WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrat Dianne Feinstein, the oldest current U.S. senator, said on Monday she was “all in” to run for re-election next year in her home state of California.

In a post on Twitter, Feinstein, 84, said there is “lots more to do: ending gun violence, combating climate change, access to healthcare. I’m all in!”

Feinstein, who was first elected to the Senate in 1992, is the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee and the first woman to hold that role. She is also a senior member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and was the first woman to lead that panel, from 2009 through 2015.

Feinstein has been a leading advocate for stricter gun safety laws for decades, and last week introduced legislation that would ban so-called bump stocks. The devices, which were used in the attack that killed 58 people at an outdoor concert in Las Vegas on Oct. 1, enable some rifles to be used like automatic weapons.

Relations between Ankara and Washington have been plagued by disputes over U.S. support for Kurdish fighters in Syria, Turkey’s calls for the extradition of a U.S.-based cleric and the indictment of a Turkish former minister in a U.S. court.

But last week’s arrest of a Turkish employee of the U.S. consulate in Istanbul marked a fresh low. Turkey said the employee had links to U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, blamed by Ankara for a failed military coup in July 2016.

The U.S. embassy in Ankara condemned those charges as baseless and announced on Sunday night it was halting all non-immigrant visa services in Turkey while it reassessed Turkey’s commitment to the security of its missions and staff.

Within hours, Ankara announced it was taking the same measures against U.S. citizens seeking visas for Turkey.

On Monday the Turkish foreign ministry summoned a U.S. diplomat to urge the United States to lift the visa suspension, saying it was causing “unnecessary tensions”.

Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gul said that if Washington had serious security concerns about its missions in Turkey, steps would be taken to address them.

“But if it’s an issue regarding the arrest of the consulate employee, then this is a decision the Turkish judiciary has made,” Gul told A Haber television. “Trying a Turkish citizen for a crime committed in Turkey is our right.”

State-run Anadolu news agency said another U.S. consulate worker had been summoned to testify over his wife and daughter’s suspected links to Gulen - which it said had emerged during the questioning of Metin Topuz, the employee arrested last week.

The diplomatic spat spooked investors. The lira dropped 3.4 percent and stood at 3.7385 against the dollar after being quoted overnight as touching a level of 3.9223.

The main BIST 100 stock index fell as much as 4.7 percent, closing the day down 2.73 percent at 101,298 points.

Airline shares were particularly hard hit, with flag carrier Turkish Airlines falling 9 percent.

The central bank said it was following developments closely.

“This looks like a really serious situation,” said Blue Bay Asset Management strategist Timothy Ash, adding that the central bank would need to move quickly to calm market nerves and possibly hike interest rates - something President Tayyip Erdogan has resisted.

Turkey’s leading business association, TUSIAD, warned that the dispute would harm bilateral economic, social and cultural ties, and called for disagreements to be settled calmly.

The dispute with the United States coincides with deep strains in Turkey’s relations with Germany, another key ally, and with Turkish military activity at the Syrian and Iraqi borders, though their market impact has so far been limited.

U.S.-Turkish tensions have risen in recent months over U.S. military support for Kurdish YPG fighters in Syria, considered by Ankara to be an extension of the banned PKK which has waged an insurgency for three decades in southeast Turkey.

Turkey has also pressed, so far in vain, for the United States to extradite Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, viewed in Ankara as the mastermind behind the failed coup in which more than 240 people were killed. Gulen denies any involvement.

Friction with the United States has also arisen from the indictment last month by a U.S. court of Turkey’s former economy minister Zafer Caglayan, charged with conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran.

Sinan Ulgen, an analyst and former Turkish diplomat, said those underlying disputes had created a crisis of confidence which made this latest fallout particularly bitter.

“This harshness is a result of a build-up,” he said. “We should not consider this as solely a reaction to the detentions of consulate employees”.","Turkey urges U.S. to review visa suspension as lira, stocks tumble",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1CD0SC-OCATP

The country that invented “Sturm und Drang” is showing a distinct lack of storm and stress as Angela Merkel heads towards a fourth term as chancellor.

That seemingly inexorable outcome on Sept. 24 has raised hopes that she will push through greater integration within the euro area, in partnership with French president Emmanuel Macron, while also championing the rules-based international order that America has forsaken under Donald Trump. But Merkel will find it hard to satisfy such expectations, since she will face new political constraints at home, while the basis for her authority, German economic strength, will come under increasing strain.

A string of polls suggests that the politics of Merkel’s fourth term will be tricky. The chancellor is a long way ahead but she is not doing as well as in the last election, in 2013. Recent findings show support for her center-right CDU party (together with the CSU in Bavaria) at around 36 percent, down from the 41.5 percent she managed four years ago. Because of Germany’s electoral system, which broadly aligns the distribution of seats in the Bundestag with the parties’ share of the vote – while excluding those that fail to reach a 5 percent voting threshold - she will once again have to form a coalition.

The most stable government would be another “grand coalition” with the center-left SPD, her current partner, which is currently polling at around 22 percent. That might appeal to the SPD leadership but many party members are opposed to playing second fiddle again, not least since this does not pay off at the polls. If Merkel cannot form a coalition with the SPD, she may have to form a coalition with not just one but two smaller parties, the FDP and the Greens. This combination would be a first in the Bundestag and it could prove fissile by bringing together the free-market FDP, Merkel’s junior partner in her second term of office between 2009 and 2013, with Germany’s environmentalist party, which has in the past allied itself with the SPD.

The coalition arithmetic could change if the election throws up surprise results for the smaller parties. But whatever alliance Merkel forms after probably protracted negotiations, it will face a disturbing new political phenomenon. Until now the Bundestag has been immune from the upsurge of populism in Europe. But the far-right AfD (Alternative for Germany) looks set to break through the 5 percent threshold that held it at bay in 2013. Currently polling around 10 percent, it has mutated from its euroskeptic origins into an anti-immigration party, capitalizing upon concerns about the influx of asylum-seekers in 2015. Though riven by internal divisions and shunned by the other parties, the AfD will be able to use its presence in the Bundestag as a platform for its populist opposition to the chancellor’s policies.

The politics of Merkel’s fourth term may be more unfavorable than before, but that should be surmountable if the economy – her trump card in the election - remains buoyant. Growth prospects for this year and next year are good, continuing a robust performance in the chancellor’s last two terms. Manufacturers excel in exporting the high-quality engineering products in which Germany specializes. The current-account surplus is extraordinarily high at around 8 percent of GDP. Helped by the humming economy and low interest rates on government debt, Germany boasts healthy public finances too, running a surplus of almost 1 percent of GDP.

Peter Apps: The coming robot arms race

John Lloyd: Labor reform in France's Macron economy

German economic and fiscal strength, so crucial in underpinning the euro zone during the crisis years of 2010-12, has come to be taken for granted. Yet under the shiny paint the engine looks less reliable for the longer journey ahead. Much of the economy does not match the prowess of German manufacturers. In particular Germany lags in business services, as a report from the OECD pointed out last year. Many professions are subject to restrictions that fetter competition. Germany is overbanked with too many small lenders and the banking sector has unhelpfully high levels of public ownership.

Moreover, the business model of German manufacturing is under threat. The diesel emissions scandal that began when Volkswagen admitted cheating U.S. emissions tests has cast a shadow over the country’s premier industry and German carmakers’ big bet on the fuel now looks misplaced. They have to scramble to catch up with electric-powered models, whose time has come thanks both to technological advances and a wave of public-health measures led by cities to ban polluting vehicles. The self-driving revolution poses another challenge to German carmakers. Manufacturers fret that they may be on the wrong side of the digital divide, with Silicon Valley in effect grabbing the high value-added content of many products.

Germans are proud of their massive current-account surplus, yet the domestic counterpart is a lack of investment to absorb national savings. The government’s drive to balance the books has come at the cost of inadequate capital spending on the national infrastructure. Business investment has been subdued. Indeed, according to the OECD’s survey, German firms are behind those of other advanced countries in investing in the “knowledge-based capital”, such as software and management skills, that is increasingly important in spurring greater efficiency. That is one reason why productivity growth has been weak.

An underlying and profound weakness is that Germany’s demographics are especially unfavorable in economic terms. At almost 46, the median age of the population in 2015 was only just lower than Japan’s, the world’s oldest, according to UN data released in June. Although there was a baby boom from the mid-1950s through most of the 1960s, the birth rate fell below the replacement level (of 2.1 children per woman) at the start of the 1970s and has since been among the lowest in the world; indeed the current fertility rate of 1.5 is unusually high. These persistently low birth rates mean that there are fewer young people to replace the bulge of baby-boomers as they retire. Despite the recent upsurge in immigration the working-age population is set to fall, which will act as a persistent drag on growth by reducing the number of workers over the next couple of decades.

For the moment, Merkel still has the aura of invincibility. Yet in practice she will find the going tougher in her fourth term as political, economic and demographic vulnerabilities take their toll. That will limit her ability to meet the exaggerated expectations of what she can achieve both within Europe and on the wider international stage.",Commentary: Don’t be fooled by Merkel’s aura of invincibility,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wallace-germany-commentary/commentary-dont-be-fooled-by-merkels-aura-of-invincibility-idUSKCN1BU2BJ

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Progress Energy, the Canadian unit of Malaysian state energy firm Petroliam Nasional Berhad, said on Thursday it was looking to sell its Deep Basin oil and gas asset in the Canadian province of Alberta.

Reuters reported on Wednesday that Petroliam Nasional, or Petronas, had enlisted BMO Capital Markets to advise on the sale of the asset, citing documents on the bank’s website.

“Progress regularly reviews its assets to ensure alignment with the company’s strategy,” it said in an emailed statement to Reuters, adding that it decided to sell its Deep Basin asset following the most recent evaluation.

The sale would allow Progress to focus on future investments in its North Montney assets in Canada’s province of British Columbia, which represents “significant growth opportunity” for the company, it said.

The potential sale marks a further retreat by Petronas in Canada after it scrapped plans for the $29 billion Pacific NorthWest liquefied natural gas export project in British Columbia in July.

While Progress’ Alberta asset produces oil and gas, the North Montney asset is rich in gas resources. Petronas acquired Progress Energy for $5.87 billion in 2012.

After the cancellation of the Pacific NorthWest project, Petronas had said it was looking at other ways to generate revenue from its North American gas assets.

“Despite what it looks like, Petronas’ reported intent to sell off its Alberta oil and gas assets does not appear to signal that the firm is looking to exit from the Canadian upstream entirely,” said Peter Lee, Asia oil and gas analyst at BMI Research.

FCA dijo en su más reciente informe de resultados financieros que, ante la “pérdida de control” que experimentan en su unidad de Venezuela, estarían considerando desconsolidarla de sus resultados globales.","Celso Núñez, un empleado de la planta de Ford en Venezuela desde hace 21 años, esperó diez meses una llamada para volver a la fábrica donde montaba camiones de carga.

La convocatoria para trabajar unos días llegó en septiembre pero mientras, y percibiendo sólo 50.000 bolívares semanales (unos 2 dólares según el cambio del mercado paralelo), hizo mudanzas con su desgastada camioneta del 2011 en la ciudad industrial de Valencia e intentó revender materiales de construcción para llegar a fin de mes.

Como él, miles de empleados de transnacionales como Fiat Chrysler (FCA) o Nestlé en Venezuela esperan meses y hasta años la reactivación de decenas de fábricas que parecen muertos vivientes: detenidas o trabajando al mínimo por falta de materia prima, en medio de la profunda escasez y recesión económica que sufre el país petrolero.

Así, unas 150 multinacionales que permanecen en el país han minimizado su presencia ante el deterioro económico de Venezuela.

Para seguir a flote, han reducido sus proyectos o se centran en presentaciones más baratas y fáciles de fabricar, operando en modo supervivencia, según dijeron a Reuters sindicatos, gremios y los portavoces de las compañías.

Y es que para muchas empresas salir del país tampoco parece una opción viable. Huir de Venezuela implicaría tener que rematar los bienes o dejarlos abandonados, como hicieron grandes firmas como Clorox o Kimberly-Clark, algo especialmente doloroso para marcas que durante décadas construyeron su presencia en el mercado.

Por eso es normal ver escenas como las de la planta de FCA en Valencia, a dos horas de Caracas, donde hay camionetas a medio montar acumulando polvo a la espera de alguna pieza que falta, como parabrisas o retrovisores, según una veintena de empleados parados en la puerta de la ensambladora.

De armar 10.286 unidades en el 2010, la planta pasó a producir cero el año pasado. En lo que va del año sacó unos 150 coches a la calle, mientras el 60 por ciento de su plantilla se queda en casa, según trabajadores y líderes sindicales.

“Lo que nos plantean los directivos es que la intención de la empresa no es irse. Es más difícil reiniciar un negocio nuevamente desde cero que mantenerse y aguantar todo este vendaval de situaciones”, reflexionó Henry Ospina, del sindicato de FCA. “Pero la inquietud está”.

A COMER A LA FÁBRICA

Aunque se sienten “pseudoempleados”, los trabajadores de las multinacionales al menos se las ven mejor que los venezolanos que, sin empleo, luchan por conseguir algo de los escasos alimentos y medicinas que importa el país.

Según los últimos datos oficiales disponibles, hasta abril del 2016 la mitad de la población activa estaba desempleada, o trabajaba de manera informal en oficios como el de taxista u otros empleos por cuenta propia.

Los empleados que se mantienen en sus puestos cobran cerca del 20 por ciento de lo que ganaban y no tienen bonos ni horas extras. Algunos van a los comedores de las plantas detenidas para tomar almuerzos pagados por las firmas, que intentan mantenerse en pie a la espera de tiempos mejores.

La cafetería de FCA, por ejemplo, abre para brindar almuerzos diarios a 60 de sus 800 trabajadores más necesitados, en un país dónde siete de cada diez personas dijeron haber perdido al menos 8 kilos de peso en un año, según el más reciente sondeo hecho por universidades privadas en 2016.

“Este año he trabajado 6 días”, confesó Pedro Rodríguez, de 44 años, otro empleado con más de dos décadas en FCA. “Pero he venido más veces para ir al comedor, porque es un plato de comida que me estoy ahorrando en la casa”.

“Hay compañeros que dejan de comer la mitad de la comida de aquí y se la llevan a su casa”, dijo, vestido con su uniforme con las siglas de la planta.

La industria venezolana está atravesando su peor momento en décadas. Miles de empresas han reducido su producción y al menos dos de cada 10 están paradas por falta de materiales o pedidos, según una encuesta de Conindustria, el principal gremio de fabricantes del país petrolero.

Y las que siguen en pie, operan a un tercio de su capacidad.

Como parte del esquema de supervivencia, las empresas también optan por reducir turnos, nóminas y los días que trabajan, buscando estirar su poca materia prima.

“Este año no he producido, pero me han pagado el sueldo”, dijo Núñez, en su humilde casa, usando su camisa azul con el logo de Ford, ya que ese día de agosto fue citado en la fábrica para conocer un plan para reactivar la producción de 50 camiones de un nuevo modelo.

Finalmente en septiembre se concretó su regreso a la planta, para producir algunas unidades, pero solo trabajó siete días.

“Nos dijeron: si el vehículo es aceptado en el mercado se viene la producción y si no...”, explicó encogiéndose de hombros. “Ford me ha dado mucha estabilidad para ayudar a mi familia. Pero uno sabe que no es culpa de ellos, sino por la situación del país”, agregó el padre de dos hijos adolescentes.

Poco menos de una decena de firmas globales, como General Mills o la autopartista Dana, vendieron en el último año sus filiales venezolanas, mayormente a empresarios locales que, si bien no quedaron exentos de las dificultades, compraron activos baratos.

Pero el Gobierno socialista de Nicolás Maduro sostiene que las firmas globales limitan de manera intencional su producción en medio de una “guerra económica” que libran sus adversarios.

Reuters solicitó comentarios al ministerio de Comunicación pero no obtuvo respuesta.

INDEMNIZANDO CON NEUMÁTICOS

Ford contó a Reuters que su planta de Valencia apenas había producido unos 400 coches hasta agosto -cuando en el 2012 ensamblaron 17.000- con una fuerza de trabajo limitada y cientos de obreros en casa. Aún así, Ford “no tiene planes de dejar el país”, aclaró la empresa en un correo electrónico.

Buscando oxígeno, la automotriz estadounidense empezó en el 2015 a vender coches en dólares, una práctica permitida en el sector, que les servirían para comprar sin pasar por el control de cambios.

Otras firmas, como Fiat Chrysler (FCA) y Toyota, le siguieron, pero todas con resultados limitados: los venezolanos con acceso a miles de dólares al contado son pocos.

En los concesionarios, lujosas todoterreno se quedan esperando compradores. La destrucción de la economía de escala y los cuellos de botella en la importación de piezas elevan los precios hasta 20.000 dólares más que en otros países, haciendo de ese mercado uno aún más exclusivo.

La sobreoferta en las tiendas de autos, contrasta con los anaqueles vacíos de los supermercados.

Las firmas de alimentos también tienen que parar varias veces al año sus líneas de producción en espera de materia prima. La gigante de alimentos Nestlé a finales de septiembre detuvo su producción de colados de fruta para bebés porque no tenía envases de vidrios, dijo la empresa.

La compañía agregó en un comunicado que a pesar de la suspensión seguirá pagando a sus trabajadores, aunque un representante del sindicato dijo a Reuters que el salario diario no era ni siquiera el equivalente a una botella de refresco.

El Gobierno de Maduro recortó el año pasado a la mitad las importaciones, reaccionando al fin de una mermante bonanza petrolera que según sus críticos, no supo administrar.

El mandatario alega que es víctima de un sabotaje de opositores y empresarios, en medio de una inflación anual que desde hace dos años se mantiene en tres dígitos y una parálisis económica, que devoran los salarios rápidamente.

El consumo, boyante hasta hace un lustro entre los venezolanos que gozaron de compras de vehículos, viajes y bienes de lujo financiados con divisas baratas, cayó un 15 por ciento en el 2016 y se espera que se contraiga otro 25 por ciento este año, según cifras de la firma local Ecoanalítica.

Imposibilitadas para reducir de forma sustancial su nómina, por la ley local que prohíbe los despidos, las empresas han empezado a ofrecer arreglos cada vez más descabellados a cambio de recibir renuncias voluntarias.

En FCA, por ejemplo, la oferta de liquidación viene acompañada de cuatro neumáticos. Consultada sobre su precaria situación, FCA dijo en un correo electrónico que hace “sus mejores esfuerzos para mantener la producción en niveles adecuados a la disponibilidad de insumos”, sin aportar detalles.

Pero hasta agosto, 23 trabajadores, muchos de ellos con el plan de emigrar, habían aceptado las ruedas para revenderlas en un país con una fuerte escasez de estos productos.

“NO ESTAMOS GANANDO, NI PERDIENDO”

La planta de jabones de Colgate-Palmolive, está detenida desde febrero porque, según los trabajadores, la firma no cubre sus costes al producir barras de jabón a menos de 0,05 centavos de dólar, como le exige el Estado.

Desde hace años, el Gobierno fija los precios de productos como la leche y el jabón, que pierden vigencia rápido por la galopante inflación. También fija el tipo de cambio al que vende el dólar en un control de cambio cada vez menos funcional.

Hace poco, Colgate reinició su producción de pasta dental a precio regulado, empaquetada en cajas de cartón reciclado marrón para ahorrar costos. También descartó versiones infantiles o con blanqueador, reduciendo su portafolio de 300 productos a menos de una docena, dijo su representante sindical, Félix Bello.

La compañía estadounidense no respondió cuando Reuters le solicitó información.

Mientras tanto, empaques rojos similares a los de Colgate importados de China, con nombres como “Coigore” o “Connert”, se ofrecen en tiendas a precios 10 veces por encima del regulado.

Otra gigante del cuidado personal, Johnson & Johnson, solo produce protectores diarios femeninos en el país. Años atrás, fabricaba o importaba desde enjuague bucal y jabón hasta champú para bebés y cremas hidratantes.

Aún así, la multinacional acordó mantener el salario y los tres turnos de sus 157 empleados, aunque sólo operen tres de las siete líneas de producción de la factoría, dijo Jaime Guevara, un representante de su sindicato.

“Johnson & Johnson tiene una responsabilidad con nuestros empleados y la comunidad”, agregó una portavoz de la empresa.

Pero aunque haya firmas que siguen apostando a “esperar y ver”, no hay señales claras de que el gobierno de Maduro pueda mejorar las condiciones porque depende de una empresa petrolera en deterioro. En este contexto ha tenido que vender menos divisas, vitales para el flujo productivo de las empresas.

“Pensamos que en algún momento el país debería volver a la normalidad y ya entonces nosotros tendremos una planta armada”, dijo el gerente general de una firma estadounidense de productos químicos, que incluía limpiadores e insecticidas, y que pidió no ser identificado.

La empresa redujo drásticamente su gama de productos y sólo fabrica con materias primas locales, mientras sus trabajadores hacen labores de mantenimientos en la fábrica, como pintar las paredes o cortar la grama.

“No estamos ganando pero tampoco estamos perdiendo. Ni estamos pensando más en eso”, concluyó.

LA SOMBRA DE GENERAL MOTORS

Pero los gerentes, dirigentes de gremios y sindicatos consultados coinciden en que estas estrategias para comprar tiempo podrían no ser sostenibles por más de dos años.

Y muchos usan la reciente salida de General Motors del país como su fábula con moraleja.

Si bien GM dejó de ensamblar vehículos en el 2015, apenas este año se retiró del todo. La fábrica está abandonada en la zona industrial de Valencia que tiene un 80 por ciento de sus plantas paradas, según el mayor gremio empresarial.

En una visita reciente de Reuters, un grupo de exobreros hacía una sopa en la entrada usando leña. Otros entrenaban a sus hijos en un campo de béisbol. La grama crecía indómita hasta las pantorrillas y el gimnasio albergaba nidos de palomas.

Hace pocas semanas la fabricante estadounidense de pinturas Axalta Coating Systems también cesó su producción en Venezuela por la “situación económica y política” del país, y despidió a sus sorprendidos empleados.

Otras firmas podrían tomar decisiones fundamentales pronto. FCA dijo en su más reciente informe de resultados financieros que, ante la “pérdida de control” que experimentan en su unidad de Venezuela, estarían considerando desconsolidarla de sus resultados globales.

Y para muchas marcas internacionales la desconsolidación ha sido el primer paso antes de partir, o en su defecto, vender.

“Ninguno está exento de lo que está sucediendo”, dijo Carlos Rodríguez, miembro del sindicato de Colgate-Palmolive. “Cuando veas las barbas de tu vecino arder, pon las tuyas en remojo”.",En modo zombi: las multinacionales que trabajan a medias en Venezuela,https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idESKBN1CD0O4-OESEN

BOSTON (Reuters) - Mitch Golden scrutinizes hedge fund managers and their investment ideas in a variety of settings from the back of a motor scooter in Ho Chi Minh City to a park bench in New York’s Central Park. The lieutenant of billionaire investor David Einhorn says it gives him the sort of perspective he can’t get from sitting in an office.

“This is a really hard job to do by just looking at the stuff that comes across your desk. You have to go out and find it,” the 45-year old portfolio manager told Reuters.

His approach is paying off. Golden, who runs an $800 million portfolio for Einhorn's $8.3 billion hedge fund firm Greenlight Capital, is producing some of the best numbers in the fund of funds industry and also, in the past two years, beating his boss.

Infographic ID: '2s8LJrm'

Greenlight Masters beat or matched the benchmark in 12 out of the last 15 years of its existence and its average annualized return of 7.7 percent through the end of 2016 handily exceeded Hedge Fund Research’s HFRI Fund of Funds Composite Index’s 3.3 percent return over the same period.

It is rare for a company to run a so-called fund of funds alongside a hedge fund. By doing so, the Greenlight Masters portfolio offers clients valuable access to star investors such as Einhorn plus those still unknown on Wall Street, says Steve Algert, managing director and assistant treasurer at The J. Paul Getty Trust, one of Golden’s clients.

Golden is known for the time he takes – sometimes years - and the lengths he will go to in researching potential managers. If he believes in their ideas he will wait for them to pay off - a rarity in an industry where skittish investors often pull out at the first sign of trouble.

He can afford to do that because a significant amount of the capital in the portfolio comes from Einhorn and his partners at Greenlight Capital.

“Mitch hustles hard to know who’s out there and to develop relationships with people even if Greenlight Masters isn’t ready to invest immediately,” said Firefly Value Partners partner Ariel Warszawski, whose fund has been in the Greenlight Masters’ portfolio for a decade.

To beat the market, a manager has to be contrarian, Golden says, but he is wary of big egos and is looking for a dose of humility in candidates.

“We look for people who have confidence in their work and can pick a fight with the markets,” Golden said. “It is a very subtle balance.”

Brian Shapiro, whose firm Simplify LLC performs due diligence on hedge funds for wealthy clients, values Golden for his cool-headed analysis. “For him, if it is not in the numbers, it is not real.”

The native New Yorker likes to go beyond the usual interactions between managers and would-be investors in conference rooms which he describes as a “Kabuki dance” in reference to a Japanese dance-drama that involves stylized expressions and melodramatic plots.

Sometimes that means accompanying fund managers on company visits to gauge how they interact with management.

Earlier this year, he zipped around Vietnam’s biggest city on the back of a scooter to visit a company that one of his managers was considering investing in. He declined to name the company.

PLAYGROUND CHATS

On Saturday mornings, Golden says he will sometimes sit in a playground in Central Park talking stocks with one of his portfolio managers as their children careen down the slides.

Unlike many other funds of funds, Greenlight Masters does not automatically sell if a portfolio fund falls by a certain amount or steadily declines over a longer period.

In 2015, for example, Golden stuck with energy-focused funds despite plunging oil prices and Greenlight Masters lost 8.4 percent that year. Those funds roared back in 2016, helping it gain 13.4 percent and beat the 9.4 percent returned by Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital and a flat performance by the average fund of funds.

He has 18 funds in the portfolio now, having exited three and added two last year. Thomas Hill’s $110 million PlusTick Partners and Nathaniel August’s $750 million Mangrove Partners, which invest in distressed energy assets, were Golden’s top performers in 2016 with gains of more than 50 percent each.

Golden acknowledges that the downside to the prolonged scrutiny is that sometimes promising fund managers will not wait and seek capital elsewhere or Greenlight Masters misses out on candidates’ early dramatic gains.

“That can be very costly,” he said, declining to name the opportunities he had missed.

Greenlight Masters is Einhorn’s brainchild, created in 2002, to uncover the next generations of stars and to give his partners a chance to diversify their holdings.

Golden joined it in 2012 as a co-portfolio manager after earlier stints as an analyst at two hedge funds and the manager of his own firm, and has run Greenlight Masters on his own since 2013.

After many months spent analyzing investments on his own, Golden brings promising candidates to a “D-meet” with Einhorn at Greenlight’s midtown Manhattan offices.

“It is nice that I get to have someone like David Einhorn and other members of the investment team pick apart their ideas,” he said.",Scooters instead of boardroom 'kabuki': how one fund manager picks winners,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hedgefunds-greenlightmasters/scooters-instead-of-boardroom-kabuki-how-one-fund-manager-picks-winners-idUSKBN1930DA

(Reuters) - Wall Street was little changed in late morning trading on Monday, as losses in healthcare stocks were offset by gains in technology shares, with the third-quarter earnings season looming.

U.S. stocks have been on a tear this year, hitting new records almost everyday in the past week, and the upcoming earnings reports will help justify the lofty valuations.

“The relatively high valuation, where the market is trading 17 to 18 times earnings, is merited by a very low interest rate environment,” said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.

“We are not danger yet if you keep your eye on rates.”

Overall, earnings at S&P 500 companies are expected to have increased 4.9 percent last quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data, down from the double-digit growth recorded in the first two quarters of this year.

Ten S&P 500 companies are expected to report earnings this week, including some of the biggest Wall Street banks. JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) and Citigroup (C.N) will report on Thursday.

At 11:00 a.m. ET (1500 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was up 5.13 points, or 0.02 percent, at 22,778.8, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was up 0.08 points, flat on a percentage basis, at 6,590.26. Both indexes hit record intraday highs.

The S&P 500 .SPX was down 1.76 points, or 0.07 percent, at 2,547.57, which is just 5 points shy of its record high. The benchmark's eight-day winning streak came to a halt on Friday due to weak jobs numbers.

Eight of the 11 major S&P indexes were higher, led by a 0.31 percent gain in the technology sector .SPLRCT. The healthcare index .SPXHC was down 0.56 percent.

GE shares (GE.N) sank 3 percent and was the top drag on the S&P after the conglomerate named a new CFO said it gave activist investment firm Trian Fund Management a board seat.

Medtronic (MDT.N) dropped about 4 percent after the medical device maker said Hurricane Maria hurt second-quarter earnings and sales.

DaVita (DVA.N) tumbled 7 percent, the most on the S&P, after JPMorgan cut its rating on the dialysis service provider, while Express Scripts (ESRX.O) fell 4.5 percent on a Raymond James downgrade.

Tesla (TSLA.O) fell 2.51 percent after pushing back the unveiling of the big rig truck to mid-November.

Viacom (VIAB.O) slipped more than 4 percent after Citigroup downgraded the stock to “sell”, citing risks that pay TV firms would stop carrying its channels.

LONDON (Reuters) - World shares rose on Monday, with Chinese stocks hitting 21-month highs and the German index setting a new record, while political uncertainty triggered big moves in sterling, the Turkish lira and Spanish debt.

Wall Street looked set to open higher, with e-mini futures on the S&P 500 index ESc1 up 0.2 percent and signaling a rebound from Friday’s fall after six days of gains.

European shares rose. The pan-European STOXX 600 index added 0.3 percent and Germany's DAX .GDAXI touched an all-time high after data showing industrial output far overshot forecasts.

Spanish shares outperformed, rising 0.6 percent, and Spain’s government bond yields fell after a big show of support for the country remaining together and against Catalan independence appeared to calm markets.

Hundreds of thousands demonstrated on Sunday in the Catalan capital Barcelona, carrying banners saying “Catalonia is Spain” and “Together we are stronger”. Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont was due to address the regional parliament on Tuesday on “the current political situation”.

“There is hope in the markets that independence will not be declared and the worst case will be avoided,” Gautam Batra, head of investments at Mediolanum Asset Management, told Reuters.

Spain’s 10-year bond yield ES10YT=TWEB fell 6.4 basis points at 1.65 percent.

On their first day of trade after a week-long holiday, Chinese blue-chip stocks .CSI300 touched their highest levels since late 2015, partly in a delayed reaction to a targeted cut in the amount of cash some banks must hold in reserve announced a week ago. The index closed up 1.2 percent.

Last week’s targeted rate cut outweighed data on Monday, showing activity in China’s service sector grew in September at its slowest since December 2015.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS fell 0.1 percent, having rebounded by 1.7 percent last week. An index of world stocks tracking shares in 46 countries, however, was up less than 0.1 percent but just shy of a record high .MIWD00000PUS.

HOLIDAYS

U.S. stocks are due to trade on Monday, although the bond market is closed for a holiday. Tokyo markets are also shut.

The dollar fell 0.1 percent against a basket of currencies .DXY. The greenback was all but flat against the Japanese yen on concerns that North Korea was preparing a new missile test.

The yen was last at 112.69 per dollar JPY=, having fallen as low as 113.44 per dollar last week. The euro edged up 0.1 percent to $1.1742 EUR=.

The Turkish lira fell as much as 2.5 percent against the dollar TRYTOM=D3 and Istanbul stocks .XU100 fell 4 percent after the United States and Turkey cut back visa services in a sharp deterioration in relations.

The lira last traded at 3.7060 per dollar, down 2.5 percent on the day, and stocks were down 3.1 percent.

A U.S. consulate employee was arrested last week on charges of links to U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, blamed by Ankara for last year’s failed military coup. Washington condemned the arrest as baseless.

“Turkey’s economy, especially the private sector, significantly relies on USD funding, the disruption of which can cause economic and financial disarray to Turkey” analysts at TD securities said in a note.

Sterling rose 0.9 percent to $1.3173 on reports that British Prime Minister Theresa May, facing threats to oust her, might sack her foreign minister, Boris Johnson.

“If Boris Johnson were to leave or be demoted as the weekend press is suggesting, that would be showing May’s leadership and that her vision of Brexit is the one that (the government) will be going forward with and that markets should be aligned to,” said Viraj Patel, an FX strategist at ING Bank in London.

Speculative investors’ bets on a stronger pound reached their highest in three years in the week to Oct. 3, data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed.

Gold XAU= hit a one-week high as tension over North Korea saw some investors seek safety in the metal. It rose 0.6 percent to nearly $1,283 an ounce.

(Reuters) - Uber said on Monday it would suspend its unlicensed service UberPOP in Oslo until Norway introduces new rules, as the U.S. ride-hailing app adopts a more conciliatory tone with national authorities.

The move follows a similar one-year suspension in Finland in July to allow a new taxi law to come into effect, however there is no set date for when UberPOP will be reintroduced in Norway.

The U.S. ride-hailing company has come under fierce pressure from traditional taxi drivers and regulators across Europe who accuse it of unfair competition and skirting traditional licensing rules.

UberPOP has already been suspended in several European capitals, including Paris and Brussels, and Uber was recently humbled when it lost its license to operate in London.

“We’ve learned the hard way that we must change as a company in order to serve the millions of riders and drivers who rely on us. With our new CEO Dara Khosrowshahi onboard, it’s a new era for Uber,” the company said in a statement.

“That’s why it’s now time to pause UberPOP in Norway, in order to relaunch under new regulations.”

UberPOP will be suspended on Oct. 30, while Uber’s licensed services UberBLACK and UberXXL will continue to operate as normal.

The Norwegian transport minister said Uber was being treated as any other market participant would be. “All actors offering taxi services must conform to rules and regulation at any time,” Ketil Solvik-Olsen told Reuters.

The suspension of UberPOP in Norway comes as the non-EU country must answer by Oct. 27 a query on its transport regulations by the EFTA Surveillance Authority (ESA), the body that ensures EU regulations are enforced in countries that have access to the European common market.

Uber will suspend UberPOP three days after that deadline.

In February, ESA said Norway was setting “disproportionately high barriers to enter the taxi market” that led to inefficient use of resources and higher prices for consumers.

Khosrowshahi took the helm of Uber in August, replacing co-founder and former boss Travis Kalanick and has promised change at the $70 billion dollar firm.

The company said it was encouraged by developments in Norway such as the government’s sharing economy committee which recommended repealing certain provisions related to taxis and an opinion from the EFTA surveillance authority which said Norway’s restrictions on taxi licenses were illegal.

“Norway deserves modernized laws that encourage innovation and competition without sacrificing what makes the Norwegian model special,” Uber said. “We hope the government will implement these recommendations soon, so that we can relaunch a new and improved version of the product loved by so many.”

(Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc said on Monday it would speed up the process for in-store returns of items bought on its website, just ahead of the busy holiday season, as it looks to steal a march on e-commerce giant Amazon.com.

Wal-Mart has been increasingly using its more than 4,700 stores to provide hassle-free shopping on its website - by offering services that allow customers to pick up products ordered online as well as make returns in store.

The new service aims to drastically reduce the time taken to return an item bought online, as the company battles Amazon’s aggressive moves to establish its own brick-and-mortar presence.

Under Wal-Mart’s Mobile Express Returns, starting in early November, customers can, for the first time, use the retailer’s app to initiate a return.

The process can then be completed at “express” lanes in a store by scanning a QR code and handing over the item, eliminating the need to wait in queues.

The new process reduces the time taken for returning products at stores to as little as 30 seconds from five minutes previously, said Daniel Eckert, head of Wal-Mart’s U.S. services and digital acceleration business.

The new returns process also allows customers to get refunds as soon as the next day. Some items, including shampoo and color cosmetics, will be eligible for instant refunds even without the products being returned in store, then company said.

Wal-Mart said it planned to extend the new process to items bought in its stores by early next year, and is working on a similar returns policy for items bought from third-party sellers on Walmart.com.

Wal-Mart is investing $2 billion into its online business and has snapped up a number of popular online retailers since last year, including Jet.com.

Olympic bronze medalist Rupp used his track speed to break open the men’s race in the last five km to finish in a lifetime best two hours, nine minutes and 20 seconds in only his fourth marathon.

“It’s just incredible,” said Rupp, who took advantage of the race’s slow early pace to win, surging in the 38th km to take control.

“I made the mistake in the past of going a little too hard too soon,” said Rupp, the U.S. record holder at 10,000 meters on the track.

“But I just felt a little gap pulling away and at that point, it was like you’ve got to put the hammer down and drive to the finish.”

Defending champion Abel Kirui of Kenya, who was with Rupp at the time, could not keep pace.

“It is a huge win for his career, for the United States,” four-times Chicago winner Khalid Khannouchi, the last American to triumph in 2002, told NBC Chicago. “He has a bright future.”

Kirui finished second in 2:09:48 with countryman Bernard Kipyego third in 2:10:23.

Dibaba, a world record holder on the track, won her first marathon in 2:18.31.

“The entire 42 km pretty much I was leading,” said Dibaba, the London Marathon runner-up and three-time Olympic champion on the track.

MYEBON, Myanmar (Reuters) - Buddhist villagers in relatively peaceful parts of Myanmar’s Rakhine state are enforcing a system of local apartheid that punishes people trading with minority Muslims, fuelling fears that violence in the far northwest could spread to new areas.

Ethnic Rakhines, who form the majority in central parts of the state, have set up committees in several districts that have meted out sanctions ranging from fines to public beatings and expulsions. They say the measures are necessary to protect their communities from Rohingya Muslim militants.

Muslim residents say they are being cut off from essential supplies and accuse authorities of turning a blind eye. Aid workers fear thousands will attempt to escape via perilous sea routes to Thailand and Malaysia when the monsoon rains abate.

About 250,000 Muslims live in central Rakhine, an area not directly affected by a military offensive against Rohingya militants who attacked security forces in the northern part of the state in late August. The army operation has forced more than half a million people to flee to Bangladesh, in what the United Nations has denounced as ethnic cleansing.

“In the current situation, it’s not possible for different communities to live together,” said Ashin Saromani, a Buddhist monk in the central Rakhine town of Myebon, where one such committee was set up at a meeting in a monastery four days after the Aug. 25 militant attacks in the north.

“The government can’t reconcile them. That’s why we prohibited communication with the Muslims, to prevent conflict.”

Rakhine state government spokesman Min Aung said he was not aware of efforts to punish Buddhists who had contact with Muslims. He said he thought tensions could best be eased by interfaith community groups.

“Other states and regions have interfaith groups working for peace. In Rakhine there’s no group like that,” he said.

Tension between ethnic Rakhines and Muslims have simmered for years. Nearly 200 people were killed and 140,000 displaced in communal violence in the state in 2012.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has warned that the violence seen in the north of the state could easily spread.

“The failure to address this systematic violence could result in a spillover into central Rakhine, where an additional 250,000 Muslims could potentially face displacement,” said Guterres in a recent speech. “They are outnumbered by Rakhine communities, some of whom have engaged in violent acts of vigilantism against their Muslim neighbours.”

“NATIONAL TRAITOR”

In Myebon, about 3,000 Muslims have been confined to a camp for displaced people since the 2012 violence, surrounded by tens of thousands of hostile Rakhine Buddhists. They have relied on aid from international agencies and fishing, supplemented by a small amount of trade in the town.

Since late August, loudspeakers mounted on tricycle rickshaws have rolled around the town, blaring messages from local monks and Rakhine community leaders exhorting Buddhists to avoid contact with Muslims.

One Rakhine woman who ignored the warnings, 35-year-old Soe Chay, told Reuters she was surrounded by a mob on Sept. 12 after buying goods at a market to sell to Muslims.

They beat her, cut her hair and marched through the town with a sign reading “national traitor” hung around her neck.

Kyaw Swar Tun, deputy director of the Rakhine General Administration Department (GAD) that overseas the local bureaucracy, said the case was an “individual problem” that was already being dealt with by the courts.

Two women and a man have been charged with assault on Soe Chay. The two women were members of the Arakan Women’s Network in Myebon, which denied taking part in the attack.

“People got angry because they don’t have a nationalist spirit, even though they know that 30 police stations were attacked and locals from Maungdaw were beheaded,” said Khin Thein, leader of the network in the town, describing the incident. He was referring to the Aug. 25 attacks, which concentrated in northern Rakhine’s Maungdaw township.

Buddhist community leaders in Myebon have also blocked international aid agencies from reaching the camp, saying only the government can deliver aid, which must be checked by Buddhists.

“We are concerned that if we don’t check that boat of the NGOs communicating directly with the Bengalis, they might include weapons together with the aid,” said Ashin Saromani. Bengali is a derogatory term for the Rohingya implying they are interlopers from Bangladesh.

Similar community-enforced restrictions on aid have been in place elsewhere in Rakhine, according to aid workers.

“FEAR OF REVENGE”

Anti-Muslim sentiment has been bubbling up elsewhere in mostly Buddhist Myanmar since the conflict erupted in Rakhine.

Police had to disperse a mob that attacked Muslim homes and businesses in the central Magwe division on Sept. 10.

In Kayin state in the east, Muslims were told last month they must get special permission from authorities before travelling outside of their villages, because of security concerns.

Closer to the conflict zone, Muslim villagers in Rathedaung township say they have been directly pressured to leave by their Rakhine neighbours.

In Ku Taung village, near the besieged Muslim villages, a group of 46 Rakhine Buddhist elders has formed a “disciplinary committee”.

They have fined Buddhists as much as 500,000 kyat ($370) for infractions including selling betel leaves to Muslims, according to farmer Tun Thar Sein.

Some Rakhine villages have set up security teams to protect against the spread of militancy. In Mrauk-U and Minbya, an area that saw several unexplained explosions last month, residents said Muslims were no longer allowed into Rakhine villages.

Kyaw Swar Tun, the local administrator, said authorities would deal with any cases brought to them according to the law, but was not aware of any such problems in central Rakhine.

Back in the Myebon camp for displaced people, Muslims say they will have to move away.

”It’s not possible for us to go back and stay together in Myebon because the Rakhine who destroyed our homes will be afraid to face us. said Cho Cho, a Muslim resident. “They fear that Muslims will take revenge.”",Segregation fans fears of fresh 'cleansing' in Myanmar's Rakhine,https://in.reuters.com/article/myanmar-rohingya-segregation/segregation-fans-fears-of-fresh-cleansing-in-myanmars-rakhine-idINKBN1CE131

LONDON (Reuters) - British transport minister Chris Grayling said on Monday costs of the repatriation of 110,000 customers of collapsed airline Monarch were being discussed with credit and debit card companies.

“We’ve entered into discussions with several third parties with the aim of recovering costs of the operation,” Grayling said in a statement to parliament.

“We’re also currently engaged in constructive discussions with the relevant credit and debit card providers so we recoup from them some of the costs to taxpayers of these repatriation flights. We’re also having similar discussions with other travel providers.”

PARIS (Reuters) - Plane giants are preparing to squeeze the last drop out of a once raging torrent of airplane orders without the razzmatazz of recent years, as the aerospace industry heads to a belt-tightening Paris Airshow looking for new sources of revenue.

The June 19-25 gathering takes place against the backdrop of surprisingly strong airline traffic driven by economic growth, but a steep drop in the appetite for new planes following robust demand for the latest fuel-efficient models in recent years.

Instead, many firms will talk up efforts to extract new revenues out of powerful data-crunching services, while the first Paris display of a U.S. stealth jet in decades, the F-35, points to a defense recovery at the world’s largest air show.

The meeting also comes amid tensions in the Gulf over a transport and economic boycott of Qatar that is fuelling questions over the resilience of a major source of demand.

Dominating an otherwise thin slate of commercial orders will be a new version of Boeing’s (BA.N) most-sold airliner, the 737.

The 190-to-230-seat Boeing 737 MAX 10, designed to narrow a gap against European rival Airbus, will be launched on Monday with over 100 orders, two people familiar with the plans said.

Analysts said one unknown quantity is how many of the MAX 10 orders may merely be replacing previous orders for other variants as Boeing rejigs its medium-haul portfolio.

Low-cost giants Lion Air of Indonesia and Ireland’s Ryanair (RYA.I) have confirmed Reuters reports of interest in the new jet, though talks with Ryanair could take longer to complete.

CDB Aviation, the aircraft leasing arm of China Development Bank, is in talks to place orders with both Boeing and Airbus and could complete at least one of the deals by the show.

It may buy 40-50 Boeings, including about 5 MAX 10s, and a similar number of Airbus jets, two sources said.

Boeing is seen anxious to win backing of major operators for the new catch-up model and has also talked to United Airlines.

""I think you'll see some activity on this in Paris and that will start the process of seeing how airlines react to it,"" said Peter Barrett, chief executive of SMBC Aviation Capital.

‘DIFFERENT DYNAMIC’

Seeking to leapfrog Airbus (AIR.PA) after a mixed few years for the MAX series, Boeing will also give more details on a larger new mid-market jet employing a novel fuselage designed to try to capture projected growth in demand for 220-270 seaters.

But few expect a repeat of the more than 400 orders and commitments at last year’s Farnborough Airshow in Britain.

“I think it is going to be a relatively quiet air show compared to previous years,” said Robert Martin, chief executive of BOC Aviation.

Instead, some of the airlines that have become synonymous with air show hoopla in previous years, such as Malaysia’s AirAsia (AIRA.KL), may return to sign up for digital services to make their new fleets more efficient to operate and maintain.

Manufacturers are exploiting breakthroughs in data storage and other technologies to cut development times by a third while offering services like “predictive maintenance” to airlines, mimicking the post-sales success of their engine suppliers.

“We have 10,000 aircraft flying and we have to apply these technologies to these aircraft,” Airbus chief operating officer and planemaking president Fabrice Bregier said.

It will also be the first air show since China and Russia successfully flew new passenger jets in recent weeks, completing a series of debuts by new entrants that also include Japan.

Mitsubishi’s MRJ90 will appear in Paris for the first time.

While there is no immediate threat to Airbus and Boeing, delegates say the feeling is taking hold in boardrooms and governments that their duopoly cannot be taken for granted.

“There is a long road from first flight to certification and all that goes with it, but I think it will be a slightly different dynamic than we might have had in previous air shows where they were paper or theoretical airplanes and now we have real aircraft,” Barrett said of the would-be challengers.

In another turning point, it may be the last major air show for Airbus super-salesman John Leahy, who has said he will retire soon. He has presided over sales of over 10,000 planes.

With the New Yorker’s departure, the swagger and deliberate baiting of rivals at such shows may become a thing of the past, but the industry is unlikely to retreat from fierce competition.

The more muted tone, and cost-cutting to focus on production after years of strong sales, are reflected in the logistics. Several firms have cut back space and host planemaker Airbus is halving staff attendance and slashing catering, insiders said.",Jetmakers hunt for new growth as order binge fizzles out,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-airshow-paris/jetmakers-hunt-for-new-growth-as-order-binge-fizzles-out-idUSKBN1961WV

Investigators remain largely in the dark about what drove Paddock, a retired real estate investor and high-stakes gambler, on Oct. 1 to carry out the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The powerful U.S. gun lobby, the National Rifle Association, said on Sunday it would oppose an outright ban on bump-stock devices that the killer in the Las Vegas massacre of 58 people used to turn rifles into automatic weapons and strafe a crowd with bursts of sustained gunfire.

The NRA, which has seldom embraced new firearms-control measures, stunned gun control advocates last week when it issued a statement voicing willingness to support a restriction on bump stocks.

On Sunday, the organization said it was open to regulation but opposed any legislation banning the devices.

“We don’t believe that bans have ever worked on anything. What we have said has been very clear - that if something transfers a semiautomatic to function like a fully automatic, then it ought to be regulated differently,” Chris Cox, the NRA’s chief lobbyist, said on “Fox News Sunday.”

Police said the gunman, Stephen Paddock, 64, fitted 12 of his weapons with bump-stock devices that allow semi-automatic rifles to operate as if they were fully automatic machine guns, which are otherwise outlawed in the United States.

Cox and Wayne LaPierre, the NRA’s chief executive, accused the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives under Democratic former President Barack Obama of paving the way for the use of bump stocks and creating legal confusion about their usage.

Republican President Donald Trump, whose party controls both chambers of the U.S. Congress, was an outspoken advocate of gun rights during his 2016 campaign for the White House. The NRA spent more than $30 million in support of his candidacy.

Several Republican lawmakers suggested last week that they were receptive to legislation to curb the use of bump stocks, including Kevin McCarthy, the No. 2 Republican in the House of Representatives, who said such controls were an area where Congress may be able to act.

But House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, a Republican who himself was nearly killed by a gunman earlier this year while at a baseball practice, was cautious on Sunday about potential new legislation.

“I do think it’s a little bit early for people to say they know what to do to fix this problem,” he said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”

FILE PICTURE: Attendees walk past the words ""If they can ban one they can ban them all"" referencing a recent effort to ban ""green tip"" ammunition during the National Rifle Association's annual meeting in Nashville, Tennessee April 11, 2015. REUTERS/Harrison McClary

“A week ago most people didn’t know what a bump stock was so to think that we’re now all experts and know how to write some panacea law, it’s fallacy,” Scalise added.

NO REPUBLICAN SUPPORT

LaPierre lashed out at U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat who has pushed for gun-control legislation on Capitol Hill.

“I think you want to tell ATF to do its job. It’s an interpretive issue and they need to get the job done. But not let Dianne Feinstein, which is what she wants to do - turn this all of this into some Christmas tree on the Hill where she brings all of her anti-gun circus she has been trying to do for years into this,” LaPierre said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”

Feinstein said she has garnered some Republican interest, but no support, for the measure. “I have nobody lined up,” she told the CBS program.

Some gun-control advocates praised the NRA for showing some flexibility.

“This is the first time that the gun lobby has shown willingness to come to the table and I think that’s in part because Americans just simply do not accept mass shooting after mass shooting happening and Congress doing absolutely nothing,” Democratic Senator Chris Murphy said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

But Sunday’s comments from the NRA representatives suggested nothing may have changed as they castigated calls for gun-control measures in the emotional aftermath of a mass shooting.

“There used to be a common decency in this country where people paused talking about policy. Unfortunately with Dianne Feinstein and Michael Bloomberg, they want to exploit a tragedy from Day One. It’s shameful, but apparently that’s the new normal.” Cox said on the “Fox News Sunday” program.

Bloomberg, a billionaire and former mayor of New York, has been an outspoken critic of the National Rifle Association through the group Everytown for Gun Safety.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Oil prices stabilised on Monday after one of the most bearish weeks in months, propped up by OPEC comments signalling the possibility of further action to restore market balance in the long term.

Oil production platforms in the Gulf of Mexico started returning to service after Hurricane Nate had forced the shutdown of more than 90 percent of crude output in the area. The prospective restarts kept price gains in check.

“Oil is having trouble to find direction. Mixed signals keep investors busy changing their minds,” said Hans van Cleef, senior energy economist at ABN Amro.

“There is a good chance that we will continue to trade a bit sideways in the coming weeks up to the OPEC meeting.”

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is due to meet in Vienna on Nov. 30, when it will discuss its pact to reduce output in order to prop up the market.

OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said on Sunday that consultations were under way for an extension of the agreement beyond March 2018 and that more oil-producing nations may join the pact, possibly at the November meeting.

He also said OPEC members and other producers may have to take some “extraordinary measures” to ensure the market is in balance in the long term.

In a speech provided for the Reuters Global Commodities Summit this week, Barkindo said he saw clear evidence the oil market was rebalancing.

Global benchmark Brent crude LCOc1 was flat at $55.62 a barrel at 1353 GMT. Earlier in the session it touched a three-week low of $55.06. It ended last week 3.3 percent lower, its biggest weekly loss since June 2017.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures CLc1 were trading at $49.53, up 24 cents. They came close to a four-week low when they fell to $49.13 earlier in the session. WTI’s losses last week came to 4.6 percent.

In further signs that OPEC members are sticking to agreed cuts, Saudi Arabia said it had curtailed crude allocations for November by 560,000 barrels per day and Iraq’s oil minister said the country was fully committed to its OPEC production target.

Money managers raised their bullish bets on U.S. crude futures for the third week in a row, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission reported on Friday.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar steadied close to its highest level in ten weeks on Monday, with strong U.S. wages data at the end of last week giving investors confidence that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates in December.

Sterling was the biggest mover among developed-market currencies, recovering as much as 0.9 percent on signs that a plot to topple Prime Minister Theresa May would not be successful, easing political uncertainty a touch.

The greenback reached 14-year highs at the start of 2017, but it had spent most of the rest of the year weakening, as weak economic data as well as doubts over U.S. President Donald Trump’s ability to push through tax reforms weighed on the currency.

Since then, though, the dollar has recovered almost 3 percent against a basket of major currencies, on signs that Trump’s tax reform plans could be back on track, and on a firming-up of bets that the Fed will in December hike rates for the third time this year.

The closely watched non-farm payrolls report on Friday showed the first fall in U.S. employment in seven years, but investors reckoned that was down to the temporary effects of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, and focused on the largest gain in U.S. wages since December.

Some strategists, though, said the numbers were not enough to materially shift expectations for the Fed’s tightening path.

“Friday’s wage data were promising but the report was so distorted, I‘m not sure investors can take too much from them,” said Commerzbank currency strategist Esther Reichelt, in Frankfurt.

“I don’t think the market is looking further than the December meeting ... I think we’ll stay around these levels for the time being,” she added.

Data on Friday showed speculators cut their bearish bets on the U.S. dollar in the week up to last Tuesday.

The dollar index - which measures the greenback against a basket of six other major currencies - hit its highest since late July on the numbers, at 94.267. It traded close to that level on Monday, inching down 0.1 percent to 93.701.

Investors were focused on U.S. inflation and retail sales due later in the week, as well as minutes from the Fed’s latest policy meeting.

“The gradual firming of earnings growth supports the Fed’s plans to continue raising rates gradually, although it remains a concern that underlying inflation pressures have slowed this year,” wrote MUFG currency economist Lee Hardman in a note to clients.

Trade was thinned by public holidays in Japan, South Korea and the United States.

The New Zealand dollar touched a four-month low after a final vote count in the country’s tight general election released over the weekend failed to identify a clear winner.

The euro edged up 0.1 percent to $1.1745, up from Friday’s low of $1.1669 - its weakest level since Aug. 17.

COX‘S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Thousands of Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar fled to Bangladesh on Monday in a new surge of refugees driven by fears of starvation and violence the United Nations has denounced as ethnic cleansing.

About 519,000 Rohingya have crossed the border since Aug. 25, when attacks by Rohingya militants on security posts in Rakhine state sparked a ferocious military response.

The European Union (EU) is proposing shunning contact with Myanmar’s top generals as a first step toward new targeted sanctions to punish the military for the violence, according to a draft document seen by Reuters.

Reuters reporters on the Bangladeshi side of the border, in Palong Khali district, saw several thousand people crossing from northern Rakhine on Monday, filing along embankments between flooded fields and scrubby forest.

“Half of my village was burnt down. I saw them do it,” said Sayed Azin, 46, who said he had walked for eight days carrying his 80-year-old mother in a basket strung on a bamboo pole between him and his son.

Soldiers and Buddhist mobs had torched his village, he said.

“I left everything,” he said, sobbing. “I can’t find my relatives ... I can’t take this any more.”

Some new arrivals spoke of bloody attacks by Buddhist mobs on people trekking toward the border.

Refugees and rights groups say the army and Buddhist vigilantes have engaged in a campaign of killing and arson aimed at driving the Rohingya out of Myanmar.

Myanmar rejects accusations of ethnic cleansing and has labeled the militants from the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army who launched the initial attacks as terrorists who have killed civilians and burnt villages.

Among those fleeing were up to 35 people on a boat that capsized off the Bangladesh coast on Sunday. At least 12 of them drowned while 13 were rescued, Bangladeshi police said.

“We faced so many difficulties, for food and survival,” Sayed Hossein, 30, told Reuters, adding that his wife, three children, mother and father in law had drowned.

“We came here to save our lives.”

“GETTING WORSE”

Myanmar leader and Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi has faced scathing international criticism for not doing more to stop the violence, although she has no power over the security forces under a military-drafted constitution.

The United States and EU have been considering targeted sanctions against Myanmar military leaders, diplomats and officials have told Reuters, though they are wary of action that could destabilize the country’s transition to democracy.

EU foreign ministers will discuss the situation in Myanmar on Oct. 16, and their draft joint statement said the bloc “will suspend invitations to the commander-in-chief of the Myanmar/Burma armed forces and other senior military officers”.

Such a move would be largely symbolic, but could be followed by further action.

The Myanmar government has said its “clearance operations” against the militants ended in early September and people had no reason to flee. But in recent days the government has reported large numbers of Muslims preparing to leave, with more than 17,000 people in one area alone.

The government cited worries about food and security as their reasons.

Some villagers in Rakhine said food was running out because rice in the fields was not ready for harvest and the state government had closed village markets and restricted the transport of food, apparently to cut supplies to the militants.

“The situation’s getting worse. We have no food and no guarantee of security,” said a Rohingya resident of Hsin Hnin Pyar village on the south of the state’s Buthidaung district.

He said a lot of people were preparing to flee.

“While the Myanmar military has engaged in a campaign of violence, there is mounting evidence that Rohingya women, men and children are now also fleeing the very real threat of starvation,” rights group Amnesty International said.

Senior state government official Kyaw Swar Tun declined to go into details when asked about the food, except to ask: “Have you heard of anyone dying of hunger in Buthidaung?”

The reports of food shortages will add to the urgency of calls by aid agencies and the international community for unfettered humanitarian access to the conflict zone.

COMING, GOING

The insurgents declared a one-month ceasefire from Sept. 10 to enable the delivery of aid but the government rebuffed them, saying it did not negotiate with terrorists.

The ceasefire is due to end at midnight on Monday, but the insurgents said in a statement they were ready to respond to any peace move by the government.

The ability of the group to mount any sort of challenge to the army is unclear, but it does not appear to have been able to put up resistance to the latest military offensive.

Bangladesh was already home to 400,000 Rohingya who had fled earlier bouts of violence.

Mostly Buddhist Myanmar does not recognize the Rohingya as citizens, even though many have lived there for generations.

But even as refugees arrive, Bangladesh insists they will all have to go home. Myanmar has responded by saying it will take back those who can be verified as genuine refugees.

Many Rohingya fear they will not be able to prove their right to return.

CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - TransCanada Corp abandoned its C$15.7 billion ($12.52 billion) cross-country Energy East pipeline on Thursday amid mounting regulatory hurdles, dealing a blow to the country’s oil export ambitions.

The demise of the pipeline comes less than a year after the Canadian government rejected another export pipeline, Enbridge Inc’s Northern Gateway, and is a further setback for Canada’s oil industry which is already hurting from low global crude prices.

The vast majority of Canadian crude exports go to the United States, and Energy East would have shipped 1.1 million barrels a day to east coast ports for loading onto tankers destined for higher-priced markets in Europe and Asia.

Concern about limited market access is one of the reasons foreign oil companies have sold off $23 billion in Canadian assets this year, along with high production costs that have made the country’s oil sands unattractive.

“It means reduced (options) for Canada and Canadian oil producers to access global markets and to receive fair pricing for one of our country’s most important export products,” said Brett Harris, spokesman for Canada’s No. 3 oil sands producer Cenovus Energy.

The cancellation heads off a broader political row over the project for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government, however, which is trying to balance diversifying Canada’s oil export markets with a commitment to tackling climate change.

TransCanada said last month it could abandon the project, weeks after Canada’s National Energy Board (NEB) announced a tougher review process that would take into account indirect greenhouse gas contributions among other factors.

On Thursday TransCanada canceled the plan, citing its review of “changed circumstances” and said it would take a fourth-quarter C$1 billion after-tax non-cash charge.

‘JOB LOSSES’

When it was announced in 2013, Energy East was hailed as a nation-building project that would unlock Canadian exports and boost economic growth along its route.

“The loss of this major project means the loss of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars for Canada, and will significantly impact our country’s ability to access markets for our oil and gas,” the Canadian Energy Pipeline Association (CEPA) said in a statement.

Pipeline supporters and the Alberta government have criticized the NEB for changing its review scope and provincial Premier Rachel Notley urged the regulator to give more clarity on its process.

While Energy East’s collapse may cost Trudeau support in the traditionally conservative oil heartland of Alberta it is likely to prove popular in the eastern province of Quebec, which has far more parliamentary seats and where pipeline opposition from politicians and environmental groups had been stiff.

Canada’s Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr said the cancellation was a business decision and oil markets had changed since the pipeline was first proposed.

Oil prices have roughly halved since 2014.

TransCanada’s decision is also a blow to the ailing economy of New Brunswick province, where the pipeline would have terminated. Premier Brian Gallant said he believed low crude prices had killed the project.

Environmental groups welcomed the decision to scrap a pipeline they said was at odds with Canada’s commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Analysts said the decision to abandon it was already priced into the stock. Shares were last up 0.7 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange at C$61.29. They had fallen 3.2 percent since Aug. 23 - when the NEB expanded the scope of its assessment.

Air Berlin filed for insolvency in August and a government loan is keeping its planes in the air to give it time to negotiate with investors for parts of the business.

Talks with Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) and easyJet (EZJ.L) are due to run until Thursday and once a deal for parts of its business has been agreed Air Berlin will have to wind down the rest of the operation.

German deputy economy minister Matthias Machnig said he is confident a deal will be reached on Thursday.

“After purchase contracts have been agreed, the company must end its own operations step by step,” Air Berlin said in a statement.

Air Berlin’s Niki, which flies to tourist destinations, and regional airline LG Walter are not insolvent and will continue to run, the company said. It will also continue to fly 38 planes as part of a wet lease deal, under which Lufthansa rents crewed planes from Air Berlin mainly for its Eurowings brand, until competition authorities have approved the sale of assets.

Most Air Berlin long-haul flights have already been canceled and the remainder will end on Oct. 15.

Lufthansa is interested in Air Berlin operations with about 81 planes, including Niki and LG Walter, while easyJet is in talks for parts of the business with about 27-30 planes, Air Berlin administrators have said.

Those operations also include access to take-off and landing slots at Air Berlin’s hubs in Tegel and Duesseldorf.

Air Berlin leases its planes, so any bidder will have to fund the aircraft separately. Lufthansa said last month that its board had freed up 1 billion euros ($1.17 billion) to invest in new planes for Eurowings, which it said were likely to come from Air Berlin.

However, a newspaper reported on Monday that talks with easyJet may not result in a deal after the British carrier reduced its offer.

Analysts and industry experts have said that easyJet could be interested in slots made available at London Gatwick after the collapse of British holiday airline Monarch, which was grounded last week.

EasyJet has already encouraged crew made redundant by Monarch last week to apply for positions at the budget carrier.

On Monday Air Berlin said its staff would not all find jobs with the potential buyers of its assets and they should start looking for jobs.

Eurowings has already opened up vacancies for 1,000-plus pilots, cabin crew and ground staff and said on Friday that it had received more than 2,500 applications from around the world, about half of which were from pilots.",Auf Wiedersehen Air Berlin: flights to cease this month,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-air-berlin-lufthansa/auf-wiedersehen-air-berlin-flights-to-cease-this-month-idUSKBN1CE198

BARCELONA/MADRID (Reuters) - Catalonia’s secessionist leader came under intense pressure on Monday to abandon plans to declare independence from Spain after hundreds of thousands of unionists took to the streets at the weekend to protest against the region breaking away.

Spain fears the Catalan parliament will vote for independence on Tuesday, when Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont is due to address the assembly in the wake of a banned Oct. 1 referendum in which Catalan officials say people voted overwhelmingly for secession.

Under Catalonia’s referendum law, deemed unconstitutional by Madrid, a vote for independence on Tuesday would start a six-month process that would envisage divorce talks with Spain before regional elections and a final act of separation.

But the Spanish government, buoyed by Sunday’s protests in Barcelona, the Catalan capital, made it clear on Monday it would respond immediately to any such vote.

“I‘m calling on the sensible people in the Catalan government...don’t jump off the edge because you’ll take the people with you,” Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaría said in an interview with COPE radio station.

“If there is a unilateral declaration of independence there will be decisions made to restore law and democracy.”

Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has not ruled out removing Catalonia’s government and calling new regional elections if it claims independence.

The stakes are high for Spain as it faces its biggest political crisis since it became a democracy four decades ago.

Losing Catalonia, which has its own language and culture, would deprive Spain of a fifth of its economic output and more than a quarter of exports. A stream of Catalonia-based firms and banks have moved their legal bases outside the region.

The crisis has also reopened old divisions in a nation where fascism is a living memory easily revived by strong displays of nationalism.

Among many moderate Spaniards, though, there is widespread opposition to a breakaway, including in Catalonia. Most of the region’s unionists boycotted the Oct. 1 referendum, which was banned by Madrid and marred by a violent police crackdown.

The European Union has also shown no interest in an independent Catalonia, despite an appeal by Puigdemont for Brussels to mediate in the crisis.

France, which borders Catalonia, said on Monday it would not recognise a unilateral independence declaration.

On Sunday, a crowd estimated by local police to number 350,000, took to the streets of the Catalan capital Barcelona, waving Spanish and Catalan flags and carrying banners saying “Catalonia is Spain” and “Together we are stronger”.

The show of support for Madrid helped calm Spanish markets on Monday, along with comments on Friday from credit rating agencies Moody's and DBRS that they expected Spain to remain united. Spanish borrowing costs fell to a one-week low and the main share index .IBEX touched a week high.

PROTESTS, NO TALKS

With Puigdemont under pressure to back down, there is speculation he may baulk at moving an independence motion on Tuesday and call snap regional polls, turning them into a de facto, legal referendum on independence.

But Puigdemont appeared resolute in a TV interview on Sunday, saying the region’s referendum law called for a declaration of independence in the event of a “yes” vote.

“We will apply what the law says,” he said, according to a partial transcript released by TV3.

Catalan authorities say about 90 percent of those who voted on Oct. 1 backed secession, but opinion polls suggest the region is more closely divided. Referendum turn-out was 43 percent.

Sunday’s anti-independence demonstration, which included Catalans and people from other parts of Spain, underlined how the dispute has riven the region itself. A month ago, a million people rallied in the city to support independence.

“We feel both Catalan and Spanish,” Araceli Ponze, 72, said during Sunday’s rally. “We are facing a tremendous unknown. We will see what happens this week but we have to speak out very loudly so they know what we want.”

Puigdemont will address the Catalan parliament at 6 p.m. (1600 GMT) on Tuesday on “the current political situation” amid speculation he could ask the assembly to declare independence.

Puigdemont said on Sunday he had not been in contact with the Madrid government for some time because it refused to discuss independence.

“What is happening in Catalonia is real, whether they like it or not. Millions of people have voted, who want to decide. We have to talk about this,” he said.

Rajoy has said repeatedly he will not talk to the Catalan leaders unless they drop their plans to declare independence.

Madrid sent thousands of national police to the region to prevent the vote. About 900 people were injured when officers used rubber bullets and batons against voters in scenes that shocked Spain and the world, and escalated the dispute.

The political stand-off has pushed banks and companies to move their legal headquarters outside Catalonia.

The boards of Catalonia-based infrastructure firm Abertis (ABE.MC), telecoms company Cellnex (CLNX.MC) and property group Inmobiliaria Colonial (COL.MC) will meet on Monday to discuss moving, sources said.

Influential in the field of behavioral economics, his research showed how traits such as lack of self-control and fear of losing what you already have prompt decisions that may not have the best outcome in the longer term.

“I think the most important impact (of my research) is the recognition that economic agents are human and economic models have to incorporate that,” Thaler, a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, said in call broadcast at the Nobel news conference.

Awarding the 9 million Swedish crown ($1.1 million) prize, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said: “Richard Thaler’s contributions have built a bridge between the economic and psychological analyses of individual decision-making.”

“His empirical findings and theoretical insights have been instrumental in creating the new and rapidly expanding field of behavioral economics, which has had a profound impact on many areas of economic research and policy.”

Thaler brought to prominence the idea of “nudge” economics, where individuals are subtly guided toward beneficial behaviors without heavy-handed compulsion, the theme of a 2008 book he co-wrote which caught the eye of policymakers around the world.

In researching how self-control - or the lack of it - Thaler touched on an age-old problem: why New Year’s resolutions to change aspects of your life are notoriously hard to keep.

The issue has relevance for economics as individuals’ tendency to fall prey to temptation often negatively affects plans to, for instance, save for retirement.

Together with Professor Cass Sunstein, he argued that society - while maintaining freedom of choice - should actively try to guide individuals in the right direction.

Their book, titled ‘Nudge: Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth, and Happiness’ became popular with some western politicians seeking ways to encourage their citizens to save and live healthily, without incurring voters’ wrath for raising taxes or banning behavior outright.

“This has also been used in public pension systems in the United States and the general idea of ‘nudging’ ... has made a breakthrough in public policy making,” Torsten Persson, economics prize committee member, told Reuters.

“There’s also a nudging unit for the UK government, there’s one for the Australian government, it even affects the Swedish government when they think about these things.”’

David Laibson, chair of Harvard University’s economics department, said many of Thaler’s theories have been widely applied by business and government, aiming to get individuals to do a range of actions such as paying parking tickets and getting flu shots.

“If you live in a developed country, there’s some firm or entity that has read these ideas and started to affect your life,” Laibson said.

Influential in academic circles, the movie-going public may have noticed Thaler make a brief cameo in the 2015 film “The Big Short”, explaining the so-called “hot-hand fallacy” where past success is expected to also warrant success in the future, with pop star Selena Gomez.

Asked how he would spend his prize money, Thaler said:

“I will spend it as irrationally as possible.”

MANY AMERICANS, NO WOMEN

The economics prize, officially called the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, was established in 1968. It was not part of the original group of awards set out in dynamite tycoon Nobel’s 1895 will.

Economy is the last of this year’s Nobels, with prizes for physiology or medicine, physics, chemistry, literature and peace awarded last week.

The United States has dominated the economics prize, with American economists accounting for roughly half of laureates since the inception of the award. Indeed, between 2000 and 2013, U.S. academics won or shared the prize every year.

While Americans have dominated the Nobel science and economics prizes, another category of researchers - women - have been few and far between. Indeed only one women - Elinor Ostrom in 2009 - has won the economics prize to date, and not a single individual women won any Nobel award in 2017.

“We are disappointed looking in a larger perspective that there aren’t more women who have been rewarded,” the Academy’s secretary general Goran Hansson said.

He said the Academy would hold a conference to discuss the issue and nominators will be asked to identify women scientists for recognition and also consider ethnic and geographic diversity.

“We are concerned, we are taking measures. I hope that in five years, ten years, we will see a very different distribution,” Hansson said.",We're all human: 'Nudge' theorist Thaler wins economics Nobel,https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1CE0X0

Em uma lista de “princípios” apresentados em documentos divulgados pela Casa Branca, o governo Trump também pressionou pela repressão a menores desacompanhados que entram nos EUA, muitos deles saídos da América Central.

O plano, que foi entregue aos líderes do Congresso na noite de domingo, foi logo rejeitado pelos democratas, que buscam uma solução legislativa para o programa de proteção a crianças que entraram ilegalmente nos EUA com seus pais, que Trump encerrou no mês passado.

“O governo não pode estar falando sério a respeito de uma concessão ou ajuda aos ‘dreamers’ se começar com uma lista que é uma anátema para os ‘dreamers’, para a comunidade imigrante e para a grande maioria dos americanos”, disseram a líder democrata na Câmara dos Deputados, Nancy Pelosi, e o líder democrata no Senado, Chuck Schumer.

“A lista inclui o muro, que foi descartado explicitamente nas negociações. Se o presidente estava falando sério sobre proteger os ‘dreamers’, seus funcionários não fizeram um esforço de boa fé para isso”, disseram em um comunicado.

A gestão Trump quer que a ‘lista de desejos’ seja a base da reforma imigratória no Congresso e acompanhe um projeto de lei de substituição do programa do ex-presidente Barack Obama que protegeu quase 800 mil “dreamers” da deportação e lhes permitiu obter vistos de trabalho.

Se adotadas, as prioridades da Casa Branca poderiam resultar na deportação dos pais dos “dreamers”.

As propostas enfatizam a vigilância da imigração e incluem um pedido de fundos para contratar mais 370 juízes de imigração, mil advogados para a Agência de Imigração e Aduana (ICE, na sigla em inglês), 300 procuradores federais e mil agentes adicionais da ICE para aplicar as leis de imigração.

“Estas prioridades são essenciais para mitigar as consequências legais e econômicas de qualquer concessão de status a beneficiários do programa”, disse o diretor de assuntos legislativos de Trump, Marc Short, aos repórteres em uma coletiva por telefone. A Casa Branca deixou claro que não defenderá a concessão de cidadania ou de qualquer legalização da situação dos “dreamers” em um eventual acordo.

COX‘S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Thousands of Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar fled to Bangladesh on Monday in a new surge of refugees driven by fears of starvation and violence the United Nations has denounced as ethnic cleansing.

About 519,000 Rohingya have crossed the border since Aug. 25, when attacks by Rohingya militants on security posts in Rakhine state sparked a ferocious military response.

The European Union (EU) is proposing shunning contact with Myanmar’s top generals as a first step toward new targeted sanctions to punish the military for the violence, according to a draft document seen by Reuters.

Reuters reporters on the Bangladeshi side of the border, in Palong Khali district, saw several thousand people crossing from northern Rakhine on Monday, filing along embankments between flooded fields and scrubby forest.

“Half of my village was burnt down. I saw them do it,” said Sayed Azin, 46, who said he had walked for eight days carrying his 80-year-old mother in a basket strung on a bamboo pole between him and his son.

Soldiers and Buddhist mobs had torched his village, he said.

“I left everything,” he said, sobbing. “I can’t find my relatives ... I can’t take this any more.”

Some new arrivals spoke of bloody attacks by Buddhist mobs on people trekking toward the border.

Refugees and rights groups say the army and Buddhist vigilantes have engaged in a campaign of killing and arson aimed at driving the Rohingya out of Myanmar.

Myanmar rejects accusations of ethnic cleansing and has labeled the militants from the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army who launched the initial attacks as terrorists who have killed civilians and burnt villages.

Among those fleeing were up to 35 people on a boat that capsized off the Bangladesh coast on Sunday. At least 12 of them drowned while 13 were rescued, Bangladeshi police said.

“We faced so many difficulties, for food and survival,” Sayed Hossein, 30, told Reuters, adding that his wife, three children, mother and father in law had drowned.

“We came here to save our lives.”

“GETTING WORSE”

Myanmar leader and Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi has faced scathing international criticism for not doing more to stop the violence, although she has no power over the security forces under a military-drafted constitution.

The United States and EU have been considering targeted sanctions against Myanmar military leaders, diplomats and officials have told Reuters, though they are wary of action that could destabilize the country’s transition to democracy.

EU foreign ministers will discuss the situation in Myanmar on Oct. 16, and their draft joint statement said the bloc “will suspend invitations to the commander-in-chief of the Myanmar/Burma armed forces and other senior military officers”.

Such a move would be largely symbolic, but could be followed by further action.

The Myanmar government has said its “clearance operations” against the militants ended in early September and people had no reason to flee. But in recent days the government has reported large numbers of Muslims preparing to leave, with more than 17,000 people in one area alone.

The government cited worries about food and security as their reasons.

Some villagers in Rakhine said food was running out because rice in the fields was not ready for harvest and the state government had closed village markets and restricted the transport of food, apparently to cut supplies to the militants.

“The situation’s getting worse. We have no food and no guarantee of security,” said a Rohingya resident of Hsin Hnin Pyar village on the south of the state’s Buthidaung district.

He said a lot of people were preparing to flee.

“While the Myanmar military has engaged in a campaign of violence, there is mounting evidence that Rohingya women, men and children are now also fleeing the very real threat of starvation,” rights group Amnesty International said.

Senior state government official Kyaw Swar Tun declined to go into details when asked about the food, except to ask: “Have you heard of anyone dying of hunger in Buthidaung?”

The reports of food shortages will add to the urgency of calls by aid agencies and the international community for unfettered humanitarian access to the conflict zone.

COMING, GOING

The insurgents declared a one-month ceasefire from Sept. 10 to enable the delivery of aid but the government rebuffed them, saying it did not negotiate with terrorists.

The ceasefire is due to end at midnight on Monday, but the insurgents said in a statement they were ready to respond to any peace move by the government.

The ability of the group to mount any sort of challenge to the army is unclear, but it does not appear to have been able to put up resistance to the latest military offensive.

Bangladesh was already home to 400,000 Rohingya who had fled earlier bouts of violence.

Mostly Buddhist Myanmar does not recognize the Rohingya as citizens, even though many have lived there for generations.

But even as refugees arrive, Bangladesh insists they will all have to go home. Myanmar has responded by saying it will take back those who can be verified as genuine refugees.

Many Rohingya fear they will not be able to prove their right to return.

Influential in the field of behavioral economics, his research showed how traits such as lack of self-control and fear of losing what you already have prompt decisions that may not have the best outcome in the longer term.

“I think the most important impact (of my research) is the recognition that economic agents are human and economic models have to incorporate that,” Thaler, a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, said in call broadcast at the Nobel news conference.

Awarding the 9 million Swedish crown ($1.1 million) prize, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said: “Richard Thaler’s contributions have built a bridge between the economic and psychological analyses of individual decision-making.”

“His empirical findings and theoretical insights have been instrumental in creating the new and rapidly expanding field of behavioral economics, which has had a profound impact on many areas of economic research and policy.”

Thaler brought to prominence the idea of “nudge” economics, where individuals are subtly guided toward beneficial behaviors without heavy-handed compulsion, the theme of a 2008 book he co-wrote which caught the eye of policymakers around the world.

In researching how self-control - or the lack of it - Thaler touched on an age-old problem: why New Year’s resolutions to change aspects of your life are notoriously hard to keep.

The issue has relevance for economics as individuals’ tendency to fall prey to temptation often negatively affects plans to, for instance, save for retirement.

Together with Professor Cass Sunstein, he argued that society - while maintaining freedom of choice - should actively try to guide individuals in the right direction.

Their book, titled ‘Nudge: Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth, and Happiness’ became popular with some western politicians seeking ways to encourage their citizens to save and live healthily, without incurring voters’ wrath for raising taxes or banning behavior outright.

“This has also been used in public pension systems in the United States and the general idea of ‘nudging’ ... has made a breakthrough in public policy making,” Torsten Persson, economics prize committee member, told Reuters.

“There’s also a nudging unit for the UK government, there’s one for the Australian government, it even affects the Swedish government when they think about these things.”’

David Laibson, chair of Harvard University’s economics department, said many of Thaler’s theories have been widely applied by business and government, aiming to get individuals to do a range of actions such as paying parking tickets and getting flu shots.

“If you live in a developed country, there’s some firm or entity that has read these ideas and started to affect your life,” Laibson said.

Influential in academic circles, the movie-going public may have noticed Thaler make a brief cameo in the 2015 film “The Big Short”, explaining the so-called “hot-hand fallacy” where past success is expected to also warrant success in the future, with pop star Selena Gomez.

Asked how he would spend his prize money, Thaler said:

The economics prize, officially called the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, was established in 1968. It was not part of the original group of awards set out in dynamite tycoon Nobel’s 1895 will.

Economy is the last of this year’s Nobels, with prizes for physiology or medicine, physics, chemistry, literature and peace awarded last week.

The United States has dominated the economics prize, with American economists accounting for roughly half of laureates since the inception of the award. Indeed, between 2000 and 2013, U.S. academics won or shared the prize every year.

“We are disappointed looking in a larger perspective that there aren’t more women who have been rewarded,” the Academy’s secretary general Goran Hansson said.

He said the Academy would hold a conference to discuss the issue and nominators will be asked to identify women scientists for recognition and also consider ethnic and geographic diversity.

But the heart of European innovation isn’t a major metropolis –it’s a small city in the Dutch-speaking region of Flanders. That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ second annual ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science, invent new technologies, and help drive the global economy (Compare all 100 schools here).

REUTERS TOP 100

The most innovative university in Europe, for the second year running, is Belgium’s KU Leuven. This nearly 600-year-old institution was founded by Pope Martin V, but today it’s better known for technology than theology: KU Leuven maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet. In fiscal 2015, the university’s research spending exceeded €454 million, and its patent portfolio currently includes 586 active families, each one representing an invention protected in multiple countries.

How does a relatively small Catholic university out-innovate bigger, better-known institutions across Europe? KU Leuven earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than most other universities on the continent, and outside researchers frequently cite KU Leuven inventions in their own patent applications. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

The second most innovative university in Europe is Imperial College London, an institution whose researchers have been responsible for the discovery of penicillin, the development of holography and the invention of fiber optics. The third-place University of Cambridge has been associated with 91 Nobel Laureates during its 800-year history. And the fourth-place Technical University of Munich has spun off more than 800 companies since 1990, including a variety of high-tech startups in industries including renewable energy, semiconductors and nanotechnology.

Overall, the same countries that dominate European business and politics dominate the ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities. German universities account for 23 of the 100 institutions on the list, more than any other country, and the United Kingdom comes in second, tied with France, each with 17 institutions. But those three countries are also among the most populous and richest countries on the continent. Control for those factors, and it turns out that countries with much smaller populations and modest economies often outperform big ones.

The Republic of Ireland has only three schools on the entire list, but with a population of less than 5 million people, it can boast more top 100 innovative universities per capita than any other country in Europe. On the same per capita basis, the second most innovative country on the list is Denmark, followed by Belgium, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Germany, the United Kingdom and France rank in the middle of the pack, an indication that they may be underperforming compared with their smaller neighbors: On a per capita basis, none of those countries has half as many top 100 universities than Ireland.

Students walk out of a faculty building of Imperial College London, Britain, May 27, 2016. REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo

And the same trends hold true if you look at national economies. According to the International Monetary Fund, in 2016 Germany’s gross domestic product exceeded $3.49 trillion –11 times larger than Ireland at $307 billion, yet Germany has only 7 times as many top 100 innovative universities.

Some countries underperform even more drastically. Russia is Europe’s most populous country and has the region’s fifth largest economy, yet none of its universities count among the top 100. Other notable absences include any universities from Ukraine or Romania–a fact that reveals another divide between Western and Eastern Europe.

To compile the ranking of Europe’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included European universities, and then ranked them based on their performance.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and three universities that ranked in the top 100 in 2016 fell off the list entirely: the Netherland’s Eindhoven University of Technology, Germany’s University of Kiel, and the UK’s Queens University Belfast. All three universities filed fewer than 50 patents during the period examined for the ranking, and thus were eliminated from consideration. They’ve been replaced by three new entrants to the top 100: the University of Glasgow (#54), the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis (#94), and the Autonomous University of Madrid (#100).

The returning universities that made the biggest moves on the list were the Netherland’s Leiden University (up 21 spots to #17) and Germany’s Technical University of Berlin (up 21 spots to #41). Belgium’s Université Libre of Brussels (down 17 to #38) and the UK’s University of Leeds (down 17 to #73) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Generally, though, the list remained largely stable: Nine of the top ten schools of 2016 remained in the top 10 for 2017, and 17 of the top 20. This stability is understandable because something as large as university paper output and patent performance is unlikely to change quickly.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the continent: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

BRASÍLIA (Reuters) - A Advocacia-Geral da União (AGU) mudou de opinião durante o governo do presidente Michel Temer e agora diz ser contra a possibilidade de o Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF) afastar parlamentares de suas funções legislativas.

A nova posição do órgão foi apresentada pela ministra-chefe da AGU, Grace Mendonça, em parecer enviado ao Supremo na sexta-feira. O texto foi escrito por três integrantes do órgão e depois avalizado pela ministra.

O STF julgará na quarta-feira ação movida por três partidos --PP, PSC e Solidariedade-- que defende que afastamento e outras medidas cautelares em desfavor de deputados e senadores deveriam ter o mesmo tratamento dado pela Constituição para decisão sobre prisão de parlamentares.

Esse julgamento terá reflexo direto no caso envolvendo o afastamento do senador Aécio Neves (PSDB-MG) pela Primeira Turma do STF, uma decisão que criou um novo embate entre a corte e o Congresso.

Na primeira manifestação enviada ao Supremo sobre o tema, no ano passado, o ex-ministro da AGU Fábio Medina, a então secretária-geral de Contencioso do órgão, a hoje ministra Grace Mendonça, e uma advogada da União defenderam que a Corte pode sim determinar o afastamento de parlamentares de suas funções.

No entanto, na mais recente manifestação, a ministra Grace Mendonça afirmou que qualquer medida restritiva da atuação de um parlamentar, que não seja uma prisão de um congressista quando flagrado cometendo um crime inafiançável, é ilegal.

O órgão argumenta que não se está proibindo a persecução criminal, mas, diante da imunidade prevista para os parlamentares, deve se observar os limites constitucional com o objetivo de garantir a plena atividade de deputados e senadores.

“Ora, se em desfavor do parlamentar não pode ser decretada prisão preventiva, por certo também que não cabe a fixação de medida cautelar diversa que somente é cabível quando presente situação que justifique aquela modalidade de prisão cautelar”, disse o órgão.

Na manifestação inicial, a AGU havia ressaltado que há diferenças na análise de um caso de prisão para outro que se refere a outras medidas cautelares.

“Como visto, a imunidade prisional refere-se exclusivamente à impossibilidade de prisão de membros do Congresso Nacional, exceto em casos de flagrante em crime inafiançável, quando os autos deverão ser encaminhados à Casa, para que decidam sobre a prisão”, afirmou.

“O dispositivo constitucional é, portanto, claro ao deferir a imunidade apenas em relação à prisão de parlamentares e, como regra que excepciona o alcance jurisdicional e confere prerrogativa, deve ser apresentada de forma restritiva”, afirmaram os representantes da AGU.",AGU muda opinião e agora diz que STF não pode afastar parlamentares,https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idBRKBN1CE1DO-OBRDN

Navistar’s Mexican factory, now the U.S. company’s largest worldwide, exports to around 30 countries and sells less to the United States than competitors such as Daimler AG, one of the top three truck-makers in Mexico, which sends three-quarters of its Mexican-made commercial vehicles north.

But Navistar’s reliance on tariff-free imported parts shows why even Mexico manufacturers that have diversified their customer base away from the United States still fear U.S. President Donald Trump’s threats to scrap NAFTA.

“To lose this treaty would be to go backwards 40 years,” said Oscar Ruiz, operations director at the plant, fearing a return to an era when barriers made foreign investment and trade expensive between the two neighbors.

Trade negotiators from the United States, Mexico and Canada will meet this week in Washington for a fourth round of talks on reworking NAFTA amid growing signs of an impasse between the Trump administration and the other two signatories of the pact.

Mexican officials warn that Trump is leading the region towards a protectionist trade war with his “America First” policy, flirting with major curbs on commerce.

Nowadays, over half the original parts for the vehicles made at Navistar’s 250 acre (100 hectare) site in the northern state of Nuevo Leon arrive duty-free from the United States and Canada in hundreds of trailers every day, Ruiz said.

Higher tariffs on imports or reduced trade flows would raise the cost of production and of exporting to the United States. That would make trucks more expensive for all Navistar’s customers, experts consulted by Reuters said. Navistar, for example, uses Alabama-made Cummins engines in its International Prostar and LT heavy tractors.

Without NAFTA, importing the engines would likely cost 10 percent more, based on World Trade Organization tariffs, according to Manuel Nieblas, a manufacturing consultant at Deloitte Mexico.

With engines representing up to 45 percent of the $130,000 cost of a Prostar truck, that tariff alone could add around $5,800 to the final price.

Prices would also rise for most of the up-to 12,000 parts used in a Navistar truck, both due to the tariffs and slower border-customs checks if trade were to be more regulated.

A ‘LOGISTIC SPRINGBOARD’

Aside from higher prices for imported parts, ending NAFTA would likely impose a 4 percent tariff on top of the total value of the Class 8 truck 18-wheeler for export to the United States.

Still, that might be slight enough for U.S. consumers to absorb, or for the company to shave off its margins.

And Navistar’s strategy of using Mexico’s low costs and multiple free trade deals to export to markets from Saudi Arabia to Australia could soften the blow of any tougher export rules for the United States, Mexican Chief Executive Carlos Pardo said.

“More than ever I believe Mexico is a logistic springboard, where on top of a qualified work force and reasonable production costs, logistically it has created the connections to supply any part of the world,” Pardo said in Navistar’s Mexico City headquarters.

While 98 percent of trucks exported from Mexico go to the United States or Canada, U.S. truckmaker Kenworth, China’s Giant and Korean automaker Kia all have a similar strategy of building in Mexico to export to countries other than the United States.

Scrapping NAFTA might not hurt exports to robust European economies, but those to Latin America, Navistar’s top market after North America, would become much more complicated, said Salvador Pasquel, an automotive expert at Baker McKenzie.

Business with Colombia, which in 2011 was the biggest market in Latin America for U.S. truck companies after Mexico, helps illustrate what could happen if NAFTA collapses.

Sales plummeted after vehicles got more expensive because of changes in Colombia’s trade policy, including a tax of 15 percent on the value of new imported heavy trucks.

“We went from exporting $817 million in heavy tractors in 2011 to barely $1 million in 2015,” said Miguel Elizalde, president of Mexico’s truck and bus business chamber, Anpact.

One fear for Mexico-based companies is that increased costs there would boost Latin American sales of trucks made in Brazil, whose vehicle industry belongs to the Mercosur free trade bloc.

“If it’s harder for Mexico to place its products in Latin America, the big economy that could provide those cars and trucks would surely be Brazil,” said Baker McKenzie’s Pasquel.

The worries over NAFTA coincide with a recovery in Navistar’s U.S. market.

After a long stretch of depressed sales, orders for Class 8 trucks in the United States soared for the fourth consecutive month in September, according to preliminary data from industry forecaster FTR. (here) Analysts expect a strong year in 2018.

Although Lisle, Illinois-based Navistar posted a second quarter loss, its share price has recovered lately as the company turns itself around after a disastrous bet on a costly and unsuccessful smog-reduction system.

Last year, Volkswagen’s truck unit said it was buying a stake in Navistar as part of an alliance in which the two companies will share technology.

In Mexico, growth of truck-making under NAFTA has been rapid. In 1993, a year before the deal took effect, Mexico exported 1,040 heavy vehicles. Last year, it sold 106,161 such vehicles abroad, according to Anpact figures.

Navistar’s Escobedo plant was producing three vehicles a day when it opened in 1998. It now makes 160, with capacity for almost double that, factory manager Ruiz said.

The company is under no illusion it could maintain those volumes without NAFTA, though the plant recently decided to hire 150 new workers because of recovering U.S. demand.

“We could survive, yes, but the question is, at what level?” Ruiz said.",Shaky NAFTA deal threatens Navistar's Mexico-made exports to world,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trade-nafta-navistar/shaky-nafta-deal-threatens-navistars-mexico-made-exports-to-world-idINKBN1CE0BX?il=0

TUNIS (Reuters) - The U.N. migration agency said on Monday it was trying to provide assistance to large numbers of migrants who had been held in the smuggling hub of Sabratha as rival factions battled for control of the city.

At least 4,000 migrants, including pregnant women, newborn babies and unaccompanied children, have been transferred from informal camps and dormitories to a hangar in the city since the clashes ended on Friday, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said.

Sabratha has been the most common point of departure for mostly sub-Saharan African migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean by boat from Libya.

But the number of crossings dropped sharply in July after an armed group struck a deal with officials from the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli to block departures, under pressure from Italy and other European Union member states.

That set off three weeks of fighting among rival factions which ended with the withdrawal of the armed group. The migrants who have since been rounded up were being held at sites that the group had controlled, local officials said.

“We are seriously concerned by the large number of migrants caught up in recent developments in Sabratha,” Othman Belbeisi, IOM Libya Chief of Mission, said in a statement.

Some migrants are being sent on to detention centers elsewhere in western Libya that are nominally under the control of the Tripoli government.

IOM officials say those centers, which were housing some 5,000 migrants, risk being overwhelmed by the new arrivals. Conditions in the centers are often dire and abuse widespread.

“Alternatives to detention must be found for migrants in Libya. In the meantime, IOM continues to provide direct humanitarian, health and psychosocial assistance to meet the urgent needs of the thousands of migrants being affected,” Belbeisi said.

Local sources have previously said that an estimated 10,000 migrants were being held in the Sabratha area.

COX‘S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Thousands of Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar fled to Bangladesh on Monday in a new surge of refugees driven by fears of starvation and violence the United Nations has denounced as ethnic cleansing.

About 519,000 Rohingya have crossed the border since Aug. 25, when attacks by Rohingya militants on security posts in Rakhine state sparked a ferocious military response.

The European Union (EU) is proposing shunning contact with Myanmar’s top generals as a first step toward new targeted sanctions to punish the military for the violence, according to a draft document seen by Reuters.

Reuters reporters on the Bangladeshi side of the border, in Palong Khali district, saw several thousand people crossing from northern Rakhine on Monday, filing along embankments between flooded fields and scrubby forest.

“Half of my village was burnt down. I saw them do it,” said Sayed Azin, 46, who said he had walked for eight days carrying his 80-year-old mother in a basket strung on a bamboo pole between him and his son.

Soldiers and Buddhist mobs had torched his village, he said.

“I left everything,” he said, sobbing. “I can’t find my relatives ... I can’t take this any more.”

Some new arrivals spoke of bloody attacks by Buddhist mobs on people trekking toward the border.

Refugees and rights groups say the army and Buddhist vigilantes have engaged in a campaign of killing and arson aimed at driving the Rohingya out of Myanmar.

Myanmar rejects accusations of ethnic cleansing and has labeled the militants from the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army who launched the initial attacks as terrorists who have killed civilians and burnt villages.

Among those fleeing were up to 35 people on a boat that capsized off the Bangladesh coast on Sunday. At least 12 of them drowned while 13 were rescued, Bangladeshi police said.

“We faced so many difficulties, for food and survival,” Sayed Hossein, 30, told Reuters, adding that his wife, three children, mother and father in law had drowned.

“We came here to save our lives.”

“GETTING WORSE”

Myanmar leader and Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi has faced scathing international criticism for not doing more to stop the violence, although she has no power over the security forces under a military-drafted constitution.

The United States and EU have been considering targeted sanctions against Myanmar military leaders, diplomats and officials have told Reuters, though they are wary of action that could destabilize the country’s transition to democracy.

EU foreign ministers will discuss the situation in Myanmar on Oct. 16, and their draft joint statement said the bloc “will suspend invitations to the commander-in-chief of the Myanmar/Burma armed forces and other senior military officers”.

Such a move would be largely symbolic, but could be followed by further action.

The Myanmar government has said its “clearance operations” against the militants ended in early September and people had no reason to flee. But in recent days the government has reported large numbers of Muslims preparing to leave, with more than 17,000 people in one area alone.

The government cited worries about food and security as their reasons.

Some villagers in Rakhine said food was running out because rice in the fields was not ready for harvest and the state government had closed village markets and restricted the transport of food, apparently to cut supplies to the militants.

“The situation’s getting worse. We have no food and no guarantee of security,” said a Rohingya resident of Hsin Hnin Pyar village on the south of the state’s Buthidaung district.

He said a lot of people were preparing to flee.

Slideshow (19 Images)

“While the Myanmar military has engaged in a campaign of violence, there is mounting evidence that Rohingya women, men and children are now also fleeing the very real threat of starvation,” rights group Amnesty International said.

Senior state government official Kyaw Swar Tun declined to go into details when asked about the food, except to ask: “Have you heard of anyone dying of hunger in Buthidaung?”

The reports of food shortages will add to the urgency of calls by aid agencies and the international community for unfettered humanitarian access to the conflict zone.

COMING, GOING

The insurgents declared a one-month ceasefire from Sept. 10 to enable the delivery of aid but the government rebuffed them, saying it did not negotiate with terrorists.

The ceasefire is due to end at midnight on Monday, but the insurgents said in a statement they were ready to respond to any peace move by the government.

The ability of the group to mount any sort of challenge to the army is unclear, but it does not appear to have been able to put up resistance to the latest military offensive.

Bangladesh was already home to 400,000 Rohingya who had fled earlier bouts of violence.

Mostly Buddhist Myanmar does not recognize the Rohingya as citizens, even though many have lived there for generations.

But even as refugees arrive, Bangladesh insists they will all have to go home. Myanmar has responded by saying it will take back those who can be verified as genuine refugees.

Many Rohingya fear they will not be able to prove their right to return.

(Reuters) - Rory McIlroy has set his sights on becoming the best non-American golfer of all time and plans to return stronger than ever after completing an injury-marred season that has seen the Briton drop to sixth in the world rankings.

After winning the PGA Tour’s FedEx Cup last year, McIlroy’s campaign was stalled by two separate injury layoffs and he signed off for the season in a tie for 63rd at the European Tour’s Alfred Dunhill Links Championship on Sunday.

The 28-year-old four-time major champion, who will now take a three-month winter break, said his first target would be to complete the career grand slam, which can be achieved next April at the U.S. Masters.

“And then, try and become the best European golfer ever. Try and surpass (Briton) Nick Faldo (who won six majors) in that,” he told British media.

“If I had a career goal, it would be to be the best international golfer ever. Gary Player has nine majors. I’d like to think I‘m going to give myself a chance to get close to that tally,” added the former world number one.

McIlroy will look to use his time off the course to fully recover from rib and back injuries that plagued him all season.

“My last round of 2017 sort of summed up all of 2017. Not much happening, good or bad. Just sort of stuck in neutral,” he said after signing for a level-par 72 at St Andrews.

”It hasn’t been the year I wanted on the golf course. I started with grand ambitions of trying to add to my major tally and trying to win golf tournaments.

“I haven’t won and the results haven’t been what I wanted, but I feel like I can still salvage something from the rest of this year, even though I‘m not playing. I’ve given myself an opportunity to put a lot of good foundations in place.”

McIlroy last went winless in 2008, a year after he turned professional as an 18-year-old. However, he said he was a better player now than he was in 2011 and 2012, when he won majors.

BARCELONA/MADRID (Reuters) - Catalonia’s secessionist leader came under intense pressure on Monday to abandon plans to declare independence from Spain after hundreds of thousands of unionists took to the streets at the weekend to protest against the region breaking away.

Spain fears the Catalan parliament will vote for independence on Tuesday, when Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont is due to address the assembly in the wake of a banned Oct. 1 referendum in which Catalan officials say people voted overwhelmingly for secession.

Under Catalonia’s referendum law, deemed unconstitutional by Madrid, a vote for independence on Tuesday would start a six-month process that would envisage divorce talks with Spain before regional elections and a final act of separation.

But the Spanish government, buoyed by Sunday’s protests in Barcelona, the Catalan capital, made it clear on Monday it would respond immediately to any such vote.

“I‘m calling on the sensible people in the Catalan government...don’t jump off the edge because you’ll take the people with you,” Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaría said in an interview with COPE radio station.

“If there is a unilateral declaration of independence there will be decisions made to restore law and democracy.”

Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has not ruled out removing Catalonia’s government and calling new regional elections if it claims independence.

The stakes are high for Spain as it faces its biggest political crisis since it became a democracy four decades ago.

Losing Catalonia, which has its own language and culture, would deprive Spain of a fifth of its economic output and more than a quarter of exports. A stream of Catalonia-based firms and banks have moved their legal bases outside the region.

The crisis has also reopened old divisions in a nation where fascism is a living memory easily revived by strong displays of nationalism.

Among many moderate Spaniards, though, there is widespread opposition to a breakaway, including in Catalonia. Most of the region’s unionists boycotted the Oct. 1 referendum, which was banned by Madrid and marred by a violent police crackdown.

The European Union has also shown no interest in an independent Catalonia, despite an appeal by Puigdemont for Brussels to mediate in the crisis.

France, which borders Catalonia, said on Monday it would not recognise a unilateral independence declaration.

On Sunday, a crowd estimated by local police to number 350,000, took to the streets of the Catalan capital Barcelona, waving Spanish and Catalan flags and carrying banners saying “Catalonia is Spain” and “Together we are stronger”.

The show of support for Madrid helped calm Spanish markets on Monday, along with comments on Friday from credit rating agencies Moody's and DBRS that they expected Spain to remain united. Spanish borrowing costs fell to a one-week low and the main share index .IBEX touched a week high.

PROTESTS, NO TALKS

With Puigdemont under pressure to back down, there is speculation he may baulk at moving an independence motion on Tuesday and call snap regional polls, turning them into a de facto, legal referendum on independence.

But Puigdemont appeared resolute in a TV interview on Sunday, saying the region’s referendum law called for a declaration of independence in the event of a “yes” vote.

“We will apply what the law says,” he said, according to a partial transcript released by TV3.

Catalan authorities say about 90 percent of those who voted on Oct. 1 backed secession, but opinion polls suggest the region is more closely divided. Referendum turn-out was 43 percent.

Sunday’s anti-independence demonstration, which included Catalans and people from other parts of Spain, underlined how the dispute has riven the region itself. A month ago, a million people rallied in the city to support independence.

“We feel both Catalan and Spanish,” Araceli Ponze, 72, said during Sunday’s rally. “We are facing a tremendous unknown. We will see what happens this week but we have to speak out very loudly so they know what we want.”

Puigdemont will address the Catalan parliament at 6 p.m. (1600 GMT) on Tuesday on “the current political situation” amid speculation he could ask the assembly to declare independence.

Puigdemont said on Sunday he had not been in contact with the Madrid government for some time because it refused to discuss independence.

“What is happening in Catalonia is real, whether they like it or not. Millions of people have voted, who want to decide. We have to talk about this,” he said.

Rajoy has said repeatedly he will not talk to the Catalan leaders unless they drop their plans to declare independence.

Madrid sent thousands of national police to the region to prevent the vote. About 900 people were injured when officers used rubber bullets and batons against voters in scenes that shocked Spain and the world, and escalated the dispute.

The political stand-off has pushed banks and companies to move their legal headquarters outside Catalonia.

The boards of Catalonia-based infrastructure firm Abertis (ABE.MC), telecoms company Cellnex (CLNX.MC) and property group Inmobiliaria Colonial (COL.MC) will meet on Monday to discuss moving, sources said.

LONDON (Reuters) - World shares rose on Monday, with Chinese stocks hitting 21-month highs and the German index setting a new record, while political uncertainty triggered big moves in sterling, the Turkish lira and Spanish debt.

Wall Street looked set to open higher, with e-mini futures on the S&P 500 index ESc1 up 0.2 percent and signaling a rebound from Friday’s fall after six days of gains.

European shares rose. The pan-European STOXX 600 index added 0.3 percent and Germany's DAX .GDAXI touched an all-time high after data showing industrial output far overshot forecasts.

Spanish shares outperformed, rising 0.6 percent, and Spain’s government bond yields fell after a big show of support for the country remaining together and against Catalan independence appeared to calm markets.

Hundreds of thousands demonstrated on Sunday in the Catalan capital Barcelona, carrying banners saying “Catalonia is Spain” and “Together we are stronger”. Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont was due to address the regional parliament on Tuesday on “the current political situation”.

“There is hope in the markets that independence will not be declared and the worst case will be avoided,” Gautam Batra, head of investments at Mediolanum Asset Management, told Reuters.

Spain’s 10-year bond yield ES10YT=TWEB fell 6.4 basis points at 1.65 percent.

On their first day of trade after a week-long holiday, Chinese blue-chip stocks .CSI300 touched their highest levels since late 2015, partly in a delayed reaction to a targeted cut in the amount of cash some banks must hold in reserve announced a week ago. The index closed up 1.2 percent.

Last week’s targeted rate cut outweighed data on Monday, showing activity in China’s service sector grew in September at its slowest since December 2015.

HOLIDAYS

U.S. stocks are due to trade on Monday, although the bond market is closed for a holiday. Tokyo markets are also shut.

The dollar fell 0.1 percent against a basket of currencies .DXY. The greenback was all but flat against the Japanese yen on concerns that North Korea was preparing a new missile test.

The yen was last at 112.69 per dollar JPY=, having fallen as low as 113.44 per dollar last week. The euro edged up 0.1 percent to $1.1742 EUR=.

The Turkish lira fell as much as 2.5 percent against the dollar TRYTOM=D3 and Istanbul stocks .XU100 fell 4 percent after the United States and Turkey cut back visa services in a sharp deterioration in relations.

The lira last traded at 3.7060 per dollar, down 2.5 percent on the day, and stocks were down 3.1 percent.

A U.S. consulate employee was arrested last week on charges of links to U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, blamed by Ankara for last year’s failed military coup. Washington condemned the arrest as baseless.

“Turkey’s economy, especially the private sector, significantly relies on USD funding, the disruption of which can cause economic and financial disarray to Turkey” analysts at TD securities said in a note.

Sterling rose 0.9 percent to $1.3173 on reports that British Prime Minister Theresa May, facing threats to oust her, might sack her foreign minister, Boris Johnson.

“If Boris Johnson were to leave or be demoted as the weekend press is suggesting, that would be showing May’s leadership and that her vision of Brexit is the one that (the government) will be going forward with and that markets should be aligned to,” said Viraj Patel, an FX strategist at ING Bank in London.

Speculative investors’ bets on a stronger pound reached their highest in three years in the week to Oct. 3, data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed.

Gold XAU= hit a one-week high as tension over North Korea saw some investors seek safety in the metal. It rose 0.6 percent to nearly $1,283 an ounce.

Relations between Ankara and Washington have been plagued by disputes over U.S. support for Kurdish fighters in Syria, Turkey’s calls for the extradition of a U.S.-based cleric and the indictment of a Turkish former minister in a U.S. court.

But last week’s arrest of a Turkish employee of the U.S. consulate in Istanbul marked a fresh low. Turkey said the employee had links to U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, blamed by Ankara for a failed military coup in July 2016.

The U.S. embassy in Ankara condemned those charges as baseless and announced on Sunday night it was halting all non-immigrant visa services in Turkey while it reassessed Turkey’s commitment to the security of its missions and staff.

Within hours, Ankara announced it was taking the same measures against U.S. citizens seeking visas for Turkey.

On Monday the Turkish foreign ministry summoned a U.S. diplomat to urge the United States to lift the visa suspension, saying it was causing “unnecessary tensions”.

Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gul said that if Washington had serious security concerns about its missions in Turkey, steps would be taken to address them.

“But if it’s an issue regarding the arrest of the consulate employee, then this is a decision the Turkish judiciary has made,” Gul told A Haber television. “Trying a Turkish citizen for a crime committed in Turkey is our right.”

State-run Anadolu news agency said another U.S. consulate worker had been summoned to testify over his wife and daughter’s suspected links to Gulen - which it said had emerged during the questioning of Metin Topuz, the employee arrested last week.

The main BIST 100 stock index fell as much as 4.7 percent, closing the day down 2.73 percent at 101,298 points.

Airline shares were particularly hard hit, with flag carrier Turkish Airlines falling 9 percent.

The central bank said it was following developments closely.

“This looks like a really serious situation,” said Blue Bay Asset Management strategist Timothy Ash, adding that the central bank would need to move quickly to calm market nerves and possibly hike interest rates - something President Tayyip Erdogan has resisted.

Turkey’s leading business association, TUSIAD, warned that the dispute would harm bilateral economic, social and cultural ties, and called for disagreements to be settled calmly.

The dispute with the United States coincides with deep strains in Turkey’s relations with Germany, another key ally, and with Turkish military activity at the Syrian and Iraqi borders, though their market impact has so far been limited.

U.S.-Turkish tensions have risen in recent months over U.S. military support for Kurdish YPG fighters in Syria, considered by Ankara to be an extension of the banned PKK which has waged an insurgency for three decades in southeast Turkey.

Turkey has also pressed, so far in vain, for the United States to extradite Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, viewed in Ankara as the mastermind behind the failed coup in which more than 240 people were killed. Gulen denies any involvement.

Friction with the United States has also arisen from the indictment last month by a U.S. court of Turkey’s former economy minister Zafer Caglayan, charged with conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran.

Sinan Ulgen, an analyst and former Turkish diplomat, said those underlying disputes had created a crisis of confidence which made this latest fallout particularly bitter.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada will pay up to C$750 million ($598 million) in compensation to thousands of aboriginals who were removed as children from their families decades ago, a top official said on Friday, promising to end “a terrible legacy.”

The move is the latest bid by the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to repair ties with Canada’s often-marginalized indigenous population, which says it has been the victim of systemic racism for centuries.

In the so-called “Sixties Scoop,” welfare authorities took around 20,000 aboriginal children from their homes between the 1960s and 1980s and placed them in foster care or allowed them to be adopted by non-indigenous families.

The compensation package is designed to settle many of the lawsuits launched by survivors, who say the forced removal deprived them of their heritage and led to mental disorders, substance abuse and suicide.

“Language and culture, apology, healing -- these are essential elements to begin to right the wrong of this dark and painful chapter,” said Carolyn Bennett, the federal minister in charge of relations with the indigenous population.

Canada’s 1.4 million aboriginals, who make up about 4 percent of the population, experience higher levels of poverty and incarceration and have a lower life expectancy than other Canadians. They are often victims of violent crime and addiction.

Indigenous activists complain Trudeau has broken repeated promises to improve their lives since taking office in late 2015. He reshuffled his cabinet in August to put more emphasis on helping aboriginal people.

Bennett, at times fighting back tears, told a news conference she had heard “truly heartbreaking stories” about loss of identity and alienation.

Marcia Brown Martel, an aboriginal chief who led the campaign for compensation, lamented the “stealing of children” and noted some of those involved lived as far away as New Zealand.

“Think of it as a puzzle, a great big puzzle. Pieces, people are missing,” she told reporters.

Trudeau and other Canadian leaders have already apologized for the many abuses committed over a 150-year period when 150,000 aboriginal children were forcibly separated from their parents and sent to church-run residential schools.

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI (Reuters) - India’s festive season should be a time of celebration for textiles businessman Habib Ansari, who usually spends October counting a boom in profits from supplying retailers ahead of a month of peak shopping.

This year Ansari is grappling with losses, and blames a 50 percent drop in sales in the last three months on confusion wrought by the July launch of a national sales tax and the after-effects of a government crackdown on untaxed wealth.

“Small garment units are not buying due to weak demand. We have cut down our workforce to 600 from 1200,” Ansari said from a textiles hub outside Mumbai, as laid off labourers napped in nearby warehouses.

Ansari’s woes highlight how Asia’s third-largest economy has cooled rapidly over five consecutive quarters as small and -medium-sized businesses across India report tumbling sales, undermining job creation and damaging sentiment in industries crucial to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s political powerbase.

That has pushed Modi into a tight corner - stepping up stimulus could reduce political damage ahead of a round of state elections beginning in December but shatter the confidence of investors worried about fiscal slippage.

The government is considering spending between 400 to 500 billion rupees ($7.7 billion) more this financial year than it had budgeted for, two senior finance ministry officials told Reuters.

New Delhi has already cut petrol and diesel taxes, but the focus now is on whether to spend more money on rural jobs, housing and recapitalisation of state-run banks, or to give targeted relief to sectors hit hardest by sliding growth, the officials said.

“We face our toughest challenge in three years,” said a government official, adding fiscal consolidation was under pressure amid slowing revenue receipts.

The economy grew at an annual 5.7 percent year-on-year in the three months to end-June, its slowest in three years, while tax collection is falling - a turnaround from a year ago when India boasted the fastest growth among major economies.

POLITICAL DAMAGE

People close to Modi, who romped to power in a landslide victory for his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 2014, say he wants to control the political damage and ensure the economic slowdown remains temporary.

Two BJP grandees, Yashwant Sinha, an ex-finance minister, and Arun Shourie, a former cabinet minister, have been critical of Modi’s recent handling of economic reforms.

But the prime minister has to walk a tight rope as pandering to populist policies could risk damaging investor confidence. The BJP has won praise from investors after trimming the fiscal deficit from 4.5 percent of GDP in 2013/14.

When the government last month hinted at more spending, India’s stock market skidded for seven consecutive days and the rupee dropped to its lowest level in six months as investors worried about the impact on public debt.

On Sept. 28, the government decided against announcing more borrowing and maintained a target for the 2017/18 financial year in line with a deficit of 3.2 percent, a move welcomed by markets.

Modi could seek parliament’s approval for up to 500 billion rupees in extra spending over the budgeted spending, the two finance ministry officials said, which could widen the fiscal deficit to a three-year high of around 3.7 percent of GDP.

India’s former chief economist, Arvind Virmani, told Reuters there was no scope for additional spending.

SMALL BUSINESS CRUNCHED

Acknowledging the slide in sentiment, Modi took the rare step last week of defending his record in a 90-minute speech, calling the economic slowdown a blip, and promising relief.

Small and medium-sized businesses across India are meanwhile cutting staff because of falling demand.

The launch in July of the long-awaited Goods and Service Tax (GST), which transformed India’s 29 states into a single customs union, has left firms at the bottom of the supply chain short of working capital.

That came on top of Modi’s “demonetisation” decision last November, in which he suddenly banned high-denomination banknotes to force people to declare illicit or untaxed wealth.

Smaller enterprises accustomed to dealing entirely in cash are now required to register themselves under the GST and to file tax returns.

Rashid Tahir Momin, treasurer of the Bhiwandi Powerloom Weavers Federation, said more than 200,000 people have lost their jobs since July in the textiles hub outside Mumbai.

Previously exempt of tax or taxed at lower rates, the requirement to pay higher taxes and then claim them back has left the government owing $10 billion to the textiles, jewellery and other exporting industries.

On Friday, the government announced it would ease tax rules to help smaller businesses.

Narendra Jadhav, a lawmaker close to Modi, said the government was operating with “a great sense of urgency” to resolve the problems faced by the small and medium enterprises.

“Complaints are being noted and addressed. We are committed to bring about structural changes, create jobs and improve infrastructure,“ Jadhav said.

FISCAL STABILITY

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had estimated a 16.4 percent rise in tax receipts to $188.7 billion this year, but the government faces a shortfall of up to 1 trillion rupees following the GST launch, one of the two finance ministry officials said.

India’s fiscal deficit including federal and state borrowing is close to 6 percent, and the central bank governor, Urjit Patel, warned this month that further widening could hit fiscal stability.

Mahesh Vyas, head of the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, said that 500 billion rupees ($7.65 billion) of extra spending would not be sufficient to turn the economy round.

“The government should send a clear message whether it wants to provide a stimulus or not,” he said.

“The uncertainty is hitting markets and any small stimulus would just be a waste of money.”

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s Prince Harry said on Monday the mental health of serving soldiers was as important as ensuring they were ready to take part in conflicts.

He was speaking as he launched a new partnership between Britain’s Ministry of Defence (MoD) and the younger royals’ charity.

Harry, who spent 10 years in the military, including two tours of Afghanistan, joined forces with Britain’s Defence Secretary Michael Fallon to promote a new initiative to offer mental health support to those in the armed forces, their families and veterans.

“Crucially, fighting fitness is not just about physical fitness. It is just as much about mental fitness too,” Harry said.

The new partnership will see the Royal Foundation, established by Harry, his elder brother Prince William and William’s wife Kate to support their chosen charities, provide advice and resources to the MoD to raise awareness of good mental health and improve training, education and information sharing.

“Our soldiers, sailors and airmen are the best in the world but we will only maintain that if we are as serious about improving mental health as we are our combat skills and cutting-edge technology,” Fallon said.

A year ago, the probability that North Korea would fire a nuclear-tipped missile at the United States was essentially zero; the North did not have the capability to make such an attack. Pyongyang has made technological advances since then.

But despite what some analysts believe, others say there is no definitive, publicly available proof that North Korea has a missile with the range to strike the continental United States, a miniaturized nuclear warhead to mate with it, and the shielding technology to make sure the warhead survives the heat and pressure of reentry to the atmosphere.

That doesn't, of course, mean the show is harmless. But even if the North acquires those technical capabilities, the likelihood it might attack the United States with a nuclear missile will remain exceedingly low, for one overriding reason: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is, as former Obama administration arms control director Jon Wolfsthal has explained in authoritative detail, neither crazy nor suicidal. The North Korean leader knows his regime would be erased within hours (more likely minutes) of his use of a nuclear weapon. Roughly 1,590 nuclear warheads deployed on U.S. ballistic missiles and bombers ensure that result. (The North has acquired the fissile material to build only 10 to 20 nuclear warheads, according to the most authoritative public reporting on the subject.)

It is also quite unlikely that the United States will make a preemptive military strike — conventional or nuclear — on North Korea, because doing so would almost certainly lead to hundreds of thousands of casualties in South Korea, and perhaps many more. Even without recourse to nuclear weapons, the North could fire thousands of rockets and artillery rounds in the early hours of a war, in a barrage of conventional explosives that would, as the North Korean state-run news service has threatened, turn Seoul into a “sea of fire.” Pyongyang also has huge stores of chemical artillery shells and rocket warheads and the capability, therefore, to also turn the South Korean capital into a sea of sarin and VX nerve gas.

In light of the undeniable reality of mutual deterrence, the North Korean ""crisis"" of 2017 can most accurately be seen as a media puppet show put on by Chairman Kim and President Trump for their own public relations purposes. Nonetheless, it’s a dangerous play. In the current overheated media environment, some piece of international theater by Kim or Trump — undertaken for political effect or negotiating edge or ego gratification — could become so magnified by breathless, 24-7 repetition on cable TV and the Internet that it becomes seen as a humiliating national insult. An emotional response to that insult could initiate a spiral of escalation that leads to catastrophe. To put things in more concrete terms: if U.S. forces had shot down the North Korean missile recently fired through Japanese airspace, might Kim, in an act of pique or bravado, have fired another missile, perhaps in the general direction of Guam? Would Trump have then felt compelled to craft a macho response? Etcetera — with a possible end result of mushroom clouds.



The best way to reduce the threat of inadvertent war posed by the invented theatrical crisis in Northeast Asia would be to persuade the prime thespians — Kim and Trump — that the show they have been putting on is unbelievable and unlikely to get either what he wants. But I don’t really expect that my views will motivate two world leaders of high (if largely unearned) self-regard to quickly change their policies on matters of life, death, and television ratings.

So I propose a next-best approach: Journalists should stop writing and broadcasting about the North Korea situation as if everything had changed and war is very near. North Korea has been seeking a usable nuclear arsenal for years. Its latest underground nuclear test had a higher yield than earlier detonations, producing the explosive power of somewhat more than 100,000 tons of TNT, meaning it was four to five times the size of the bomb dropped on Nagasaki. The larger yield could have come from a fission bomb “boosted” with hydrogen isotopes or a true fusion weapon, commonly known as a hydrogen bomb; experts cannot be sure which, based on the information currently available.

But even if the September 3 test involved a true hydrogen bomb, Sig Hecker—former director of Los Alamos National Laboratory and one of the country’s foremost experts on North Korea’s nuclear program—has told the magazine I edit, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, that it wouldn’t be “a game changer.” If delivered to an American city, any North Korean nuclear bomb — whether based on nuclear fission or fusion, whether its yield is 20 or 100 or 800 kilotons — would produce devastation and the instant death of tens of thousands. That’s a devastating prospect. But again, North Korea’s leaders know that to fire a nuclear weapon at the United States or its allies would constitute certain national suicide.



Clearly, North Korean nuclear bomb and ballistic missile tests are important events that the international news media must report. But the urgency that world news media are imparting to the ""crisis"" is, actually, a factor in extending it, thereby creating opportunities for miscalculation and war. The North Korean situation might begin to devolve into the kind of long slog of difficult diplomacy that leads to an acceptable resolution if more journalists downplayed the Chairman Kim and President Trump Puppet Show and focused on reality: North Korea is a tiny, impoverished country that would be instantly vaporized if it ever launched a serious attack on the United States, and so the probability of such an attack is vanishingly small. Absent a media environment that encourages a perception of crisis, the likelihood of an American preemptive attack is equally small.

Journalists can’t make U.S. and North Korean leaders behave responsibly. But the media can help audiences understand that the Korean “crisis” is really a Korean standoff, and that a puppet show full of bluster is a rather pathetic substitute for professional diplomacy.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Re-testing of more than a thousand samples from the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics uncovered only one athlete to have taken banned substances, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Monday.

The IOC said it had conducted re-tests of 1,195 urine samples, including those of all medalists from the winter Games seven years ago as well as of all Russian athletes.

“Three adverse analytical findings, all coming from one athlete, are being taken forward for results management,” the IOC said in a statement. It did provide any details of the athlete in question, nor of his or her sport or nationality.

The low number of positive re-tests from Vancouver is in stark contrast with the results from samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics.

More than 100 athletes tested positive in total in those re-tests and some 75 medals had to be reallocated. More than 80 percent of those cases involved the sports of weightlifting and athletics.

“This wide-ranging re-analysis is another demonstration of the IOC’s commitment to fight against doping and to protect clean athletes,” IOC President Thomas Bach said.

“The Vancouver 2010 reanalysis program was done in full cooperation with the World Anti-Doping Agency and with the help and support of stakeholders such as International Federations and experts,” he added.

The IOC stores athletes’ samples for a decade as it looks to re-test them using newer methods or testing for substances that at the time of the competition were not yet known.

It has also started reanalyzing the samples of all Russian athletes from the 2014 Sochi Olympics as part of ongoing investigations into the country’s doping scandal and its alleged manipulation of athletes’ drugs samples during those Games.",Olympics: Only one athlete positive in Vancouver Games re-tests - IOC,https://www.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idCAKBN1CE1QL-OCASP

(Reuters) - Wall Street was little changed in late morning trading on Monday, as losses in healthcare stocks were offset by gains in technology shares, with the third-quarter earnings season looming.

U.S. stocks have been on a tear this year, hitting new records almost everyday in the past week, and the upcoming earnings reports will help justify the lofty valuations.

“The relatively high valuation, where the market is trading 17 to 18 times earnings, is merited by a very low interest rate environment,” said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.

“We are not danger yet if you keep your eye on rates.”

Overall, earnings at S&P 500 companies are expected to have increased 4.9 percent last quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data, down from the double-digit growth recorded in the first two quarters of this year.

Ten S&P 500 companies are expected to report earnings this week, including some of the biggest Wall Street banks. JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) and Citigroup (C.N) will report on Thursday.

At 11:00 a.m. ET (1500 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was up 5.13 points, or 0.02 percent, at 22,778.8, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was up 0.08 points, flat on a percentage basis, at 6,590.26. Both indexes hit record intraday highs.

The S&P 500 .SPX was down 1.76 points, or 0.07 percent, at 2,547.57, which is just 5 points shy of its record high. The benchmark's eight-day winning streak came to a halt on Friday due to weak jobs numbers.

Eight of the 11 major S&P indexes were higher, led by a 0.31 percent gain in the technology sector .SPLRCT. The healthcare index .SPXHC was down 0.56 percent.

GE shares (GE.N) sank 3 percent and was the top drag on the S&P after the conglomerate named a new CFO said it gave activist investment firm Trian Fund Management a board seat.

Medtronic (MDT.N) dropped about 4 percent after the medical device maker said Hurricane Maria hurt second-quarter earnings and sales.

DaVita (DVA.N) tumbled 7 percent, the most on the S&P, after JPMorgan cut its rating on the dialysis service provider, while Express Scripts (ESRX.O) fell 4.5 percent on a Raymond James downgrade.

Tesla (TSLA.O) fell 2.51 percent after pushing back the unveiling of the big rig truck to mid-November.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Meryl Streep, the most admired actress in the entertainment industry, on Monday criticized Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein for “inexcusable behavior” but said she was unaware of any talk about his alleged sexual harassment of women.

Streep, who has won three Oscars, had been under pressure to speak out after a New York Times investigation last week detailed claims by multiple women of unwanted physical contact and harassment by Weinstein over three decades.

Weinstein, 65, initially apologized but later threatened to sue. He was fired on Sunday as co-chairman of the Weinstein Co because of the fallout from the Times story but has not been charged with any crimes.

Streep, who in 2012 called Weinstein “God” in a Golden Globe acceptance speech and appeared in numerous films produced by him, said the “disgraceful news about Harvey Weinstein has appalled those of us whose work he championed.”

But Streep said in a statement to the Huffington Post that she did not know about the reported claims that he had undressed in front of actresses and assistants or asked young women to give him massages.

“Harvey supported the work fiercely, was exasperating but respectful with me in our working relationship, and with many others with whom he worked professionally,” Streep said.

“I did not know about his having meetings in his hotel room, his bathroom, or other inappropriate, coercive acts.”

Actresses Ashley Judd and Rose McGowan are among those who have said Weinstein sexually harassed them. Other Hollywood heavyweights, including director Judd Apatow and producer Megan Ellison, have spoken out in support of the women.

“The behavior is inexcusable, but the abuse of power familiar,” Steep said. “Each brave voice that is raised, heard and credited by our watchdog media will ultimately change the game.”

Weinstein, who produced or distributed Oscar-winning movies like “Shakespeare in Love” and “Chicago,” is the latest U.S. media or entertainment industry titan to face sexual harassment accusations.

At Fox News, late Chief Executive Officer Roger Ailes was forced out of the company in 2016 after being accused of sexual harassment, and popular anchor Bill O‘Reilly had to resign in April on similar grounds. Both denied the allegations.

The Madrid government, grappling with Spain’s biggest political crisis since an attempted military coup in 1981, made it clear on Monday it would respond immediately to any such unilateral declaration.

A week on from a referendum on independence which the government did its utmost to thwart, more signs were emerging that the fraught situation was also taking its toll on the business climate of Spain’s wealthiest region.

Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont is due to address the regional parliament on Tuesday afternoon and the Madrid government is worried it will vote for a unilateral declaration of independence.

Catalan officials say people voted overwhelmingly for secession in the ballot, which was declared illegal by the government and was marked by police violence against independence supporters.

But the issue has deeply divided the northeastern region itself as well the Spanish nation. Hundreds of thousands of unionists took to the streets of Barcelona at the weekend to protest against the region breaking away.

Buoyed by the show of support, Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaría said on Monday: “I‘m calling on the sensible people in the Catalan government... don’t jump off the edge because you’ll take the people with you.”

“If there is a unilateral declaration of independence there will be decisions made to restore law and democracy,” Saenz de Santamaría told COPE radio station.

Backing also came from European heavyweights Germany and France.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke to Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy on Saturday about the crisis, her spokesman said on Monday. She stressed her support for Spain’s unity but also encouraged more dialogue.

France said it would not recognize Catalonia if the region unilaterally declared independence. Doing so would lead to Catalonia’s automatic exit from the European Union, it said.

“This crisis needs to be resolved through dialogue at all levels of Spanish politics,” France’s European affairs minister Nathalie Loiseau said.

The European Union has shown no interest in an independent Catalonia, despite an appeal by Puigdemont for Brussels to mediate in the crisis.

NEW ELECTIONS?

Under Catalonia’s referendum law, deemed unconstitutional by Madrid, a vote for independence in the assembly on Tuesday would start a six-month process that would envisage divorce talks with Spain before regional elections and a final act of separation.

Rajoy has not ruled out the so-called “nuclear option” of removing Catalonia’s government and calling new regional elections if it claims independence.

He gained some political cover for such a move on Monday when opposition Socialist leader Pedro Sanchez said in Barcelona he would “support the response of the rule of law in the face of any attempt to break social harmony”.

Sanchez stopped short, however, of explicitly saying his party would back dissolving the regional parliament, a possibility written into the 1978 constitution.

Losing Catalonia, which has its own language and culture, would deprive Spain of a fifth of its economic output and more than a quarter of exports. A stream of Catalonia-based firms and banks have moved their legal bases outside the region.

The boards of Catalonia-based infrastructure firm Abertis (ABE.MC), telecoms company Cellnex (CLNX.MC) and property group Inmobiliaria Colonial (COL.MC) will meet on Monday to discuss moving, sources said.

Banks Caixabank (CABK.MC) and Sabadell (SABE.MC) have already resolved to leave the region.

The crisis has also reopened old divisions in a nation where the right-wing dictatorship of General Francisco Franco is a living memory easily revived by strong displays of nationalism.

Among many moderate Spaniards there is widespread opposition to a breakaway, including in Catalonia. Regional authorities say about 90 percent of those who voted in the referendum backed secession, but turnout was 43 percent, with most unionists boycotting it.

Sunday's demonstration in the Catalan capital helped calm Spanish markets on Monday, along with comments on Friday from credit rating agencies Moody's and DBRS that they expected Spain to remain united. Spanish borrowing costs fell to a one-week low and the main share index .IBEX touched a week high.

Puigdemont appeared resolute in a television interview on Sunday, saying the region’s referendum law called for a declaration of independence in the event of a “yes” vote.

“We will apply what the law says,” he told TV3.

Catalonia’s High Court asked for more security in case independence is declared, specifically drafting in the national police, who were called in to stop the referendum when the Catalan police force failed to act.

Madrid sent thousands of national police to the region to prevent the vote. About 900 people were injured when officers used rubber bullets and batons against voters in scenes that shocked Spain and the world, and escalated the dispute.

Under a blueprint for independence drawn up by the Catalan parliament last month, the High court would be turned into a new Supreme Court of Catalonia.

Puigdemont said on Sunday he had not been in contact with the Madrid government for some time because it refused to discuss independence.

“What is happening in Catalonia is real, whether they like it or not. Millions of people have voted, who want to decide. We have to talk about this,” he said.

BRUXELLES, 5 ottobre (Reuters) - Uno schema di garanzia europeo per i depositi bancari dovrebbe essere introdotto nella Ue più gradualmente di quanto programmato nel tentativo di ottenere il sostegno della Germania.

In una bozza, vista da Reuters, del documento che la Commissione europea presenterà la prossima settimana, si legge che lo schema di garanzia, conosciuto come Edis, potrebbe inizialmente dare sostegno solo per i depositi di banche fallite.

Il piano della Commissione, teso ad aumentare la stabilità finanziaria della zona euro, prevede che in un secondo tempo lo schema possa coprire le perdite.

Questa fase partirebbe solo dopo una sufficiente riduzione delle sofferenze da parte delle banche.

La Germania si sta opponendo da tempo a questo piano, temendo gli eccessivi costi per le banche tedesche.

Berlino si è sinora detta d‘accordo solo a uno schema sui depositi che li garantisca sino a 100.000 euro in tutta la zona euro, a condizione di una preliminare riduzione dei rischi di fallimento bancari.

Per questo è necessaria in alcuni paesi una significativa riduzione delle sofferenze del settore bancario, attualmente elevate. La Commissione ha dichiarato che la prossima primavera presenterà proposte per rendere più facile il recupero dei debiti.

La Commissione proporrà anche lo sviluppo del mercato secondario degli Npl, facilitandone la vendita.

Bruxelles sta anche considerando “livelli minimi di accantonamento che le banche dovranno fare per gli Npl”, misura che ridurrebbe i rischi da Npl ma aumenterebbe gli oneri delle banche.

Nel documento di 17 pagine la Commissione propone poi che la Bce, attualmente supervisore di 130 banche della zona euro, estenda i suoi poteri di vigilanza alle maggiori banche d‘affari e ai più grandi fondi.

Per ridurre i rischi legati ai fallimenti bancari la migliore opzione, per Bruxelles, continua a essere rappresentata dal Meccanismo europeo di stabilità (Esm) come paracadute per il Fondo di risoluzione unica che finanzia le risoluzioni bancarie.

La Commissione sta considerando di introdurre nel 2018 il quadro legale per abs con al loro interno titoli di Stato, proposta tesa a ridurre i rischi legati all‘eccessiva esposizione bancaria al debito sovrano stesso.

A Espanha teme que o Parlamento catalão vote pela independência na terça-feira, quando Puigdemont deve discursar à Assembleia na esteira do referendo de 1º de outubro, no qual as autoridades catalãs disseram que a maioria da população votou a favor da independência

Pela lei do referendo da Catalunha, que Madri considerou inconstitucional, uma votação a favor da independência na terça-feira iniciaria um processo de seis meses que contemplaria conversas com a Espanha sobre a divisão antes de eleições regionais e um ato final de separação.

Mas o governo espanhol, estimulado pelos protestos de domingo em Barcelona, a capital catalã, deixou claro nesta segunda-feira que reagirá imediatamente a qualquer votação deste tipo.

“Estou pedindo às pessoas sensatas do governo catalão... não saltem do precipício porque levarão as pessoas com vocês”, disse a vice-primeira-ministra espanhola, Soraya Sáenz de Santamaría, em uma entrevista à rádio Cope.

“Se houver uma declaração unilateral de independência, serão tomadas decisões para restaurar a lei e a democracia”.

O premiê espanhol, Mariano Rajoy, não descartou destituir o governo da Catalunha e convocar eleições regionais se a região reivindicar a independência.

As apostas são altas, uma vez que a Espanha enfrenta sua maior crise política desde que voltou a ser uma democracia quatro décadas atrás.

Perder a Catalunha, que tem língua e cultura próprias, privaria a Espanha de um quinto de sua produção econômica e mais de um quarto de suas exportações. Diversas empresas e bancos sediados em solo catalão já transferiram suas bases legais para outras regiões.

A crise também ressuscitou divisões antigas em uma nação na qual o fascismo é uma lembrança viva que vem à tona facilmente diante de demonstrações contundentes do nacionalismo.

TUNIS (Reuters) - The U.N. migration agency said on Monday it was trying to provide assistance to large numbers of migrants who had been held in the smuggling hub of Sabratha as rival factions battled for control of the city.

At least 4,000 migrants, including pregnant women, newborn babies and unaccompanied children, have been transferred from informal camps and dormitories to a hangar in the city since the clashes ended on Friday, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said.

Sabratha has been the most common point of departure for mostly sub-Saharan African migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean by boat from Libya.

But the number of crossings dropped sharply in July after an armed group struck a deal with officials from the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli to block departures, under pressure from Italy and other European Union member states.

That set off three weeks of fighting among rival factions which ended with the withdrawal of the armed group. The migrants who have since been rounded up were being held at sites that the group had controlled, local officials said.

“We are seriously concerned by the large number of migrants caught up in recent developments in Sabratha,” Othman Belbeisi, IOM Libya Chief of Mission, said in a statement.

Some migrants are being sent on to detention centers elsewhere in western Libya that are nominally under the control of the Tripoli government.

IOM officials say those centers, which were housing some 5,000 migrants, risk being overwhelmed by the new arrivals. Conditions in the centers are often dire and abuse widespread.

“Alternatives to detention must be found for migrants in Libya. In the meantime, IOM continues to provide direct humanitarian, health and psychosocial assistance to meet the urgent needs of the thousands of migrants being affected,” Belbeisi said.

Local sources have previously said that an estimated 10,000 migrants were being held in the Sabratha area.

LONDON (Reuters) - Protecting Britain from cyber crime is as important as defending it against terrorism, the head of Britain’s GCHQ spy agency said on Monday.

Britain has suffered a number of high-profile cyber attacks this year, including one in May on the state-run National Health Service which crippled some computer systems and caused huge disruption, and another on parliament in June.

Writing in the Daily Telegraph newspaper, Jeremy Fleming, said the speed of technological advances, whilst providing great opportunities for businesses, individuals and countries, was also giving enemies new means to threaten the nation’s security.

“If GCHQ is to continue to help keep the country safe, then protecting the digital homeland -- keeping our citizens safe and free online -- must become and remain as much part of our mission as our global intelligence reach and our round-the-clock efforts against terrorism.”

The National Cyber Security Centre, which is part of GCHQ, said last week it had dealt with almost 600 significant incidents which required a nationwide, coordinated response.

In July, Fleming’s predecessor at GCHQ, Robert Hannigan, said Russia was causing cyberspace mayhem and should face retaliation if it continued to undermine democratic institutions in the West.

Fleming said that Britons benefited greatly from the ease and speed of connections and from the security provided by default encryption.

“Hostile states, terrorists and criminals use those same features... to undermine our national security, attack our interests and, increasingly, commit crime,” he said.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Meryl Streep, the most admired actress in the entertainment industry, on Monday criticized Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein for “inexcusable behavior” but said she was unaware of any talk about his alleged sexual harassment of women.

Streep, who has won three Oscars, had been under pressure to speak out after a New York Times investigation last week detailed claims by multiple women of unwanted physical contact and harassment by Weinstein over three decades.

Weinstein, 65, initially apologized but later threatened to sue. He was fired on Sunday as co-chairman of the Weinstein Co because of the fallout from the Times story but has not been charged with any crimes.

Streep, who in 2012 called Weinstein “God” in a Golden Globe acceptance speech and appeared in numerous films produced by him, said the “disgraceful news about Harvey Weinstein has appalled those of us whose work he championed.”

But Streep said in a statement to the Huffington Post that she did not know about the reported claims that he had undressed in front of actresses and assistants or asked young women to give him massages.

“Harvey supported the work fiercely, was exasperating but respectful with me in our working relationship, and with many others with whom he worked professionally,” Streep said.

“I did not know about his having meetings in his hotel room, his bathroom, or other inappropriate, coercive acts.”

Actresses Ashley Judd and Rose McGowan are among those who have said Weinstein sexually harassed them. Other Hollywood heavyweights, including director Judd Apatow and producer Megan Ellison, have spoken out in support of the women.

“The behavior is inexcusable, but the abuse of power familiar,” Steep said. “Each brave voice that is raised, heard and credited by our watchdog media will ultimately change the game.”

Weinstein, who produced or distributed Oscar-winning movies like “Shakespeare in Love” and “Chicago,” is the latest U.S. media or entertainment industry titan to face sexual harassment accusations.

At Fox News, late Chief Executive Officer Roger Ailes was forced out of the company in 2016 after being accused of sexual harassment, and popular anchor Bill O‘Reilly had to resign in April on similar grounds. Both denied the allegations.

(Reuters) - With a businessman turned politician now in the Oval Office, a small but growing number of bankers and Wall Street financiers across the United States have set their sights on politics.

In New Jersey, Connecticut and California, former bankers, hedge fund managers and private equity executives have either announced bids for legislative and gubernatorial seats, or associates have told Reuters they are considering running.

Meanwhile, industry trade groups including the American Bankers Association are launching formal programs to teach members in various states how to campaign successfully.

It is not the first time well-heeled candidates have entered American politics, and there are not a great number of them. But historians, political scientists and bankers say the atmosphere has changed abruptly under President Donald Trump.

“It’s certainly raised the visibility of folks who in the past may have said ‘I‘m not a politician,” said Richard Baier, president of the Nebraska Bankers Association, which is launching a training school for potential legislative candidates. “We’ve shown that you don’t really need that background.”

The Oklahoma Bankers Association is also planning to launch its own candidate school, a spokesman said.

Foreclosures, job losses and growing income inequality after the 2007-2009 financial crisis made anyone with Wall Street ties into a political pariah. But Trump, a self-described billionaire who made a fortune in New York real estate and entertainment, has stocked his cabinet with Wall Street bankers and industry tycoons.

His presidency has inspired others in the financial community to pursue civic duty, according to people who have studied campaigns or are involved with current election efforts.

Trump’s ascendance shows that candidates’ backgrounds matter less than whether they can connect with voters, said Joshua Sandman, a political science professor at the University of New Haven.

“Trump running has encouraged more people in financial services to test the waters,” he said, “but the water could be murky for them unless they have a real set of positive experiences within business and are reflective of creating jobs and helping people.”

It is hard to say quantitatively whether more candidates with finance backgrounds are pursuing political office now compared with prior election cycles. But Paul Herrnson, a political science professor at the University of Connecticut who has researched candidates’ backgrounds, says he is sceptical about how successful the new crop of candidates will be.

“Sure, the mood is better than it was when the market collapsed, but I don’t think people say, ‘Wall Street financier – that’s someone I can vote for,” he said.

Phil Murphy, the Democratic candidate for New Jersey governor in 2017, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc executive who spent 23 years at the firm, is perhaps the most prominent moneyed candidate.

His campaign has focussed on bolstering the middle class with proposals to create a millionaire’s tax and launch other initiatives to help low-income residents.

Murphy has won support from labour unions, environmental groups and consumer rights activists, as well as bold-faced names in the Democratic party like former Vice Presidents Joe Biden and Al Gore, who have both endorsed him.

FILE PHOTO: American environmentalist Tom Steyer speaks at the Netroots Nation annual conference for political progressives in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S. August 12, 2017. REUTERS/Christopher Aluka Berry/File Photo

An Oct. 3 Monmouth University Poll has him leading his Republican rival, Kim Guadagno by 14 points, and over 60 percent of New Jersey voters said Murphy’s ties to Goldman do not matter in a recent Quinnipiac Poll.

“Obviously Goldman was his career,” said Tony Bianchini, spokesman for the Northeast Regional Council of Carpenters, which is backing Murphy. “Everyone has a career.”

In Connecticut, former UBS Group AG executive Robert Stefanowski is running for governor, according to a public filing, and hedge fund manager David Stemerman recently said he may do the same.

The two Republicans have given few clues about their campaign strategies other than to cast themselves as outsiders who can fix Connecticut’s problems.

In California, two Wall Street veterans are mulling runs as progressive Democrats.

DETROIT (Reuters) - No. 1 U.S. automaker General Motors Co (GM.N) said on Monday it would buy Strobe Inc, which uses LIDAR technology to help self-driving cars identify objects at a distance, to speed up development of autonomous vehicles and slash sensor costs.

LIDAR is one of the major sensor technologies used in autonomous, or self-driving vehicles, and there is fierce competition between large automakers to bring the cars to market first.

Fully self-driving vehicles are expected to hit the market in a limited form by around 2020. GM and its U.S. rival Ford Motor Co (F.N) have both publicly stated that they aim to have fully self-driving cars on sale by 2021.

”This acquisition is a game changer for GM and Cruise,“ because of the cost savings it will bring,” Kyle Vogt, chief executive of GM’s Cruise Automation unit, said.

“We’ve made this acquisition because we aim to speed our path to market,” he added.

Strobe’s new microchip LIDAR system would significantly enhance the capabilities of the self-driving cars GM was developing, Vogt said in a blog post and on a conference call with reporters.

By reducing the entire sensor down to a single chip, Strobe’s system should reduce the cost of each LIDAR on its self-driving cars by 99 percent, he said.

The technology provided not just a distance measurement for an object on the road - vehicles, people and objects - but also measured that object’s velocity.

“This is really important for self-driving cars, especially in challenging situations,” Vogt said.

Vogt did not disclose financial terms, but said 11 full-time Strobe employees would join Cruise as part of the deal.

He said last week that the unit was making “rapid progress” toward deploying self-driving cars in part through testing vehicles on the crowded streets of San Francisco.

Influential in the field of behavioral economics, his research showed how traits such as lack of self-control and fear of losing what you already have prompt decisions that may not have the best outcome in the longer term.

“I think the most important impact (of my research) is the recognition that economic agents are human and economic models have to incorporate that,” Thaler, a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, said in call broadcast at the Nobel news conference.

Awarding the 9 million Swedish crown ($1.1 million) prize, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said: “Richard Thaler’s contributions have built a bridge between the economic and psychological analyses of individual decision-making.”

“His empirical findings and theoretical insights have been instrumental in creating the new and rapidly expanding field of behavioral economics, which has had a profound impact on many areas of economic research and policy.”

Thaler brought to prominence the idea of “nudge” economics, where individuals are subtly guided toward beneficial behaviors without heavy-handed compulsion, the theme of a 2008 book he co-wrote which caught the eye of policymakers around the world.

In researching how self-control - or the lack of it - Thaler touched on an age-old problem: why New Year’s resolutions to change aspects of your life are notoriously hard to keep.

The issue has relevance for economics as individuals’ tendency to fall prey to temptation often negatively affects plans to, for instance, save for retirement.

Together with Professor Cass Sunstein, he argued that society - while maintaining freedom of choice - should actively try to guide individuals in the right direction.

Their book, titled ‘Nudge: Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth, and Happiness’ became popular with some western politicians seeking ways to encourage their citizens to save and live healthily, without incurring voters’ wrath for raising taxes or banning behavior outright.

“This has also been used in public pension systems in the United States and the general idea of ‘nudging’ ... has made a breakthrough in public policy making,” Torsten Persson, economics prize committee member, told Reuters.

“There’s also a nudging unit for the UK government, there’s one for the Australian government, it even affects the Swedish government when they think about these things.”’

David Laibson, chair of Harvard University’s economics department, said many of Thaler’s theories have been widely applied by business and government, aiming to get individuals to do a range of actions such as paying parking tickets and getting flu shots.

“If you live in a developed country, there’s some firm or entity that has read these ideas and started to affect your life,” Laibson said.

Influential in academic circles, the movie-going public may have noticed Thaler make a brief cameo in the 2015 film “The Big Short”, explaining the so-called “hot-hand fallacy” where past success is expected to also warrant success in the future, with pop star Selena Gomez.

Asked how he would spend his prize money, Thaler said:

“I will spend it as irrationally as possible.”

MANY AMERICANS, NO WOMEN

The economics prize, officially called the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, was established in 1968. It was not part of the original group of awards set out in dynamite tycoon Nobel’s 1895 will.

Economy is the last of this year’s Nobels, with prizes for physiology or medicine, physics, chemistry, literature and peace awarded last week.

The United States has dominated the economics prize, with American economists accounting for roughly half of laureates since the inception of the award. Indeed, between 2000 and 2013, U.S. academics won or shared the prize every year.

While Americans have dominated the Nobel science and economics prizes, another category of researchers - women - have been few and far between. Indeed only one women - Elinor Ostrom in 2009 - has won the economics prize to date, and not a single individual women won any Nobel award in 2017.

“We are disappointed looking in a larger perspective that there aren’t more women who have been rewarded,” the Academy’s secretary general Goran Hansson said.

He said the Academy would hold a conference to discuss the issue and nominators will be asked to identify women scientists for recognition and also consider ethnic and geographic diversity.

“We are concerned, we are taking measures.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Google has discovered Russian operatives spent tens of thousands of dollars on ads on its YouTube, Gmail and Google Search products in an effort to meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, a person briefed on the company’s probe told Reuters on Monday.

The ads do not appear to be from the same Kremlin-affiliated entity that bought ads on Facebook Inc, but may indicate a broader Russian online disinformation effort, according to the source, who was not authorized to discuss details of Google’s confidential investigation.

The revelation is likely to fuel further scrutiny of the role that Silicon Valley technology giants may have unwittingly played during last year’s election. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Moscow’s goal was to help elect Donald Trump.

Google has uncovered less than $100,000 in ad spending potentially linked to Russian actors, the source said.

Both Twitter Inc and Facebook recently detected and disclosed that suspected Russian operatives, working for a content farm known as the Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg, Russia, used their platforms to purchase ads and post content that was politically divisive in a bid to influence Americans before and after the November 2016 presidential election.

The Internet Research Agency employ hundreds of so-called “trolls” who post pro-Kremlin content, much of it fake or discredited, under the guise of phony social media accounts that posed as American or European, according to lawmakers and researchers.

Facebook announced last month it had unearthed $100,000 in spending by the Internet Research Agency and, under pressure from lawmakers, has pledged to be more transparent about how its ads are purchased and targeted.

Google’s review had been more robust than ones undertaken so far by Facebook or Twitter, the source said.

Russia’s ad purchases were first reported by the Washington Post.

Google, owned by Alphabet Inc, did not deny the story, and in a statement pointed to its existing ad policies that limit political ad targeting and prohibit targeting based on race or religion.

“We are taking a deeper look to investigate attempts to abuse our systems, working with researchers and other companies, and will provide assistance to ongoing inquiries,” a Google spokeswoman said on Monday.

Google runs the world’s largest online advertising business and YouTube is the world’s largest online video site.

Congressional committees have launched multiple investigations into the Russian interference. Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have said Russia intended to sow discord in the United States, spread propaganda and sway the election.

Google officials have been invited to testify publicly about Russian attempts to use their platforms to influence the election before both the House and Senate intelligence committees on Nov. 1 alongside Facebook and Twitter.

(Reuters) - Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) plans to spin off non-core assets and create at least two new publicly listed companies, as the U.S. industrial conglomerate seeks to streamline its business, according to people familiar with the matter.

The move would represent the first major shakeup at the Morris Plains, New Jersey-based company since Darius Adamczyk succeeded David Cote as chief executive in April. It comes after Honeywell said in September it would raise its annual dividend by 12 percent.

The sources said on Sunday that while Honeywell would defy calls by one of its shareholders, activist hedge fund Third Point LLC, to spin off its aerospace division, it would still seek to carve out assets worth several billions of dollars.

Honeywell is considering placing its turbochargers business, which produces components that improve the performance and efficiency of cars and trucks, into one of the newly created companies, the sources said. Honeywell lists turbochargers as part of its aerospace business.

The sources did not disclose which other assets Honeywell was looking to spin off and asked not to be identified because the deliberations were confidential.

Honeywell is hoping to unveil the spinoff plan as early as this week, though the announcement could be delayed, the sources added.

Honeywell, which has a market capitalization of $109 billion, declined to comment.

Honeywell’s businesses include energy efficient products and solutions for homes, specialty chemicals, electronic and advanced materials, and sensing, safety and security technologies for buildings, homes and industries.

Third Point has argued that Honeywell is undervalued compared to peers in industrial automation, and that spinning off the entire aerospace business would create $20 billion in shareholder value.

Honeywell’s aerospace business, its biggest, also makes auxiliary power units and engines for aircraft manufactured by companies such as Bombardier Inc (BBDb.TO), Textron Inc (TXT.N) and General Dynamics Corp (GD.N).

Air Berlin filed for insolvency in August and a government loan is keeping its planes in the air to give it time to negotiate with investors for parts of the business.

Talks with Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) and easyJet (EZJ.L) are due to run until Thursday and once a deal for parts of its business has been agreed Air Berlin will have to wind down the rest of the operation.

German deputy economy minister Matthias Machnig said he is confident a deal will be reached on Thursday.

“After purchase contracts have been agreed, the company must end its own operations step by step,” Air Berlin said in a statement.

Air Berlin’s Niki, which flies to tourist destinations, and regional airline LG Walter are not insolvent and will continue to run, the company said. It will also continue to fly 38 planes as part of a wet lease deal, under which Lufthansa rents crewed planes from Air Berlin mainly for its Eurowings brand, until competition authorities have approved the sale of assets.

Most Air Berlin long-haul flights have already been canceled and the remainder will end on Oct. 15.

Lufthansa is interested in Air Berlin operations with about 81 planes, including Niki and LG Walter, while easyJet is in talks for parts of the business with about 27-30 planes, Air Berlin administrators have said.

Those operations also include access to take-off and landing slots at Air Berlin’s hubs in Tegel and Duesseldorf.

Air Berlin leases its planes, so any bidder will have to fund the aircraft separately. Lufthansa said last month that its board had freed up 1 billion euros ($1.17 billion) to invest in new planes for Eurowings, which it said were likely to come from Air Berlin.

However, a newspaper reported on Monday that talks with easyJet may not result in a deal after the British carrier reduced its offer.

Analysts and industry experts have said that easyJet could be interested in slots made available at London Gatwick after the collapse of British holiday airline Monarch, which was grounded last week.

EasyJet has already encouraged crew made redundant by Monarch last week to apply for positions at the budget carrier.

On Monday Air Berlin said its staff would not all find jobs with the potential buyers of its assets and they should start looking for jobs.

Eurowings has already opened up vacancies for 1,000-plus pilots, cabin crew and ground staff and said on Friday that it had received more than 2,500 applications from around the world, about half of which were from pilots.",Auf Wiedersehen Air Berlin: flights to cease this month,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-air-berlin-lufthansa/auf-wiedersehen-air-berlin-flights-to-cease-this-month-idUSKBN1CE198?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

Modi, in a rare acknowledgment that economic sentiment had turned negative, this week defended his handling of the economy, which in the June quarter grew at an annual 5.7 percent, its slowest rate in three years.

Small and medium-sized enterprises, crucial to Modi’s plans to create millions of more jobs, have been hurt by a massive tax overhaul launched on July 1 that added layers of bureaucracy for companies and hit exports.

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Friday chaired a meeting of the council for the Goods and Services Tax (GST), a landmark reform which turned India’s 29 states into a single customs union for the first time.

After the day-long meeting, Jaitley said small businesses would be allowed to file tax returns once a quarter instead of every month. He also said duties would be cut on some products and the threshold for lower tax would be raised.

“We are not in a denial mode that there is a problem in the SME (small and medium enterprises) sector,” said a senior lawmaker who has been working with Modi’s office to combat the economic slowdown.

Ajay Sahai, head of the Federation of Indian Export Organisation, said before the Jaitley press conference that its 25,000 small and medium-sized members had found the monthly tax drill “exhausting”.

While a mountain of bad loans has crimped bank lending to India’s bigger companies, smaller firms have been hurt by a government move last November to stamp out “black money” - untaxed cash that oils many industries - and by GST, whose complex structure has baffled companies down the supply chain.

“Informal sources of working capital (for smaller firms) has dried up,” said Anil Bhardwaj at the Federation of Indian Micro and Small and Medium Enterprises.

He predicted that it would be another year before GST began to have a positive impact on smaller companies.

Jaitley has promised steps to boost economic growth back above 7 percent and toward the levels economists say India requires to generate employment for the one million entering the workforce every month.

Modi built a reputation as an economic reformer capable of delivering jobs and wealth for an increasingly aspirational population, but slowing growth will be near the top of voter concerns in upcoming state elections.

Investment remains low. The government has hiked spending on infrastructure, but private investment has remained muted.

“It is not easy because our banking system is in deep trouble and private investment is not picking up,” the lawmaker said. “The government will have to recast all policies that will activate the public sector.”

Commerce Minister Suresh Prabhu said in a tweet his department was working with Jaitley to address GST-related issues of exporters.

Jaitley said input tax credit for exporters for July and August, estimated at $10 billion, would be refunded soon.","India's Modi, under fire, eases burden on small companies",https://www.reuters.com/article/india-economy/modi-under-fire-eases-burden-on-small-companies-idINKBN1CB0HR

UNLVR.L

The 3-second video clip, posted on Dove’s U.S. Facebook page on Friday, reminded some social media users of racist soap adverts from the 19th century or early 20th century that showed black people scrubbing their skin to become white.

Dove removed the clip and apologized, saying on Twitter that the post had “missed the mark in representing women of color thoughtfully”.

But the apology failed to stem a torrent of online criticism, with some social media users calling for a boycott of Dove products, while conventional media outlets in the United States and Europe were also seizing on the story.

In Britain, the controversy featured prominently in Monday’s television breakfast shows, with guests debating how the ad got through the company’s approval process and whether it was indicative of a broader problem with racism in marketing.

On Twitter, posts including the hashtag #BoycottDove, which started over the weekend among U.S. users, were appearing in multiple European languages.

“In short, racism is back in fashion and brands are looking to benefit,” wrote user @Beatrix B. in French.

In the full clip, the black woman removed her t-shirt to reveal the white woman, who then lifted her own top to reveal an Asian woman.

“The short video was intended to convey that Dove body wash is for every woman and be a celebration of diversity, but we got it wrong,” Dove said in a statement.

The black-to-white transition was reminiscent in the eyes of some viewers of infamous soap ads from history, some of which were posted on social media.

In one example from the 1880s, a black child is pictured bathing in a tub while a white child offers him a bar of soap. After using the soap, the black child looks delighted to see that his skin has turned white.

Dove declined to say how the ad was produced and approved. It said it was “re-evaluating our internal processes for creating and approving content”.

A previous Dove ad, which showed three women side by side in front of a before-and-after image of cracked and smooth skin, caused an uproar in 2011 because the woman positioned on the “before” side was black while the “after” woman was white. Dove said at the time all three were supposed to “demonstrate the ‘after’ product benefit”.",Dove faces PR disaster over ad that showed black woman turning white,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-unilever-dove-advert/dove-faces-pr-disaster-over-ad-that-showed-black-woman-turning-white-idUKKBN1CE17E

Many had begun to assume that would be the full extent of the “Brexit discount” demanded by overseas investors to keep faith with the world’s fifth-largest economy.
After the biggest-ever move in favor of the pound in the four weeks to mid-May, market positioning has reversed.
“If the Conservatives back a softer Brexit, sterling would seem to want to go up.
“The uncertainty that the (election) result brings means that you have a degree of the risk premia re-establishing itself,” said Barclays strategist Hamish Pepper.","LONDON (Reuters) - Last week’s shocking British election result and the period of political uncertainty that looks set to follow may have come at the worst of times for the country’s economy and the value of the pound sterling.

Until 10 p.m. London time last Thursday, Prime Minister Theresa May’s decision to call the snap poll did not look like a pivotal point for the most-sold major currency of last year.

Sterling lost almost a fifth of its value between June 2016, when Britons voted to leave the European Union, and November. Many had begun to assume that would be the full extent of the “Brexit discount” demanded by overseas investors to keep faith with the world’s fifth-largest economy.

But May’s loss of her majority drove a 2 percent fall in the pound on Friday and another 1 percent on Monday, and traders now say the election could prove another turning point for sterling.

After the biggest-ever move in favor of the pound in the four weeks to mid-May, market positioning has reversed.

For many strategists, the election result not only makes the likely shape of Brexit even more uncertain, it also creates a political hiatus that risks the sort of sudden stop to economic activity that many feared would follow last year’s referendum.

“Markets are still trying to work out what the new risk premium is for sterling,” says James Binny, head of currencies at U.S. financial group State Street Global Advisors in London.

“If the Conservatives back a softer Brexit, sterling would seem to want to go up. But if it became much clearer that things were heading downhill from a growth perspective, then that might create a bigger move down.”

VICIOUS CYCLE

Markets now assume May’s failure to secure her party a majority will lead to a softening of the government’s Brexit stance to give greater priority to a close trading relationship with the EU.

But there’s little confidence that the planned loose support agreement with Northern Irish Unionists can keep her minority Conservative government afloat for long, or whether May herself can cling on as premier for the two years of divorce talks.

Anxiety that Britain’s economy may be entering a downward spiral was already growing before the election.

Sterling’s weakness in the wake of the Brexit vote has driven inflation above the Bank of England’s target at a time when household wages and overall growth are not keeping pace, as data on Wednesday underlined.

FILE PHOTO: A general view shows the Bank of England in the City of London, Britain April 19, 2017. REUTERS/Hannah McKay/File Photo

But high and increasingly static housing costs that eat into the pay packets of young Britons without feeding optimism among their older neighbors mean the Bank of England is forced to ignore rising prices and keep credit conditions ultra-loose.

The combination of high inflation and cheap money then just undermines the pound further.

That presents a stark contrast with the euro zone, now on its best economic run for a decade, and leaves sterling looking most exposed against the euro.

Some airport exchange bureaus are already offering holidaymakers less than a euro per pound and the options markets companies use to insure against currency moves have flipped from positive on sterling in mid-April to universally negative. EURGBPVOL=

“The fundamentals still are not positive, they are negative,” said Josh O‘Byrne, a currency strategist with Citi, the world’s single biggest currency trader, in London.

”We have this cyclical underperformance. We have this political divergence where the UK is looking less stable, Europe looks more so.

“And also the positioning does not favor sterling. People are taking another look but waiting for more clarity.”

Barclays, which was positive on the pound before last week, has put its forecasts on review and is likely to cut them.

“The uncertainty that the (election) result brings means that you have a degree of the risk premia re-establishing itself,” said Barclays strategist Hamish Pepper. “The currency is vulnerable to that in the near term.”

Much will depend on how fiscal and monetary policies mesh over the next year, and some hedge funds and other major speculative investors are already wondering if more quantitative easing (QE) asset purchases from the BoE will be in the mix.

That would further loosen monetary policy and probably prove negative for sterling, although it would provide a backstop bid for British government bonds, known as gilts.

Ed Al-Hussainy, senior interest rate and currency analyst at Columbia Threadneedle, which manages $467 billion of assets, said ordinarily investors would sell gilts and demand higher interest rates to hold them, pressuring public finances.

”But here’s the twist: we have an opportunity for the Bank to restart QE,“ he said. ”The threshold for that is still very high -- we need to see a much greater deterioration.

“But in that scenario it is not clear that rates will go up.”","Hard or soft Brexit aside, pound nervous of economic slowdown",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-markets-sterling-analysis/hard-or-soft-brexit-aside-pound-nervous-of-economic-slowdown-idUSKBN19528B

O britânico Hamilton, que largou da pole position, cruzou a linha de chegada 1,2s à frente de Max Verstappen, da Red Bull, abrindo 59 pontos de vantagem na liderança do campeonato. Daniel Ricciardo, companheiro de Verstappen, ficou em terceiro.

Vettel, por sua vez, não passou da quarta volta, abandonando a prova nos boxes.

O alemão, que já estava 34 pontos atrás de Hamilton antes da prova, sofreu o terceiro revés no mesmo número de corridas, e agora suas esperanças estão depositas em que Hamilton sofra o mesmo tipo de má sorte nas quatro etapas finais da temporada.

“Eu só poderia sonhar em ter uma vantagem dessa”, disse Hamilton em entrevista no pódio ao ex-piloto de F1 Takuma Sato, vencedor das 500 Milhas de Indianápolis neste ano.

“Eu não diria que estou com uma mão (na taça)”, acrescentou mais tarde. “Ainda tem 100 pontos em disputa, então vou continuar com o pé no acelerador”.

A vitória deste domingo foi a 61ª da carreira de Hamilton e a terceira no circuito de Suzuka. O triunfo aconteceu um dia após o piloto de 32 anos ter registrado o novo recorde no circuito de 5,8km no treino classificatório de sábado.

Com a atual vantagem conquistada sobre Vettel, Hamilton pode assegurar o título já na próxima corrida, em Austin, no Texas, em 22 de outubro.

Valtteri Bottas, que largou em sexto devido a um punição por uma troca de câmbio, lutou até o final para terminar em quarto com sua Mercedes. O também finlandês Kimi Raikkonen, que também sofreu punição no grid relacionada ao câmbio, foi o representante único da Ferrari no fim da prova, em quinto.

LONDON (Reuters) - Iran promised on Monday to give a “crushing” response if the United States designated its elite Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist group.

The pledge came a week before President Donald Trump announces a final decision on how he wants to contain the Islamic Republic.

He is expected on Oct. 15 to “decertify” a landmark 2015 international deal to curb Iran’s nuclear program, a step that by itself stops short of pulling out of the agreement but gives Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions.

Trump is also expected to designate Iran’s most powerful security force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corp (IRGC) as a terrorist organization, as he rolls out a broader, more hawkish U.S. strategy on Iran.

“We are hopeful that the United States does not make this strategic mistake,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi was quoted as saying by the state news agency IRNA.

“If they do, Iran’s reaction would be firm, decisive and crushing and the United States should bear all its consequences,” he told a news conference reported by IRNA.

Individuals and entities associated with the IRGC are already on the U.S. list of foreign terrorist organizations, but the organization as a whole is not.

IRGC commander Mohammad Ali Jafari said on Sunday, “If the news is correct about the stupidity of the American government in considering the Revolutionary Guards a terrorist group, then the Revolutionary Guards will consider the American army to be like Islamic State all around the world.”

Jafari also said that additional sanctions would end chances for future dialogue with the United States and that the Americans would have to move their regional bases outside the 2,000 km (1,250 mile) range of IRGC’s missiles.

WARY EUROPE

U.S. sanctions on the IRGC could affect conflicts in Iraq and Syria, where Tehran and Washington both support warring parties that oppose the Islamic State militant group (IS).

France said on Monday it was worried that classifying the IRGC as a terrorist group could exacerbate tensions in the region.

Germany said it was worried Trump would decide Iran is not respecting the nuclear deal, negotiated under his predecessor Barack Obama, and fears such a step will worsen insecurity in the Middle East.

A U.S. pullout could unravel an accord seen by supporters as vital to preventing a Middle East arms race and tamping down regional tensions, since it limits Iran’s ability to enrich uranium for nuclear fuel in exchange for the lifting of sanctions that damaged its oil-based economy.

The U.N. nuclear watchdog’s inspectors have repeatedly declared Iran in compliance with the terms of the nuclear deal.

Trump called Iran “a corrupt dictatorship” during his first speech to the U.N. General Assembly and said the nuclear deal was “the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into”.

The other five world powers in the deal were Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China.

The prospect of the United States reneging on the agreement has worried other partners that helped negotiate it.

The Kremlin said that any U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal would have “negative consequences.”

British Prime Minister Theresa May, who supports the nuclear pact, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who opposes it, agreed in a phone call on Monday that they need to be “clear-eyed” about the threat Iran poses to the Middle East.

“They agreed that ... the international community should continue working together to push back against Iran’s destabilizing regional activity,” May’s spokesman said.

“MALIGN ACTIVITIES”

Despite the nuclear deal, Washington still maintains its own more limited sanctions on Iran over its ballistic missile program and over accusations Tehran supports terrorism.

Iran says it is developing missiles solely for defensive purposes and denies involvement in terrorism.

The Trump administration aims to put more pressure on the IRGC, especially over recent missile tests and what Washington has called its “malign activities” across the Middle East.

The U.S. government imposed sanctions in July on 18 entities and people for supporting the IRGC in developing drones and military equipment. In August, Congress overwhelmingly approved the “Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act” which imposed new sanctions on Iran for its ballistic missile program, as well as sanctions on Russia and North Korea.

In an interview aired on Saturday night, Trump accused Iran of “funding North Korea” and “doing things with North Korea that are totally inappropriate”.

Qasemi, Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman, said the U.S. accusations were “baseless”. He added, “Israel and some specific countries are raising these accusations to create Iranophobia.”",Iran promises 'crushing' response if U.S. designates Guards a terrorist group,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-usa-irgc/iran-promises-crushing-response-if-u-s-designates-guards-a-terrorist-group-idUSKBN1CE0M2

LONDON (Reuters) - Iranian authorities have opened a new case against a British-Iranian charity worker serving five years in jail in Tehran, leveling charges that could carry a sentence of 16 additional years in prison, her family said on Monday.

Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, was arrested by the elite Revolutionary Guards in April 2016 at a Tehran airport, as she was about to return to Britain with her two-year-old daughter after a family visit.

She was convicted of plotting to overthrow Iran’s clerical establishment, a charge denied by her family and the Foundation, a charity organization that is independent of Thomson Reuters and operates independently of Reuters News. She was sentenced to five years in prison.

In a hearing in Evin Prison, where she is serving her term, Zaghari-Ratcliffe was told on Sunday that a new case had been opened at the insistence of the Revolutionary Guards, Iran’s most powerful security force, her family said in a statement.

The new charges include joining and receiving money from organizations working to overthrow the Islamic Republic, and attending a demonstration outside the Iranian Embassy in London, the family said.

“Nazanin and the rest of her family are bewildered at this turn,” the family statement said.

Her husband Richard Ratcliffe said the Revolutionary Guards were “inventing new charges to prevent her early release”.

Iran’s judiciary was not immediately available for comment.

Zaghari-Ratcliffe used to work in London for the BBC, which Iran says is seeking to topple the Islamic theocracy. During Sunday’s hearing she rejected all the new charges, the family said.

Iran refuses to recognize dual nationals and denies them access to consular assistance.

On the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in September, Britain’s foreign minister, Boris Johnson, said progress in the relationship between London and Tehran would depend to some extent on a resolution of the Nazanin case.",Jailed British-Iranian charity worker faces new charges: family,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-rights-britain/jailed-british-iranian-charity-worker-faces-new-charges-family-idUSKBN1CE1TG?il=0

(Reuters) - Juan Martin del Potro saved four break points in the decider to battle past Georgian qualifier Nikoloz Basilashvili on Monday and reach the Shanghai Masters second round.

The Argentine, who prevailed 6-2 3-6 6-4, looked on course for a routine win after taking the first set in 23 minutes but world number 59 Basilashvili pounced on his errors in the next to level the match.

Attacking Del Potro’s serve at 4-4 in the third, Basilashvili earned four chances to break and serve for the match. But the 2013 finalist defended resolutely and switched gears to set up a meeting with Russian teenager Andrey Rublev.

South Korea’s Chung Hyeon eased past world number 13 Roberto Bautista Agut, last year’s runner-up, 6-4 6-3 to equal the best victory of his career.

World number 60 Chung, who beat David Goffin when the Belgian was ranked 13th in Montreal this year, next faces Richard Gasquet.

American qualifier Frances Tiafoe stunned Benoit Paire 6-4 6-4 and fired a warning to the experienced players on the Tour.

“A lot of us younger guys are playing well, doing well, and it’s going to help others step up,” he said. “I think you’re going to see a lot of us in the top 50. The other guys are going to have to leave eventually.”

Also advancing to the next round were Feliciano Lopez who defeated big-serving Ivo Karlovic 7-6(1) 7-6(6) and Britain’s Kyle Edmund who downed Jiri Vesely 6-3 6-2.

Roger Federer, the 2014 champion, starts his campaign on Wednesday.

“I couldn’t be happier with the season, to be quite honest,” Federer told reporters.

“I‘m relieved that I‘m feeling better since the American summer and Canada. It would be nice to pick up one more title, maybe a couple more would be nice, and then get into training and start again next year.”

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s top court on Monday temporarily banned the sale of firecrackers in and around the capital ahead of Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, as it looks to prevent a repeat of severe air pollution that forced school closures last year.

New Delhi's air quality has already hit ""very unhealthy"" levels, U.S. embassy data shows. This is often blamed on burning of unwanted vegetation on farms in neighboring states usual at this time of year, worsened by fumes from fireworks. (bit.ly/2eZOb9H)

The ban takes effect immediately and will run until Nov. 1, said a panel of Supreme Court judges headed by Justice Arjan Kumar Sikri, adding that its impact on the region’s air quality would have to be examined after the festival.

“All temporary licenses to sell firecrackers stand canceled,” said Haripriya Padmanabhan, a lawyer representing the group that sought the ban.

“People who had already purchased crackers will be able to burst them. Hopefully they won’t do that,” she told Asian News International, a partner of Reuters Television.

Diwali, traditionally ushered in with the burning of firecrackers, falls on Oct. 19 this year.

“This is a nice step, let us look at other sources of #airpollution too,” global environmental group Greenpeace said on social network Twitter.

But others saw it as an attack on tradition.

“We Indians will protest and burn crackers,” wrote one Twitter user, Ishkaran Bhandari. “We will uphold our culture, traditions and celebrate Diwali.”

Last November, about a million children were forced to stay home from school, thousands of workers reported sick and queues formed outside shops selling face masks as New Delhi struggled with its worst pollution for nearly 20 years.

Vehicle emissions and dust from construction sites were the factors blamed for that spike, besides firecrackers and farm burnings.

Ele afirmou que as projeções apontam que a região que a Petrobras irá explorar na cessão onerosa teria ainda um volume excedente de 5 a 10 bilhões de barris além do cedido à estatal, que poderia ser oferecido a investidores em mais de um leilão, devido aos volumes expressivos estimados.

Ele ressaltou, no entanto, que uma decisão sobre os leilões é de competência do Conselho Nacional de Política Energética (CNPE), um colegiado formado por autoridades do governo.

Para o secretário de Petróleo e Gás, o fundamental no momento é o governo fechar as negociações sobre a atualização do contrato da cessão onerosa com a Petrobras, de forma a viabilizar o primeiro certame da cessão onerosa em 2018.

LONGA NEGOCIAÇÃO

Nos últimos anos, governo e Petrobras vêm discutindo a atualização do contrato da cessão onerosa, firmado em 2010, que deu direito à petroleira de explorar 5 bilhões de barris de petróleo em troca do aumento da participação da União no capital da empresa.

O secretário Félix revelou que o ministério tem promovido reuniões semanais com a Petrobras em busca de um consenso. A empresa será credora na negociação, conforme já revelaram integrantes do governo, mas o valor desse crédito é o motivo da demora na solução do impasse.

Segundo Félix, o contrato da cessão onerosa aponta que seus termos deveriam ser atualizados após a declaração de comercialidade da área. Só que houve seis declarações desse tipo entre o fim de 2013 e o final de 2014. Nesse período, o barril sofreu forte movimento de baixa.

“A questão é: qual o valor do barril de referência? Se você escolhe a primeira declaração o valor é um, e quando se escolhe a última o valor é outro”, frisou ele. “O ‘timing’ é o ‘X ‘da questão, porque isso mexe no valor significativamente. A diferença é significativa”, disse.

O secretário acrescentou que o governo pretende fazer nos anos de 2020 e 2021 dois leilões anuais de petróleo, sendo um no regime de partilha de produção e outro no sistema de concessão.

”Para 2020 e 2021 queremos fazer dois leilões. Se vier um novo governo, ele pode mudar isso, mas a proteção é o resultado que os leilões vão trazer”, disse.

The bipartisan consensus favoring disability rights represented the best of America’s ideals of equality, opportunity, and fair play.
The Republican Party’s turn against disability rights is a rejection of those core American values.
From 2009-2011, he led the Department of Justice’s disability rights enforcement as a Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights.","On September 7, on a straight party-line vote, the Republican-controlled House Judiciary Committee moved forward a bill that would gut key protections for people with disabilities. Although versions of this legislation had been introduced in prior years, the bill did not go anywhere while President Barack Obama stood ready to veto it. But now that President Donald Trump, whose actions have demonstrated hostility to civil rights, occupies the White House, the proposal presents a real risk of passage. If Republicans in Congress do eviscerate the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), it will be the culmination of their recent abandonment of the bipartisan consensus in favor of inclusion and equality for disabled persons.

Although the partisan divide in Washington has often seemed unbridgeable, disability rights long united lawmakers. Republican President George H.W. Bush referred to the ADA, which he signed in 1990, as one of his “proudest achievements.” The law guaranteed that people with disabilities would have access to, and be free from discrimination by, employers, businesses, and government agencies. In 2008, after a series of court decisions that gave a narrow reading to the ADA, a Democratic Congress passed amendments to the ADA reasserting the statute’s broad coverage - and President George W. Bush signed it.

The Trump administration is hacking away at disability rights online and in the workplace, while Trump and congressional Republicans work to gut funding for programs people with disabilities rely on such as Medicaid. The partial ADA-repeal bill is only the most overt assault on disability rights - the culmination of a shift that began when, in December 2012, 38 Republican senators denied the two-thirds vote needed for ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which was modeled on the ADA and ardently supported by disabled GOP luminaries such as former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole. But while that action was merely symbolic red meat for their base – conservatives worried it would inhibit homeschooling and infringe U.S. sovereignty - this new proposal could cause tangible and long-lasting harm.

The current bill, misleadingly titled the “ADA Education and Reform Act of 2017,” would render largely unenforceable key ADA requirements that businesses be accessible to disabled consumers – requirements that they provide ramps instead of stairs where possible, that doorways be wide enough for wheelchairs and so forth.

For wheelchair users, a single step – or a door that is a bit too narrow – can be the barrier that prevents them from patronizing a store. A few inches can make the difference between being full participants in civic and economic life and being dependent on others and shut off from the community.

Businesses have had 27 years to learn about and conform to the ADA’s requirements. But too many still fail to comply with the law, because enforcement relies principally on suits by disabled individuals. Wheelchair users, blind persons, and other people with disabilities encounter inaccessible businesses on a daily basis. According to 2016 Department of Labor statistics, only 31.2 percent of working-age Americans with disabilities had jobs, compared to 76.4 percent of working-age nondisabled Americans. The failure of employers, including stores and restaurants, to provide required accommodations is one of the key reasons for this persistent gap. Surveys show inaccessibility also causes people with disabilities to eat out less often.

The ADA does not give a disabled customer the right to receive damages for a denial of service, just an injunction that requires the owner to remove the barrier. This limitation already creates an incentive for inaccessible businesses to wait until they are sued before complying. Under the bill that recently passed the judiciary committee, the incentive to wait and see will be even greater. The proposal would prevent a disabled person from suing a business that violates the ADA as long as the business makes “substantial progress in removing the barrier,” within six months of being notified. A business might be able to avoid ever complying with the ADA or facing a lawsuit. It’s a system designed to allow businesses to delay until the victim runs out of energy or money to keep pursuing them.

Sponsors of the “ADA Education and Reform Act,” such as Texas Republican Ted Poe, say that the bill is necessary to stop unscrupulous lawyers from bringing frivolous or abusive ADA cases against small businesses. But state bars, and individual judges, already have ample authority to sanction attorneys who engage in such unprofessional conduct. And the ADA itself protects the interests of business owners by providing that an existing facility need not remove accessibility barriers unless doing so is easy to accomplish without significant expense.

Rather than protecting legitimate business interests, the bill pending in Congress would give a reprieve to enterprises that have had 27 years to comply with the law but have not yet done so. That is a betrayal of the basic promise of the ADA – that people with disabilities would be treated as equal citizens, with full access to America’s civic and economic life.

It is just the latest Republican betrayal of the historic bipartisan support for disability rights. In the Trump administration, attacks on disability rights have accelerated. Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ Justice Department has already reversed course in a key lawsuit, prosecuted by the Obama administration, involving the rights of disabled workers to retain their jobs. The White House has also signaled a halt to the Obama-era efforts to adopt regulations ensuring that the Internet is accessible to blind people and others with disabilities.

Perhaps the biggest threat to disability rights isn’t even in the realm of civil rights law, but healthcare: the GOP’s endless efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and cut funding for Medicaid. If they succeed Republicans would remove benefits that allow people with disabilities to access health insurance and home health services. Instead of staying in their communities and possibly working, many would be institutionalized. Trump has also proposed in his budget to cut drastically into Social Security Disability Insurance, the only source of income for millions of Americans unable to work.

The bipartisan consensus favoring disability rights represented the best of America’s ideals of equality, opportunity, and fair play. The Republican Party’s turn against disability rights is a rejection of those core American values.

Frankfurt (Reuters) - Die längste Rally in der Geschichte der europäischen Aktienmärkte nährt bei Börsianern die Furcht vor einer Überhitzung.

Dax und EuroStoxx steigen bereits das sechste Jahr in Folge, so lange wie nie zuvor. Seit Jahresbeginn hat der deutsche Leitindex rund zwölf Prozent zugelegt und steht nun kurz vor dem Sprung durch die Schallmauer von 13.000 Punkten. Zuletzt trennten ihn lediglich rund 30 Pünktchen von der Rekordmarke.

Immer mehr Analysten raten dazu, die Kurssprünge mit Vorsicht zu genießen. Vor allem die Wall Street, die den Dax mit nach oben gezogen hat, scheint heißgelaufen. Auch Deutsche-Bank-Chef John Cryan sieht in Folge der jahrelangen Niedrigzins-Politik der Notenbanken Anzeichen von Spekulationsblasen bei Aktien, Anleihen und Immobilien. Die europäische Finanzmarktaufsicht (ESMA) warnte ebenfalls vor Risiken. EZB-Ratsmitglied Ewald Nowotny sieht vor allem am US-Aktienmarkt eine erhöhte Gefahr für Abstürze, eine generelle Überbewertung an Europas Börsen sei noch nicht in Sicht. Auch EZB-Chef Mario Draghi gibt sich diesbezüglich gelassen. Erstklassige Gewerbeimmobilien seien der einzige Bereich mit überdehnten Preisen, meinte er kürzlich.

Fakt ist: Die Zinspolitik der Notenbanken hat in zahlreichen Anlageklassen zu kräftigen Preisschüben geführt. Seit 2009 sind die Geldhähne weit geöffnet. Die US-Notenbank Fed, die Europäische Zentralbank und die Notenbanken Großbritanniens und Japans pumpten seither Billionen in den Geldkreislauf.

NOCH LUFT NACH OBEN

Aktienanleger fragen sich, wie lange die Party an den Börsen noch anhält und ob der Zeitpunkt für einen Ausstieg nicht schon gekommen ist. Aus kurzfristiger Sicht mag es richtig sein, erst einmal Kasse zu machen, meint Martin Hüfner, Chefvolkswirt des Vermögensverwalters Assenagon. Langfristig hingegen seien die fundamentalen Faktoren nach wie vor gut. Die Konjunktur laufe rund, daran werde sich auf absehbare Zeit nichts ändern. “Die Überbewertungen in anderen Asset-Klassen, vor allem in Bonds sind viel größer”, betont Hüfner.

Neben dem zuletzt wieder etwas schwächeren Euro setzen die Anleger vor allem auf eine starke US-Konjunktur. “Geopolitische Risiken werden immer stärker ignoriert”, sagt Anlagestratege Tobias Basse von der NordLB. Das könnte sich jedoch ändern, sollten die Krisen in Nordkorea und Katalonien eskalieren. Störfeuer könnten auch von der Fed kommen, die mit höheren Zinsen auf das von den Börsen momentan gespielte Szenario eines stärkeren Wachstums in den USA reagieren könnte. “Damit scheinen vor allem nordamerikanische Aktien inzwischen recht ambitioniert bewertet zu sein.”

Vergleicht man das Kurs-Gewinn-Verhältnis (KGV) zwischen den Kontinenten bleibt dem Dax noch Luft nach oben. Nach Reuters-Daten liegt sein KGV derzeit bei knapp 14 - der Kurs der 30 im deutschen Leitindex gelisteten Unternehmens-Papiere übertrifft also den Gewinn je Aktie um das 14-fache. Das ist sogar unter dem langjährigen Mittel von rund 15. Zum Vergleich: In Zeiten der Internet-Blase zur Jahrtausendwende lag das KGV etwa doppelt so hoch.

An der New Yorker Wall Street laufen die Aktienkurse den Unternehmensgewinnen hingegen davon. Der Blick zurück zeigt, dass nur in kurzen Phasen die KGVs jemals höher waren als momentan. “Fundamental sind Bewertungen vorzufinden, die sonst nur in einem Fünftel der Geschichte der Wall Street zu beobachten waren”, sagt Stratege Jochen Stanzl von CMC Markets. Fiskalpolitisch sorgten zwar die Steuerpläne der Trump-Regierung für gute Stimmung, allerdings sei die Frage nach der Finanzierbarkeit nicht geklärt. Beim US-Standardwerteindex Dow Jones liegt das KGV bei 20,6 und beim breit gefassten S&P 500 sogar bei 22,5. Damit rangieren beide ebenfalls über ihrem langjährigen Durchschnitt.

VERZERRUNGEN AN DEN BONDMÄRKTEN

Ein Großteil des billigen Notenbank-Geldes fließt in die Anleihemärkte. Allein das Kaufprogramm der EZB umfasst 2,3 Billionen Euro. Dies drückt die Verzinsung auf Rekordtiefs. Nach Berechnungen der Vermögensverwaltung der US-Bank JP Morgan rentieren rund 36 Prozent der Staatsanleihen in der Euro-Zone unter Null. Es sei schwer zu leugnen, dass es überzogene Preise gebe, sagt der auf Bonds spezialisierte Vermögensverwalter Iain Stealey von JP Morgan Asset Management. “Es gibt Länder, die im Jahr nominal an die vier Prozent wachsen und deren Staatsanleihen einen Negativ-Zins haben. Da gibt es ein Missverhältnis.”

Der Einfluss der EZB wird unter anderem bei Italien deutlich. Die zehnjährigen Anleihen des Landes, das volkswirtschaftlich als eines der schwächsten Glieder in der Euro-Zone gilt, warfen in den vergangenen Jahren meist weniger ab als US-Staatspapiere. Zum Höhepunkt der Finanzkrise hatten sie bei 7,5 Prozent rentiert. Momentan liegen die Renditen mit 2,2 beziehungsweise 2,3 Prozent nahezu gleichauf.",HINTERGRUND-Dax-Rekordfieber nährt Furcht vor Überhitzung,https://www.reuters.com/article/m-rkte-aktien-anleihen-spekulationsblase-idDEKBN1CB0OL

Set in the United States in December 2003 – when U.S. forces in Iraq were dragging Saddam Hussein out of a “spider hole” - it is the story of three ageing former servicemen who reunite to bury the son of one of them who has been killed in action.

With President Donald Trump saying he could “totally destroy” North Korea and characterizing a dinner with military commanders as “the calm before the storm”, Cranston said “Last Flag Flying” was a timely reminder of the effect on normal Americans of ill-advised military campaigns.

“I think it has a lot of relevance today in the sense that (today) it’s not clear cut as far as the (what are the) intentions of the government or military,” Cranston, acclaimed for his lead role in the TV drama “Breaking Bad”, told Reuters.

“In World War Two, it was the ‘good war’, it was clear and present danger, we had to stop this mad man. Since then, with Vietnam and Iraq, (there are) a lot of questions ... among the troops and the citizens as to if we are doing the right thing and what is the purpose of our being there.”

REUTERS/Afolabi Sotunde

“Last Flag Flying” was produced by Amazon Studios and directed and co-written by Richard Linklater, whose greatest critical acclaim has been for the naturalistic “Before Sunset” trilogy and the 2014 “Boyhood” which won a slew of Oscar nominations.

Linklater also made comedies including “School of Rock” and “Everybody Wants Some!!”, about skirt-chasing undergraduates. “Last Flag Flying” falls somewhere between the two genres.

The drama and comedy stem from the chemistry between the three leads, each played by a big Hollywood name.

Steve Carell is the awkward shy one who, we assume, was quiet and withdrawn even before the loss of his son. Cranston plays a foul-mouthed, hard-drinking bar owner who is his own best customer, and Laurence Fishburne, is a man who has found God and become an evangelical preacher, preferring to forget the sex and drugs they all indulged in back in ‘Nam.

Vanity Fair’s Richard Lawson said the film’s ability to honor the footsoldiers while being critical of the wars they are sent to fight, could hit “an Academy sweet spot, satisfying both the more conservative oldsters and the younger, leftier types.”

Other critics said “Last Flag Flying” lacked the light touch of Linklater’s best work. The Guardian’s Benjamin Lee called it “a half-baked TV movie masquerading as Oscarbait, a curious misstep for the Oscar-nominated indie auteur”.","Linklater's war veteran comedy speaks to modern America, says star",https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idCAKBN1CD0X2-OCAEN

BEIJING (Reuters) - China said on Monday it hopes the Iran nuclear deal will stay intact, playing an important role in keeping the peace, after a senior U.S. official said President Donald Trump is expected to decertify the agreement.

The official, speaking last week on condition of anonymity, said Trump was also expected to roll out a broader U.S. strategy on Iran that would be more confrontational. The Trump administration has frequently criticized Iran’s conduct in the Middle East.

Trump, who has called the pact an “embarrassment” and “the worst deal ever negotiated”, has been weighing whether it serves U.S. security interests as he faces an Oct. 15 deadline for certifying that Iran is complying with its terms.

Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the Iran nuclear deal was a good example of how to solve something peacefully through talks.

The agreement had played a positive and important role in ensuring nuclear non-proliferation and protecting peace and stability in the Middle East, she added.

“We hope that the comprehensive Iran nuclear agreement can continue to be earnestly implemented,” Hua told a daily news briefing.

Iranian authorities have repeatedly said Tehran would not be the first to violate the accord, under which Iran agreed to restrict its nuclear program in return for the lifting of most international sanctions that had crippled its economy.

If Trump declines to certify Iran’s compliance, U.S. congressional leaders would have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions on Tehran suspended under the agreement.

The prospect that Washington could renege on the pact, which was signed by the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China, the European Union and Iran, has worried some U.S. allies.

The Madrid government, grappling with Spain’s biggest political crisis since an attempted military coup in 1981, made it clear on Monday it would respond immediately to any such unilateral declaration.

A week on from a referendum on independence which the government did its utmost to thwart, more signs were emerging that the fraught situation was also taking its toll on the business climate of Spain’s wealthiest region.

Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont is due to address the regional parliament on Tuesday afternoon and the Madrid government is worried it will vote for a unilateral declaration of independence.

Catalan officials say people voted overwhelmingly for secession in the ballot, which was declared illegal by the government and was marked by police violence against independence supporters.

But the issue has deeply divided the northeastern region itself as well the Spanish nation. Hundreds of thousands of unionists took to the streets of Barcelona at the weekend to protest against the region breaking away.

Buoyed by the show of support, Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaría said on Monday: “I‘m calling on the sensible people in the Catalan government... don’t jump off the edge because you’ll take the people with you.”

“If there is a unilateral declaration of independence there will be decisions made to restore law and democracy,” Saenz de Santamaría told COPE radio station.

Backing also came from European heavyweights Germany and France.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke to Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy on Saturday about the crisis, her spokesman said on Monday. She stressed her support for Spain’s unity but also encouraged more dialogue.

France said it would not recognize Catalonia if the region unilaterally declared independence. Doing so would lead to Catalonia’s automatic exit from the European Union, it said.

“This crisis needs to be resolved through dialogue at all levels of Spanish politics,” France’s European affairs minister Nathalie Loiseau said.

The European Union has shown no interest in an independent Catalonia, despite an appeal by Puigdemont for Brussels to mediate in the crisis.

NEW ELECTIONS?

Under Catalonia’s referendum law, deemed unconstitutional by Madrid, a vote for independence in the assembly on Tuesday would start a six-month process that would envisage divorce talks with Spain before regional elections and a final act of separation.

Rajoy has not ruled out the so-called “nuclear option” of removing Catalonia’s government and calling new regional elections if it claims independence.

He gained some political cover for such a move on Monday when opposition Socialist leader Pedro Sanchez said in Barcelona he would “support the response of the rule of law in the face of any attempt to break social harmony”.

Sanchez stopped short, however, of explicitly saying his party would back dissolving the regional parliament, a possibility written into the 1978 constitution.

Losing Catalonia, which has its own language and culture, would deprive Spain of a fifth of its economic output and more than a quarter of exports. A stream of Catalonia-based firms and banks have moved their legal bases outside the region.

The boards of Catalonia-based infrastructure firm Abertis (ABE.MC), telecoms company Cellnex (CLNX.MC) and property group Inmobiliaria Colonial (COL.MC) will meet on Monday to discuss moving, sources said.

Banks Caixabank (CABK.MC) and Sabadell (SABE.MC) have already resolved to leave the region.

The crisis has also reopened old divisions in a nation where the right-wing dictatorship of General Francisco Franco is a living memory easily revived by strong displays of nationalism.

Among many moderate Spaniards there is widespread opposition to a breakaway, including in Catalonia. Regional authorities say about 90 percent of those who voted in the referendum backed secession, but turnout was 43 percent, with most unionists boycotting it.

Sunday's demonstration in the Catalan capital helped calm Spanish markets on Monday, along with comments on Friday from credit rating agencies Moody's and DBRS that they expected Spain to remain united. Spanish borrowing costs fell to a one-week low and the main share index .IBEX touched a week high.

Puigdemont appeared resolute in a television interview on Sunday, saying the region’s referendum law called for a declaration of independence in the event of a “yes” vote.

“We will apply what the law says,” he told TV3.

Catalonia’s High Court asked for more security in case independence is declared, specifically drafting in the national police, who were called in to stop the referendum when the Catalan police force failed to act.

Madrid sent thousands of national police to the region to prevent the vote. About 900 people were injured when officers used rubber bullets and batons against voters in scenes that shocked Spain and the world, and escalated the dispute.

Under a blueprint for independence drawn up by the Catalan parliament last month, the High court would be turned into a new Supreme Court of Catalonia.

Puigdemont said on Sunday he had not been in contact with the Madrid government for some time because it refused to discuss independence.

“What is happening in Catalonia is real, whether they like it or not. Millions of people have voted, who want to decide. We have to talk about this,” he said.

The text, which will be discussed further by envoys from the 28 EU states on Tuesday and may be modified, said the EU may consider further measures depending on developments in Myanmar but would “respond accordingly to positive developments”.

The document confirmed support for an existing EU embargo on arms and equipment “that can be used for internal repression”.

It called on Myanmar to discuss repatriating refugees from neighboring Bangladesh and praised the latter for its role in the crisis, which started when attacks by Rohingya militants on security posts brought a ferocious military response.

Refugees and rights groups say the army and Buddhist vigilantes use killing and arson to drive the Rohingya out of Myanmar. Myanmar rejects accusations of ethnic cleansing.

The EU draft characterized the situation in the most-affected Rakhine State as “extremely serious” and said Kachin and Shan provinces were also “of great concern.”

ArcelorMittal si è detta “contrariata” per il mancato avvio dei negoziati e difende la propria “buona fede”, chiedendo che l‘applicazione del piano non venga ritardata.

“Abbiamo incontrato, con il viceministro [Teresa] Bellanova l‘azienda, e abbiamo comunicato che l‘apertura del tavolo in questi termini è irricevibile, soprattutto per quanto concerne gli impegni sui livelli di stipendio e inquadramento (dei lavoratori), su cui c‘era l‘impegno dell‘azienda a rispettare l‘attuale situazione”, ha detto Calenda.

I sindacati e molti esponenti politici dei diversi schieramenti hanno apprezzato la posizione netta del ministro.

Contrari al taglio di 4.800 dipendenti dal 2018 già proposto dal consorzio Am InvestCo (di cui fanno parte anche il Gruppo Marcegaglia e Intesa Sanpaolo), i sindacati hanno protestato nei giorni scorsi per la decisione degli acquirenti di cancellare l‘anzianità di servizio del personale riassunto, col rischio di pesanti decurtazioni salariali.

Oggi tutti gli stabilimenti del primo gruppo siderurgico sono in sciopero contro il piano di Am InvestCo.

“Comprendiamo l‘importanza dei livelli occupazionali per il Paese, infatti abbiamo mostrato flessibilità aumentando il numero degli occupati a 10.000 rispetto alla nostra offerta originaria”, ha detto Arcelor nella nota aggiungendo che “il resto sarà oggetto della negoziazione sindacale”.

Attualmente Ilva conta circa 14.200 dipendenti.

“Bene stop Governo al tavolo trattativa. Ma non è sufficiente. Su Ilva non accettabili licenziamenti, esternalizzazioni e riduzioni salari”, ha detto in un tweet Francesca Re David, segretaria generale della Fiom-Cgil.

Fabrizio Bentivogli, leader della Fim-Cisl, ha detto: “Sapevamo che il negoziato sarebbe stato durissimo ma con queste premesse più che un‘intesa ravvisiamo solo la volontà di scontro da parte dell‘azienda”.

Un partecipante non sindacale alla trattativa ha definito oggi “spigoloso” l‘atteggiamento dei rappresentanti di ArcelorMittal e dei suoi soci, e ha aggiunto: “Potevano almeno proporre un contratto integrativo per consentire ai lavoratori di recuperare il salario”.

I tagli chiesti riguardano in gran parte la sede di Taranto. Gli esuberi resterebbero in carico alla “vecchia” Ilva, quella gestita dai commissari dell‘amministrazione straordinaria, almeno fino al 2023, per attuare piano ambientale e bonifiche. Ma i sindacati e gli enti locali sono preoccupati per il loro destino dopo quella data.

Contemporaneamente Am InvestCo, il cui piano attende il via libera dell‘Antitrust Ue a fine mese, prevede investimenti per 2,3 miliardi di euro e, dal 2024, una produzione di oltre 8 milioni di tonnellate di acciaio l‘anno.

If Spanish authorities hoped strong-arm tactics against the referendum independence for Catalonia would nip nationalist feeling in the bud, they will almost certainly be proved badly wrong. Sunday’s footage of violent police action against unarmed demonstrators may prove just the catalyst pro-independence groups wanted, handing Europe yet another crisis when it needed it least.

Ironically, the government of Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy would have done better to simply ignore the non-binding referendum. It was always likely to produce a vote for independence, if only because those who favored it were far more likely to vote. Broader opinion polls conducted before the weekend ballot never showed majority support for independence, and most estimates suggest it has been ebbing steadily since 2013 to around 40 percent.

The scale of the violence this weekend and the brutality of the national police attempts to stop the ballot – almost 900 injured, according to local authorities – has changed everything. While the referendum was expected to be a polarizing event, the Spanish authorities have now effectively guaranteed it will be seen as a defining moment not just for Catalonia but the country at large. It would be astounding if it did not yield a substantial spike in separatist feeling. In a single day, the Rajoy government may have taken what should have been a manageable issue and escalated it into an existential challenge for Spain.

Catalonia’s governor Carles Puigdemont could always have been hoping to declare independence in the aftermath of the ballot. The widely reported violence, however, delivers a degree of political legitimacy to that fact. That doesn’t mean Spain will necessarily fracture – but it does dramatically increase the chances of that happening in the longer run.

A Spanish break-up will have broad implications for a continent that has spent much of the last decade bouncing from crisis to crisis, but had been having a better year than many U.S. and British pundits had anticipated. French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel both bested far-right challenges in national elections, growth is improving in eurozone economies and the refugee crisis appears to have stabilized.

Events in Spain, however, are a stark reminder that almost every European country remains trapped in a slow-burning political crisis with an ever-growing chance of unusual, unorthodox and outright aggressive nationalist or radical politics eroding the center ground.

In France, the National Front is clearly poised to take advantage of the faltering popularity of Macron, who defeated far-right leader Marine LePen in May. In Germany, Alternative for Germany (AfD) came in a strong third in last week’s election, and is now in parliament for the first time. The festering sore of Brexit continues to raise a host of challenges for both the EU and Britain, while Greece, Italy and Spain continue to struggle economically despite strong broader European growth.

So far, European nations are struggling to work out what their position should be with Spain. For all the public criticism of what is clearly seen as an unnecessarily heavy-handed Spanish clampdown, few European leaders have been willing to criticize Rajoy in public. Behind closed doors, however, the message will almost certainly be that the weekend’s scenes cannot be repeated.

Spain is not the only European country with separatist regions, and that will certainly be little appetite for a wider upswing in the regional nationalism. Just as serious, however, is the way events in Spain reinvigorate the wider European narrative of crisis.

Already, the euro was trading slightly lower on Monday on the news. Russian broadcasters and social media feeds – always keen to jump on anything that undermines the European political mainstream – gave front-page coverage to the news of riot police using rubber bullets and batons to stop the Catalonia vote. Wider international attention can be expected to continue, potentially exacerbating political polarization at every step.

Rajoy’s government is in a tricky situation. It must realize that more heavy-handed use of law enforcement will simply strengthen the separatist cause. Unlike more authoritarian states, Spain does not have the option of bludgeoning dissent into the ground. But nor can it afford to ignore events in Catalonia, for fear the now-heightened momentum behind the pro-independence movement grows still further.

The most obvious solution would be to offer Catalonians more regional autonomy. So far, however, there are few signs of that – and Rajoy’s early statements praising the police response and denying that the referendum has any legal force look set to aggravate tensions rather than ameliorate them.",Commentary: Spain's missteps supercharge the Catalonia crisis,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apps-catalonia-commentary/commentary-spains-missteps-supercharge-the-catalonia-crisis-idUSKCN1C724O

DETROIT (Reuters) - No. 1 U.S. automaker General Motors Co (GM.N) said on Monday it would buy Strobe Inc, which uses LIDAR technology to help self-driving cars identify objects at a distance, to speed up development of autonomous vehicles and slash sensor costs.

LIDAR is one of the major sensor technologies used in autonomous, or self-driving vehicles, and there is fierce competition between large automakers to bring the cars to market first.

Fully self-driving vehicles are expected to hit the market in a limited form by around 2020. GM and its U.S. rival Ford Motor Co (F.N) have both publicly stated that they aim to have fully self-driving cars on sale by 2021.

”This acquisition is a game changer for GM and Cruise,“ because of the cost savings it will bring,” Kyle Vogt, chief executive of GM’s Cruise Automation unit, said.

“We’ve made this acquisition because we aim to speed our path to market,” he added.

Strobe’s new microchip LIDAR system would significantly enhance the capabilities of the self-driving cars GM was developing, Vogt said in a blog post and on a conference call with reporters.

By reducing the entire sensor down to a single chip, Strobe’s system should reduce the cost of each LIDAR on its self-driving cars by 99 percent, he said.

The technology provided not just a distance measurement for an object on the road - vehicles, people and objects - but also measured that object’s velocity.

“This is really important for self-driving cars, especially in challenging situations,” Vogt said.

Vogt did not disclose financial terms, but said 11 full-time Strobe employees would join Cruise as part of the deal.

He said last week that the unit was making “rapid progress” toward deploying self-driving cars in part through testing vehicles on the crowded streets of San Francisco.

Tens of thousands of soldiers are taking part in the massive four-yearly war games that are both a drill as well as a show of strength for the West. Next time around, in 2021, those troops might be sharing their battle space with a different type of force: self-driving drones, tanks, ships and submersibles.

Drone warfare is hardly new – the first lethal attack conducted by an American unmanned aerial vehicle took place in Afghanistan in October 2001. What is now changing fast, however, is the ability of such unmanned systems to operate without a guiding human hand.

That’s a truly revolutionary shift – and one every major nation wants to be lead. Critics have long feared countries might be more willing to go to war with unmanned systems. Now, some see a very real risk control might pass beyond human beings altogether.

Tech entrepreneur Elon Musk has long warned that humanity might be on the verge of some cataclysmic errors when it comes to artificial intelligence. Last month, he ramped that up with a warning that the development of autonomous weapons platforms might provoke a potentially devastating arms race.

As if to reinforce Musk’s point, Russian President Vladimir Putin told students shortly thereafter that he believed the technology would be a game changer, making it clear Russia would plow resources into it. “The one who becomes leader in this will become ruler of the world,” Putin was quoted as saying.

China too is pushing ahead, believed by some experts to now be the global leader when it comes to developing autonomous swarms of drones.

Already, drones are able to fly themselves independently so they can stay airborne if they lose touch with human pilots. Soon they may be able to make their own tactical decisions. At Georgia Tech in the United States this summer, researchers programmed swarms of light drones to fight their own aerial dogfights. The U.S. military is trying out similar products.

That means one operator could command many, many more drones – or that they might not need direct supervision at all.

Even more important than what is happening in robotics may be the wider developments in artificial intelligence. That won’t make warfare necessarily more deadly – a bomb dropped from a drone is not in itself less lethal than one from a manned aircraft. While it’s possible that greater accuracy might reduce casualties, some analysts fear that the changes brought by new unmanned systems might themselves fuel new conflicts.

“Radical technological change begets radical government policy ideas,” concluded a July report on the topic produced for the U.S. intelligence community by Harvard University’s Belfer Center. It warned an “inevitable” AI arms race could prove as revolutionary as the invention of nuclear weapons.

Artificial intelligence could dramatically increase the efficiency of surveillance technology, allowing a single system to monitor perhaps millions of digital conversations, hacked personal devices and other sources of information. The implications could be terrifying, particularly in the hands of a state with little or no democratic oversight.

At a recent UK panel discussion, Britain’s former Special Forces director Lieutenant General Sir Graeme Lamb predicted that by 2030, technological breakthroughs – not just AI, but quantum computing and beyond – would produce entirely unpredictable changes. Special force teams, he suggested, might well have a robotic and artificial intelligence component deployed alongside them – the U.S. Army calls this “manned-unmanned teaming.”

That sounds like something out of science fiction – and it might well look like it. Last year, Russia unveiled its FEDOR humanoid military robot, which it demonstrated firing a gun.

Most countries deliberately keep their defense AI secret, ultimately fueling the arms race Musk was warning about. Some scientists already worry about a real-world version of the premise for the Arnold Schwarzenegger-starring “Terminator” film franchise in which the United States, fearing cyber attack, hands control of key military systems to the artificial intelligence Skynet. (Skynet, fearing its human creators might choose to turn it off, immediately launches a full-scale nuclear attack on humanity.)

For now, Western nations at least look keen to keep a human in the “kill chain.” Not all countries may make that choice, however. Russia has long had a reputation for trusting machines more than people, at one stage considering – and, some evidence suggests, building – an automated system to launch its nuclear arsenal should its command structure be destroyed by a first strike.

Outside of the military, there is evidence AI algorithms have already alarmed their creators. In August, Facebook shut down an AI experiment after programs involved began communicating with each other in a language the humans monitoring them could not understand.

Is this the end for ordinary human soldiering? Almost certainly not. It’s even been argued that a more complex, high-tech battlefield might require more soldiers, not fewer.

Robotic systems may be vulnerable to hacking, jamming and simply rendered inoperable through electronic warfare. Such techniques allow U.S.-led forces in Iraq to largely negate the off-the-shelf drones being used by Islamic State. Russia used similar techniques against Western-made drones in Ukraine.

That’s a worry for armed forces betting – like many industries – on automation. Britain’s new aircraft carrier has only a fraction of the sailors on its only slightly larger U.S. carrier counterparts, relying heavily on automatic systems to manage weaponry and damage control. The latest Russian tank, the T-14 Armata, has an automated turret that will usually be out of reach to most of its crew. Such techniques have clear advantages – but also mean that interfering with electronics could leave them useless.

Such technology is coming whether it is a good idea or not. Indeed, even relatively old military equipment increasingly can be retrofitted. Russian engineers have already demonstrated that they can adapt the 20-year-old T-90 tank to be controlled remotely.

Ironically, the North Korean crisis reminds us that the most dangerous technologies may well remain those invented more than 70 years ago – atomic weapons and the missiles that carry them. Even if mankind can avoid a nuclear apocalypse, however, the coming AI and robotic revolution may prove an equal existential challenge.",Commentary: The coming robot arms race,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apps-robots-commentary/commentary-the-coming-robot-arms-race-idUSKCN1BT1XN

(Reuters) - With a businessman turned politician now in the Oval Office, a small but growing number of bankers and Wall Street financiers across the United States have set their sights on politics.

In New Jersey, Connecticut and California, former bankers, hedge fund managers and private equity executives have either announced bids for legislative and gubernatorial seats, or associates have told Reuters they are considering running.

Meanwhile, industry trade groups including the American Bankers Association are launching formal programs to teach members in various states how to campaign successfully.

It is not the first time well-heeled candidates have entered American politics, and there are not a great number of them. But historians, political scientists and bankers say the atmosphere has changed abruptly under President Donald Trump.

“It’s certainly raised the visibility of folks who in the past may have said ‘I‘m not a politician,” said Richard Baier, president of the Nebraska Bankers Association, which is launching a training school for potential legislative candidates. “We’ve shown that you don’t really need that background.”

The Oklahoma Bankers Association is also planning to launch its own candidate school, a spokesman said.

Foreclosures, job losses and growing income inequality after the 2007-2009 financial crisis made anyone with Wall Street ties into a political pariah. But Trump, a self-described billionaire who made a fortune in New York real estate and entertainment, has stocked his cabinet with Wall Street bankers and industry tycoons.

His presidency has inspired others in the financial community to pursue civic duty, according to people who have studied campaigns or are involved with current election efforts.

Trump’s ascendance shows that candidates’ backgrounds matter less than whether they can connect with voters, said Joshua Sandman, a political science professor at the University of New Haven.

“Trump running has encouraged more people in financial services to test the waters,” he said, “but the water could be murky for them unless they have a real set of positive experiences within business and are reflective of creating jobs and helping people.”

It is hard to say quantitatively whether more candidates with finance backgrounds are pursuing political office now compared with prior election cycles. But Paul Herrnson, a political science professor at the University of Connecticut who has researched candidates’ backgrounds, says he is sceptical about how successful the new crop of candidates will be.

“Sure, the mood is better than it was when the market collapsed, but I don’t think people say, ‘Wall Street financier – that’s someone I can vote for,” he said.

Phil Murphy, the Democratic candidate for New Jersey governor in 2017, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc executive who spent 23 years at the firm, is perhaps the most prominent moneyed candidate.

His campaign has focussed on bolstering the middle class with proposals to create a millionaire’s tax and launch other initiatives to help low-income residents.

Murphy has won support from labour unions, environmental groups and consumer rights activists, as well as bold-faced names in the Democratic party like former Vice Presidents Joe Biden and Al Gore, who have both endorsed him.

FILE PHOTO: American environmentalist Tom Steyer speaks at the Netroots Nation annual conference for political progressives in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S. August 12, 2017. REUTERS/Christopher Aluka Berry/File Photo

An Oct. 3 Monmouth University Poll has him leading his Republican rival, Kim Guadagno by 14 points, and over 60 percent of New Jersey voters said Murphy’s ties to Goldman do not matter in a recent Quinnipiac Poll.

“Obviously Goldman was his career,” said Tony Bianchini, spokesman for the Northeast Regional Council of Carpenters, which is backing Murphy. “Everyone has a career.”

In Connecticut, former UBS Group AG executive Robert Stefanowski is running for governor, according to a public filing, and hedge fund manager David Stemerman recently said he may do the same.

The two Republicans have given few clues about their campaign strategies other than to cast themselves as outsiders who can fix Connecticut’s problems.

In California, two Wall Street veterans are mulling runs as progressive Democrats.

Tom Steyer, an environmentalist who worked at Goldman Sachs and was a hedge fund manager, may run for Senate or governor, a person familiar with the matter said. Joseph Sanberg, a former Tiger Global Management LLC executive, is also considering a Senate run, according to Politico. He casts himself as a “progressive entrepreneur” on his website.

Other ex-Wall Streeters who have entered politics have a mixed history, and much depends on how well their messages align with voters’ concerns, political historians said.

Influential in the field of behavioral economics, his research showed how traits such as lack of self-control and fear of losing what you already have prompt decisions that may not have the best outcome in the longer term.

“I think the most important impact (of my research) is the recognition that economic agents are human and economic models have to incorporate that,” Thaler, a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, said in call broadcast at the Nobel news conference.

Awarding the 9 million Swedish crown ($1.1 million) prize, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said: “Richard Thaler’s contributions have built a bridge between the economic and psychological analyses of individual decision-making.”

“His empirical findings and theoretical insights have been instrumental in creating the new and rapidly expanding field of behavioral economics, which has had a profound impact on many areas of economic research and policy.”

Thaler brought to prominence the idea of “nudge” economics, where individuals are subtly guided toward beneficial behaviors without heavy-handed compulsion, the theme of a 2008 book he co-wrote which caught the eye of policymakers around the world.

In researching how self-control - or the lack of it - Thaler touched on an age-old problem: why New Year’s resolutions to change aspects of your life are notoriously hard to keep.

The issue has relevance for economics as individuals’ tendency to fall prey to temptation often negatively affects plans to, for instance, save for retirement.

Together with Professor Cass Sunstein, he argued that society - while maintaining freedom of choice - should actively try to guide individuals in the right direction.

Their book, titled ‘Nudge: Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth, and Happiness’ became popular with some western politicians seeking ways to encourage their citizens to save and live healthily, without incurring voters’ wrath for raising taxes or banning behavior outright.

“This has also been used in public pension systems in the United States and the general idea of ‘nudging’ ... has made a breakthrough in public policy making,” Torsten Persson, economics prize committee member, told Reuters.

“There’s also a nudging unit for the UK government, there’s one for the Australian government, it even affects the Swedish government when they think about these things.”’

David Laibson, chair of Harvard University’s economics department, said many of Thaler’s theories have been widely applied by business and government, aiming to get individuals to do a range of actions such as paying parking tickets and getting flu shots.

“If you live in a developed country, there’s some firm or entity that has read these ideas and started to affect your life,” Laibson said.

Influential in academic circles, the movie-going public may have noticed Thaler make a brief cameo in the 2015 film “The Big Short”, explaining the so-called “hot-hand fallacy” where past success is expected to also warrant success in the future, with pop star Selena Gomez.

Asked how he would spend his prize money, Thaler said:

“I will spend it as irrationally as possible.”

MANY AMERICANS, NO WOMEN

The economics prize, officially called the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, was established in 1968. It was not part of the original group of awards set out in dynamite tycoon Nobel’s 1895 will.

Economy is the last of this year’s Nobels, with prizes for physiology or medicine, physics, chemistry, literature and peace awarded last week.

The United States has dominated the economics prize, with American economists accounting for roughly half of laureates since the inception of the award. Indeed, between 2000 and 2013, U.S. academics won or shared the prize every year.

While Americans have dominated the Nobel science and economics prizes, another category of researchers - women - have been few and far between. Indeed only one women - Elinor Ostrom in 2009 - has won the economics prize to date, and not a single individual women won any Nobel award in 2017.

“We are disappointed looking in a larger perspective that there aren’t more women who have been rewarded,” the Academy’s secretary general Goran Hansson said.

He said the Academy would hold a conference to discuss the issue and nominators will be asked to identify women scientists for recognition and also consider ethnic and geographic diversity.

“We are concerned, we are taking measures.

GUAYNABO, Puerto Rico (Reuters) - With the Puerto Rico power grid shredded by Hurricane Maria, the U.S. Postal Service has taken the place of cellphone service at the forefront of island communications.

Only 15 percent of electrical power has been restored since the storm bludgeoned the U.S. territory on Sept. 20, but 99 of Puerto Rico’s 128 post offices are delivering mail. Tents have taken the place of post offices wrecked by Maria.

Mail carriers gather information on sick and elderly residents in far-flung parts where hospitals have closed. Data is fed into the Federal Emergency Management Agency disaster relief office in San Juan so medical attention can be provided.

Restoration of the power grid is months away and many rural roads are blocked by mudslides, sink holes and downed trees and telephone poles. Since the start of the month the Postal Service has nonetheless been delivering letters and care packages to family members desperate for news.

“It’s been a clutch situation, and you guys have totally come through,” a FEMA worker was heard telling Postal Service Caribbean customer service manager Martin Caballero on Sunday.

“We might know the general area where people need help, but the mail carriers are the only ones who really have the exact addresses,” the FEMA worker told Reuters, asking not to be named because he was not authorized to speak to news media.

Caballero regularly goes on AM radio, which can be heard by listeners lucky enough to have diesel to run generators, to tell people in inaccessible parts of the island where their mail is being held. He invites them to pick it up, but only when travel conditions become safe.

Even for urban middle-class customers in the San Juan suburb of Guaynabo, whose concrete homes were not smashed by the storm, it was a chore to recover their blown-away mailboxes or build new ones. Hurricane or not, the Postal Service will not drop off mail without a designated box.

LONDON (Reuters) - Iran promised on Monday to give a “crushing” response if the United States designated its elite Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist group.

The pledge came a week before President Donald Trump announces a final decision on how he wants to contain the Islamic Republic.

He is expected on Oct. 15 to “decertify” a landmark 2015 international deal to curb Iran’s nuclear program, a step that by itself stops short of pulling out of the agreement but gives Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions.

Trump is also expected to designate Iran’s most powerful security force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corp (IRGC) as a terrorist organization, as he rolls out a broader, more hawkish U.S. strategy on Iran.

“We are hopeful that the United States does not make this strategic mistake,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi was quoted as saying by the state news agency IRNA.

“If they do, Iran’s reaction would be firm, decisive and crushing and the United States should bear all its consequences,” he told a news conference reported by IRNA.

Individuals and entities associated with the IRGC are already on the U.S. list of foreign terrorist organizations, but the organization as a whole is not.

IRGC commander Mohammad Ali Jafari said on Sunday, “If the news is correct about the stupidity of the American government in considering the Revolutionary Guards a terrorist group, then the Revolutionary Guards will consider the American army to be like Islamic State all around the world.”

Jafari also said that additional sanctions would end chances for future dialogue with the United States and that the Americans would have to move their regional bases outside the 2,000 km (1,250 mile) range of IRGC’s missiles.

WARY EUROPE

U.S. sanctions on the IRGC could affect conflicts in Iraq and Syria, where Tehran and Washington both support warring parties that oppose the Islamic State militant group (IS).

France said on Monday it was worried that classifying the IRGC as a terrorist group could exacerbate tensions in the region.

Germany said it was worried Trump would decide Iran is not respecting the nuclear deal, negotiated under his predecessor Barack Obama, and fears such a step will worsen insecurity in the Middle East.

A U.S. pullout could unravel an accord seen by supporters as vital to preventing a Middle East arms race and tamping down regional tensions, since it limits Iran’s ability to enrich uranium for nuclear fuel in exchange for the lifting of sanctions that damaged its oil-based economy.

The U.N. nuclear watchdog’s inspectors have repeatedly declared Iran in compliance with the terms of the nuclear deal.

Trump called Iran “a corrupt dictatorship” during his first speech to the U.N. General Assembly and said the nuclear deal was “the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into”.

The other five world powers in the deal were Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China.

The prospect of the United States reneging on the agreement has worried other partners that helped negotiate it.

The Kremlin said that any U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal would have “negative consequences.”

British Prime Minister Theresa May, who supports the nuclear pact, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who opposes it, agreed in a phone call on Monday that they need to be “clear-eyed” about the threat Iran poses to the Middle East.

“They agreed that ... the international community should continue working together to push back against Iran’s destabilizing regional activity,” May’s spokesman said.

“MALIGN ACTIVITIES”

Despite the nuclear deal, Washington still maintains its own more limited sanctions on Iran over its ballistic missile program and over accusations Tehran supports terrorism.

Iran says it is developing missiles solely for defensive purposes and denies involvement in terrorism.

The Trump administration aims to put more pressure on the IRGC, especially over recent missile tests and what Washington has called its “malign activities” across the Middle East.

The U.S. government imposed sanctions in July on 18 entities and people for supporting the IRGC in developing drones and military equipment. In August, Congress overwhelmingly approved the “Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act” which imposed new sanctions on Iran for its ballistic missile program, as well as sanctions on Russia and North Korea.

In an interview aired on Saturday night, Trump accused Iran of “funding North Korea” and “doing things with North Korea that are totally inappropriate”.

Qasemi, Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman, said the U.S. accusations were “baseless”. He added, “Israel and some specific countries are raising these accusations to create Iranophobia.”",Iran promises 'crushing' response if U.S. designates Guards a terrorist group,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-usa-irgc/iran-promises-crushing-response-if-u-s-designates-guards-a-terrorist-group-tasnim-idUSKBN1CE0M2

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union negotiators see no big breakthrough in a new round of Brexit talks from Monday nor when Theresa May attends a summit next week, yet leaders could offer the beleaguered British prime minister a hand, EU officials believe.

Talks which began on Monday in Brussels have a thin schedule - British Brexit Secretary David Davis is to meet EU negotiator Michel Barnier on Tuesday and again on Thursday. But Wednesday is blank on the timetable and officials will not touch on the knottiest outstanding problem - how much Britain pays the EU.

That all but rules out “miracles” on key divorce issues that Barnier’s boss says are needed for May’s 27 fellow EU leaders to agree to open the talks she wants on a post-Brexit free trade pact when they all meet in Brussels next Thursday and Friday.

The prime minister revived an increasingly sour dialogue two weeks ago by offering concessions in a speech in Florence. But talks that followed left big gaps on three core issues on which the EU demands “significant progress” before Barnier can so much as mention what happens after Britain leaves in 18 months time.

Yet such is the opposition to compromise that May faces within her own party that many EU diplomats think leaders could give her some hope at the summit to help her face down calls for Britain to simply walk out without a deal - an eventuality that the Europeans are nonetheless preparing for.

“My guess is the leaders will try to find some positive elements,” one senior diplomat told Reuters, saying May could be offered hope of a “landing zone” for accords to let the next scheduled summit, in mid-December, approve trade talks.

This week could see further movement on agreeing rights for expatriate citizens, where the role of EU judges is in dispute. But few see much movement on the Irish border or on the money.

And with May and the EU batting back and forth assertions that the ball is in the other’s court, attention is fast turning from this week’s meetings to next week’s summit.

ENCOURAGEMENT FOR MAY

Not one of over a dozen senior EU officials and diplomats who spoke to Reuters expect the summit to launch talks on future trade, few rule out that May’s counterparts may give her some assurance of doing so soon - and even offer some limited exploration of the transition period she has asked for.

“She is in a difficult situation, if she goes out there and there is nothing tangible on our side,” a senior EU official said, saying governments wanted to keep up momentum for a deal that would avoid legal chaos across Europe. “We’ll try to be neutral, maybe even offer an encouraging line to stay engaged.”

Nonetheless, governments are extremely wary of any attempt by British negotiators to divide their solid display of unity and are anxious not to appear to be going soft on May, despite some sympathy for the balancing act she faces.

On Friday, envoys from many of the 27 including heavyweights Germany and France opposed suggestions from Barnier that they might start some preliminary discussion of what exactly will happen in the transition period immediately after Brexit.

“This situation is not a reason for the Commission to loosen its guidelines,” a senior official from a big EU power said of May’s domestic woes. “I believe she really wants a deal but we can’t alter our negotiating stance because of that.”

Nonetheless, several diplomats said leaders could soften the stance on transition talks by next week. Leaders say they will not negotiate directly with May and want to channel everything through Barnier. But May’s powerful peers may find it hard to sit back and watch her fail, provoking further British turmoil.

“The leaders want to lead, they want to make history,” said another senior EU diplomat who said the summiteers could break next week from the advice of their own officials. “Who can say that they won’t just say, ‘OK, let’s just get on with it’?”","Brexit talks stutter, but EU leaders might give May break",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-negotiations/brexit-talks-stutter-but-eu-leaders-might-give-may-break-idUKKBN1CE0QO

LONDON (Reuters) - Maersk (MAERSKb.CO) can no longer transport goods in or out of Qatar after Arab countries imposed restrictions on trade with the tiny Gulf state and the company is looking at alternative shipping routes.

Shipping lines normally transship cargoes from the United Arab Emirates port of Jebel Ali to Qatar, which relies heavily on imports by sea and land.

A Maersk Line spokesman said on Tuesday: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

“We expect disruptions to our Qatar services. The situation is very fluid,” the spokesman said, adding that Maersk would notify customers about alternative options as soon as possible.

The spokesman said the company, which is the world’s biggest container shipping line, was looking at other routes such as Oman.

Larger container ships are unable to dock at ports in Qatar due in part to shallow waters so shipping lines use feeder services, which transport container boxes from the larger port of Jebel Ali in the United Arab Emirates.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

Ports have also been directly affected, which has disrupted trade in commodities from crude oil to metals and food.

The ban has meant that any ship sailing to and from Qatar will be prevented from calling at major ports in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, which include Jebel Ali, as well as Bahrain.

Food imports have been affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies.

Trade sources said the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already cut exports of white sugar to Qatar.

COX‘S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Thousands of Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar fled to Bangladesh on Monday in a new surge of refugees driven by fears of starvation and violence the United Nations has denounced as ethnic cleansing.

About 519,000 Rohingya have crossed the border since Aug. 25, when attacks by Rohingya militants on security posts in Rakhine state sparked a ferocious military response.

The European Union (EU) is proposing shunning contact with Myanmar’s top generals as a first step toward new targeted sanctions to punish the military for the violence, according to a draft document seen by Reuters.

Reuters reporters on the Bangladeshi side of the border, in Palong Khali district, saw several thousand people crossing from northern Rakhine on Monday, filing along embankments between flooded fields and scrubby forest.

“Half of my village was burnt down. I saw them do it,” said Sayed Azin, 46, who said he had walked for eight days carrying his 80-year-old mother in a basket strung on a bamboo pole between him and his son.

Soldiers and Buddhist mobs had torched his village, he said.

“I left everything,” he said, sobbing. “I can’t find my relatives ... I can’t take this any more.”

Some new arrivals spoke of bloody attacks by Buddhist mobs on people trekking toward the border.

Refugees and rights groups say the army and Buddhist vigilantes have engaged in a campaign of killing and arson aimed at driving the Rohingya out of Myanmar.

Myanmar rejects accusations of ethnic cleansing and has labeled the militants from the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army who launched the initial attacks as terrorists who have killed civilians and burnt villages.

Among those fleeing were up to 35 people on a boat that capsized off the Bangladesh coast on Sunday. At least 12 of them drowned while 13 were rescued, Bangladeshi police said.

“We faced so many difficulties, for food and survival,” Sayed Hossein, 30, told Reuters, adding that his wife, three children, mother and father in law had drowned.

“We came here to save our lives.”

“GETTING WORSE”

Myanmar leader and Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi has faced scathing international criticism for not doing more to stop the violence, although she has no power over the security forces under a military-drafted constitution.

The United States and EU have been considering targeted sanctions against Myanmar military leaders, diplomats and officials have told Reuters, though they are wary of action that could destabilize the country’s transition to democracy.

EU foreign ministers will discuss the situation in Myanmar on Oct. 16, and their draft joint statement said the bloc “will suspend invitations to the commander-in-chief of the Myanmar/Burma armed forces and other senior military officers”.

Such a move would be largely symbolic, but could be followed by further action.

The Myanmar government has said its “clearance operations” against the militants ended in early September and people had no reason to flee. But in recent days the government has reported large numbers of Muslims preparing to leave, with more than 17,000 people in one area alone.

The government cited worries about food and security as their reasons.

Some villagers in Rakhine said food was running out because rice in the fields was not ready for harvest and the state government had closed village markets and restricted the transport of food, apparently to cut supplies to the militants.

“The situation’s getting worse. We have no food and no guarantee of security,” said a Rohingya resident of Hsin Hnin Pyar village on the south of the state’s Buthidaung district.

He said a lot of people were preparing to flee.

“While the Myanmar military has engaged in a campaign of violence, there is mounting evidence that Rohingya women, men and children are now also fleeing the very real threat of starvation,” rights group Amnesty International said.

Senior state government official Kyaw Swar Tun declined to go into details when asked about the food, except to ask: “Have you heard of anyone dying of hunger in Buthidaung?”

The reports of food shortages will add to the urgency of calls by aid agencies and the international community for unfettered humanitarian access to the conflict zone.

COMING, GOING

The insurgents declared a one-month ceasefire from Sept. 10 to enable the delivery of aid but the government rebuffed them, saying it did not negotiate with terrorists.

The ceasefire is due to end at midnight on Monday, but the insurgents said in a statement they were ready to respond to any peace move by the government.

The ability of the group to mount any sort of challenge to the army is unclear, but it does not appear to have been able to put up resistance to the latest military offensive.

Bangladesh was already home to 400,000 Rohingya who had fled earlier bouts of violence.

Mostly Buddhist Myanmar does not recognize the Rohingya as citizens, even though many have lived there for generations.

But even as refugees arrive, Bangladesh insists they will all have to go home. Myanmar has responded by saying it will take back those who can be verified as genuine refugees.

Many Rohingya fear they will not be able to prove their right to return.

(Reuters) - Uber said on Monday it would suspend its unlicensed service UberPOP in Oslo until Norway introduces new rules, as the U.S. ride-hailing app adopts a more conciliatory tone with national authorities.

The move follows a similar one-year suspension in Finland in July to allow a new taxi law to come into effect, however there is no set date for when UberPOP will be reintroduced in Norway.

The U.S. ride-hailing company has come under fierce pressure from traditional taxi drivers and regulators across Europe who accuse it of unfair competition and skirting traditional licensing rules.

UberPOP has already been suspended in several European capitals, including Paris and Brussels, and Uber was recently humbled when it lost its license to operate in London.

“We’ve learned the hard way that we must change as a company in order to serve the millions of riders and drivers who rely on us. With our new CEO Dara Khosrowshahi onboard, it’s a new era for Uber,” the company said in a statement.

“That’s why it’s now time to pause UberPOP in Norway, in order to relaunch under new regulations.”

UberPOP will be suspended on Oct. 30, while Uber’s licensed services UberBLACK and UberXXL will continue to operate as normal.

The Norwegian transport minister said Uber was being treated as any other market participant would be. “All actors offering taxi services must conform to rules and regulation at any time,” Ketil Solvik-Olsen told Reuters.

The suspension of UberPOP in Norway comes as the non-EU country must answer by Oct. 27 a query on its transport regulations by the EFTA Surveillance Authority (ESA), the body that ensures EU regulations are enforced in countries that have access to the European common market.

Uber will suspend UberPOP three days after that deadline.

In February, ESA said Norway was setting “disproportionately high barriers to enter the taxi market” that led to inefficient use of resources and higher prices for consumers.

Khosrowshahi took the helm of Uber in August, replacing co-founder and former boss Travis Kalanick and has promised change at the $70 billion dollar firm.

The company said it was encouraged by developments in Norway such as the government’s sharing economy committee which recommended repealing certain provisions related to taxis and an opinion from the EFTA surveillance authority which said Norway’s restrictions on taxi licenses were illegal.

“Norway deserves modernized laws that encourage innovation and competition without sacrificing what makes the Norwegian model special,” Uber said. “We hope the government will implement these recommendations soon, so that we can relaunch a new and improved version of the product loved by so many.”

Pence was attending a game in his home state of Indiana between the Indianapolis Colts and the San Francisco 49ers.

When the national anthem was played before the start of the game, some 49ers knelt while some Colts, their arms locked, wore black T-shirts with the words “We Will” on the front and “Stand for equality, justice, unity, respect, dialogue, opportunity” on the back.

“I left today’s Colts game because President Trump and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem,” Pence said in a statement issued by the White House.

Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said after his team’s game on Sunday that he would bench players who disrespect the U.S. flag.

“If there is anything that is disrespectful to the flag then we will not play,” Jones told reporters.

Asked about Pence’s departure, Jones said: ”We cannot in the NFL in any way give the implication that we tolerate disrespecting the flag.

“I know the vice president did leave, because in his opinion the teams were,” he said, adding: “There is no question in my mind that the National Football League and the Dallas Cowboys are going to stand up for the flag.”

But the NFL Players Association in a statement defended players’ right to protest.

“We should not stifle these discussions and cannot allow our rights to become subservient to the very opinions our Constitution protects,” the association said, adding, in words that borrowed from the national anthem, “that is what makes us the land of the free and the home of the brave.”

After Pence’s departure, critics began to question whether he had only attended the game in order to make a production of leaving, pointing out he flew from Las Vegas on Saturday and was then going to fly to California on Sunday evening.

Pence had planned for “several weeks” to attend Sunday’s Colts game, where former quarterback Peyton Manning was being honored, an official in his office said, asking not to be named. Additionally, he made a last-minute decision to travel to Las Vegas for a prayer service on Saturday, the official said.

“As he had discussed with the president, when several 49ers players disrespected the flag and the national anthem, the vice president decided to leave the game,” the official said.

President Donald Trump said in a tweet on Sunday that he had asked Pence to leave the stadium “if any player kneeled, disrespecting our country.”

NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy declined to comment.

The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution bars the government from limiting free speech, including prohibiting protests of the national anthem or punishing people who choose not to stand. The national anthem is played before every NFL football game and many other sporting events.

Less than an hour after issuing Pence’s statement, the White House released a picture of him and his wife at the stadium where the game took place, standing with hands over their hearts during the performance of the national anthem.

Trump’s criticism of the NFL players has played well with his conservative base while he grapples with controversies over Iran and North Korea, an investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 election and policy struggles in Congress.

Five months into Trump’s presidency, the survey spanning 37 nations showed U.S. favorability ratings in the rest of the world slumping to 49 percent from 64 percent at the end of Barack Obama’s eight years in the White House.

But the falls were far steeper in some of America’s closest allies, including U.S. neighbors Mexico and Canada, and European partners like Germany and Spain.

Trump took office in January pledging to put “America First”. Since then he has pressed ahead with plans to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, announced he will pull out of the Paris climate accord, and accused countries including Canada, Germany and China of unfair trade practices.

On his first foreign trip as president in early June, Trump received warm welcomes in Saudi Arabia and Israel, but a cool reception from European partners, with whom he clashed over NATO spending, climate and trade.

Just 30 percent of Mexicans now say they have a favorable view of the United States, down from 66 percent at the end of the Obama era. In Canada and Germany, favorability ratings slid by 22 points, to 43 percent and 35 percent, respectively.

In many European countries, the ratings were comparable to those seen at the end of the presidency of George W. Bush, whose 2003 invasion of Iraq was deeply unpopular.

“The drop in favorability ratings for the United States is widespread,” the Pew report said. “The share of the public with a positive view of the U.S. has plummeted in a diverse set of countries from Latin America, North America, Europe, Asia and Africa”.

The survey, based on the responses of 40,447 people and conducted between Feb. 16 and May 8 this year, showed even deeper mistrust of Trump himself, with only 22 percent of those surveyed saying they had confidence he would do the right thing in world affairs, compared to 64 percent who trusted Obama.

Both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, with confidence ratings of 27 percent and 28 percent respectively, scored higher than Trump. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, with a confidence rating of 42 percent, scored highest among the four leaders in the survey.

The countries with the lowest confidence in Trump were Mexico, at 5 percent and Spain at 7 percent. The only two countries where ratings improved compared to Obama were Russia, where confidence in the U.S. president surged to 53 percent from 11 percent, and Israel, where it rose 7 points to 56 percent.

Globally, 75 percent of respondents described Trump as “arrogant”, 65 percent as “intolerant” and 62 percent as “dangerous”. A majority of 55 percent also described him as a “strong leader”.

The survey showed widespread disapproval of Trump’s signature policy proposals, with 76 percent unhappy with his plan to build the wall on the border with Mexico, 72 percent against his withdrawal from major trade agreements and 62 percent opposed to his plans to restrict travel to the U.S. from some majority-Muslim countries.

LONDON (Reuters) - For years the options market that companies and investors use to hedge against big swings in currencies viewed the euro as a bigger political and structural risk than Britain’s pound.

No more.

In the political and market turmoil immediately before and following Britain’s decision last June to leave the European Union, financial market investors flipped their long-held bias against the euro and now expect sterling to be the riskier party for years to come.

Reuters data going back to 2012 shows three- and five-year risk reversals -- the cost of taking out an option to buy or sell the pound -- have consistently been below zero.

That indicated it was almost always more expensive to hedge against the risk of euro exchange rates collapsing than of the same happening in sterling.

There are always blips. On a handful of occasions since Mario Draghi’s promise to do “whatever it takes” to prop up the euro in 2012, the single currency has briefly been valued as steadier for the long term.

But since an initial jump in the first six months of 2016, both three- and five-year euro-sterling risk reversal contracts have held consistently in positive territory, indicating the tail risk -- the risk of a low probability, high impact event -- is now instead with the pound.

That is the first time in Reuters’ historical data on the options market and means it will be increasingly costly for investors exposed to the pound’s exchange rate to insure portfolios against further slides.

With the pound pummelled by political and economic uncertainty, the euro/sterling five-year risk reversal on Thursday matched its highest in 11 months, showing an increased bias towards sterling weakness.

This followed open disagreement among Bank of England policymakers on the outlook for interest rates and, by extension, the pound.

On Tuesday BoE Governor Mark Carney said now was not the time to raise rates, warning of weak wage growth as Britain prepared to quit the EU.

On Wednesday, the central bank’s chief economist, Andy Haldane, said he was likely to join those voting for a hike later this year.

Bankers are cautious about predicting further steep falls in the pound, but some senior currency market players wonder what will happen to sterling if Brexit talks turn bad.

Some in the sales teams that focus on selling cheap option plays to hedge fund investors wanting to speculate on currency moves say the change is reflective of the broad swing in political risk.

“Risk reversals tend to price fear,” said the head of hedge fund sales with one of the big five international banks who run 40 percent of the $5 trillion a day global currency market.

“It is when you are thinking you are going to get a big gap move. And historically the gap move that was on people’s minds over the last five years was the euro break-up story. This signals a change in the potential tail risks.”

At a time when global measures of volatility are at rock bottom, those in sterling have jumped in the past fortnight, driven initially by a shock electoral turnaround that saw Prime Minister Theresa May deprived of her parliamentary majority.

Analysts say the move in the longer-term risk reversals, however, point to a broader questioning of faith in the pound.

“The market is willing to pay a higher premium to hedge against a large sterling depreciation,” said Sam Lynton-Brown, a strategist with BNP Paribas in London.

“That is a change.”","Forget euro zone breakup, sterling now deemed riskier",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-sterling-options-analysis/forget-euro-zone-breakup-sterling-now-deemed-riskier-idUSKBN19E0WV

Weakness in sterling helped the index to its strongest week in 10 months last week but the pound’s bounce from lows after the weekend reined in the heavily internationally exposed index.

Analysts said although the inverse relationship between sterling and the FTSE had somewhat loosened in the last weeks, the pound’s sharp sell-off last week had brought it back into focus as it drove the equity index higher.

“The FTSE has had a pretty good rally, it’s verging on overbought now so it might just be a little bit of short-term weariness,” said Ian Williams, economics and strategy analyst at Peel Hunt.

VIELHA, Spain (Reuters) - If Catalonia declares independence from Spain this week, one community in the region’s mountainous north might declare independence from Catalonia.

Most people in the picturesque Aran Valley - a semi-autonomous community nestled among the Pyrenees - want to stay with Spain, and the area has the right to self-determination under a law passed in 2015 by the Catalan parliament.

“We’re a little spot on the map and often we’re not taken into account,” said Maria Verges Perez, the deputy mayor of Aran’s capital, Vielha, a cluster of stone-and-slate houses on the valley floor ringed by autumnal forests.

“But we will exercise our right to decide our future.”

Catalan President Carles Puigdemont is expected to declare independence on Tuesday in Spain’s worst constitutional crisis since the return of democracy in the 1970s.

The roughly 10,000 people of Aran, on the border with France, have a language and culture distinct from the rest of Catalonia, which itself differs from the rest of Spain. The valley’s economy is heavily dependent on winter sports tourists from Spain and the EU.

Their politicians say the 2015 law gives them the right to vote on whether they want to break away with Catalonia - something which Catalan officials do not dispute.

The Spanish government has vowed to prevent Catalonia seceding. Losing the region would deprive the country of 16 percent of its people and a fifth of its economic output.

But while Madrid insists Spain is indivisible under its constitution, the Aran Valley underlines the complex nature of nationhood in such a culturally diverse country.

Ever since Spain’s return to democracy in the 1970s, Madrid has struggled to balance the country’s patchwork of regional identities, including its decades-long fight to quell separatism in the northern Basque Country led by violent militants ETA.

Few in the medieval villages along the Aran Valley doubt the community would opt to stay with Spain if asked to vote.

“The people here feel very far away from what is going on in Barcelona,” said Carlos Barrera, head of the Aran government, at a rural festival in Salardu village where locals judged stocky Pyrenean horses and handed out racks of blood sausages.

CROWN OF ARAGON

The valley had the lowest voter turnout by far in Catalonia’s Oct. 1 independence referendum, which had been declared illegal by Spain’s constitutional court.

Across Catalonia there was a 43 percent turnout, with most people who wanted to remain in Spain staying home, and 90 percent of those who voted backed secession. In Aran, just 24 percent voted, with 84 percent of those backing independence.

The valley traces its political allegiances back to pacts drawn up in the 13th century with the Crown of Aragon, a monarchy that would join with the Crown of Castille two centuries later to form what became Spain. Many locals speak Aranese, a dialect of the Occitan language still spoken in pockets of the Pyrenees and southern France.

Two years ago, the Catalan parliament approved the “Law on Aran’s Special Status”, giving it control over its culture, language and administration and recognizing “the right of the Aranese people to decide their future”.

A Catalan government spokesman said Catalonia would respect the Aranese people’s decision in any future referendum.

A Spanish government spokesman declined to comment on whether Aran could remain part of Spain, saying Catalonia would never become independent.

Aran’s residents are some of the sternest critics of the Catalan government which they say is ignoring those people who want to stay in Spain and charging toward independence at any cost.

In Vielha, a lone red and yellow Catalan independence flag hanging from an apartment block was the only evidence last Saturday of the separatist fever sweeping many parts of the region, where cities convulse with protests triggered by Madrid’s violent crackdown on the referendum.

PRICE OF INDEPENDENCE

Many people in Aran fear Catalan independence would destroy its tourism economy which revolves around Baqueira-Beret, Spain’s most popular ski resort.

About two-thirds of the population in Aran depend on the ski resort for jobs. In the winter, the population triples with the influx of skiers drawn to the same slopes used by Spain’s royal family.

Since the referendum, Verges Perez, the Vielha deputy mayor, said potential visitors had canceled almost 30 percent of hotel reservations for next week’s local holidays. And if an independent Catalonia was no longer part of the European Union, Aran’s reliance on agreements to use French hospitals for medical emergencies would be jeopardized, she added.

“That’s the trap. Nobody has explained the price that independence like this would have,” she said.

Many of Catalonia’s largest businesses have already said they are transferring their headquarters out of the region due to the political turmoil. Insurance firm Catalana Occidente, owned by the same family that owns Baqueira-Beret, is reportedly considering doing the same, although it has not confirmed it.

The valley ranks as one of Catalonia’s wealthiest regions, thanks to a tunnel that opened it up to the rest of Spain in 1948. Before then, it was a poor area only accessible by an often snow-covered mountain pass.

The valley’s politicians say holding their own referendum could be the only way to defend the local economy.

But Jaime Geli, Salardu’s 72-year-old former mayor and one of the few independence supporters here, said locals shouldn’t be so quick to throw their lot in with Spain instead of sticking with Catalonia.

Catalan authorities had protected the Aranese culture and language from a central government hostile to the idea that Spain is made up of different “nations”, he said, sat by the valley’s river.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The Gujarat High Court jailed 11 men for life on Monday, for setting fire to a train carrying Hindu pilgrims in 2002, which sparked the country’s worst religious riots in decades, a lawyer said.

The killing of the 59 pilgrims, while the train stopped at Godhra, a station about 120 km (75 miles) distant from the state capital of Gandhinagar, led to attacks on minority Muslims in which more than 2,500 people were killed, activists say.

Modi, the state’s chief minister at the time, faced allegations of turning a blind eye to the attacks on Muslims, but a court-appointed investigation panel absolved him of responsibility.

(Reuters) - World number one Rafael Nadal produced a ruthless performance to thrash Australian Nick Kyrgios 6-2 6-1 in the China Open final on Sunday for his 75th career singles title.

The 31-year-old was given a tough fight early on but Kyrgios’s challenge faded after he lost his temper and was docked a penalty point at 2-5 in the first set.

Nadal’s previous title at the tournament came 12 years ago.

“I had very tough draw here,” Nadal, who saved match points in his opening round against Frenchman Lucas Pouille, said.

“I was lucky the first day saving the two match points but after that I think I played one of my best events of the year.”

World number 19 Kyrgios matched Nadal early on, winning his opening two service games but became involved in a debate with umpire Mohamed Lahyani over a close line call against him.

“I can’t play at 100 percent if that stuff happens -- and then you expect me not to be angry,” Kyrgios told Lahyani.

He continued to argue the toss with the official who eventually awarded a penalty point against the Australian during the changeover when he trailed 2-5, meaning he began the eighth game already 0-15 behind.

Nadal was well in control by then and he raced into a 5-0 lead in the second set before Kyrgios slightly delayed the inevitable as the Spaniard sauntered to his 12th consecutive win.

“He played well. I played terrible. He’s in great form. He just destroyed me today, so it was too good,” Kyrgios, who struck 20 winners but 35 unforced errors, said.

“I put in a pretty good week, had some good wins. It’s tough to find positives when you won three games in the final. But I guess there were positives. In the semi-final I played well, obviously beating Alex (Zverev).”

DETROIT (Reuters) - No. 1 U.S. automaker General Motors Co (GM.N) said on Monday it would buy Strobe Inc, which uses LIDAR technology to help self-driving cars identify objects at a distance, to speed up development of autonomous vehicles and slash sensor costs.

LIDAR is one of the major sensor technologies used in autonomous, or self-driving vehicles, and there is fierce competition between large automakers to bring the cars to market first.

Fully self-driving vehicles are expected to hit the market in a limited form by around 2020. GM and its U.S. rival Ford Motor Co (F.N) have both publicly stated that they aim to have fully self-driving cars on sale by 2021.

”This acquisition is a game changer for GM and Cruise,“ because of the cost savings it will bring,” Kyle Vogt, chief executive of GM’s Cruise Automation unit, said.

“We’ve made this acquisition because we aim to speed our path to market,” he added.

Strobe’s new microchip LIDAR system would significantly enhance the capabilities of the self-driving cars GM was developing, Vogt said in a blog post and on a conference call with reporters.

By reducing the entire sensor down to a single chip, Strobe’s system should reduce the cost of each LIDAR on its self-driving cars by 99 percent, he said.

The technology provided not just a distance measurement for an object on the road - vehicles, people and objects - but also measured that object’s velocity.

“This is really important for self-driving cars, especially in challenging situations,” Vogt said.

Vogt did not disclose financial terms, but said 11 full-time Strobe employees would join Cruise as part of the deal.

He said last week that the unit was making “rapid progress” toward deploying self-driving cars in part through testing vehicles on the crowded streets of San Francisco.

Trump did not make clear to what he was referring, but his comments seemed to be a further suggestion that military action was on his mind.

The president has previously said the United States would “totally destroy” North Korea if necessary to protect itself and its allies from Pyongyang’s nuclear threats.

Earlier this week, during a meeting with top U.S. military leaders and their spouses, Trump told reporters it was the “calm before the storm.” Asked for clarification then on what he meant, Trump said: “You’ll find out.”

Speaking to reporters on Saturday ahead of a trip to North Carolina, Trump said he had nothing more to clarify.

Asked on Saturday about Trump’s tweet, Sanders said she had nothing to add to the president’s comments.

The Pentagon referred a question for clarification to the White House and said the Defense Department’s job was to “present the president military options and carry out orders.”

Trump repeatedly has made clear his distaste for dialogue with North Korea. On Sunday he dismissed the idea of talks as a waste of time, a day after Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Washington was maintaining open lines of communication with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s government.

Trump said on Saturday that he had a good relationship with his secretary of state despite some disagreements.

”We have a very good relationship. We disagree on a couple of things. Sometimes I’d like him to be a little bit tougher, but other than that we have a very good relationship,” he said.

A Russian lawmaker on Friday was quoted saying North Korea was preparing to test a long-range missile that it believes can reach the west coast of the United States. Anton Morozov, a member of the Russian lower house of parliament’s international affairs committee, was part of a Russian delegation that visited Pyongyang from Oct. 2-6, according to Russian RIA news agency.

TBILISI (Reuters) - Georgian President Giorgi Margvelashvili on Monday vetoed a draft new constitution and sent it back to parliament with his objections which included opposing its call for an end to direct elections for president.

Parliament, which is dominated by the Georgian Dream Party, adopted the new draft last week over objections from Margvelashvili and the opposition.

Under this new proposed new constitution, direct elections for president would be abolished from 2024, the country would transfer to full proportional parliamentary representation and the system of electoral blocs would be scrapped.

In a televised statement, Margvelashvili, who was elected in 2013 for a five-year term, said he remained in favor of direct presidential elections rather than a system in which the president would be appointed by parliament.

He said he had proposed to the parliamentary majority to allow parties to form electoral blocs for the next parliamentary elections in 2020.

He said he also supported scrapping the voting “bonus” system under which votes of parties that failed to muster enough support to enter parliament would be transferred to the winner of the election.

He also supported a switch to a proportional electoral system in 2020.

“I will send my justified objection to the parliament today,” Margvelashvili said.

The next presidential election in Georgia is to be held in 2018 and it is not clear whether Margvelashvili, who is at odds with the ruling party on several issues, will stand again.

MPs from the Georgian Dream said after adopting the new constitution that they would give ground on only two of the president’s objections -- allowing the parties to form electoral blocs and scrapping the voting bonus system.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China has denied responsibility for alleged cyber attacks in the United States appearing to target exiled tycoon Guo Wengui, who has levelled corruption allegations against senior Communist Party officials and applied for political asylum.

The Ministry of Public Security said in a statement provided to Reuters on Sunday an investigation had found “no evidence” of Chinese government involvement in the alleged cyber attacks.

The law enforcement agency said China had also provided the U.S. government with evidence that Guo, who has applied for political asylum in the United States, fabricated documents used to support his claims. It said China would make an official request for U.S. authorities to investigate the matter.

“The falsified official documents and the false information he fabricated are sensational and outrageous,” the ministry said in a rare English-language statement.

Guo denied the documents were forged and said the Ministry of Public Security’s statement should not be believed.

The Washington-based Hudson Institute think tank was scheduled to host Guo last Wednesday in a rare public appearance, but canceled the event the day before without explanation.

The event would have coincided with the visit of an official Chinese delegation to the U.S. capital for a high-level law enforcement and cyber security dialogue between the two countries.

The Hudson Institute said it had detected a Shanghai-based attack aimed at shutting down access to its website several days earlier.

POLITICAL ASYLUM

The suspected attack was raised by U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions during a meeting with China’s Public Security Minister Guo Shengkun on Wednesday, a Department of Justice spokesman told Reuters on Sunday.

China had “pledged to cooperate”, the spokesman said.

However, the New York-based Guo Wengui said: “Just because the Ministry of Public Security said China didn’t do it doesn’t make it true.”

“Why did the U.S. raise it in their meeting?” he told Reuters.

Guo Wengui applied for U.S. political asylum in September, but said this week the law firm representing him, Clark Hill PLC, had backed out after being targeted by Chinese hackers.

Clark Hill lawyer Thomas Ragland, who lodged the asylum claim, confirmed he was no longer representing Guo Wengui, without elaborating.

Guo Wengui held a news conference at the National Press Club on Thursday, after his Hudson event was called off, where he produced what he claimed were “top secret” official documents showing China had sent secret agents into the United States.

China’s Ministry of Public Security said the documents shown by him were “clumsily forged” and “full of obvious mistakes”.

Guo Wengui has made wide-ranging corruption allegations against senior Communist Party leaders through a daily stream of Twitter and YouTube posts since the start of the year, which he says are aimed at disrupting a key five-yearly Communist Party congress that begins next week.

The Chinese government has been seeking to discredit Guo Wengui, who is the subject of an Interpol red notice issued at Beijing’s request, as a criminal suspect who should not be trusted.",China denies links to alleged cyber attacks in United States targeting exiled tycoon Guo,https://www.reuters.com/article/china-corruption-tycoon/china-denies-links-to-alleged-cyber-attacks-in-united-states-targeting-exiled-tycoon-guo-idINKBN1CD0AY

Prime Minister Theresa May made clear in speech she was to deliver to parliament that she hoped her EU partners would make proposals at a new round of talks opening the way to the next stage of negotiations, saying “the ball is in their court”.

But even before she had delivered the speech, an EU spokesman hit back in Brussels, saying “the ball is entirely in the UK court for the rest to happen”.

May is desperate to try to regain some of her authority and refocus on talks to unravel more than 40 years of union after a speech at her party conference last week, marred by a repetitive cough, a prankster and a stage malfunction, left her weaker than ever.

She has so far fought off attempts to unseat her by critics already angry over an ill-judged election when she lost her governing Conservatives’ majority, but her weakness has opened the door for many in her party to challenge her Brexit strategy with just 18 months to go before Britain leaves the EU.

With Brussels quietly preparing for a collapse in the talks and Britain getting ready for what May calls “all eventualities”, some officials and business chiefs worry the country will crash out of the EU without a deal.

Speaking in parliament later on Monday, May will say she is determined to secure a new partnership with the other 27 members of the wealthy political and trade bloc.

“Achieving that partnership will require leadership and flexibility, not just from us but from our friends, the 27 nations of the EU,” she will say, according to excerpts of her speech.

“And as we look forward to the next stage, the ball is in their court. But I am optimistic we will receive a positive response.”

But the EU was clear: “There is a clear sequencing to these talks and there has been so far no solution found on step one, which is the divorce proceedings,” European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas told a regular briefing.

“So the ball is entirely in the UK court for the rest to happen.”

“SEE WHAT HAPPENS”

May, who will host businesses later on Monday to listen to their Brexit concerns, is keen to push the talks beyond a discussion of the divorce to try to offer firms some certainty about future trading conditions.

A report that aerospace manufacturer BAE Systems (BAES.L) is planning to cut more than 1,000 jobs can only add pressure for May to press her case for the EU to move beyond talks on the divorce settlement, the rights of expatriates and the border with EU-member Ireland.

EU negotiators say that while they see no big breakthrough at the summit next week, they may offer May a hand by offering some hope of a shift at the next scheduled meeting in mid-December.

Aides to May have signaled that the prime minister has accepted that her October deadline will not be met despite a speech in Italy last month which attempted to reset the tone of the difficult negotiations.

Her spokesman told reporters: “Let’s see what happens in the next round of talks”.

But some pro-Brexit campaigners are calling on the prime minister to get ready to step away from the talks - underlining the deep divisions in the Conservative Party.

Those differences were aired again on Monday with negative briefings in the local media against finance minister Philip Hammond, who supports prolonging the status quo with the EU for as long as possible, and foreign minister Boris Johnson, who angered some Conservatives for setting his own Brexit red lines.

Some have suggested that May will reshuffle her cabinet, but on Monday her spokesman said she had full confidence in both ministers.

“We are fast reaching the point when the prime minister should assert the authority of her office over the negotiations and call time,” Bernard Jenkin, a Conservative lawmaker, wrote in the Guardian newspaper.

Kim Yo Jong was named as an alternate member of the politburo within the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea - the opaque, all-powerful party organ where top state affairs are decided, the North’s official media said on Sunday.

It makes her only the second woman in patriarchal North Korea to join the exclusive club after Kim Kyong Hui, who held powerful roles when her brother Kim Jong Il ruled the country.

“Since she is a female, Kim Jong Un likely does not see her as a threat and a challenge to his leadership,” said Moon Hong-sik, research fellow at the Institute for National Security Strategy. “As the saying goes ‘blood is thicker than water,’ Kim Jong Un thinks Kim Yo Jong can be trusted.”

Unlike her aunt, who was promoted to the politburo in 2012 after serving more than three decades in the party, Kim Yo Jong has risen to power at an unprecedented pace.

Kim Kyong Hui has not been seen since her husband, Jang Song Thaek, once regarded as the No.2 leader in Pyongyang, was executed in 2013. South Korea’s spy agency believes she is now in a secluded place near Pyongyang undergoing a treatment for an unidentified disease, according to an August briefing to parliament.

Jang and his wife are not the only relatives to fall from Kim Jong Un’s favor.

Kim Jong Un’s estranged half-brother, Kim Jong Nam, was killed with a toxic nerve agent at a Malaysian airport in February. Two women are on trial for the murder, which South Korean and U.S. officials believe Kim Jong Un’s regime was behind.

Kim Jong Nam, who lived in exile in Macau, had criticized his family’s dynastic rule and his brother had issued a standing order for his execution, according to some South Korean lawmakers.

IN A PONYTAIL AND BLACK SUITS

The smartly dressed Kim Yo Jong, her hair usually pulled back in a ponytail and mostly seen in black suits and black-heeled shoes, made her first debut on state media in December 2011, seen standing tearfully next to Kim Jong Un at the funeral of their father.

Since then, Kim has made several appearances with her brother, giggling at concerts, riding a white horse, smiling as she receives flowers on his behalf at state functions.

Her youth and bubbly personality seen in state media are in stark contrast to the usually glum generals and aging party cadres who follow Kim Jong Un on official duties.

Having previously only occasionally appeared in the background, the young heiress has moved to the front and center of media photos more recently, assisting her brother at numerous high-profile state events.

At a massive military parade in April to mark the 105th birth anniversary of founding father Kim Il Sung, she was seen rushing out from behind pillars to bring paperwork to her brother as he prepared to give an address.

The same month, she stood alongside him during the unveiling ceremony of a construction project in Pyongyang.

In March 2016, she accompanied Kim Jong Un to a field guidance for nuclear scientists, where he claimed successful miniaturisation of nuclear warheads.

“Kim Yo Jong’s official inclusion in the 30-strong exclusive club of North Korea’s chief policy makers means her role within the regime will be expanded further,” Cheong Seong-chang, senior fellow at the Sejong Institute south of Seoul.

BEHIND THE VEIL

Apart from her age, little is known about Kim Yo Jong. She was publicly identified for the first time in February 2011 when a South Korean TV station caught her at a Eric Clapton concert in Singapore with her other brother, Kim Jong Chol.

The three, who all reportedly went to school in Switzerland, are full blood siblings, born to Kim Jong Il’s fourth partner, Ko Yong Hui.

Kim Jong Chol, the oldest of Kim Jong Il’s sons, does not involve himself in politics, leading a quiet life in Pyongyang where he plays guitar in a band, according to Thae Yong Ho, North Korea’s former deputy ambassador in London who defected to the South.

In 2014, Kim Yo Jong was made vice director of the Workers’ Party’s Propaganda and Agitation Department, which handles ideological messaging through the media, arts and culture.

The position led the U.S. Treasury Department to blacklist her along with six other North Korean officials in January for “severe human rights abuses” and censorship that concealed the regime’s “inhumane and oppressive behavior”.

Last year, South Korea’s former spy chief said Kim Yo Jong was seen “abusing power”, punishing propaganda department executives for “minor mistakes”.

In a North Korean state media photo in January 2015, she was spotted wearing a ring on her fourth finger during a visit to a child care center.

If there’s been one common thread running through almost every industry in the last decade, it has been how a handful of tech firms have revolutionized how the world does business. There’s Google for accessing information; Twitter for sharing opinion and news; Facebook for interacting with friends; Amazon for shopping, AirBnB for places to stay and Uber for getting around.

Until relatively recently, most consumers and governments took this as a positive trend. While there were disputes over individual and limited issues – not least the companies’ unwillingness to pay tax or comply with requests from local regulators – they usually were seen as good for the economy and job opportunities. With their slick lobbying and PR operations, the tech entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley were courted by politicians and civil society alike.

That is changing. The decision by London authorities to strip Uber of its license to operate in the British capital is part of a wider backlash in a rapidly escalating war between governments and the tech firms they believe have become too powerful and contemptuous of rules and democratic authority. Uber and its biggest rival Lyft were ejected from the Texas capital of Austin last year for refusing to fingerprint their drivers. In 2013 in San Francisco and Oakland, tech giants such as Google and Apple’s private employee buses, which were illegally using public bus stops, were blocked by protesters.

Other cities are clearly watching carefully. New York’s city regulators said Monday they were looking at their own probe into Uber, looking specifically at its impact on the city’s own yellow cab sector.

Political perceptions of these tech firms are changing too. After the so-called “Arab Spring,” many Western governments – and the Obama administration in particular – openly praised the tech firms as being a positive global influence, helping democratize the world.

That assumption unraveled as the same platforms later fueled the rise of far right parties in Europe and the Trump presidential campaign. Under Congressional pressure, Facebook voluntarily turned over details of 3,000 election-related ads that appeared to have been paid for by Russia-linked buyers.

Such scrutiny may only be the beginning. Increasingly, firms such as Facebook and Twitter are being blamed for seismic changes in Western political systems, accused of allowing themselves to be hijacked by automatic bots and hardliners to radicalize politics and often spread extremism.

Getting too close to tech firms now brings its own political dangers. U.S. think tanks that happily embraced funding from Google now find themselves criticized for it, accused of reining in any debate critical of the company and its counterparts.

Instead of spreading opportunity, such firms are increasingly blamed for killing jobs. Amazon’s success is at the heart of what trade analysts referred to as the “retail apocalypse,” the shutting of growing numbers of stores across the United States and beyond. Uber has proved toxic to more tightly controlled taxi industries. The drivers of London’s famous black cabs have been particularly hard hit, and their aggressive lobbying of politicians is seen as one of the key factors behind London mayor Sadiq Khan’s decision to suspend Uber’s operating license.

The decision proved immediately contentious. For all the criticisms of Uber – that it ignores regulators and the employment rights of those who drive for it, and that there have been reports of abuse and sexual assaults by drivers – it has slashed transport costs for its users. It has also provided opportunities – although without much in the way of job security – for hundreds of thousands around the world. An Uber-launched petition to reverse the London ban quickly notched up 600,000 signatures.

For the firms themselves, this is a familiar dynamic. Facebook, Google and Twitter in particular have been tangling with national governments since they began operating in relatively autocratic countries such as Russia, China and those in the Middle East, where those in authority have long felt threatened by the quick and easy access they offer to information. Sometimes, the tech companies have found themselves blocked outright.

Increasingly, the perception has become that many of these firms are simply willing to push their luck to see what they can get away with.

Technology firms do have a difficult balance to strike. Google, Apple and others have long made a virtue of protecting user data against what they see as overly intrusive requests for access by authorities. In some areas, the rights and wrongs are arguable. In others, however – such as the payment of tax – governments and campaigners believe the issues are much more clear-cut.

In many respects, Uber and AirBnB are seen amongst the most egregious examples of companies that have seriously and deliberately pushing the limits of what is strictly legal. While London’s already more stringent taxi regulation means Uber needs a license, in many other cities both it and its drivers operate outside the conventional taxi licensing system. AirBnB lets out rooms in cities that explicitly ban short-term rentals. Both have based their entire business model on working around, if not entirely flouting, pre-existing local regulations. Authorities often seemed to lack the ability, or the political will, to enforce the rules.

The London Uber decision is perhaps the most significant escalation in that war so far. It’s not that the firm will necessarily be ultimately banned from the streets, as it will continue to operate pending an appeal. The most likely scenario is that the firm and regulators reach a deal – although that could be a difficult process.

Early signs are that the firm is indeed willing to compromise. On Monday, its chief executive sent London authorities a contrite letter saying that the firm realized it had to change. Mayor Khan welcomed the statement, saying he favored talks to resolve the issue.

What Khan – a fast-rising star within the opposition Labour Party – has demonstrated, however, is that the firm can only operate if authorities allow it to do so. It is fundamentally replaceable – indeed, that have already been suggestions that a quickly-formed rival with better employment and safety practices might take its place. Something similar happened in Austin: although the Texas state government overruled the ban on Uber and Lyft in May, both companies now face more local competition.

Giant tech firms are unlikely to go away. But neither are national or local governments, democratically elected or otherwise. With a host of new technologies coming down the line – self-driving cars, automatic shops, artificial intelligence – many controlled by the same companies, these fights are only going to get bloodier.",Commentary: Uber’s London fight a sign of tech battles to come,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apps-uber-commentary/commentary-ubers-london-fight-a-sign-of-tech-battles-to-come-idUSKCN1C223I

A primeira-ministra britânica, Theresa May, deixará claro, em um discurso que deve fazer ao Parlamento, que espera que seus parceiros de bloco façam propostas em uma nova rodada de conversas que abrirão caminho para a próxima fase das negociações, dizendo que “a bola está no campo deles”.

Mas mesmo antes do discurso uma porta-voz da UE reagiu em Bruxelas, dizendo que “a bola está totalmente no campo do Reino Unido para que o resto aconteça”.

May está desesperada para recuperar algo de sua autoridade e voltar a atenção para as conversas que desfarão mais de 40 anos de união após um discurso na conferência de seu partido na semana passada no qual uma tosse repetitiva, uma pegadinha de um comediante e um problema técnico no palco a deixaram mais frágil do que nunca.

Até agora ela conteve as tentativas de deposição de críticos já revoltados com a convocação mal calculada de uma eleição na qual o governista Partido Conservador perdeu a maioria que tinha no Parlamento, mas a fragilidade da premiê abriu a porta para muitos de seus próprios correligionários questionarem sua estratégia para o Brexit apenas 18 meses após a decisão britânica de sair da UE.

Como Bruxelas está se preparando discretamente para um colapso nas conversas e o Reino Unido se apronta para o que May classificou como “todas as eventualidades”, algumas autoridades e líderes empresariais temem que o país deixe o bloco sem um acordo.

Quando falar ao Parlamento mais tarde nesta segunda-feira, May dirá estar determinada a garantir uma nova parceria com os outros 27 membros do rico bloco político e comercial.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s top court on Monday temporarily banned the sale of firecrackers in and around the capital ahead of Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, as it looks to prevent a repeat of severe air pollution that forced school closures last year.

New Delhi's air quality has hit ""very unhealthy"" levels, U.S. Embassy data shows. This is often blamed on burning of unwanted vegetation on farms in neighboring states, usual at this time of year, worsened by fumes from fireworks. (bit.ly/2eZOb9H)

The ban takes effect immediately and will run until Nov. 1, said a panel of Supreme Court judges headed by Justice Arjan Kumar Sikri, adding its impact on the region’s air quality would have to be examined after the festival.

“All temporary licenses to sell firecrackers stand canceled,” said Haripriya Padmanabhan, a lawyer representing the group that sought the ban.

“People who had already purchased crackers will be able to burst them. Hopefully they won’t do that,” she told Asian News International, a partner of Reuters Television.

Diwali, traditionally ushered in with the setting off of firecrackers mainly by India’s majority Hindu community, falls on Oct. 19 this year.

The government welcomed the move, with Environment Minister Harsh Vardhan requesting people to abide by the order.

But others, including Priti Gandhi, a leader from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist party, saw it as an attack on tradition and Hindu culture.

“We Indians will protest and burn crackers,” wrote one Twitter user, Ishkaran Bhandari. “We will uphold our culture, traditions and celebrate Diwali.”

Last November, about a million children were forced to stay home from school, thousands of workers reported sick and queues formed outside shops selling face masks as New Delhi struggled with its worst pollution for nearly 20 years.

Vehicle emissions and dust from construction sites were the factors blamed for that spike, besides firecrackers and farm burnings.

India and China together account for more than half of the 4.2 million deaths attributable to air pollution worldwide in 2015, a study by the U.S.-based Health Effects Institute (HEI) showed.

Global environmental group Greenpeace said the court ban on crackers was only a small relief for the “episodic air pollution levels in October”.

“The pollution levels in north India are multiple times higher than the national standards throughout the winter months, hence we also need to look at a stricter, comprehensive and time-bound action plan to address all sources of air pollution across India,” a Greenpeace India spokeswoman said.",Indian court bans firecracker sales in Delhi ahead of peak pollution season,https://www.reuters.com/article/india-pollution/supreme-court-bans-firecracker-sales-in-delhi-ahead-of-peak-pollution-season-idINKBN1CE0SY

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said on Monday he would sign a proposed rule on Tuesday to begin withdrawing from the Clean Power Plan, former President Barack Obama’s centerpiece regulation to fight climate change.

“Here’s the president’s message: The war on coal is over,” EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt told a gathering in the Kentucky coal-country town of Hazard.

“Tomorrow in Washington, D.C., I’ll be signing a proposed rule to withdraw the so-called Clean Power Plan of the past administration and thus begin the effort to withdraw that rule,” he said.

The Obama administration created the rule in an effort to reduce pollution from power plants by 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. The utilities are the largest emitters of greenhouse gases blamed by scientists for climate change.

The effort to undo the rule is part of a broader plan by the administration of President Donald Trump to revive the U.S. coal industry and boost domestic fossil fuels production. The EPA now says the Clean Power Plan introduced by Obama in 2015 was illegal.

Pruitt said the Obama-era plan was “really about picking winners and losers” in the competition to generate electricity in the United States.

“Regulatory power should not be used by any regulatory body to pick winners and losers,” Pruitt said. “The past administration was unapologetic. They were using every bit of power, every bit of authority to use the EPA to pick winners and losers on how we generate electricity in this country. And that’s wrong.”

The EPA has not decided whether it will replace the Clean Power Plan after it moves to repeal it, according to a draft of the proposal seen by Reuters on Friday.

The EPA said it has not yet determined whether or when it will propose a new rule to regulate emissions from existing power plants. But it said it would soon release what it calls an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to solicit information on a potential replacement.",EPA chief to sign rule on Clean Power Plan exit on Tuesday,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climatechange-usa-epa/epa-chief-to-sign-rule-on-clean-power-plan-exit-on-tuesday-idUSKBN1CE1RV

Airline shares were particularly hard hit, with flag carrier Turkish Airlines falling 9 percent.

The central bank said it was following developments closely.

“This looks like a really serious situation,” said Blue Bay Asset Management strategist Timothy Ash, adding that the central bank would need to move quickly to calm market nerves and possibly hike interest rates - something President Tayyip Erdogan has resisted.

Turkey’s leading business association, TUSIAD, warned that the dispute would harm bilateral economic, social and cultural ties, and called for disagreements to be settled calmly.

The dispute with the United States coincides with deep strains in Turkey’s relations with Germany, another key ally, and with Turkish military activity at the Syrian and Iraqi borders, though their market impact has so far been limited.

U.S.-Turkish tensions have risen in recent months over U.S. military support for Kurdish YPG fighters in Syria, considered by Ankara to be an extension of the banned PKK which has waged an insurgency for three decades in southeast Turkey.

Turkey has also pressed, so far in vain, for the United States to extradite Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, viewed in Ankara as the mastermind behind the failed coup in which more than 240 people were killed. Gulen denies any involvement.

Friction with the United States has also arisen from the indictment last month by a U.S. court of Turkey’s former economy minister Zafer Caglayan, charged with conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran.

Sinan Ulgen, an analyst and former Turkish diplomat, said those underlying disputes had created a crisis of confidence which made this latest fallout particularly bitter.

“This harshness is a result of a build-up,” he said. “We should not consider this as solely a reaction to the detentions of consulate employees”.","Turkey urges U.S. to review visa suspension as lira, stocks tumble",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-turkey-security/turkey-urges-u-s-to-review-visa-suspension-as-lira-stocks-tumble-idUSKBN1CD0SC?il=0

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to block a Chinese-backed firm from buying a U.S.-based chipmaker this week is detrimental to America’s growth and the global economy, China’s state news agency Xinhua said in a commentary on Saturday.

Canyon Bridge Capital Partners’ planned $1.3 billion acquisition of Lattice Semiconductor Corp was one of the largest attempted by a Chinese-backed firm in the U.S. microchip sector and was the first announced deal for the buyout fund, which launched last year with a focus on technology investment.

U.S. regulatory scrutiny grew after Reuters reported in November that Canyon Bridge was funded partly by capital from China’s central government and had indirect links to its space program.

Trump said in an executive order on Wednesday that Lattice and Canyon Bridge “shall take all steps necessary to fully and permanently abandon the proposed transaction” within 30 days.

“The move, which is detrimental to both America’s growth and global economic recovery, also runs counter to the mutually-beneficial and win-win nature of China-U.S. relations,” the Xinhua commentary said.

Security reviews of investments in sensitive sectors “should not be used as a tool to implement protectionism”, it added, echoing comments by a Commerce Ministry spokesman last week.

Citing analysts who said Trump’s decision was made with an eye to the 2018 midterm election, Xinhua called it “penny wise and pound foolish ... It is a short-sighted move to take protectionist measures amid sluggish global growth.”

“Chinese investment is not ‘Trojan Horse’ with hidden purposes,” it said.

Trump is set to visit China in November.

“The two countries need to strengthen dialogue and communication, promote cooperation and exchanges in various fields and properly handle issues of common concerns. Only then can China and the United States push forward the world’s most important bilateral relationship,” Xinhua said.",Trump move to block chipmaker deal bad for America - Xinhua,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-usa-trade-commentary/trump-move-to-block-chipmaker-deal-bad-for-america-xinhua-idUSKCN1BR062

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Mylan N.V. is best known for producing EpiPen emergency allergy treatments and generic drugs.

But a non-pharmaceutical offering – refined coal – has quietly generated hundreds of millions of dollars of tax credits for the company over the last six years that have boosted its bottom line, according to a Reuters review of company filings.

Since 2011, Mylan has bought 99 percent stakes in five companies across the U.S. that own plants which process coal to reduce smog-causing emissions. It then sells the coal at a loss to power plants to generate the real benefit for the drug company: credits that allow Mylan to lower its own tax bill.

Infographic ID: '2sQaEQL'

These refined coal credits were approved by Congress in 2004 in order to incentivize companies to fund production of cleaner coal. They are available to any company that is willing to invest the capital, and are set to expire after 2021.

Mylan is one of only a few public companies, and the only publicly-traded pharmaceutical maker, that uses these tax credits, a Reuters review of a comprehensive database of filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission found. It is possible other companies receive an immaterial amount of the tax credits and decline to disclose them.

Future tax credits could prove valuable to Mylan, which has seen sales of its flagship EpiPen allergy treatment sag after consumer outrage over the allergy treatment’s $600 list price. The pricing issue, which has drawn scrutiny from members of Congress and the U.S. Department of Justice, and Chairman Robert Coury’s nearly $100 million pay package last year have caused a group of investors to launch an effort to vote down the company’s board at its annual meeting on Thursday.

Mylan already carries a low tax rate after moving its headquarters overseas in 2015. The coal credits helped the company lower its effective tax rate further, to just over four percent in 2014 and 7.4 percent in 2015. Last year, the company actually had a tax benefit of $358 million, giving it an effective tax rate of negative 294 percent.

Mylan confirmed Reuters’ calculations based on figures in the tax footnotes in the company’s annual reports. According to these calculations, Mylan used more than $100 million of “clean energy and research” tax credits in both 2016 and 2015, and around $95 million in 2014.

A person familiar with the matter told Reuters these coal operations have increased Mylan’s net earnings by around $40 million to $50 million in each of the past two years. That accounts for around 9 percent of the company’s earnings last year and more than 5 percent of its 2015 earnings.

Mylan has disclosed very little about the tax credit strategy or its coal refining operations. It did not announce the coal deals when they occurred or disclose how much they cost. Mylan has not discussed them on its earnings conference calls and does not disclose exactly how much in tax credits they generate or what effect they are having on its bottom line.

Wells Fargo analyst David Maris, who has a market perform rating on the company, said he believes that, from an investor standpoint, the coal transactions adds unnecessary complexity.

“The average investor looking at their financial statements or their press releases, would have no idea what this is or how it flows through to their profit and loss statement,” he said.

“BEING MINDFUL OF TAX PLANNING”

Mylan refers to losses and interest expense generated by its “clean energy investments,” as well as the fact that they qualify for tax credits, in tables and footnotes at the bottom of its earnings releases. In filings with regulators, it discloses some risks around the investments, their carrying value, and liabilities related to the investments.

“It does sound like they are being mindful of tax planning,” said Lisa De Simone, professor of accounting at Stanford Graduate School of Business. “From the perspective of shareholder value, companies have all of the incentive in the world to try to reduce their tax payments, to increase net income and increase distributions to shareholders.”

Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin said in an emailed statement that the tax credits are available to any interested company, and often “made outside of a company’s ordinary course of business, and companies involved in such projects range across a variety of non-energy related sectors.”

Other companies Reuters found that take the credits include insurance brokerage and risk management services firm Arthur J Gallagher, Waste Management Inc and industrial supply company WW Grainger. The companies vary in their level of disclosure of the investments, but some disclose the number of tax credits they receive from the facilities.

Devlin added that the health company recognizes that the production at the refined coal facilities will no longer be eligible for a tax credit beginning in 2022. “Nonetheless, on an ongoing basis, we consider appropriate opportunities for tax planning with respect to our global operations,” she added.

New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer spoke out against the tax strategy when informed about it by Reuters. Stringer, who is leading the effort to vote down Mylan’s current board, oversees New York City pensions that together own more than 1.1 million shares of Mylan stock.

“From the EpiPen pricing debacle to embracing complex tax avoidance strategies, Mylan’s board appears more focused on financial engineering than on the company’s core business,” he said.

COAL INTEREST DATES TO 2011

Mylan made the first investment in the coal producing plants in 2011, and expanded its total holdings to 5 plants by 2014.

Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch, who has led the company since 2012, has coal country roots: she is the daughter of U.S. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the second largest coal-producing state in the country. The company declined to discuss the origin of why it adopted the tax strategy.

Mylan says in its last two annual reports that its holdings are equity method investments in five limited liability corporations that own refined coal production plants, but does not name them.

Reuters was able to identify these operations by reviewing lists of the company’s subsidiaries included with its annual reports. Mylan has 99 percent stakes in 5 LLCs that own refined coal plants: Canton Fuels Company in Illinois, Chouteau Fuels Company in Oklahoma, Deogun Manufacturing Company in Utah, Marquis Industrial Company in Indiana and Powder Street LLC in West Virginia.

Mylan is booking losses from the plants, which is not unusual for these facilities. The companies often pay a middleman who manages the coal production facilities as well as other costs.

Mylan recorded pre-tax losses of $92.3 million in 2016, $93.2 million in 2015 and $78.9 million in 2014 from the operations. The loss generated by the coal plants, as well as depreciation, is tax deductible, according to tax experts.

But the tax credits generated by the facilities are extremely valuable. Last year, companies received $6.81 in tax credits for every ton of refined coal produced. Mylan produced around 16 million tons of refined coal last year, according to a person familiar with the matter.

According to the same person, expenses – including costs paid for the assets and adjusted for tax deductions – equate to around 60 percent of the gross credits earned.",Drugmaker Mylan gets boost from unlikely source: coal,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mylan-coal-insight/drugmaker-mylan-gets-boost-from-unlikely-source-coal-idUSKBN19C0DW

MADRID/MILAN (Reuters) - Spain’s market watchdog approved Italian infrastructure group Atlantia’s (ATL.MI) proposed takeover of Spanish rival Abertis (ABE.MC) on Monday, clearing one of the hurdles to the creation of the world’s biggest toll-roads operator.

Approval comes nearly five months after Atlantia announced it was offering 16.3 billion euros ($19 billion) in cash and shares to buy Abertis.

Spanish regulator CNMV said in a market filing the offer was conditional on shareholders representing at least 10.1 percent of Abertis share capital accepting payment in Atlantia shares.

In addition the offer must be accepted by shareholders representing at least 50 percent plus one share of the Spanish company.

Atlantia is offering to pay 16.5 euros for each Abertis share, a level that CNMV said was equitable.

Abertis shareholders will have 15 calendar days to accept the bid starting from the first trading day following the formal publication of the offer’s prospectus, the watchdog said.

One source with knowledge of the matter said this was expected to happen in the next few days.

Though the offer was described as “friendly” by Atlantia, Abertis’s shareholders have not expressed a view on the bid and potential counter-bids could still emerge.

The board of the Spanish company must publish its assessment of the bid within 10 days after the start of the acceptance period, Atlantia said.

The top shareholder in Abertis is Criteria Caixa, the financial arm of a politically connected and powerful banking foundation that controls Catalonia’s largest lender Caixabank (CABK.MC).

Several potential rivals for acquiring Abertis have been named in media reports in recent months, but only Spanish builder ACS (ACS.MC), which is headed by Real Madrid soccer club Chairman Florentino Perez, has said it is looking at making a possible counter-offer.

ACS is expected to decide this month whether to make an offer.

In the prospectus published on the website of Spain’s CNMV, the Italian group said it was leaving the door open to changing the bid to an all-cash offer.

Atlantia, controlled by Italy’s Benetton family, also said in the document it would sell a portion of Abertis’s 34 percent shareholding in telecom masts company Cellnex (CLNX.MC) to avoid having to make a full bid for Cellnex.

It also repeated it was ready to sell Abertis’s satellites business Hispasat if requested by the Spanish government.",Spanish regulator clears the way for Atlantia's bid for Abertis,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-abertis-m-a-atlantia-approval/spanish-regulator-clears-the-way-for-atlantias-bid-for-abertis-idUSKBN1CE0YW

The main BIST 100 stock index fell as much as 4.7 percent, closing the day down 2.73 percent at 101,298 points.

Airline shares were particularly hard hit, with flag carrier Turkish Airlines falling 9 percent.

The central bank said it was following developments closely.

“This looks like a really serious situation,” said Blue Bay Asset Management strategist Timothy Ash, adding that the central bank would need to move quickly to calm market nerves and possibly hike interest rates - something President Tayyip Erdogan has resisted.

Turkey’s leading business association, TUSIAD, warned that the dispute would harm bilateral economic, social and cultural ties, and called for disagreements to be settled calmly.

The dispute with the United States coincides with deep strains in Turkey’s relations with Germany, another key ally, and with Turkish military activity at the Syrian and Iraqi borders, though their market impact has so far been limited.

U.S.-Turkish tensions have risen in recent months over U.S. military support for Kurdish YPG fighters in Syria, considered by Ankara to be an extension of the banned PKK which has waged an insurgency for three decades in southeast Turkey.

Turkey has also pressed, so far in vain, for the United States to extradite Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, viewed in Ankara as the mastermind behind the failed coup in which more than 240 people were killed. Gulen denies any involvement.

Friction with the United States has also arisen from the indictment last month by a U.S. court of Turkey’s former economy minister Zafer Caglayan, charged with conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran.

Sinan Ulgen, an analyst and former Turkish diplomat, said those underlying disputes had created a crisis of confidence which made this latest fallout particularly bitter.

“This harshness is a result of a build-up,” he said. “We should not consider this as solely a reaction to the detentions of consulate employees”.","Turkey urges U.S. to review visa suspension as lira, stocks tumble",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-turkey-security/turkey-urges-u-s-to-review-visa-suspension-as-lira-stocks-tumble-idUKKBN1CD0S6?il=0

Scientists in Singapore said on Monday they have mapped the genome of the durian, known throughout Southeast Asia as the “king of fruits” for its unique smell, flavour and formidable spiny appearance.

They identified a group of genes responsible for odour compounds called volatile sulphur compounds, and found that these genes become highly activated as the fruit ripens, driving its unusual smell.

“The durian smell has been described as a mix of an onion-like sulphury aroma with notes of sweet fruitiness and savoury soup-seasoning. A key component of the durian smell are volatile sulphur compounds, or VSCs, which have been characterized as decaying, onion-like, rotten eggs, sulphury and fried shallots,” said geneticist Bin Tean Teh, deputy director of the National Cancer Center Singapore, co-leader of the study published in the journal Nature Genetics.

Unlike other plant species that typically have one or two copies of these genes, this species boasted four copies, demonstrating that VSC production is, as Teh put it, “turbocharged” in durian fruits.

The researchers said this odour may be important to the durian in the wild, helping to attract animals to eat it and disperse its seeds.

The scientists sequenced the genome of the Musang King variety of durian, discovering it has about 46,000 genes, nearly double the number in the human genome.

They were able to trace the evolution of the fruit back 65 million years, finding an ancient relationship to the cacao tree, whose seeds produce chocolate.

“Most of us in Singapore have grown up with the durian, and we are very familiar with it,” said geneticist Patrick Tan, a professor at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore. “However, even within the same family, there are individuals that love the taste, while others have learned to simply tolerate it, especially during durian season. For those who have never experienced durian before, it can indeed elicit opposing emotions of devotion and revulsion.”

Durian is eaten fresh, cooked, fermented or as an ingredient in candies, baked goods and other food.

The researchers said there are at least 30 other durian species, some edible, some inedible, and some with other distinctive features. Several are endangered.

NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Yahoo is like a zombie feasting on Verizon’s brains. Marni Walden, a top executive at the $200 billion U.S. telecom group, is leaving just a day after the internet firm she helped to acquire tripled its tally of customer accounts exposed to a 2013 hack. While the company suggests the timing is a coincidence, it’s clear that Yahoo is a problem that continues to fester.

Verizon disclosed that Walden will exit at the end of the year in a two-sentence regulatory filing on Wednesday. The 50-year-old executive vice president was a rising star and a rare female in the upper ranks, who could have been a credible successor to Chief Executive Lowell McAdam. As the head of media, Walden also oversaw the creation of Oath, a combination of acquired 1990s internet brands Yahoo and AOL, to help shore up Verizon’s digital advertising offerings.

Even if buying Yahoo had a certain business rationale, it has proven to be a real pain in the side. Two hacking incidents revealed last year nearly scotched the deal. Verizon wrangled a $350 million price cut from Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer, but that may have been too little. On Tuesday it emerged that all 3 billion of Yahoo’s user accounts were compromised.

Verizon said that Walden’s departure and the latest revelation were unrelated. She is pursuing outside opportunities because she was unlikely to be the next chief executive, the Wall Street Journal reported. Others now in the running to replace McAdam, 63, include John Stratton, head of global operations, and Hans Vestberg, who once led Ericsson and is now Verizon’s chief technology officer.

Either of those would suggest that Verizon is now more interested in building out a fiber network than reinventing the media landscape. At least it only plunked down $9 billion for Oath. Meanwhile, rival AT&T is still splashing out on satellite distribution and media, paying some $175 billion for DirecTV and Time Warner. It ought to learn from Verizon’s experience: risky deals may come back to haunt.

BEIJING/SINGAPORE/LONDON (Reuters) - Some of China’s top oil refineries are having to take the highly unusual step of cutting operations during what is typically the peak demand summer season when hot weather drives up power usage and families take to the road during school holidays.

Almost 10 percent of China’s refining capacity is set to be shut down during the third quarter, signaling that demand growth from the world’s top crude importer is stuttering further.

West African and European suppliers are already feeling the chill from China’s reduced demand, and a global glut has dragged spot prices for crude this week to their lowest since November, 2016.

Major Chinese oil refineries, including PetroChina’s Jinzhou will set their run rates around 6,500 barrels per day (bpd) lower than the second quarter, sources at the affected refineries said.

Petrochina’s Fushun refinery, with an annual capacity of 233,200 bpd, began a 45-day full shutdown at the start of June, the sources said on condition of anonymity as they are not authorized to speak to media.

Rival Sinopec is considering slashing as much as 230,000 bpd, equivalent to about 5 percent of its average daily production last year, in what would be only the second time in 16 years that the firm has cut runs.

Stocks of surplus products like gasoline and diesel have been building since mid-2015, when Beijing started giving out crude import licenses to independent refiners, sometimes called teapots. This has forced state-owned Sinopec and PetroChina to cut back operations, and reduced their crude buying.

“Refiners probably realized that the domestic market cannot take so much gasoline and diesel, and the only way is to cut runs,” said Gao Jian, crude oil analyst with China Sublime Information Group.

Adding to these cuts, around 1.3 million bpd of refining capacity is going to shut in the third quarter as four state-run refineries and six independents begin planned maintenance, data provided by China Sublime Information Group showed.

Those closures mean almost 10 percent of China’s 15.1 million bpd total refining capacity will go offstream in the third quarter.

To whittle down the surplus weighing on the domestic market, analysts expect China to export refined product, putting more pressure on a well supplied global markets.

“China will have to export product... onto Asian markets, which given demand conditions regionally does not appear particularly constructive,” said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity strategy at French bank BNP Paribas.

The lower refinery throughput should reduce China’s demand for crude until around September. Some suppliers are already feeling the chill. Shipments by Angola, which sends most its oil to China, were running at the lowest level in at least a year during the first few weeks of June.

From the North Sea, just 2 million barrels of Forties crude has been shipped to Asia so far this month, compared with around 6 million barrels in June last year, and 10 million barrels in May.

BUT DON‘T WRITE CHINA OFF

The imminent cuts in China’s refining sector are likely to further weigh on oil prices, which have more than halved since 2014 due to oversupply.

However, traders say that China’s voracious thirst for oil will likely return once the immediate glut is cleared.

Nineteen Chinese independent refiners this week received fresh licenses to import crude for 2017.

“I’d expect improved buying now that teapot quotas have been released. If prices drop, China tends to buy more,” said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for Strong Petroleum, a trading firm supplying Chinese refiners.

Taken together with the licenses awarded earlier, independent refiners now have import quotas for about 1.42 million bpd this year, and it is possible that eight companies will receive allocations for another 340,000 bpd.

As refiners start chartering tankers to import crude, the impact of the new import allowances is expected to show from the end of the third quarter.

Traders said they will meet much of this demand by re-selling crude stored in South Korea and China, particularly from Shandong province where most of the independent refiners are, and from tankers off Malaysia.

Some traders even expect demand to spike in the fourth quarter, as seen late last year as teapots rushed to use up quotas to build their case for maintaining or increasing future quota allocations.

“China is a bit unpredictable – suddenly they buy a lot out of the blue, so you can never underestimate China’s buying,” said Berentsen.",Looming Chinese refinery cuts to hit oil demand,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-oil-demand-analysis/looming-chinese-refinery-cuts-to-hit-oil-demand-idUSKBN19C168

(Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc said on Monday it would speed up the process for in-store returns of items bought on its website, just ahead of the busy holiday season, as it looks to steal a march on e-commerce giant Amazon.com.

Wal-Mart has been increasingly using its more than 4,700 stores to provide hassle-free shopping on its website - by offering services that allow customers to pick up products ordered online as well as make returns in store.

The new service aims to drastically reduce the time taken to return an item bought online, as the company battles Amazon’s aggressive moves to establish its own brick-and-mortar presence.

Under Wal-Mart’s Mobile Express Returns, starting in early November, customers can, for the first time, use the retailer’s app to initiate a return.

The process can then be completed at “express” lanes in a store by scanning a QR code and handing over the item, eliminating the need to wait in queues.

The new process reduces the time taken for returning products at stores to as little as 30 seconds from five minutes previously, said Daniel Eckert, head of Wal-Mart’s U.S. services and digital acceleration business.

The new returns process also allows customers to get refunds as soon as the next day. Some items, including shampoo and color cosmetics, will be eligible for instant refunds even without the products being returned in store, then company said.

Wal-Mart said it planned to extend the new process to items bought in its stores by early next year, and is working on a similar returns policy for items bought from third-party sellers on Walmart.com.

That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ annual ranking of the World’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science, invent new technologies and power new markets and industries.

REUTERS TOP 100

The most innovative university in the world, for the third consecutive year, is Stanford University. Located in the heart of California's Silicon Valley, Stanford has long played a key role in the development of our modern networked world: A Stanford professor designed the basic communication standard for the Internet, and university alumni founded some of the biggest tech companies in the world, including Google, Intel, Hewlett-Packard and Netflix. Today the university continues to consistently produce original research and technology. Innovations that originate at Stanford are frequently cited by researchers elsewhere in academia and in private industry. Those are key criteria in the ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of numerous indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

MORE FROM REUTERS TOP 100 Compare Institutions | Methodology

Overall, the top ranks of The World's Most Innovative Universities remain largely unchanged, with nine of last year’s 10 highest-ranked universities remaining in the top 10. And the most elite institutions are almost all large, well-established universities based in the United States and Western Europe. Rounding out the top three are MIT and Harvard, which have held onto their respective 2nd and 3rd place rankings for the past three years. In fourth place is the University of Pennsylvania, which climbed four spots from #8 last year. The highest ranked university outside the U.S., Belgium’s KU Leuven (#5), is a nearly 600-year-old institution that maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet.

In contrast, there are only two Asian universities in the top 20, both of which are based in South Korea, and one of them actually teaches the majority of its classes in English: South Korea’s KAIST, formerly the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, ranked #6. Established in 1971 by the Korean government, KAIST was modeled after engineering schools in the United States, and initially funded with a multimillion-dollar loan from the United States Agency for International Development.

Overall, the top 100 consists of 51 universities based in North America, 26 in Europe, 20 in Asia and 3 in the Middle East. Why does Asia underperform? One reason is because Japanese universities – traditionally the research powerhouses of the region – depend heavily on government R&D spending, and the nation has been undergoing deflation and economic stagnation for more than 20 years. That means less money for research and fewer innovations.

According to data from Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science, which tracks articles published in scientific journals, Japanese researchers accounted for 8.4% of all papers published in 2005, but only 5.2% in 2015. Key research areas such as computer science showed even larger decreases, with the number of published papers falling by more than 37%. As a result, the Reuters ranking shows significant declines in rank for leading Japanese universities, including the University of Tokyo (down five spots to #21), Osaka University (down 13 to #24), and Keio University (down 25 to #78). Japan had nine universities on the list in 2016, but only has eight this year; six of those eight universities saw their rank fall from 2016, and one was unchanged. Only Kyushu University saw its ranking improve, moving from #79 to #68.

Of course, while Japan struggles, other Asian nations are growing fast. China has gone from one university on the list in 2015 to two in 2016, and now three in 2017. The two Chinese universities returning to the list this year both made significant gains (Tsinghua University climbed 15 spots to #51, and Peking University climbed 10 spots to #60); the third, Zhejiang University, appears on the list for the first time at #100. But given China’s massive population and economy, just three universities out of 100 still represents significant underperformance.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations – including educational institutions, nonprofit charities and government-funded labs – that publish the most academic research. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries), and ranked them based on their performance.

Slideshow (8 Images)

Careful observers might note a few differences between how non-U.S. institutions rank on Reuters’ regional innovation lists, Asia’s Most Innovative Universities and Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and how they rank on the global innovators list. An institution’s relative ranking may change from list to list, since each ranking is dependent on summarizing 10 indicators and comparing that with others in a specific population; when that population changes, individual rankings might change as well. Furthermore, the global list is restricted to institutions that filed 70 or more patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization during the five-year period examined by Thomson Reuters. The cutoff for regional lists is just 50 patents, allowing a more in-depth view of the most active institutions within a limited geographic area.

Due to changes in the methodology of this year’s list, three university systems that were ranked in the top 100 last year (University of London, State University System of Florida and University of Arizona and Board of Regents) were broken up so that each of their member institutions were ranked individually: As a result, four of those constituent universities – the University of Florida (#66), University College London (#67), Florida State University (#76) and Arizona State University (#85) – made the top 100 for the first time.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university – or whether it appears on the list at all – does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s best theoretical physics departments, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the planet. All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

Le due consultazioni sono lontanissime da quella catalana del primo ottobre scorso, che ha innescato una crisi istituzionale dagli esiti ancora incerti e ha avuto un impatto sui mercati europei.

Nelle due regioni del nord Italia, guidate da presidenti della Lega sostenuti dal centrodestra, il voto infatti è consultivo, è stato autorizzato dalla Corte Costituzionale e punta a sostenere la richiesta di maggiore autonomia rispetto al governo nazionale, in particolare sull‘istruzione, la sanità, sui fondi per le imprese e la gestione delle imprese.

VENETO INDIPENDENTE

“Vuoi tu che alla Regione Veneto siano attribuite ulteriori forme e condizioni particolari di autonomia?”, dice il quesito sottoposto agli elettori veneti. Mentre quello lombardo propone, “nel quadro dell‘unità nazionale”, di intraprendere “le iniziative istituzionali necessarie per richiedere allo Stato l‘attribuzione di ulteriori forme e condizioni particolari di autonomia”.

La giunta veneta avrebbe voluto una consultazione più ampia, e nel 2014 aveva proposto un referendum parallelo sull‘indipendenza dall‘Italia. Ma la legge regionale per indire la consultazione era stata impugnata dal governo (che recentemente ha anche bocciato una legge per l‘esposizione della bandiera veneta insieme a quelle dell‘Italia e della Ue). Ed era intervenuta la Consulta, eliminando dal voto anche i temi fiscali e le questioni che spettano al governo nazionale.

LA PROSPETTIVA DELLE ELEZIONI

Anche altre regioni chiedono più autonomia, ma non hanno fatto ricorso all‘arma referendaria. È il caso per esempio dell‘Emilia-Romagna, il cui presidente Pd ha avviato una trattativa con Palazzo Chigi.

Per alcuni critici quella di Veneto e Lombardia è una mossa in vista delle prossime elezioni politiche, per portare più consensi alla Lega di Matteo Salvini, concorrente di Forza Italia per la leadership del centrodestra.

Il referendum è sostenuto dal M5s mentre il Pd nazionale non prende posizione lasciando libertà di voto. I sindaci di Milano e Bergamo, Giuseppe Sala e Giorgio Gori, sono favorevoli così come il segretario regionale Pd in Veneto, Alessandro Bisato.

Giorgia Meloni, leader di Fratelli d‘Italia, alleato della Lega, parla invece di “oltraggio alla patria”.

Gli operatori di mercato sentiti da Reuters non ritengono che l‘esito delle consultazioni possa generare volatilità sui titoli di Stato italiani. Anche perché non gli assegnano un significato politico nazionale, a differenza dell‘esito delle elezioni siciliane, il 5 novembre, che saranno osservate da vicino per valutare la performance del M5s.

ZAIA: VENETO CATALOGNA D‘ITALIA

Per Luca Zaia, ex ministro dell‘Agricoltura e in testa alla classifica dei presidenti più amati d‘Italia, “il Veneto è la Catalogna d‘Italia, fatto di pmi, l‘80% delle quali sotto i 15 dipendenti, 600.000 imprese, 150 miliardi di Pil, disoccupazione più bassa d‘Italia col 6,8%, e 5 milioni di abitanti”.

Il governatore, che ha già fatto stampare 100.000 copie di un opuscolo intitolato “Le 100 domande dei veneti a Luca Zaia”, dice a Reuters che il referendum è “un evento storico per l‘Italia” che “si prefigge l‘obiettivo di portare il popolo veneto ad esprimersi e chiedere a Roma tutte le competenze previste dalla Costituzione”.

Ma anche l‘opuscolo “Scopri perché la Lombardia è una regione speciale”, diffuso dalla giunta di Roberto Maroni, paragona la regione di Milano a quella di Barcellona. Anzi, spiega, il residuo fiscale (cioè la differenza tra tasse pagate e trasferimenti dallo Stato) che la Lombardia vanta è molto più alto di quello della Catalogna e della Baviera.

MAGGIORANZA BULGARA PER IL SÌ, MA CRITICHE SU SPESE

Di sondaggi sull‘esito del voto, per il momento, ne circolano pochi. Quelli dell‘agosto scorso di Winpoll dicono che in Lombardia, dove non c‘è quorum, dovrebbero andare a votare (sicuramente + probabilmente) il 58% degli aventi diritto, col 94% che intende votare sì; mentre in Veneto (dove invece il quorum c‘è) l‘affluenza salirebbe al 66%, con i sì al 92%.

“Voto e voto sì. Serve un mandato politico forte per ottenere un completo sistema di autonomie locali”, dice a Reuters il responsabile ricerca e sviluppo di un‘azienda editoriale con sede a Milano.

Decisamente contrario invece Luciano Canova, un giovane economista originario di Sondrio: “Mi ripugna un po’ l‘organizzazione di un appuntamento elettorale che ha il chiaro intento di spronare i leghisti in prossimità delle elezioni, coi soldi della regione e quindi pubblici. Per cui non andrò ed è il mio modo di esprimere politicamente il non riconoscimento dell‘appuntamento”.

Polemiche sui costi. Per la Lombardia, dove nei seggi si voterà su tablet elettronici costati 23 milioni, la stima è di una spesa di 50 milioni. Maroni ha detto che i tablet, costati 23 milioni, sono un investimento che resterà in dotazione alle scuole.

Per il Veneto, il costo è di 14 milioni. Per il 55% degli italiani, dice un sondaggio Swg, si tratta di una spesa inutile, anche perché la maggioranza ritiene che si possano ottenere più poteri per le regioni negoziando direttamente con lo Stato.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenyan police fired teargas and shots in the air on Monday as hundreds of demonstrators marched through the capital Nairobi to protest against proposed legal changes that would make it harder for the Supreme Court to annul an election.

Reuters television footage showed a sport utility vehicle ploughing into some of the protesters, severely injuring three, but it was not immediately clear who was responsible and the police made no immediate comment on the incident.

Kenya is due on Oct. 26 to repeat a presidential election after the Supreme Court nullified an Aug. 8 vote due to procedural irregularities. President Uhuru Kenyatta, who won the August election, will face opposition leader Raila Odinga.

Uncertainty over the coming election has created turmoil in the East African nation, which is a regional trade hub and staunch Western ally.

As the demonstrators marched toward the election board in Nairobi, a Reuters journalist saw men in plain clothes near security forces fire shots in the air. Police on horseback set up blockades to prevent protesters from accessing some roads.

Police also used teargas in the western city of Kisumu, Odinga’s stronghold, to disperse protesters, though another demonstration in the coastal city of Mombasa passed peacefully.

Odinga’s opposition alliance is threatening to boycott the October vote unless the electoral board changes some personnel - a stance he declined on Monday to clarify, in comments that suggested he was keeping his options open for now.

“This is a democratic society we live in. If I choose not to participate in the pre-rigged election process, it is my democratic right. No court can order me to do so,” Odinga said in comments broadcast on Kenyan TV stations, without elaborating further.

“DECLARING WAR”

The protesters want to warn ruling party lawmakers not to pass an amendment to the election law that would limit the circumstances in which the Supreme Court could void an election on procedural grounds, opposition lawmaker James Orengo said.

“If parliament passes the law tomorrow, it will be like declaring war on the Kenyan people,” he said.

REUTERS/Thomas Mukoya

Justin Muturi, speaker of the National Assembly, said the amendment could be debated when parliament reconvenes on Tuesday if lawmakers were keen to push it forward.

He said the key part of the proposed law stipulates that if a candidate boycotts an election whose date has already been set, the remaining candidate would win the contest without formal polls being held.

The government is keen to avoid a constitutional crisis if Odinga pulls out at the last minute, frustrating the court’s order to hold elections within 60 days, Muturi said.

“We are trying to prevent a crisis should there be no elections,” he told Reuters by phone.

The government-backed Kenya National Commission on Human Rights said on Monday in a report that at least 37 people had been killed in a police crackdown on protests that immediately followed the August vote - the highest death toll given so far.

The report attributed some deaths to “police using live bullets and a few from police bludgeoning using clubs”. It named a 6-month-old baby girl, a 7-year-old boy, and an 8-year-old girl as being among the victims.","Kenya police use teargas, shoot in air during opposition march",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1CE1GW-OZATP

HSBC will have demonstrated the same values if John Flint, head of retail banking and wealth management, replaces Stuart Gulliver when he steps down as chief executive next year. The consummate company man, who has spent nearly three decades at the sprawling Asia-focused lender, is awaiting approval from regulators, according to the Sunday Times. Installing Flint would continue the bank’s tradition of appointing insiders as CEO.

Such lack of radical change is hardly galling. HSBC has already broken with convention by installing Mark Tucker, an outsider, as chairman. The bank’s shareholders want a low-risk, diversified bank that produces steady payouts. After nearly seven years of restructuring and selling assets, Gulliver has largely achieved this. HSBC had a solid capital ratio of 14.7 percent at the end of June, well in excess of its 13 percent target, underpinning dividends. HSBC shares have outperformed the STOXX Europe 600 Banks index by a whopping 45 percent over the past two years and trade at a relatively healthy 1.2 times book value.

The bank’s net operating income – which deducts bad debt provisions but not expenses – has fallen by an average of 5.8 percent a year since 2011 as Gulliver sold businesses and shed low-returning assets. Tucker, newly recruited from AIA, could be forgiven for plotting a change of tack. Under his watch assets at the Asian insurer grew by 38 percent to $185 billion over the past five financial years, according to Eikon data. HSBC’s balance sheet shrank by 11 percent over the same period.

The bank is placing some bets: for example, it is redeploying $100 billion in risk-weighted assets to Asia, specifically the Pearl River Delta region in Southern China, in a quest to sign up middle-class customers. Investors who recall HSBC’s disastrous 2003 purchase of Household International – a bid to capture a bigger piece of the then-booming U.S. property market – might point to the perils of chasing debt-fuelled growth.

There is also more cleaning up to do. The bank has yet to make a compelling case for keeping a foothold in Mexico. Its 19 percent stake in China’s Bank of Communications also looks increasingly superfluous. Further disposals may disappoint those questing for headline-grabbing enlargement.

REUTERS/David Gray

LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - Can thousands of people standing in lines to spell out “Stop Adani” actually scupper the Indian company’s plans to develop a huge coal mine in the Australian outback?

Perhaps a more relevant question is whether the protesters are enough to make Australia’s federal and Queensland state politicians lose their nerve, and quietly withdraw support for what is the world’s largest new coal mine planned.

While Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull’s Liberal Party, which holds federal power, and the Labor Party, which rules Queensland state, have maintained their backing for Adani Enterprises’ Carmichael mine so far, both have also previously backed down on political issues over possible electoral losses.

Thousands of people opposed to the $4 billion, 25 million tonnes-a-year Carmichael mine turned out at various locations across Australia on Oct. 7, attending events organised by an umbrella organisation of groups opposed to the development.

While the presence of protesters isn’t enough itself to cause the federal and state governments to abandon Adani, there is an opinion poll showing a majority of Australians are against the mine. Also, media coverage has grown increasingly sceptical, if not hostile.

The state Australian Broadcasting Corp last week aired a programme alleging Adani engaged in bribery, corruption and environmentally damaging practices in India. The programme also reported that Adani has set up complex corporate structures in tax havens to minimise any potential tax payments in Australia.

Adani has dismissed the allegations and stated that the Carmichael project remains on track.

Adani Australia’s chief executive officer Jeyakumar Janakaraj, in an interview published on Oct. 5 in India’s Economic Times, said Adani’s corporate structure was above board and that work on the mine will start in a “couple of weeks.”

Janakaraj did acknowledge, however, that the company still has to secure A$4.2 billion ($3.3 billion) for the Carmichael mine and associated rail project, and that it intended to achieve this by March next year.

MONEY, POLITICS

Part of the problem for Adani is that the company is seeking about A$900 million of this cash from Australia’s federal government to build the near 400 km (260 mile) rail line from the mine to a port on Queensland’s coast.

It’s this money that environmental activists are hoping to target by ramping up pressure on Prime Minister Turnbull, who holds power by a razor-thin majority in parliament.

If there is any realistic chance of seats in Queensland falling to the Labor Party, or even the Australian Greens, Turnbull will be tempted to reverse course on support for Adani.

Turnbull’s government has so far sought to distance itself from the liquefied natural gas (LNG) industry in Queensland amid mounting public anger over high local natural gas prices and the idea that three export LNG plants in the state are to blame.

State governments, both Liberal and Labor, have also given into activists by banning or restricting natural gas exploration and production in New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and the Northern Territory.

That has the anti-Adani activists feeling they have the wind at their backs and their campaign against the Carmichael mine is gaining traction.

It doesn’t seem to matter to the activists that many of the claims against the mine are exaggerated, as long as the public believes it is the tipping point for man-made climate change and the destruction of Australia’s iconic Great Barrier Reef.

Carmichael’s 25 million tonnes of coal a year obviously won’t help mitigate climate change, but it’s a spit in the bucket when viewed against China’s annual consumption of around 3.5 billion tonnes and India’s demand of nearly 1 billion.

However, it seems that Adani is losing the public relations battle in Australia, and that increases the risk its political support will evaporate as well.

If the environmentalists do manage to halt Adani, the victory may well have implications beyond coal.

Any resource project could be targeted given environmentalists are generally opposed to any fossil fuel or mineral extraction, making it harder for Australia to expand or replenish the sector that is the nation’s major export earner.

Single-issue activists rarely consider the wider implications of their campaigns, but politicians are supposed to do just that. The potential costs of weak political decisions are mounting in Australia.","Column: In people vs Adani's coal mine, people may win",https://www.reuters.com/article/column-russell-coal-adani-ent/column-in-people-vs-adanis-coal-mine-people-may-win-idINKBN1CE0BA

Berlin (Reuters) - Noch bevor die Spitzen von CDU und CSU am Sonntag in Berlin zusammenkamen, keimte in der Union eine alte Furcht auf.

“Ohne eine Klärung, ob wir auch noch inhaltlich Schwestern sind, können wir nicht in Sondierungsgespräche gehen”, sagte CSU-Landesgruppenchef Alexander Dobrindt. Damit steht das Gespenst von Kreuth von 1976 im Raum, als die CSU in dem oberbayerischen Ort die Aufgabe der Fraktionsgemeinschaft im Bundestag beschloss und Wochen später wieder aufhob.

Am Sonntagabend beendeten die Spitzen von CDU und CSU zwar den Asylstreit mit der Einigung auf ein Migrationspaket und feierten dies. Dennoch gibt es mehrere Gründe, wieso die Spannungen in der Union keineswegs beendet sind, sondern anhalten werden - mindestens bis zur bayerischen Landtagswahl im Herbst 2018.

ANDERE STRATEGISCHE ZIELE

Die strategischen Ziele einer Bundes- und einer Regionalpartei sind völlig unterschiedlich. Differenzen gibt es zudem nicht nur im Redestil, sondern auch im Demokratieverständnis. Das erklärt, warum der bayerische JU-Landesvorsitzende Hans Reichhart auf dem Deutschlandtag der Jungen Union in Dresden von einer “krachenden Niederlage” bei der Bundestagswahl sprach. CDU-Chefin Angela Merkel aber bescheinigte, dass die Union trotz herber Verluste die strategischen Ziele erreicht habe. Denn aus Sicht der CDU und Merkels ist das wichtigste Ziel, dass gegen die Union keine Regierung gebildet werden kann - auch nicht nach zwölf Jahren ununterbrochener Kanzlerschaft. Zudem ist der Abstand zur SPD weiter deutlich, weil die Sozialdemokraten selbst verloren.

Außerdem reicht es Merkel und den allermeisten in der CDU-Spitze in Bund und Ländern, mit wechselnden Koalitionsregierungen an der Macht zu bleiben. Die CDU empfindet sich als klassische Mitte-Partei. Dies ist auch das Motto, das bei jeder Pressekonferenz der CDU-Vorsitzenden auf der Wand hinter ihr steht. Deshalb erscheint es in Merkels Denken logisch, dass sie am Samstag den Einzug der FDP in den Bundestag lobte - obwohl die Union fast so viele Stimmen an die Liberalen wie an die AfD verlor.

CSU DENKT ANDERS

Für die CSU ist eine solche Haltung eine Provokation. Denn für sie ist das oberste Ziel, die absolute Mehrheit bei der Landtagswahl zu verteidigen. Dort wird über die eigentliche Machtbasis einer Partei entschieden, die seit Jahrzehnten ununterbrochen in Bayern regiert - und die nach Ansicht führender CSU-Politiker schon eine Koalitionsregierung mit der FDP auf Landesebene als “Drama” empfindet.

Die Bereitschaft der CDU, mit wechselnden Partnern Koalitionen einzugehen, wird in der CSU als Schwäche empfunden. Und wenn eine neue Partei wie die AfD am rechten Rand auftaucht, will sie die CSU mit einem konservativeren Profil überflüssig machen. “Ich stehe dazu, dass rechts von der Union keine Partei sein sollte”, betonte zwar auch Merkel mit Hinweis auf den damaligen CSU-Chef Franz Josef Strauß. Zugleich machte sie die Grenzen deutlich, weil sie für die sehr viel größere CDU nicht die Mitte-Wähler nicht verprellen will: “Franz Josef Strauß, dem ich leider nie begegnet bin, hätte sicher nicht dazu aufgefordert, unsere eigenen Prinzipien zu verraten, um das zu erreichen.” Die drei Wurzeln der CDU seien nun einmal konservativ, sozial und liberal.

ANDERE ANALYSE DER FLÜCHTLINGSKRISE

In den vergangenen Tagen wurde erneut deutlich, dass CDU und CSU auch zwei Jahre nach dem Höhepunkt der Flüchtlingskrise immer noch abweichende Analysen haben, was überhaupt passierte. Innenminister Thomas de Maiziere (CDU) verbat sich den Vorwurf aus der Schwesterpartei, er sei für einen “Unrechtsstaat” verantwortlich. Das zeigt den Frustniveau bis in die oberste CDU-Ebene: Dort wird immer wieder darauf verwiesen, dass der Aufschwung der AfD auch damit zusammenhänge, dass die Regierungspartei CSU über Monate den Eindruck eines “Staatsversagens” geschürt habe. Zur CSU-Forderung nach einer Grenzschließung zu Österreich erklärte Merkel erneut, dass für sie europäisches Recht über deutschem Recht stehe.

Auch hier argumentiert die CSU-Spitze anders: Ein zu weicher Kurs Merkels sei verantwortlich, ihr Offenhalten der Grenzen falsch und gefährlich. Dass etwa die von der CSU geforderten Transitzentren an der Grenze nicht an der CDU, sondern am Koalitionspartner SPD scheiterten und die Einstufung der Maghreb-Staaten als sichere Herkunftsstaaten an den Grünen, spielt dabei kaum eine Rolle im Denken einer Partei, die in ihrem Bundesland immer praktisch allein entscheiden konnte - und deshalb von der Kanzlerin die Umsetzung von Unionspositionen erwartet.

Das erklärt auch die Bedenken der CSU mit Blick auf eine Jamaika-Koalition. In der Partei gibt es die Sorge, dass die Union ausgerechnet vor der Landtagswahl schmerzhafte Kompromisse eingehen müsste, die die AfD als “Verrat” verkaufen würde. Dagegen steht die klare Forderung Merkels, dass Jamaika nicht an der CSU scheitern dürfe.

Das erklärt die Spannungen in den kommenden Monaten, wenn die CDU möglicherweise zu Kompromissen mit den Grünen bereit sein wird, während die CSU auf einem schärferen konservativeren Profil beharrt. Schon am Montag deutete die Grünen-Kritik am Obergrenzen-Kompromiss darauf hin, dass die Debatte noch lange nicht beendet ist.

SPALTUNG ODER NICHT?

Längst ist in Berlin deshalb kaum noch von Schwesterparteien, sondern eher von einer Sondierung der Unionsparteien die Rede. Aber den endgültigen Schritt zu Kreuth wagt zurzeit niemand: Denn dies würde letztlich die CSU-Ausweitung auf das Bundesgebiet und die Gründung eines 16. CDU-Landesverbandes in Bayern bedeuten. Aber Merkel bezweifelt, dass das Antreten von zwei C-Parteien in allen Bundesländern die Union wirklich stärken würde und warnte in Dresden vor der Spaltung. Die CDU-Spitze hatte bereits in den vergangenen Monaten Versuche von frustrierten CSU-Anhängern abgeblockt, in Bayern einen CDU-Landesverband zu gründen.

CSU-Chef Horst Seehofer wiederum weiß, dass seine Partei die absolute Mehrheit verlieren würde, sollte die CDU 2018 in Bayern antreten. Die Schwesterparteien müssten sich im Wahlkampf gegeneinander profilieren. Allerdings wird zumindest in der CDU hinter vorgehaltener Hand darauf verwiesen, dass man sich kaum mehr schaden könne als dies im Streit über die Flüchtlingspolitik der Fall gewesen sei. Scheitert Jamaika tatsächlich, könnte es also zur Neuauflage der Debatte kommen.","ANALYSE-CSU und CDU droht die ""Verkreuthisierung""",https://www.reuters.com/article/deutschland-union-idDEKBN1CE1CD

“This looks like a really serious situation,” said Blue Bay Asset Management strategist Timothy Ash, adding that the central bank would need to move quickly to calm market nerves and possibly hike interest rates - something President Tayyip Erdogan has resisted.

Turkey’s leading business association, TUSIAD, warned that the dispute would harm bilateral economic, social and cultural ties, and called for disagreements to be settled calmly.

The dispute with the United States coincides with deep strains in Turkey’s relations with Germany, another key ally, and with Turkish military activity at the Syrian and Iraqi borders, though their market impact has so far been limited.

U.S.-Turkish tensions have risen in recent months over U.S. military support for Kurdish YPG fighters in Syria, considered by Ankara to be an extension of the banned PKK which has waged an insurgency for three decades in southeast Turkey.

Turkey has also pressed, so far in vain, for the United States to extradite Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, viewed in Ankara as the mastermind behind the failed coup in which more than 240 people were killed. Gulen denies any involvement.

Friction with the United States has also arisen from the indictment last month by a U.S. court of Turkey’s former economy minister Zafer Caglayan, charged with conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran.

Sinan Ulgen, an analyst and former Turkish diplomat, said those underlying disputes had created a crisis of confidence which made this latest fallout particularly bitter.

PARIS (Reuters) - Apple (AAPL.O) boss Tim Cook went out of his way on Monday to single out a small French firm behind innovative features in the latest iPhones ahead of meeting with President Emmanuel Macron, who has called for a tougher line on technology company taxes.

The Apple chief executive paid a surprise visit to Eldim, a Normandy-based firm that develops optical technology used in the facial recognition system inside new top-of-the-line iPhone X smartphones due out next month. Prices start at $999.

Face ID, as the iPhone X feature is known, will replace the fingerprint sensor for unlocking the phone and features in Apple’s campaign to distinguish the phone from rival devices.

“Bravo for your work!”, Cook said on his official Twitter account in French. A picture of him chatting with Eldim employees was also posted. He also hailed the contributions of French start-ups on Twitter while on his way to a scheduled meeting with Macron on Monday afternoon.

The meeting between the French president and Apple CEO follows calls by Macron last week for Apple and other tech companies such as Amazon.com to pay more in taxes in Europe.

“Bravo to Europe for acting with determination to get tax rules and justice respected,” Macron said in a tweet last week praising European Union officials for taking member-state Ireland to court to reclaim 13 billion euros ($15.26 billion) in back taxes from Apple.

Eldim, located outside Caen, near the northern coast of France, had quietly worked with Apple on research projects for nearly a decade before gaining recognition for its optical work on behalf of Apple, the world’s most highly valued company.

“They (Eldim) certainly have a top-notch technology,” said industry analyst Thomas Husson of Forrester Research. “Facial recognition is one of iPhone X’s differentiating features.”

Apple is normally highly secretive about the suppliers it uses to develop new phones, computers and other devices.

A spokeswoman for Apple declined to comment.

DETROIT (Reuters) - No. 1 U.S. automaker General Motors Co (GM.N) said on Monday it would buy Strobe Inc, which uses LIDAR technology to help self-driving cars identify objects at a distance, to speed up development of autonomous vehicles and slash sensor costs.

LIDAR is one of the major sensor technologies used in autonomous, or self-driving vehicles, and there is fierce competition between large automakers to bring the cars to market first.

Fully self-driving vehicles are expected to hit the market in a limited form by around 2020. GM and its U.S. rival Ford Motor Co (F.N) have both publicly stated that they aim to have fully self-driving cars on sale by 2021.

”This acquisition is a game changer for GM and Cruise,“ because of the cost savings it will bring,” Kyle Vogt, chief executive of GM’s Cruise Automation unit, said.

“We’ve made this acquisition because we aim to speed our path to market,” he added.

Strobe’s new microchip LIDAR system would significantly enhance the capabilities of the self-driving cars GM was developing, Vogt said in a blog post and on a conference call with reporters.

By reducing the entire sensor down to a single chip, Strobe’s system should reduce the cost of each LIDAR on its self-driving cars by 99 percent, he said.

The technology provided not just a distance measurement for an object on the road - vehicles, people and objects - but also measured that object’s velocity.

“This is really important for self-driving cars, especially in challenging situations,” Vogt said.

Vogt did not disclose financial terms, but said 11 full-time Strobe employees would join Cruise as part of the deal.

He said last week that the unit was making “rapid progress” toward deploying self-driving cars in part through testing vehicles on the crowded streets of San Francisco.

DETROIT (Reuters) - No. 1 U.S. automaker General Motors Co (GM.N) said on Monday it would buy Strobe Inc, which uses LIDAR technology to help self-driving cars identify objects at a distance, to speed up development of autonomous vehicles and slash sensor costs.

LIDAR is one of the major sensor technologies used in autonomous, or self-driving vehicles, and there is fierce competition between large automakers to bring the cars to market first.

Fully self-driving vehicles are expected to hit the market in a limited form by around 2020. GM and its U.S. rival Ford Motor Co (F.N) have both publicly stated that they aim to have fully self-driving cars on sale by 2021.

”This acquisition is a game changer for GM and Cruise,“ because of the cost savings it will bring,” Kyle Vogt, chief executive of GM’s Cruise Automation unit, said.

“We’ve made this acquisition because we aim to speed our path to market,” he added.

Strobe’s new microchip LIDAR system would significantly enhance the capabilities of the self-driving cars GM was developing, Vogt said in a blog post and on a conference call with reporters.

By reducing the entire sensor down to a single chip, Strobe’s system should reduce the cost of each LIDAR on its self-driving cars by 99 percent, he said.

The technology provided not just a distance measurement for an object on the road - vehicles, people and objects - but also measured that object’s velocity.

“This is really important for self-driving cars, especially in challenging situations,” Vogt said.

Vogt did not disclose financial terms, but said 11 full-time Strobe employees would join Cruise as part of the deal.

He said last week that the unit was making “rapid progress” toward deploying self-driving cars in part through testing vehicles on the crowded streets of San Francisco.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China said on Monday it hopes the Iran nuclear deal will stay intact, playing an important role in keeping the peace, after a senior U.S. official said President Donald Trump is expected to decertify the agreement.

The official, speaking last week on condition of anonymity, said Trump was also expected to roll out a broader U.S. strategy on Iran that would be more confrontational. The Trump administration has frequently criticized Iran’s conduct in the Middle East.

Trump, who has called the pact an “embarrassment” and “the worst deal ever negotiated”, has been weighing whether it serves U.S. security interests as he faces an Oct. 15 deadline for certifying that Iran is complying with its terms.

Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the Iran nuclear deal was a good example of how to solve something peacefully through talks.

The agreement had played a positive and important role in ensuring nuclear non-proliferation and protecting peace and stability in the Middle East, she added.

“We hope that the comprehensive Iran nuclear agreement can continue to be earnestly implemented,” Hua told a daily news briefing.

Iranian authorities have repeatedly said Tehran would not be the first to violate the accord, under which Iran agreed to restrict its nuclear program in return for the lifting of most international sanctions that had crippled its economy.

If Trump declines to certify Iran’s compliance, U.S. congressional leaders would have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions on Tehran suspended under the agreement.

The prospect that Washington could renege on the pact, which was signed by the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China, the European Union and Iran, has worried some U.S. allies.

Kim Yo Jong was named as an alternate member of the politburo within the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea - the opaque, all-powerful party organ where top state affairs are decided, the North’s official media said on Sunday.

It makes her only the second woman in patriarchal North Korea to join the exclusive club after Kim Kyong Hui, who held powerful roles when her brother Kim Jong Il ruled the country.

“Since she is a female, Kim Jong Un likely does not see her as a threat and a challenge to his leadership,” said Moon Hong-sik, research fellow at the Institute for National Security Strategy. “As the saying goes ‘blood is thicker than water,’ Kim Jong Un thinks Kim Yo Jong can be trusted.”

Unlike her aunt, who was promoted to the politburo in 2012 after serving more than three decades in the party, Kim Yo Jong has risen to power at an unprecedented pace.

Kim Kyong Hui has not been seen since her husband, Jang Song Thaek, once regarded as the No.2 leader in Pyongyang, was executed in 2013. South Korea’s spy agency believes she is now in a secluded place near Pyongyang undergoing a treatment for an unidentified disease, according to an August briefing to parliament.

Jang and his wife are not the only relatives to fall from Kim Jong Un’s favor.

Kim Jong Un’s estranged half-brother, Kim Jong Nam, was killed with a toxic nerve agent at a Malaysian airport in February. Two women are on trial for the murder, which South Korean and U.S. officials believe Kim Jong Un’s regime was behind.

Kim Jong Nam, who lived in exile in Macau, had criticized his family’s dynastic rule and his brother had issued a standing order for his execution, according to some South Korean lawmakers.

IN A PONYTAIL AND BLACK SUITS

The smartly dressed Kim Yo Jong, her hair usually pulled back in a ponytail and mostly seen in black suits and black-heeled shoes, made her first debut on state media in December 2011, seen standing tearfully next to Kim Jong Un at the funeral of their father.

Since then, Kim has made several appearances with her brother, giggling at concerts, riding a white horse, smiling as she receives flowers on his behalf at state functions.

Her youth and bubbly personality seen in state media are in stark contrast to the usually glum generals and aging party cadres who follow Kim Jong Un on official duties.

Having previously only occasionally appeared in the background, the young heiress has moved to the front and center of media photos more recently, assisting her brother at numerous high-profile state events.

At a massive military parade in April to mark the 105th birth anniversary of founding father Kim Il Sung, she was seen rushing out from behind pillars to bring paperwork to her brother as he prepared to give an address.

The same month, she stood alongside him during the unveiling ceremony of a construction project in Pyongyang.

In March 2016, she accompanied Kim Jong Un to a field guidance for nuclear scientists, where he claimed successful miniaturisation of nuclear warheads.

“Kim Yo Jong’s official inclusion in the 30-strong exclusive club of North Korea’s chief policy makers means her role within the regime will be expanded further,” Cheong Seong-chang, senior fellow at the Sejong Institute south of Seoul.

BEHIND THE VEIL

Apart from her age, little is known about Kim Yo Jong. She was publicly identified for the first time in February 2011 when a South Korean TV station caught her at a Eric Clapton concert in Singapore with her other brother, Kim Jong Chol.

The three, who all reportedly went to school in Switzerland, are full blood siblings, born to Kim Jong Il’s fourth partner, Ko Yong Hui.

Kim Jong Chol, the oldest of Kim Jong Il’s sons, does not involve himself in politics, leading a quiet life in Pyongyang where he plays guitar in a band, according to Thae Yong Ho, North Korea’s former deputy ambassador in London who defected to the South.

In 2014, Kim Yo Jong was made vice director of the Workers’ Party’s Propaganda and Agitation Department, which handles ideological messaging through the media, arts and culture.

The position led the U.S. Treasury Department to blacklist her along with six other North Korean officials in January for “severe human rights abuses” and censorship that concealed the regime’s “inhumane and oppressive behavior”.

Last year, South Korea’s former spy chief said Kim Yo Jong was seen “abusing power”, punishing propaganda department executives for “minor mistakes”.

In a North Korean state media photo in January 2015, she was spotted wearing a ring on her fourth finger during a visit to a child care center.

MILAN (Reuters) - Italian broadcaster Mediaset and French media group Vivendi (VIV.PA) have opened lines of communication to find a solution to a bitter legal dispute, a source close to the matter said on Monday, as shares in the Italian company rose sharply.

The two companies have been at loggerheads since Vivendi backtracked last year on a deal to buy Mediaset’s (MS.MI) pay-TV unit Premium.

The rift deepened when Vivendi built up a 28.8 percent stake in Mediaset last December in a move which the French group said was not hostile but a sign of long-term interest.

Mediaset is 39.5 percent owned by the family of former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi. It is suing Vivendi for damages of at least 3 billion euros.

An Italian source close to the matter said on Monday lawyers representing Mediaset and Vivendi were holding talks, but added it would be difficult to reach an agreement.

On Saturday Italian daily Il Sole 24 Ore said the two sides were negotiating for a possible solution ahead of a court hearing scheduled for Dec. 19.

The paper said a planned joint-venture between Telecom Italia (TLIT.MI) and Vivendi’s pay-TV arm Canal + could be extended to Mediaset as part of any potential deal.

Milan-based broker Banca Akros said in a note on Monday a possible broader partnership involving Vivendi and Telecom Italia would be a very positive development.

“... a wider industrial partnership with Vivendi-Telecom Italia would offer more value creation for Mediaset than the deep downsizing of Premium announced last January,” it said.

Prime Minister Theresa May made clear in speech she was to deliver to parliament that she hoped her EU partners would make proposals at a new round of talks opening the way to the next stage of negotiations, saying “the ball is in their court”.

But even before she had delivered the speech, an EU spokesman hit back in Brussels, saying “the ball is entirely in the UK court for the rest to happen”.

May is desperate to try to regain some of her authority and refocus on talks to unravel more than 40 years of union after a speech at her party conference last week, marred by a repetitive cough, a prankster and a stage malfunction, left her weaker than ever.

She has so far fought off attempts to unseat her by critics already angry over an ill-judged election when she lost her governing Conservatives’ majority, but her weakness has opened the door for many in her party to challenge her Brexit strategy with just 18 months to go before Britain leaves the EU.

With Brussels quietly preparing for a collapse in the talks and Britain getting ready for what May calls “all eventualities”, some officials and business chiefs worry the country will crash out of the EU without a deal.

Speaking in parliament later on Monday, May will say she is determined to secure a new partnership with the other 27 members of the wealthy political and trade bloc.

“Achieving that partnership will require leadership and flexibility, not just from us but from our friends, the 27 nations of the EU,” she will say, according to excerpts of her speech.

“And as we look forward to the next stage, the ball is in their court. But I am optimistic we will receive a positive response.”

But the EU was clear: “There is a clear sequencing to these talks and there has been so far no solution found on step one, which is the divorce proceedings,” European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas told a regular briefing.

“So the ball is entirely in the UK court for the rest to happen.”

“SEE WHAT HAPPENS”

May, who will host businesses later on Monday to listen to their Brexit concerns, is keen to push the talks beyond a discussion of the divorce to try to offer firms some certainty about future trading conditions.

A report that aerospace manufacturer BAE Systems (BAES.L) is planning to cut more than 1,000 jobs can only add pressure for May to press her case for the EU to move beyond talks on the divorce settlement, the rights of expatriates and the border with EU-member Ireland.

EU negotiators say that while they see no big breakthrough at the summit next week, they may offer May a hand by offering some hope of a shift at the next scheduled meeting in mid-December.

Aides to May have signaled that the prime minister has accepted that her October deadline will not be met despite a speech in Italy last month which attempted to reset the tone of the difficult negotiations.

Her spokesman told reporters: “Let’s see what happens in the next round of talks”.

But some pro-Brexit campaigners are calling on the prime minister to get ready to step away from the talks - underlining the deep divisions in the Conservative Party.

Those differences were aired again on Monday with negative briefings in the local media against finance minister Philip Hammond, who supports prolonging the status quo with the EU for as long as possible, and foreign minister Boris Johnson, who angered some Conservatives for setting his own Brexit red lines.

Some have suggested that May will reshuffle her cabinet, but on Monday her spokesman said she had full confidence in both ministers.

“We are fast reaching the point when the prime minister should assert the authority of her office over the negotiations and call time,” Bernard Jenkin, a Conservative lawmaker, wrote in the Guardian newspaper.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union will cut back contacts with Myanmar’s top generals in a first step to increase sanctions over an army offensive that has driven more than 500,000 Rohingya Muslims out of the country, according to a draft document seen by Reuters.

Thousands of the Rohingya fled for Myanmar to Bangladesh on Monday in a new surge of refugees driven by fears of starvation and violence which the United Nations denounced as ethnic cleansing.

The United States and the European Union have been considering targeted sanctions against Myanmar military leaders, though the European bloc sees its options as relatively limited, with no hard-hitting, direct leverage on the ground.

EU foreign ministers will discuss the situation in Myanmar on Oct.16, and their draft joint statement said the bloc “will suspend invitations to the commander-in-chief of the Myanmar/Burma armed forces and other senior military officers”.

The text, which will be discussed further by envoys from the 28 EU states on Tuesday and may be modified, said the EU may consider further measures depending on developments in Myanmar but would “respond accordingly to positive developments”.

The document confirmed support for an existing EU embargo on arms and equipment “that can be used for internal repression”.

It called on Myanmar to discuss repatriating refugees from neighbouring Bangladesh and praised the latter for its role in the crisis, which started when attacks by Rohingya militants on security posts brought a ferocious military response.

Refugees and rights groups say the army and Buddhist vigilantes use killing and arson to drive the Rohingya out of Myanmar. Myanmar rejects accusations of ethnic cleansing.

The EU draft characterised the situation in the most-affected Rakhine State as “extremely serious” and said Kachin and Shan provinces were also “of great concern.”

It called on all sides to cease violence, told the military to “end its operations” and protect all civilians equally, as well as calling on Myanmar to allow humanitarian access to the affected regions.

The West has invested politically in Myanmar leader and Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, who has faced scathing international criticism for not doing more to stop the violence.

While the EU feels disillusioned, it also acknowledges Aung San Suu Kyi has little influence over Myanmar’s security forces.

The move to punish the army head is largely symbolic as the West is also wary of hurting the wider economy or destabilising already-tense ties between Suu Kyi and the army.

LORDSTOWN, Ohio (Reuters) - Wall Street is fretting that the U.S. auto industry is heading for a downturn, but for thousands of workers at General Motors Co factories in the United States, the hard times are already here.

Matt Streb, 36, was one of 1,200 workers laid off on Jan. 20 - inauguration day for Republican U.S. President Donald Trump - when GM canceled the third shift at its Lordstown small-car factory here. Sales of the Chevrolet Cruze sedan, the only vehicle the plant makes, have nosedived as U.S. consumers switch to SUVs and pickup trucks.

Streb is looking for another job, but employers are wary because they assume he will quit whenever GM calls him back.

“I get it,” said Streb, who has a degree in communications, “but it’s frustrating.”

Layoffs at Lordstown and other auto plants point to a broader challenge for the economy in Midwestern manufacturing states and for the Trump administration.

The U.S. auto industry's boom from 2010 through last year was a major driver for manufacturing job creation. The fading of that boom threatens prospects for U.S. industrial output and job creation that were central to President Trump's victory in Ohio and other manufacturing states.

Infographic ID: '2smL7NQ'

“This is about economics, not what Trump says,” said Robert Morales, president of United Auto Workers (UAW) union Local 1714, which represents workers at GM’s stamping plant at Lordstown. “Even if Trump went out and bought 10,000 Cruzes a month, he wouldn’t get the third shift back here.”

Last week the Federal Reserve said U.S. factory output fell 0.4 percent in May, the second decline in three months, due partly to a 2-percent drop in motor vehicles and parts production.

Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, has compiled data from government sources that show the auto industry punching higher than its weight in job creation in recent years - accounting for between 60 percent and 80 percent of all U.S. manufacturing jobs added in 2015 and 2016.

In the first quarter of this year, the auto industry accounted for less than 2 percent of the 45,000 manufacturing jobs created.

“There’s no argument with the idea that auto has been pulling the manufacturing sled up the mountain for the last three or four years,” Muro said. “If you take auto out, you’re left with a very tepid outlook indeed.”

Long-term auto layoffs could threaten the economies of communities and states directly affected, although after decades of boom and bust, many communities in the auto manufacturing heartland have diversified.

In Ohio’s Mahoning Valley, which was battered by the collapse of the once-dominant steel industry, the boom in drilling for shale gas helps offset job cuts at auto plants.

Lordstown Mayor Arno Hill says the town salted away money during the boom to pay down its debts and new businesses are coming in, including a $900-million power plant being built in town that will burn cheap natural gas produced in the region.

GM makes up 40 percent of tax receipts versus 85 percent in the early 1990s, he said.

“GM is still the brightest star in the Mahoning Valley, but luckily we have diversified our economy,” Hill said. “There is pain for the laid-off workers, but it won’t hurt us as bad it used to.”

Lordstown’s workers have taken steps to blunt the impact of layoffs, with help from GM.

Matt Streb’s wife is due to start work soon after getting a degree, while he hopes to return to a former job as a mailman. In the meantime, GM gave advance notice of job cuts so he saved extra money and has drastically cut his spending.

""The auto industry is cyclical and has always had its ups and downs,"" Streb said. ""This is just another Lordstown downturn.""

STALLING SEDAN SALES

The decline in U.S. auto sales is still minor compared to the dramatic collapse during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, when demand for new vehicles plunged to its lowest levels in decades.

However, the days when auto assembly and parts plants throughout the Midwest were running flat-out because of high demand for nearly every type of vehicle are over. Recent sales trends show consumers becoming more selective, shunning older models and especially smaller cars.

For much of the boom that ran from 2010 through to a record year in 2016 of 17.55 million new vehicles sold, the share of cars has declined versus “light trucks” - or pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers.

After peaking at 51.32 percent of all sales in 2012, passenger cars fell to 40.4 percent of sales in 2016. That decline equates to the output of seven or eight vehicle assembly plants.

Through the first five months of this year, sedan sales fell 11 percent, even as the light truck category rose 4.7 percent.

To avoid profit-sapping discounts, and reverse a decline in prices of used vehicles, automakers are ordering more and deeper production cuts.

GM has laid off more than 5,000 workers so far this year - including 1,000 at its Fairfax plant in Kansas that makes the Chevrolet Malibu midsize sedan. GM has also laid off 1,100 workers at a plant in Lansing because it has ended production of the GMC Acadia SUV there.

More GM workers will be hit with temporary layoffs this summer. Lordstown will shut up shop for five weeks this summer, much longer than the usual two-week summer vacation closure.

Many laid-off GM workers are finding temporary employment at other facilities or taking permanent transfers to plants like its Arlington, Texas, facility where production of large sport utility vehicles continues unabated. However, those temporary postings require workers to relocate hundreds of miles from home.

Randy Freeman, president of UAW Local 652 which represents workers at GM’s Grand River plant in Lansing, Michigan, which makes sedans, says he has been pleased by GM’s efforts to rehire workers and relations with the automaker “are on an upward swing.”

The threats to U.S. workers building sedans are not likely to ease, barring a spike in the price of gasoline. Ford Motor Co signaled its long-term pessimism about small-car demand in the United States by announcing plans on Tuesday to shift production of its Focus compact car model to China. The Michigan plant that builds the Focus currently is expected to switch to building trucks and SUVs in 2018.

At GM’s Lordstown and Lansing Grand River plants, UAW representatives say they are focused on improving quality in the hope that GM will pick their plant when it’s time to find a location for producing a new truck or SUV.

At Lordstown, for instance, union officials tout the fact the plant has just won a quality award for local innovation on a part that helps the Cruz run better.

“We’re working hard to make the best product we can,” said Glenn Johnson, president of UAW Local 1112 at Lordstown, “so we can raise our hands and say to GM ‘look at what we can do.”

Prime Minister Theresa May made clear in speech she was to deliver to parliament that she hoped her EU partners would make proposals at a new round of talks opening the way to the next stage of negotiations, saying “the ball is in their court”.

But even before she had delivered the speech, an EU spokesman hit back in Brussels, saying “the ball is entirely in the UK court for the rest to happen”.

May is desperate to try to regain some of her authority and refocus on talks to unravel more than 40 years of union after a speech at her party conference last week, marred by a repetitive cough, a prankster and a stage malfunction, left her weaker than ever.

She has so far fought off attempts to unseat her by critics already angry over an ill-judged election when she lost her governing Conservatives’ majority, but her weakness has opened the door for many in her party to challenge her Brexit strategy with just 18 months to go before Britain leaves the EU.

With Brussels quietly preparing for a collapse in the talks and Britain getting ready for what May calls “all eventualities”, some officials and business chiefs worry the country will crash out of the EU without a deal.

Speaking in parliament later on Monday, May will say she is determined to secure a new partnership with the other 27 members of the wealthy political and trade bloc.

“Achieving that partnership will require leadership and flexibility, not just from us but from our friends, the 27 nations of the EU,” she will say, according to excerpts of her speech.

“And as we look forward to the next stage, the ball is in their court. But I am optimistic we will receive a positive response.”

But the EU was clear: “There is a clear sequencing to these talks and there has been so far no solution found on step one, which is the divorce proceedings,” European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas told a regular briefing.

“So the ball is entirely in the UK court for the rest to happen.”

“SEE WHAT HAPPENS”

May, who will host businesses later on Monday to listen to their Brexit concerns, is keen to push the talks beyond a discussion of the divorce to try to offer firms some certainty about future trading conditions.

A report that aerospace manufacturer BAE Systems (BAES.L) is planning to cut more than 1,000 jobs can only add pressure for May to press her case for the EU to move beyond talks on the divorce settlement, the rights of expatriates and the border with EU-member Ireland.

EU negotiators say that while they see no big breakthrough at the summit next week, they may offer May a hand by offering some hope of a shift at the next scheduled meeting in mid-December.

Aides to May have signaled that the prime minister has accepted that her October deadline will not be met despite a speech in Italy last month which attempted to reset the tone of the difficult negotiations.

Her spokesman told reporters: “Let’s see what happens in the next round of talks”.

But some pro-Brexit campaigners are calling on the prime minister to get ready to step away from the talks - underlining the deep divisions in the Conservative Party.

Those differences were aired again on Monday with negative briefings in the local media against finance minister Philip Hammond, who supports prolonging the status quo with the EU for as long as possible, and foreign minister Boris Johnson, who angered some Conservatives for setting his own Brexit red lines.

Some have suggested that May will reshuffle her cabinet, but on Monday her spokesman said she had full confidence in both ministers.

“We are fast reaching the point when the prime minister should assert the authority of her office over the negotiations and call time,” Bernard Jenkin, a Conservative lawmaker, wrote in the Guardian newspaper.

LONDON (Reuters) - Iran promised on Monday to give a “crushing” response if the United States designated its elite Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist group.

The pledge came a week before President Donald Trump announces a final decision on how he wants to contain the Islamic Republic.

He is expected on Oct. 15 to “decertify” a landmark 2015 international deal to curb Iran’s nuclear program, a step that by itself stops short of pulling out of the agreement but gives Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions.

Trump is also expected to designate Iran’s most powerful security force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corp (IRGC) as a terrorist organization, as he rolls out a broader, more hawkish U.S. strategy on Iran.

“We are hopeful that the United States does not make this strategic mistake,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi was quoted as saying by the state news agency IRNA.

“If they do, Iran’s reaction would be firm, decisive and crushing and the United States should bear all its consequences,” he told a news conference reported by IRNA.

Individuals and entities associated with the IRGC are already on the U.S. list of foreign terrorist organizations, but the organization as a whole is not.

IRGC commander Mohammad Ali Jafari said on Sunday, “If the news is correct about the stupidity of the American government in considering the Revolutionary Guards a terrorist group, then the Revolutionary Guards will consider the American army to be like Islamic State all around the world.”

Jafari also said that additional sanctions would end chances for future dialogue with the United States and that the Americans would have to move their regional bases outside the 2,000 km (1,250 mile) range of IRGC’s missiles.

WARY EUROPE

U.S. sanctions on the IRGC could affect conflicts in Iraq and Syria, where Tehran and Washington both support warring parties that oppose the Islamic State militant group (IS).

France said on Monday it was worried that classifying the IRGC as a terrorist group could exacerbate tensions in the region.

Germany said it was worried Trump would decide Iran is not respecting the nuclear deal, negotiated under his predecessor Barack Obama, and fears such a step will worsen insecurity in the Middle East.

A U.S. pullout could unravel an accord seen by supporters as vital to preventing a Middle East arms race and tamping down regional tensions, since it limits Iran’s ability to enrich uranium for nuclear fuel in exchange for the lifting of sanctions that damaged its oil-based economy.

The U.N. nuclear watchdog’s inspectors have repeatedly declared Iran in compliance with the terms of the nuclear deal.

Trump called Iran “a corrupt dictatorship” during his first speech to the U.N. General Assembly and said the nuclear deal was “the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into”.

The other five world powers in the deal were Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China.

The prospect of the United States reneging on the agreement has worried other partners that helped negotiate it.

The Kremlin said that any U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal would have “negative consequences.”

British Prime Minister Theresa May, who supports the nuclear pact, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who opposes it, agreed in a phone call on Monday that they need to be “clear-eyed” about the threat Iran poses to the Middle East.

“They agreed that ... the international community should continue working together to push back against Iran’s destabilizing regional activity,” May’s spokesman said.

“MALIGN ACTIVITIES”

Despite the nuclear deal, Washington still maintains its own more limited sanctions on Iran over its ballistic missile program and over accusations Tehran supports terrorism.

Iran says it is developing missiles solely for defensive purposes and denies involvement in terrorism.

The Trump administration aims to put more pressure on the IRGC, especially over recent missile tests and what Washington has called its “malign activities” across the Middle East.

The U.S. government imposed sanctions in July on 18 entities and people for supporting the IRGC in developing drones and military equipment. In August, Congress overwhelmingly approved the “Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act” which imposed new sanctions on Iran for its ballistic missile program, as well as sanctions on Russia and North Korea.

In an interview aired on Saturday night, Trump accused Iran of “funding North Korea” and “doing things with North Korea that are totally inappropriate”.

Qasemi, Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman, said the U.S. accusations were “baseless”. He added, “Israel and some specific countries are raising these accusations to create Iranophobia.”",Iran promises 'crushing' response if U.S. designates Guards a terrorist group,https://www.reuters.com/article/iran-usa-irgc/iran-promises-crushing-response-if-u-s-designates-guards-a-terrorist-group-idINKBN1CE0ML?il=0

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Google has discovered Russian operatives spent tens of thousands of dollars on ads on its YouTube, Gmail and Google Search products in an effort to meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, a person briefed on the company’s probe told Reuters on Monday.

The ads do not appear to be from the same Kremlin-affiliated entity that bought ads on Facebook Inc, but may indicate a broader Russian online disinformation effort, according to the source, who was not authorized to discuss details of Google’s confidential investigation.

The revelation is likely to fuel further scrutiny of the role that Silicon Valley technology giants may have unwittingly played during last year’s election. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Moscow’s goal was to help elect Donald Trump.

Google has uncovered less than $100,000 in ad spending potentially linked to Russian actors, the source said.

Both Twitter Inc and Facebook recently detected and disclosed that suspected Russian operatives, working for a content farm known as the Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg, Russia, used their platforms to purchase ads and post content that was politically divisive in a bid to influence Americans before and after the November 2016 presidential election.

The Internet Research Agency employ hundreds of so-called “trolls” who post pro-Kremlin content, much of it fake or discredited, under the guise of phony social media accounts that posed as American or European, according to lawmakers and researchers.

Facebook announced last month it had unearthed $100,000 in spending by the Internet Research Agency and, under pressure from lawmakers, has pledged to be more transparent about how its ads are purchased and targeted.

Google’s review had been more robust than ones undertaken so far by Facebook or Twitter, the source said.

Russia’s ad purchases were first reported by the Washington Post.

Google, owned by Alphabet Inc, did not deny the story, and in a statement pointed to its existing ad policies that limit political ad targeting and prohibit targeting based on race or religion.

“We are taking a deeper look to investigate attempts to abuse our systems, working with researchers and other companies, and will provide assistance to ongoing inquiries,” a Google spokeswoman said on Monday.

VIELHA, Spain (Reuters) - If Catalonia declares independence from Spain this week, one community in the region’s mountainous north might declare independence from Catalonia.

Most people in the picturesque Aran Valley - a semi-autonomous community nestled among the Pyrenees - want to stay with Spain, and the area has the right to self-determination under a law passed in 2015 by the Catalan parliament.

“We’re a little spot on the map and often we’re not taken into account,” said Maria Verges Perez, the deputy mayor of Aran’s capital, Vielha, a cluster of stone-and-slate houses on the valley floor ringed by autumnal forests.

“But we will exercise our right to decide our future.”

Catalan President Carles Puigdemont is expected to declare independence on Tuesday in Spain’s worst constitutional crisis since the return of democracy in the 1970s.

The roughly 10,000 people of Aran, on the border with France, have a language and culture distinct from the rest of Catalonia, which itself differs from the rest of Spain. The valley’s economy is heavily dependent on winter sports tourists from Spain and the EU.

Their politicians say the 2015 law gives them the right to vote on whether they want to break away with Catalonia - something which Catalan officials do not dispute.

The Spanish government has vowed to prevent Catalonia seceding. Losing the region would deprive the country of 16 percent of its people and a fifth of its economic output.

But while Madrid insists Spain is indivisible under its constitution, the Aran Valley underlines the complex nature of nationhood in such a culturally diverse country.

Ever since Spain’s return to democracy in the 1970s, Madrid has struggled to balance the country’s patchwork of regional identities, including its decades-long fight to quell separatism in the northern Basque Country led by violent militants ETA.

Few in the medieval villages along the Aran Valley doubt the community would opt to stay with Spain if asked to vote.

“The people here feel very far away from what is going on in Barcelona,” said Carlos Barrera, head of the Aran government, at a rural festival in Salardu village where locals judged stocky Pyrenean horses and handed out racks of blood sausages.

CROWN OF ARAGON

The valley had the lowest voter turnout by far in Catalonia’s Oct. 1 independence referendum, which had been declared illegal by Spain’s constitutional court.

Across Catalonia there was a 43 percent turnout, with most people who wanted to remain in Spain staying home, and 90 percent of those who voted backed secession. In Aran, just 24 percent voted, with 84 percent of those backing independence.

The valley traces its political allegiances back to pacts drawn up in the 13th century with the Crown of Aragon, a monarchy that would join with the Crown of Castille two centuries later to form what became Spain. Many locals speak Aranese, a dialect of the Occitan language still spoken in pockets of the Pyrenees and southern France.

Two years ago, the Catalan parliament approved the “Law on Aran’s Special Status”, giving it control over its culture, language and administration and recognizing “the right of the Aranese people to decide their future”.

A Catalan government spokesman said Catalonia would respect the Aranese people’s decision in any future referendum.

A Spanish government spokesman declined to comment on whether Aran could remain part of Spain, saying Catalonia would never become independent.

Aran’s residents are some of the sternest critics of the Catalan government which they say is ignoring those people who want to stay in Spain and charging toward independence at any cost.

In Vielha, a lone red and yellow Catalan independence flag hanging from an apartment block was the only evidence last Saturday of the separatist fever sweeping many parts of the region, where cities convulse with protests triggered by Madrid’s violent crackdown on the referendum.

PRICE OF INDEPENDENCE

Many people in Aran fear Catalan independence would destroy its tourism economy which revolves around Baqueira-Beret, Spain’s most popular ski resort.

About two-thirds of the population in Aran depend on the ski resort for jobs. In the winter, the population triples with the influx of skiers drawn to the same slopes used by Spain’s royal family.

Since the referendum, Verges Perez, the Vielha deputy mayor, said potential visitors had canceled almost 30 percent of hotel reservations for next week’s local holidays. And if an independent Catalonia was no longer part of the European Union, Aran’s reliance on agreements to use French hospitals for medical emergencies would be jeopardized, she added.

“That’s the trap. Nobody has explained the price that independence like this would have,” she said.

Many of Catalonia’s largest businesses have already said they are transferring their headquarters out of the region due to the political turmoil. Insurance firm Catalana Occidente, owned by the same family that owns Baqueira-Beret, is reportedly considering doing the same, although it has not confirmed it.

The valley ranks as one of Catalonia’s wealthiest regions, thanks to a tunnel that opened it up to the rest of Spain in 1948. Before then, it was a poor area only accessible by an often snow-covered mountain pass.

The valley’s politicians say holding their own referendum could be the only way to defend the local economy.

But Jaime Geli, Salardu’s 72-year-old former mayor and one of the few independence supporters here, said locals shouldn’t be so quick to throw their lot in with Spain instead of sticking with Catalonia.

Catalan authorities had protected the Aranese culture and language from a central government hostile to the idea that Spain is made up of different “nations”, he said, sat by the valley’s river.

Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU) agreed with their conservative CSU Bavarian allies on Sunday to limit to 200,000 the number of people Germany would accept per year on humanitarian grounds.

It was part of Merkel’s drive to get the sister party on board so that she can start talks with the Greens and Free Democrats (FPD) on forming a “Jamaica” coalition - named for the black, green and yellow colors of the three blocs, which match the Caribbean island’s flag.

“We achieved a joint result which I think is a very, very good basis to go into exploratory talks with the FDP and Greens,” Merkel told a joint news conference with her Bavarian counterpart Horst Seehofer on Monday.

But underlying the difficulties in forging a coalition, the Greens said they disagreed with the migrant limit.

It would not stop a coalition being discussed, Green co-leader Cem Ozdemir said, but stressed it would not be part of the formal coalition agreement if one is reached.

Merkel said her conservative bloc would begin exploratory talks next week on forming a coalition - first with the FDP and Greens separately on Oct. 18, and then in a three-way format on Oct. 20.

Related Coverage Merkel says to begin three-way German coalition talks next week

Such a three-way tie-up is untested at national level but it is Merkel’s only realistic option of forming a government as the center-left Social Democrats - her previous coalition partners - insist they want to go into opposition.

Ozdemir dismissed the migrant limit as an internal CDU-CSU matter.

“It definitely won’t appear in a possible coalition agreement,” he said, adding the pro-migrant Greens wanted quick and fair processes for newcomers to Germany, effective integration measures and an immigration law with clear rules and criteria.

The Greens reject a cap on migrant arrivals that the Bavarian CSU has been advocating in view of an influx of 890,000 migrants in 2015 and 280,000 in 2016, with many of them entering the country via Bavaria.

Although arrivals are expected to drop further this year, the issue is expected to set sparks flying between the CSU and Greens in coalition talks.

COALITION FOUNDATIONS

Merkel said the limit of 200,000 migrants per year did not mean the 200,001st refugee to arrive would be deported but rather he or she would have the right for his or her case to be individually considered. A package of measures would, however, ensure that the limit is not breached, she added.

Merkel and Seehofer stressed that the government and lower house of parliament could change the rules to allow more or fewer people into Germany if the national or international situation changed unexpectedly such as if a war were to break out of if there were rising unemployment in Germany.

Seehofer said it would be mandatory for parliament to have a say on the adjustments.

But Merkel said even if there were adjustments there would not be a repeat of the 2015 migrant influx because of factors such as the migrant deal between the European Union and Turkey, partnerships with Africa and the expanded remit of the EU’s border control agency Frontex.

She said asylum applications for newcomers would be processed in centers where decisions can also be made to deport them because it had proved difficult to deport rejected asylum seekers once they had been distributed to towns.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Fostering monetary conditions conducive to economic growth were a constant consideration for Indian policymakers, but would not take priority over achieving the central bank’s inflation target, Governor Urjit Patel told a newspaper on Monday.

Patel told the Mint newspaper that the economy was recovering, after growth slowed to a three-year low of 5.7 percent in the April-June quarter.

The slowdown had sparked some calls for lower interest rates, but with inflation rising the RBI left rates unchanged at a review by the monetary policy committee (MPC) last week.

“Growth is always there in the MPC’s scheme of things; we don’t lose sight of that, but not at the cost of inflation,” Patel was quoted as saying in the interview.

“However, we have to be careful — we should aim at achieving the inflation target without losing sight of supporting economic growth.”

Consumer inflation accelerated to 3.36 percent in August. India’s central bank has a medium-term target for annual inflation of 4 percent with the flexibility of plus/minus 2 percent on either side to make room for food price volatility.

The (MPC) will strive to achieve its 4 percent inflation target on a “durable basis”, Patel said.

Last week, the RBI kept its repo rate unchanged at 6.00 percent as expected last week, and raised inflation projections, cooling hopes for future rate cuts.

However, Patel said growth was already starting to recover. The RBI last week cut its projection for gross value added - an indicator of growth it prefers to 6.7 percent from 7.3 percent for the year ending in March - higher than some analyst forecasts.

“Our projections based on high frequency real economy indicators suggest that growth will pick up in the third and fourth quarters (of the current fiscal year) to above 7 percent,” he told Mint.

“We have started seeing the upturn.”

Patel has given only a handful of interviews since taking over as RBI Governor late last year.

PRICE OF INDEPENDENCESlideshow (14 Images)Many people in Aran fear Catalan independence would destroy its tourism economy which revolves around Baqueira-Beret, Spain’s most popular ski resort.","VIELHA, Spain (Reuters) - If Catalonia declares independence from Spain this week, one community in the region’s mountainous north might declare independence from Catalonia.

Most people in the picturesque Aran Valley - a semi-autonomous community nestled among the Pyrenees - want to stay with Spain, and the area has the right to self-determination under a law passed in 2015 by the Catalan parliament.

“We’re a little spot on the map and often we’re not taken into account,” said Maria Verges Perez, the deputy mayor of Aran’s capital, Vielha, a cluster of stone-and-slate houses on the valley floor ringed by autumnal forests.

“But we will exercise our right to decide our future.”

Catalan President Carles Puigdemont is expected to declare independence on Tuesday in Spain’s worst constitutional crisis since the return of democracy in the 1970s.

The roughly 10,000 people of Aran, on the border with France, have a language and culture distinct from the rest of Catalonia, which itself differs from the rest of Spain. The valley’s economy is heavily dependent on winter sports tourists from Spain and the EU.

Their politicians say the 2015 law gives them the right to vote on whether they want to break away with Catalonia - something which Catalan officials do not dispute.

The Spanish government has vowed to prevent Catalonia seceding. Losing the region would deprive the country of 16 percent of its people and a fifth of its economic output.

But while Madrid insists Spain is indivisible under its constitution, the Aran Valley underlines the complex nature of nationhood in such a culturally diverse country.

Ever since Spain’s return to democracy in the 1970s, Madrid has struggled to balance the country’s patchwork of regional identities, including its decades-long fight to quell separatism in the northern Basque Country led by violent militants ETA.

Few in the medieval villages along the Aran Valley doubt the community would opt to stay with Spain if asked to vote.

“The people here feel very far away from what is going on in Barcelona,” said Carlos Barrera, head of the Aran government, at a rural festival in Salardu village where locals judged stocky Pyrenean horses and handed out racks of blood sausages.

CROWN OF ARAGON

The valley had the lowest voter turnout by far in Catalonia’s Oct. 1 independence referendum, which had been declared illegal by Spain’s constitutional court.

Across Catalonia there was a 43 percent turnout, with most people who wanted to remain in Spain staying home, and 90 percent of those who voted backed secession. In Aran, just 24 percent voted, with 84 percent of those backing independence.

The valley traces its political allegiances back to pacts drawn up in the 13th century with the Crown of Aragon, a monarchy that would join with the Crown of Castille two centuries later to form what became Spain. Many locals speak Aranese, a dialect of the Occitan language still spoken in pockets of the Pyrenees and southern France.

Two years ago, the Catalan parliament approved the “Law on Aran’s Special Status”, giving it control over its culture, language and administration and recognising “the right of the Aranese people to decide their future”.

A Catalan government spokesman said Catalonia would respect the Aranese people’s decision in any future referendum.

A Spanish government spokesman declined to comment on whether Aran could remain part of Spain, saying Catalonia would never become independent.

Aran’s residents are some of the sternest critics of the Catalan government which they say is ignoring those people who want to stay in Spain and charging towards independence at any cost.

In Vielha, a lone red and yellow Catalan independence flag hanging from an apartment block was the only evidence last Saturday of the separatist fever sweeping many parts of the region, where cities convulse with protests triggered by Madrid’s violent crackdown on the referendum.

PRICE OF INDEPENDENCE

Many people in Aran fear Catalan independence would destroy its tourism economy which revolves around Baqueira-Beret, Spain’s most popular ski resort.

About two-thirds of the population in Aran depend on the ski resort for jobs. In the winter, the population triples with the influx of skiers drawn to the same slopes used by Spain’s royal family.

Since the referendum, Verges Perez, the Vielha deputy mayor, said potential visitors had cancelled almost 30 percent of hotel reservations for next week’s local holidays. And if an independent Catalonia was no longer part of the European Union, Aran’s reliance on agreements to use French hospitals for medical emergencies would be jeopardised, she added.

“That’s the trap. Nobody has explained the price that independence like this would have,” she said.

Many of Catalonia’s largest businesses have already said they are transferring their headquarters out of the region due to the political turmoil. Insurance firm Catalana Occidente, owned by the same family that owns Baqueira-Beret, is reportedly considering doing the same, although it has not confirmed it.

The valley ranks as one of Catalonia’s wealthiest regions, thanks to a tunnel that opened it up to the rest of Spain in 1948. Before then, it was a poor area only accessible by an often snow-covered mountain pass.

The valley’s politicians say holding their own referendum could be the only way to defend the local economy.

But Jaime Geli, Salardu’s 72-year-old former mayor and one of the few independence supporters here, said locals shouldn’t be so quick to throw their lot in with Spain instead of sticking with Catalonia.

Catalan authorities had protected the Aranese culture and language from a central government hostile to the idea that Spain is made up of different “nations”, he said, sat by the valley’s river.

In the 1960’s and 1970’s, the central goal was preventing North Korean founder Kim Il Sung from redeploying his army south of the 38th parallel. For the last 25 years, however, the focus of U.S. policymakers has been something even more difficult: the denuclearization of the Kim dynasty.

Pyongyang’s two intercontinental ballistic missile tests in July, its testing of a Hwasong-12 missile over Japan in August and the September 3 test of what Pyongyang claimed was a hydrogen bomb have only accelerated the sense of urgency in Washington, Seoul, and Tokyo about the need for a strong collective response.

The U.S. foreign policy community has many recommendations on the table but few easy answers. A preventive military strike is not plausible given its devastating cost - Brigadier General Rob Givens (retired) estimates that 20,000 people would perish in Seoul in the first day of a conflict. Even though the U.N. Security Council voted Monday to step up sanctions against Pyongyang, economic restrictions have limited impact. Pyongyang is a master of sanctions evasion, devising ever new and effective ways to keep their weapons programs funded.

Adele M. Stan: How Trump mainstreamed hate

What may work, however, is a new U.S. approach that learns from its failures - as well as its successes during the Cold War - while tempering expectations on what can be achieved.

The Kim dynasty has long sought recognition as a nuclear weapons state, a demand that would be a political minefield for even the most popular U.S. president to meet. But North Korea is a nuclear state whether Washington offers formal recognition or not. The only way for the U.S. to improve its North Korea policy is by acknowledging that Pyongyang will be nuclear-capable for many years to come and is highly unlikely to eliminate its nuclear weapons program regardless of what Washington offers. This isn’t about what Kim Jong Un wants, but rather what is most likely to serve U.S. national security.

While openly recognizing North Korea as a nuclear power would cause tremors throughout Asia, Trump ought to do it anyway. As soon as he does, the U.S. can re-focus attention from a denuclearization objective that is increasingly impossible to imagine toward an old-fashioned strategy of deterrence and containment. “We know how to contain and degrade enemies who want to do us harm,” Harry Kazianis of the Center for the National Interest told me. “We just need to open a history book and reread what works and apply it for the 21st century.”

For Washington, deterrence and containment would mean building an anti-North Korea alliance of diverse states in and outside the region with the common objective of minimizing Pyongyang’s ability to threaten its neighbors. As former State Department official Richard Sokolsky told me in an email: “If we could deter the likes of Stalin and Mao, we can do the same with Kim.”

As politically risky as this decision would be, effective deterrence would require Trump to establish a reliable channel of communication with the North - similar to the U.S.-Soviet and U.S.-China hotlines during the Cold War - in order to clear up misunderstandings that will inevitably arise and to deliver a unified message of what Washington will tolerate. The signal to the leadership in Pyongyang should be as unambiguous as possible: while Washington does not seek an armed conflict with the North, the U.S. military will respond to any provocation that dangerously impacts the interests of the U.S. or its allies. The message would aim to trade coexistence between the U.S. and North Korea for as long as Kim Jong Un refrains from launching an attack against his neighbors. Given Kim’s preoccupation with self-preservation - there is no evidence to date he is bent on suicidal self-destruction - this arrangement may be pragmatic enough for the young dictator to explore.

Because the Kim dynasty has been accused of exporting and cooperating with countries like Iran and Syria on nuclear designs, missile technology, and possibly chemical weapons development, the Security Council ought to deliver a similar message to Pyongyang that a continuation of this behavior would be grounds for an even tougher and more comprehensive boycott of what it can import and export.

While China remains resistant to cutting off all oil imports to the North or squeezing its economy to the point of collapse, Washington may be willing to enlist Beijing’s help in areas where Beijing is more likely to agree, such as preventing the proliferation of dual use nuclear and missile technology transiting North Korean territory. Stemming the flow of these materials would minimize the spread of weapons of dangerous items to other proliferators, an objective that the Chinese appear to share.

Washington also needs to encourage a stronger South Korea-Japan relationship. Historical rivalries between these two states cannot obstruct the regional intelligence sharing essential to promoting a unity of purpose in East Asia. The Trump administration needs to spend far more diplomatic capital on alliance-building than it has to date. Open talk about scrapping the free trade agreement only destabilizes the kinds of partnerships that form the bedrock of an anti-Pyongyang alliance. Washington can and should allow the South Koreans to take more responsibility for its external defense, but it can do so without giving Pyongyang a reason to believe that its nuclear development is causing divisions among its adversaries.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China said on Thursday it has approved HP Inc’s (HPQ.N) $1.1 billion purchase of Samsung Electronics’ (005930.KS) printer business with certain restrictions, citing concerns about the U.S. firm’s dominance of the domestic laser printer market.

HP announced the deal in September 2016, hoping to disrupt the $55 billion copier market by focusing on multifunction printers and more deeply embedding mobile and cloud printing technologies to its product solutions.

It hoped at the time to close the transaction within 12 months, pending regulatory review.

In a statement issued late on Thursday, the Ministry of Commerce said sale of A4 format laser printers by HP in China should be done on “fair and reasonable” terms and the firm must report every six months on their prices and related data to the ministry.

HP must not buy any stakes in other A4 printer manufacturers in China even if they are a minority equity investment, it said.

It must not adapt its printers to restrict compatibility with third-parties or claim in advertising that its printers are not compatible with other suppliers, the ministry said.

HP expects to close the acquisition in the fourth quarter which ends on Dec. 31, a spokeswoman said in an email. She declined to comment on the regulatory process.

Samsung was not immediately available for comment.

That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ second annual ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science and invent new technologies.

REUTERS TOP 75

The most innovative university in the region, for the second year running, is South Korea’s KAIST. Formerly known as the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, it is the nation’s oldest research-oriented science and engineering university, with campuses in Daejeon, Seoul and Busan.

KAIST earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than 74 out of the 75 top-ranked universities in the region, and outside researchers frequently cite KAIST inventions in their own patents and research papers. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Asia Pacific’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

Recent KAIST research highlights include the development of a “parasite” robot that controls the movements of a living host: The device is mounted onto the shell of a turtle, and uses a combination of flashing lights and food rewards to direct the animal. The research could lead to hybrid animal-robot systems that would allow access to environments that would otherwise be difficult to reach on their own. In 2015 a university team collaborated with Rainbow Co, a company spun out of KAIST’s Humanoid Robot Research Center, to win the U.S. Department of Defense’s DARPA Robotics Challenge with an adaptable humanoid robot, DRC-HUBO.

The second most innovative university in the Asia Pacific region is also based in South Korea. Seoul National University was founded in 1946 as the country’s first national university, and now operates 16 colleges, one graduate school and 10 professional schools. In 2016 SNU received more than KRW 76 billion (about $68 million) in research funding from external industry, approximately 15 percent of its total funding.

South Korean universities typically have close relationships with industry. Fourth-place Pohang University of Science & Technology, or POSTECH, was actually founded by the South Korean steel company POSCO in 1986, and its 400-acre campus is located only a few minutes away from POSCO headquarters. POSTECH ranks first among all universities on the list in terms of the percentage of research articles it produces that include a co-author from industry, and the number of times its research papers are cited by articles originating in the private sector.

Overall, South Korean universities fill four of the top five spots on the ranking and eight of the top 20. There are 22 South Korean universities among the top 75, far more than you’d expect from a relatively small nation. Korea’s population is just under 51 million, so that’s one top-ranked university per 2.3 million people. In contrast, China has the most universities on the list – 25 between Hong Kong and the mainland – but it also has a massive population of more than 1.37 billion people, or one top-ranked university per 54.9 million people. (Japan has 19 ranked universities, Australia has five, Singapore has two, and New Zealand and India each have one.)

Some nations underperform on the ranking because of the way they organize their university systems. Despite boasting the world’s second-largest population (more than 1.26 billion) and one of its largest economies, only one Indian university appears in the top 75, The Indian Institutes of Technology (#71). IIT is a network of 23 universities which centralizes its patent administration, so it's not always possible to identify which constituent university was responsible for what research. As a result, Reuters ranked the entire system as opposed to individual universities. World-class campuses like IIT Delhi and IIT Bombay may have ranked much higher on the list if they weren’t grouped in with smaller and newer institutes like IIT Tirupati and IIT Palakkad.

And some countries are missing from the list entirely. There are no ranked universities in Indonesia, which contains Asia’s third largest population. Nor are there any universities in Pakistan or Bangladesh, the region’s fourth- and fifth-most populous countries, or any universities in the Philippines and Vietnam, two of the region’s largest economies.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included universities in East Asia, South Asia, and Oceania, and then ranked them based on their performance.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Asia’s Most Innovative Universities. Five universities that ranked in the top 75 last year slipped off the list in 2017: Japan’s Nihon University, the Indian Institute of Science – Bangalore, Putra University Malaysia, the University of South Australia, and Malaysia’s University of Malaya. These drop offs were all supplanted by fast-growing institutions in China and South Korea: the China University of Petroleum (#45), the University of Ulsan (#69), the University of Electronic Science & Technology of China (#70), Yeungnam University (#73), and Tongji University (#75).

The returning university that made the biggest move on the list was the University of Hong Kong, which climbed 26 spots from #56 to #30. That change is largely attributable to adjustments in Clarivate Analytics’ methodology: The university’s 2016 ranking did not account for patents that originated at HKU but were assigned to its commercialization arm, Versitech Limited, and the addition of those patents improves the university’s overall performance. Other big movers include China’s Huazhong University of Science & Technology (up 24 spots to #33) and the Beijing University of Chemical Technology (up 13 spots to #34). Japan's Okayama University (down 14 spots to #52) and Waseda University (down 18 to #66) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Overall, the ranking remained largely stable year over year, with eight of 2016’s top 10 universities returning to the top 10, and 18 of the top 20.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of the scope of its researchers’ work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 75 in the region: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa will relocate six endangered black rhinos to Chad where the animal was hunted to local extinction decades ago, the environment ministry in Pretoria said.

If the experiment is successful, the central African nation will host the most northerly wild population of black rhinos in Africa. This could pave the way for the species to be reintroduced to other parts of its former continental range from which it was exterminated due to poaching.

“A team of experts from South Africa will visit Chad to assess the habitat, security and management suitability and associated ecological parameters as well as infrastructural readiness prior to the translocation,” South Africa’s environment ministry said in a statement.

A date for the relocation has not been set yet.

The rhinos’ destination will be Zakouma National Park in the southeast of Chad, an impoverished oil-producer. Found just south of the Sahara Desert, Zakouma is home to a recovering elephant population of several hundred and is managed by the African Parks Foundation, a conservation NGO.

Africa has two rhino species of which the white rhino is the larger and more numerous of the two. The black rhino is famed for its ornery disposition and is far more apt to charge at any perceived threat.

Black rhinos have not roamed Chad since the early 1970s and the species has been eliminated from much of its original range in the face of relentless poaching.

The move comes against the backdrop of an unfolding rhino poaching crisis in South Africa, home to most of the world’s population of the bulky pachyderms.

The number of rhinos poached for their horns in South Africa fell 10 percent in 2016 to 1,054, the second straight year of decline according to government data, but conservationists say the levels remain alarming.

Rhino poaching rates in South Africa had surged from 83 in 2008 to a record 1,215 in 2014 to meet red-hot demand in newly-affluent Asian countries such as Vietnam, where the horn is prized as a key ingredient in traditional medicines.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Investors are increasingly excited about the prospects for much faster growth in the solar power industry in Southeast Asia, which has until now been a backwater for renewable energy.

They say that the region is in a perfect position to benefit from rapidly declining prices in solar panels. It has strong economic growth, relatively high costs of electricity and a shortage from traditional sources, undeveloped infrastructure in more remote areas, plenty of sunshine, and backing for more renewable energy from many of Southeast Asia’s governments.

“Dramatically falling costs for solar energy technologies means businesses and governments are choosing renewable energy not for environmental reasons but for economic ones,” said Roberto De Vido, spokesman for Singapore-based Equis, one of Asia’s biggest green energy-focused investment firms with $2.7 billion in committed capital. “It simply makes good business sense. And that’s a trend that’s not going to change,”

By the end of last year, Southeast Asia had installed solar capacity of only just over 3 gigawatts (GW), a mere 1 percent of global capacity, according to data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena).

Steve O’Neil, the chief executive of Singapore-based solar panel maker REC, said he expects that to grow by 5 GW of new installations every year between 2017-2020. That’s the equivalent of building five standard fossil-fuel power stations annually.

""People don't realize what is about to happen, when you're in the middle of exponential growth,"" said REC's O'Neil. ""It's transformational.

Some European funds are among those looking at the region.

“The projects on offer in Europe are stagnating, so European investors are looking in that direction with great interest,” said Armin Sandhoevel, chief investment officer for Infrastructure Equity at Allianz Global Investors, whose team manages 1.6 billion euros ($1.76 billion) worth of renewable investments.

“In Asia, you’d expect double-digit returns. That’s hard to achieve in Europe,” he said.

Southeast Asia has a population of more than 600 million and annual power demand growth of 6 percent, which most countries struggle to meet.

Solar power potential is measured by Global Horizontal Irradiation (GHI), a measurement of the intensity of the sun. Thailand has a GHI that can produce 1,600 to 2,000 kilowatt-hours of solar power per square meter (kWh/m2), well above the 1,000 to 1,200 kWh/m2 in Europe’s solar leader Germany, according to solar weather and data provider Solargis.

The region is ripe for a boom because solar panel prices have crashed to under 50 cents per watt of electricity today from $70 per watt in 1980 as technology and manufacturing efficiency have improved consistently.

At the same time, Southeast Asian countries have all set ambitious renewable energy targets, ranging from 18 percent of overall energy generation mix in Thailand and Malaysia to 35 percent in the Philippines, up from negligible levels today.

There are, of course, still risks for investors - including currency volatility, the difficulties of making land acquisitions, and usually the lack of any government guarantees, said Sharad Somani, head of Asia/Pacific Power & Utilities at KPMG.

Storing solar power through the night remains a hurdle too, though battery technology is improving rapidly.

VENTURE CAPITAL

Bringing together international investors, panel makers, and potential users is a small but growing group of venture capital firms, mostly based in Singapore.

GA Power is one such firm. Led by German solar business veterans, it focuses entirely on financing and developing solar projects across Southeast Asia.

“There is more money than there are projects. If you can offer professional developed projects, you’ll have no issue organizing funding,” said Roland Quast, GA Power’s managing director, adding that “a solar boom in Southeast Asia is unavoidable” given it is now a competitive power source.

He said an investor can expect around a 12 percent economic internal rate of return on average in the region. The measurement reflects returns after costs for the construction, installation, and operation of a project.

Mid-sized solar projects that can be turned on without having to tap into a larger grid are in favor in the region as governments seek to bring power to an area without having to add expensive infrastructure, Quast said.

KPMG’s Somani, who is an adviser in the renewables sector, said that Equis and other funds are raising capital with U.S. and European institutional investors, including pension funds. Equis declined to provide detail on the sources of its money.

“Today we have unique confluence of all three factors necessary for success of such projects – demand for projects from government/utility side supported by conducive regulatory framework, strong developer and supplier interest and abundance of domestic and international financing availability,” Somani said.

KILLER ARGUMENT

At the REC solar panel factory in Singapore, one of Singapore’s biggest manufacturing sites, a thousand workers and more than a hundred robots work around the clock, churning out 20 containers full of panels every day, which are immediately sent to overseas customers, increasingly to Southeast Asia.

“We produce 14,000 panels per day, which go into 20 containers, 24/7. We never stop,” REC’s O‘Neil told Reuters during a recent visit to the factory.

Founded in Norway, headquartered in Singapore, and owned by Chinese industrial giant ChemChina, O‘Neil says that REC sells globally, but that he expects “Southeast Asia to become a game-changer.”

In 2016, REC grew by just 3 percent in Southeast Asia - excluding the huge solar markets of India, China and Australia. This year, it expects 5 percent growth in the region, and then 9 to 10 percent growth annually between 2018 and 2020.

The business is cut-throat. Cheap Chinese production of solar panels has left a trail of collapsed companies in its wake - the bankruptcies of Germany’s SolarWorld, once Europe’s biggest panel maker, and major U.S. panel maker Suniva are among them.

To survive, REC says it needs to be in a relentless drive to improve productivity, including employing low-wage Malaysian workers and automating as much as possible.

“Our panels are now cheaper than a same-sized window,” said O‘Neil.",Here comes the sun: investors increasingly hot on solar projects in S.E. Asia,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asia-renewables-analysis/here-comes-the-sun-investors-increasingly-hot-on-solar-projects-in-s-e-asia-idUSKBN18Y0DU

SYDNEY (Reuters) - The World Solar Challenge began on Sunday with 42 solar cars crossing Australia’s tropical north to its southern shores, a grueling 3,000 km (1,864 mile) race through the outback.

The race from the northern city of Darwin to the southern city of Adelaide is expected to take a week for most cars, with speeds of 90-100 kmh (55-62 mph) powered only by the sun.

The fastest time was achieved by Japan’s Tokai University in 2009, completing the transcontinetal race in only 29 hours and 49 minutes.

Belgian team Punch Powertrain started first on Sunday after recording a trial time of 2:03.8 for 2.97 km (1.78 miles), hitting an average speed of 83.4 kmh (51.5mph).

But reigning 2015 champions Nuon from Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands believes it has a good chance of retaining the prize.

“All the cars look completely different (this year), and all we know is we’ve got a good car, we’ve got it running perfectly the last couple of days and we’re confident we’re going to do everything to win,” tour manager Sarah Benninkbolt said Sunday.

Race director Chris Selwood said the biennial event has attracted one of the best fields ever, with teams from more than 40 countries.

“This is the 30th anniversary of the Bridgestone World Solar Challenge and competitors want to be part of that. They have been drawn to the challenge of new regulations which reduced the solar array size without limiting the size of the solar car,” Selwood said.

Teams come from countries including the United States, Japan, Germany, Chile, Netherlands, United Kingdom, Malaysia, Belgium, Sweden, Iran, South Korea, India, Hong Kong, South Africa, Poland, Thailand, Turkey, Canada, Taiwan and Australia.

The Northern Territory Minister for Tourism and Culture, Lauren Moss said her government’s A$250,000 (US$194,150) sponsorship of the race showed it was committed to achieving 50 percent renewable energy for the territory by 2030.

“Innovation is at the heart of the event and the technology showcased this year will influence continuing solar innovation for vehicles and householders in the future,” she said.

“This event is a great promotion for the NT – it shows our ability to innovate to the world.”",Solar cars begin race across Australian desert,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-race-australia-solar/solar-cars-begin-race-across-australian-desert-idUSKBN1CD04Y

Trump’s only explicit mention of human rights was to condemn — without naming names — the “governments with egregious human rights records” that sit on the UN Human Rights Council.
What Trump did not say, therefore, is just as much of a threat to human rights as what he did.","President Donald Trump’s opening speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday is drawing widespread criticism for his aggressive statements about North Korea and Iran, but it is just as significant for what he didn’t mention at all.

In a 42-minute address that stunned many listeners, Trump called the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un “Rocket Man on a suicide mission” and vowed to “totally destroy” the country if it attacks the United States. He promised to crush “loser terrorists.” He called the Iran nuclear deal an “embarrassment” and said portions of the world are “going to hell.”

The overarching theme of Trump’s speech was sovereignty – a word he used 21 times. It was a strange emphasis in an increasingly interconnected, globalized world. Though in line with his ""America first"" platform, it was highly unusual for a U.S. leader speaking in a global forum that stands for peace through cooperation. What Trump left out was just as important: he did not offset his emphasis on sovereignty — with its implication that what a nation does within its borders is of no concern to the international community — with an assertion of the primacy of universal human rights or Washington’s commitment to promoting democracy.

Indeed, Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, their vast ideological differences notwithstanding, sounded far more similar to each other when addressing the UN than Trump did to either of them or his other predecessors.

The three most glaring omissions were climate change, human rights and Russia’s efforts to destabilize Western democracies. Trump’s ignoring climate change was no surprise, given his rejection of climate science and planned withdrawal from the UN-sponsored Paris climate agreement. President Obama, by comparison, frequently argued for international climate cooperation in his UN speeches.

But the other subjects Trump avoided were less expected. American commitment to helping the UN advance human rights has long been a staple in UN addresses by presidents, no matter their political party. Although Trump said that he intends to work hard on an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal at a Wednesday meeting with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, the fact that a settlement wasn’t mentioned during the UN address suggests the issue is no longer a White House priority.

In his UN speech Trump also offered no direct condemnation of China or Russia, despite their recent actions that have undermined — and antagonized — the United States on the world stage.

These omissions were a stark departure from past U.S. presidents. Though Trump’s condemnation of North Korea, Iran and Venezuela echoed Bush’s “axis of evil,” Bush’s annual UN addresses promoted the spread of democracy and nation-building abroad. Obama, meanwhile, emphasized diplomacy and international institutions to resolve conflict, achieve peace and protect human rights.

Any call for the respect of rights in Trump’s speech was reserved for nations, not people. “Our success depends on a coalition of strong and independent nations that embrace their sovereignty, to promote security, prosperity, and peace, for themselves and for the world,” he said, adding that he expects nations to “uphold these two core sovereign duties: to respect the interests of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation.”

For all the president’s focus on sovereignty, he ignored threats to from Russia, such as its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, and what U.S. intelligence agencies say was Moscow’s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and hacking of French election infrastructure.

As for China, Trump made only a vague reference to its threat in the South China Sea, where Beijing has built up islands and military outposts in an area the United States regards as international waters. Trump did, however, thank both Russia and China by name for their recent UN Security Council votes for more sanctions on North Korea. His choice of words could perhaps be interpreted as recognition of how much he will need their support facing down the Kim regime.

Trump’s only explicit mention of human rights was to condemn — without naming names — the “governments with egregious human rights records” that sit on the UN Human Rights Council. China and American allies such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar are the obvious suspects. (Trump did say, “We call for the full restoration of democracy and political freedoms in Venezuela,” but his overwhelming focus regarding Venezuela was on attacking its socialist economy.)

He did not raise the humanitarian crisis in Myanmar, where more than 420,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled to Bangladesh in what the United Nations called “a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.” Calling out Myanmar would have carried little political risk for Trump and would have gone a long way toward pressuring the country to drop its brutal campaign.

The focus on sovereignty conjured a picture of a world where every nation only looks out for itself. It is also a world where the United States abandons its role as a leader.

What Trump did not say, therefore, is just as much of a threat to human rights as what he did. He repeatedly extolled the virtues of strong nations over strong international institutions and held up the nation-state as “the best vehicle for elevating the human condition.” What’s unclear just how this is supposed to work. His rhetoric of sovereignty gives oppressive regimes permission to violate their citizens’ rights, and tells the rest of the world it’s okay to turn a blind eye.","Commentary: At the UN, Trump’s silences spoke volumes",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-karas-trump-commentary/commentary-at-the-un-trumps-silences-spoke-volumes-idUSKCN1BW2AC

”It is for this reason why so many of my friends, most of whom were born outside Australia, didn’t support Australia in sporting contests.

The Pakistan-born 30-year-old said in a blog post that racial abuse was widespread on the playing field during his junior days and blamed it for curtailing the sporting ambitions of a number of his overseas-born friends.

“Getting sledged by opposition players and their parents was the norm,” Khawaja wrote on the PlayersVoice website.

”Some of them said it just quietly enough for only me to hear. It still hurt, but I would never show it. Most of the time it was when I scored runs.

”Some parents take things too seriously.

”It is for this reason why so many of my friends, most of whom were born outside Australia, didn’t support Australia in sporting contests. I didn’t either.

“Especially in cricket. It was either West Indies, Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka. Anyone else.”

The first Muslim to play test cricket for Australia, left-hander Khawaja has scored 1,728 runs in his 24 tests at an average of 45.47, and is likely to be selected at number three for the upcoming Ashes series against England.

He said the hard-edged Australia teams of his childhood held little appeal.

“In hindsight, the fact we didn’t support Australia is disappointing,” he added.

”Everything that was going on in our childhood and around us built up this resentment of the Australian cricket team.

”I mean, none of them looked like us.

”I was brought up to be respectful, humble and polite. But when I watched the Aussie team, I saw men who were hard-nosed, confident, almost brutish.

“The same type of men who would sledge me about my heritage growing up.”

Khawaja credited his “strong-willed” family and his own competitive nature for his international breakthrough but said a number of aspiring players had been thwarted by racism.

“My point is this: it’s no surprise it has taken Australia cricket so long for coloured players to come through the system,” he said.

”There is no doubt racism and politics played a large role in selections in the past.

”I’ve heard a few stories from past Anglo-Saxon players where this seems to be the case. It would just be the times that they lived in. Certainly cricket and society has come a long way.

Republicans in Congress and the White House haven’t been able to get any major legislation passed yet. But they're betting they can pull it off with a bare-bones proposal for tax reform outlined last week, which they claim will help the middle class despite the evidence that it will overwhelmingly benefit the rich.

Their plan to overhaul what they call a broken tax code leaves out many key details. But one point gets hammered home: Republicans say they want to make filing taxes easier. The first principle for President Trump’s tax plan, their outline states, is to “make the tax code simple, fair and easy to understand.” There are a dozen more references to simplification throughout the rest of the document.

The Republican promise is that they want to make filing taxes as easy as mailing a postcard. But their plan doesn’t get anywhere close to that, while overlooking a straightforward reform that would. Instead of reducing complexity, the GOP plan mostly lowers and flattens rates. For example, it reduces the number of personal income tax brackets from seven to three.

However, the effort of filing taxes has nothing to do with how many brackets there are -- figuring out which bracket you fall in is the easy part. What makes doing taxes complicated is figuring out which deductions, credits, and loopholes to claim. Republicans would close some loopholes, but they would open others -- including a lower tax rate on pass-through businesses that will entice rich people with the right accounting team to get creative in order to reap the rewards. (Tycoons with family-owned businesses, such as Donald Trump, especially stand to benefit from this change, which would allow law firms, hedge funds, and real estate brokerages to file under a much lower rate.) Such loopholes make the code more complex to navigate, not less.

Simple tax filing isn’t a hopeless goal, however. There’s something Congress could do that would radically simplify the process of filing taxes for the vast majority of U.S. taxpayers.

It’s called return-free filing. In countries such as Chile, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Japan, Norway, Sweden, and Spain, the government basically prepares tax returns for its citizens. It already has most of the information it needs: Employers have to tell tax authorities how much they pay their employees, while forms like W-2s and 1099s provide other necessary details. In Japan, for example, the country’s tax agency sends everyone a document with how much they earned, how much was withheld, and how much they owe or are owed in taxes.

If Washington adopted this policy, the government would fill out a return for every resident with the information it already keeps on file. Taxpayers who wanted to itemize their returns or dispute the numbers would be free to do so, but otherwise they could simply sign off on the government’s math. In some countries, merely taking no action constitutes an approval and therefore counts as doing your taxes.

Instead, in the United States it’s up to every taxpayer to gather their forms, enter all the numbers into a long document, ensure that everything has been calculated accurately, and send it all in. It takes a collective 2.6 billion hours to get this done. Americans pay an average $200 each for the pleasure of doing their taxes, or around 10 percent of the average federal tax refund.

Return-free filing, on the other hand, could save an estimated collective 225 million hours of tax filing work and $2 billion in costs. Up to 60 million households would no longer have to file any returns.

The concept is not entirely foreign to the United States. President Ronald Reagan called for something just like it in his 1985 Tax Reform Act, arguing that Americans should “not even have to fill out a return.” Since then, Senator Elizabeth Warren has taken up the crusade, introducing legislation two years in a row that would instruct the IRS to develop a free, online return-free filing option, allowing taxpayers to download their information straight from the government and into a form. The idea is even supported by conservative anti-tax activist Grover Norquist.

But it hasn’t moved forward; last year, Warren’s bill didn’t even make it out of committee.

That’s because some deep-pocketed companies have worked tirelessly to bury it. If most Americans no longer needed help doing their taxes, business would dry up for tax preparers such as H&R Block and TurboTax. More than half of all individual tax returns filed in 2014 were prepared by a tax professional, while about 80 percent of Americans use either software or a preparer.

These companies have said as much publicly. Intuit, the software company that makes TurboTax, has said in filings that it “opposes IRS government tax preparation” and that such legislation “may present a continued competitive threat to our business in the foreseeable future.” Liberty Tax Service stated in 2015 that “demand for our products is related to the complexity of tax return preparation.”

So they’ve spent heavily to campaign against return-free filing. H&R Block, which ProPublica says spent $3 million on lobbying last year, fought hard against Warren’s bill. Intuit spent $2 million in the same year, much of it in favor of legislation that would block the government from offering return-free filing. The firm has lobbied in favor of a number of similar past bills.

Republicans have long claimed that they want to make taxes simpler, yet their proposals never live up to such promises. It’s not impossible, though; the answer is staring us right in the face. It would just require the government to put the interests of everyday taxpayers over big-spending corporate lobbyists.

“Se somos líderes no Mercosul (em vendas), temos que liderar em eletrificação”, disse o executivo. “Para liderarmos no Mercosul, vamos ter que trabalhar isso no Brasil também”, acrescentou Zarlenga, sem dar mais detalhes.

O executivo comentou que a venda de um veículo na região gera uma média de “25 mil a 30 mil dólares incluindo pós-venda, mas se você pensar nos ganhos que tecnologias como veículos autônomos poderão gerar isso sobe para 500 mil ao longo da vida útil do veículo”, disse Zarlenga.

O executivo comentou à Reuters que o mercado brasileiro deverá passar por uma “evolução muito rápida” nos próximos anos.

Ele acrescentou que a GM deve anunciar novos investimentos no Brasil em breve. A empresa já anunciou investimentos de 4,5 bilhões de reais entre este ano e 2020, dentro de um pacote de 13 bilhões de reais que vem sendo aplicado desde 2014.

“Não acabamos com anúncios de investimento e vamos ter mais um proximamente”, afirmou o executivo na apresentação durante o congresso.

Questionado pela Reuters sobre o foco da GM nos próximos investimentos, Zarlenga comentou que a montadora pretende ter lançamentos “em segmentos novos em que ainda não participamos”. Um exemplo é o utilitário esportivo Equinox, que teve vendas no país anunciadas pela montadora neste ano.

A categoria de SUVs foi uma das poucas a apresentar crescimento durante a crise do mercado nacional e tem continuado a atrair interesse, com novas entrantes no país, como a sul-coreana Ssangyong, que pretende voltar a exportar seus modelos de SUV e picapes para o Brasil a partir de 2018.

“Temos uma expectativa muito forte sobre a Equinox, segmento em que não estamos”, disse Zarlenga, que espera um crescimento do mercado brasileiro de veículos em 2018 de 7 a 16 por cento, para algo entre 2,4 milhões e 2,6 milhões de unidades.

Mais cedo, em apresentação gravada para o congresso, o presidente associação de montadoras do país (Anfavea), Antonio Megale, afirmou que a entidade prevê que as vendas de veículos no país cresçam dois dígitos no próximo ano, ante uma expansão projetada para 2017 de 7,3 por cento.","GM quer liderar mercado de veículos elétricos no Mercosul, diz executivo",https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idBRKBN1CE1UN-OBRBS

One week after suffering a staggering collision with Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico is in the throes of an agonizing humanitarian disaster.

The storm left at least 16 dead and the entire island without power; most people won’t get their lights back on anytime soon. The cascading effects have been devastating. More than half of residents remain without drinking water. Hospitals cannot function. Supermarket shelves are empty and few gas stations are open. Communication networks are crippled, and first responders are struggling to make contact with residents in remote or heavily affected areas. Credit cards are useless, and ATMs are out of service.

We know how to do better and we can do better. Nobody should die because the power went out.

We need a dedicated national effort to fortify our electrical grids so that they can get back online much more quickly after inevitable, and increasingly severe, extreme weather events. Natural disasters happen, but often the catastrophes that follow are man-made. And when it comes to the electricity system—the lynchpin upon which so much of our society relies—widespread, long-lasting power outages can quickly devolve into nightmares all their own. Just a few weeks ago, 11 senior citizens died in Florida following prolonged heat exposure due to power outages in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma. Similar catastrophes were suffered in the wakes of many other earlier storms, including Hurricanes Sandy and Katrina.

Flooding can submerge and damage equipment, as it did throughout the Northeast during Sandy; heavy winds can rip down trees and power lines, as was seen throughout Florida from Irma; and extreme heat and forest fires can wreak havoc on transmission lines. Climate change stands to escalate these threats, by contributing to higher seas, more intense storms, worsening wildfires and extended heat waves.

That’s why the focus must be on electricity grid resilience. It’s impractical and impossible to stop all outages from occurring. But it is possible to design the system such that when the power does inevitably fail, fewer people are affected from the outset and power is restored more quickly for the rest.

In Florida, policymakers directed the state’s utilities to “storm harden” their systems following the devastating 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons. One decade and several billion ratepayer dollars later, Irma gave people a chance to see their increased utility bills at work.

The result: an astounding 6.7 million customers—or nearly two out of every three in the state—were plunged into darkness. Surely evidence of a failed approach, right?

Not quite. When it comes to the cascading failures arising from widespread outages, length of the blackout is a key factor in the severity of the impact. Even though all those Floridians lost power after, the utilities were able to get over one million back online overnight, and millions more restored within a few days with help from crews from across America.

In Florida, that pivot toward improving recovery times has meant, for one, simple upgrades, like replacing thousands of wooden utility poles with concrete that can better withstand hurricane-force winds. In the aftermath of Irma, even though crashing trees and flying debris ripped down power lines, restoration times were vastly improved by a reduced need to replace fallen poles.

Other initiatives can be more technologically complex. For example, by installing sensors and grid automation throughout the system, utilities can pinpoint when and where an outage has occurred, and re-route systems to reduce the number of people without power. Similarly, flood monitoring equipment can alert a utility when critical infrastructure is at risk of inundation, allowing the equipment to be pre-emptively turned off to improve post-storm repair times.

Tackling a problem this big, however, is impossible for each utility to do alone. Complicating the push for a more resilient electricity system is the fact that proposed interventions can be expensive, and investment dollars are limited. Additionally, the federal government has offered insufficient assistance, leaving states, cities and territories to largely fend for themselves, even though investing in a more resilient system now can reduce the costs of future relief and recovery efforts.

Utilities’ limited funds mean there are trade-offs, so opportunities must be carefully weighed against one another. But the costs of prolonged outages are far-reaching and challenging to quantify, and resiliency metrics are hard to define and even harder to compare. Efforts must also align with other priorities, especially as the power sector undergoes an unparalleled transition to clean and distributed renewable resources.

The fact also remains that some services are far too critical—drinking water, first responders, communications—and some populations, such as the elderly, disabled, or low-income, to tolerate even a day without power. For these people and services, a resilient grid is not enough.

Diesel generators, which have long-served a backup role when disasters hit, are expensive, heavily polluting, and prone to failure due to infrequent use. And as the long and frustrating lines following recent storms have made clear, maintaining steady access to fuel in the aftermath of a severe storm can be challenging, if not impossible. Microgrids powered by solar and storage, on the other hand, are more reliable during times of crisis, better for health and the environment, and increasingly affordable. This is thanks to lower costs of solar and storage technologies, as well as the fact that these systems can provide onsite power, generating benefits all year, not just during extreme weather events.

So what does this mean for Puerto Rico? Reports suggest parts of the island could remain without power for months, potentially impacting millions of people. This is unacceptable.

Now, as a country, we must pool together resources for a swift response to curtail the devastating crisis at hand. But we must also ensure that as the decimated power grid is pieced back together, this catastrophe—and the far too many that preceded it—were not suffered in vain. The electricity system must be rebuilt for a climate-resilient, clean-energy supporting future, not as a replica of its brittle and underinvested past.",Commentary: How we could have prevented some of Puerto Rico’s misery,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mcnamara-electricity-commentary/commentary-how-we-could-have-prevented-some-of-puerto-ricos-misery-idUSKCN1C42ER

RAQQA, Syria (Reuters) - In the gutted four-storey building that he and five other U.S.-backed fighters have turned into a frontline fortress, Babel can peer out at Islamic State positions just 150 meters away.

The jihadist militants expected to make a last stand for this stronghold of their self-proclaimed caliphate are cornered and desperate here in Raqqa, the city on the Euphrates river that has served as their de-facto Syrian capital since 2014.

“Let Daesh come - we’re ready for them. We have explosives to drop downstairs,” said Babel, which is his nom de guerre. He and his fellow members of the U.S.-backed Syrian Defense Forces have occupied the frontline building for three weeks and are now preparing for a final showdown with Islamic State, the group also known as ISIS, ISIL or Daesh.

The SDF fighters’ position is well prepared in case the cornered IS militants attempt an attack. The front porch steps have been demolished, leaving a drop to the basement that can be crossed only by climbing a section of iron fence - a makeshift ladder, which the defenders can pull up. Inside, plastic bottles have been strewn across the floor to squeak when stepped on and alert them to intruders.

After months of intense fighting and heavy U.S. bombardment, the SDF have surrounded Islamic State militants in a small part of the city. As the Kurdish and Arab militias of the SDF close in and U.S.-led air raids increase, they expect fierce fighting to mark the final stages of the campaign.

“Daesh regularly launch small raids, even behind our position. Yesterday they attacked the building opposite and tried to push toward us. We killed a few and they retreated to the hospital,” Babel said.

SDF units have a clear view over the Raqqa hospital, one of Islamic State’s last strongholds in the city, from a line of buildings they occupy to its northwest. Apartment blocks between them and the hospital have been flattened by air strikes.

Commanders say the hospital and a nearby stadium, where the jihadists are said to be holding civilian hostages, will be where they make their last stand.

Babel’s unit are holding the front line ahead of an anticipated final push, firing at militants whenever they can spot them.

“The last few nights they’ve been shining spotlights from the hospital towards our lines, so we can’t really see,” he said.

Another fighter in the unit said sniper fire from Islamic State had recently reduced, possibly as a means of conserving ammunition for more intense fighting to come.

SURRENDER OR DIE

An SDF field commander said on Sunday assaults were to begin soon as part of a final push against Islamic State, focused initially on surrounding the stadium. The hospital is already encircled.

“Daesh is amassing, preparing to fight. This is the last stage, so they’ll resist and then surrender or die,” the commander who gave his name as Ardal Raqqa said.

U.S. coalition spokesman Ryan Dillon was more cautious about calling the current stage of the offensive a final assault.

“Whether this is the final assault or an assault, I won’t characterize it either way,” Dillon said by phone. The fight was “concentrated around the complex which was the national hospital and the stadium,” he said.

The SDF predicted ahead of a major push in June that it could take just weeks to drive Islamic State out of Raqqa. That has proven overly optimistic, with the militants holding out for months so far.

Their use of civilians for cover, tunnels to launch counter attacks, snipers and countless booby traps have slowed SDF advances.

“Many are being wounded, especially by snipers. Daesh snipers often shoot to wound, not to kill, so they can target whoever comes to save an injured comrade,” Babel said.

One shaken SDF fighter in a nearby base last week showed cuts on his face from where a sniper bullet had ricocheted.

Both the U.S. spokesman Dillon and the SDF fighter Babel said that some Islamic State fighters were surrendering.

“The other day a Saudi fighter escaped and handed himself over. The guys who surrender usually have families,” Babel said.

Interrogations of surrendering militants revealed IS had dug a tunnel between the hospital and stadium, he said.

Dillon said several IS militants and leaders had surrendered in recent weeks. “It is a growing trend,” he said.

At the front line, SDF fighters said morale was high. One fighter belted pop music to other units over his walkie talkie.

“Hopefully we’ll be done soon,” Babel said.",Fighters on Raqqa front line brace for final showdown with Islamic State,https://www.reuters.com/article/mideast-crisis-syria-raqqa/fighters-on-raqqa-front-line-brace-for-final-showdown-with-islamic-state-idINKBN1CE1MX

(Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc said on Monday it would speed up the process for in-store returns of items bought on its website, just ahead of the busy holiday season, as it looks to steal a march on e-commerce giant Amazon.com.

Wal-Mart has been increasingly using its more than 4,700 stores to provide hassle-free shopping on its website - by offering services that allow customers to pick up products ordered online as well as make returns in store.

The new service aims to drastically reduce the time taken to return an item bought online, as the company battles Amazon’s aggressive moves to establish its own brick-and-mortar presence.

Under Wal-Mart’s Mobile Express Returns, starting in early November, customers can, for the first time, use the retailer’s app to initiate a return.

The process can then be completed at “express” lanes in a store by scanning a QR code and handing over the item, eliminating the need to wait in queues.

The new process reduces the time taken for returning products at stores to as little as 30 seconds from five minutes previously, said Daniel Eckert, head of Wal-Mart’s U.S. services and digital acceleration business.

The new returns process also allows customers to get refunds as soon as the next day. Some items, including shampoo and color cosmetics, will be eligible for instant refunds even without the products being returned in store, then company said.

Wal-Mart said it planned to extend the new process to items bought in its stores by early next year, and is working on a similar returns policy for items bought from third-party sellers on Walmart.com.

Wal-Mart is investing $2 billion into its online business and has snapped up a number of popular online retailers since last year, including Jet.com.

The 70-year-old retired banker said he is unhappy with infighting and turnover in the White House. He does not like Trump’s penchant for traveling to his personal golf resorts. He wishes the president would do more to fix the healthcare system, and he worries that Trump might back down from his promise to force illegal immigrants out of the country.

“Every president makes mistakes,” Wilson said. “But if you add one on top of one, on top of another one, on top of another, there’s just a limit.”

Trump, who inspired millions of supporters last year in places like Morgan County, has been losing his grip on rural America.

According to the Reuters/Ipsos daily tracking poll, the Republican president’s popularity is eroding in small towns and rural communities where 15 percent of the country’s population lives. The poll of more than 15,000 adults in “non-metro” areas shows that they are now as likely to disapprove of Trump as they are to approve of him.

In September, 47 percent of people in non-metro areas approved of Trump while 47 percent disapproved. That is down from Trump’s first four weeks in office, when 55 percent said they approved of the president while 39 percent disapproved.

The poll found that Trump has lost support in rural areas among men, whites and people who never went to college. He lost support with rural Republicans and rural voters who supported him on Election Day.

And while Trump still gets relatively high marks in the poll for his handling of the economy and national security, rural Americans are increasingly unhappy with Trump’s record on immigration, a central part of his presidential campaign.

Forty-seven percent of rural Americans said in September they approved of the president’s handling of immigration, down from 56 percent during his first month in office.

Poll respondents who were interviewed by Reuters gave different reasons for their dissatisfaction with the president on immigration.

A few said they are tired of waiting for Trump to make good on his promise to build a wall along America’s southern border, while others said they were uncomfortable with his administration’s efforts to restrict travel into the United States.

“There should be some sort of compromise between a free flow of people over the border and something that’s more controlled,” said Drew Carlson, 19, of Warrensburg, Missouri, who took the poll.

But Trump’s “constant fixation on deportation is a little bit unsettling to me.”

The Trump administration would not comment about the Reuters/Ipsos poll.

To be sure, Trump is still much more popular in rural America than he is elsewhere.

Since he took office, “I like him less, but I support him more,” said Robert Cody, 87, a retired chemical engineer from Bartlesville, Oklahoma who took the poll.

Cody said that Trump may rankle some people with the way he talks and tweets, but it is a small price to pay for a president who will fight to strip away government regulations and strengthen the border.

DROPPING OFF THE SCREEN

When Trump called the election a ”last shot“ for the struggling coal industry and when he called for protecting the nation’s southern border with a “big, fat, beautiful wall”, he was speaking directly to rural America, said David Swenson, an economist at Iowa State University.

“Feelings of resentment and deprivation have pervaded a lot of these places,” Swenson said. “And here comes a candidate (Trump) who’s offering simplistic answers” to issues that concern them.

Rural Americans responded by supporting Trump over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton by 26 percentage points during the election, an advantage that helped tip the balance in battleground states, such as Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, where Trump won by less than 1 percentage point.

But after 10 months, many are still waiting to see concrete changes that could make life easier in rural America, said Karl Stauber, who runs a private economic development agency serving a patchwork of manufacturing communities in south central Virginia.

“Rural people are more cynical about the federal government than people in general are,” Stauber said. “They’ve heard so many promises, and they’ve not seen much done.”

Despite all the talk of bringing manufacturing jobs back, Stauber said he has not seen any companies which have relocated to his region, or anyone expand their workforce, due to new federal policies.

“It just seems like we’ve dropped off the screen,” he said.

According to the poll, Trump’s overall popularity has dropped gradually, and for different reasons, this year.

Rural Americans were increasingly unhappy with Trump’s handling of healthcare in March and April after he lobbied for a Republican plan to overhaul Obamacare and cut coverage for millions of Americans.

In May and June, they were more critical of Trump’s ability to carry out U.S. foreign policy, and they gave him lower marks for “the way he treats people like me.”

In August, they were increasingly unhappy with “the effort he’s making to unify the country” after he blamed “both sides” for the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, in which a suspected white nationalist drove his car into a crowd of anti-racist demonstrators.

The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English across the United States. It asked people to rate the president’s performance and the results were filtered for people who lived in zip codes that fell within counties designated as “non-metro” by the federal government.

The poll combined the results of “non-metro” respondents into nine, four-week periods. Each period included between 1,300 and 2,000 responses and had a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points.",Trump's popularity is slipping in rural America: poll,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-ruralamerica-poll/trumps-popularity-is-slipping-in-rural-america-poll-idUSKBN1CE162

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. smartphone chipmaker Qualcomm has offered concessions in an attempt to allay EU antitrust concerns over its $38-billion bid for NXP Semiconductors, the largest ever in the semiconductor industry.

Qualcomm, which supplies chips to Android smartphone makers and Apple, submitted its proposal on Oct. 5, a filing on the European Commission site showed on Monday, without providing details.

The EU competition enforcer, which suspended the deadline for its decision on Aug. 17 for a second time while waiting for information data from Qualcomm, said it would set a new deadline once the company has complied with its request.

CRAIOVA, Romania (Reuters) - NATO launched a new multinational force in Romania on Monday to counter Russia along its eastern flank and to check a growing Russian presence in the Black Sea following the Kremlin’s 2014 seizure of Crimea.

The force will initially be built around a Romanian brigade of up to 4,000 soldiers, supported by troops from nine other NATO countries, and complementing a separate deployment of 900 U.S. troops who are already in place. The plans are to include additional air and sea assets to give the force greater capabilities.

“Our purpose is peace, not war,” Romanian President Klaus Iohannis told the NATO Parliamentary Assembly of alliance lawmakers, which is meeting this year in Bucharest.

“We are not a threat for Russia. But we need dialogue from a strong position of defense and discouragement,” he said, before flying to the Craiova military base in south-eastern Romania.

At the base, as military bands played, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg stood alongside Iohannis, addressed some of the troops in green face paint and inspected vehicles and weapons.

“We are sending a very clear message: NATO is here, NATO is strong and NATO is united,” Stoltenberg told assembled Polish, Romanian, Spanish and Portuguese soldiers.

Russia accuses NATO of trying to encircle it and threatening stability in Eastern Europe, which NATO denies. Around the Black Sea, Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey are NATO members while Georgia and Ukraine aspire to join.

The NATO force aims to develop its presence in the Black Sea region, rich in oil and gas, without escalating tensions as it seeks to counter Russia’s own plans to create what military analysts say is a “buffer zone”.

The 2008 Russian operation to put troops in Georgia’s South Ossetia region, its support for separatists in eastern Ukraine since 2014 and its annexation of Crimea have raised the stakes, with all sides warning of a new, Cold-War style scenario.

Apart from Romania, Poland is the biggest troop contributor. Bulgaria, Italy and Portugal will train regularly with the force in Craiova, and Germany is also expected to contribute.

In additional to existing NATO Black Sea naval patrols, a maritime presence will include more allied visits to Romanian and Bulgarian ports, training and exercises.

‘WEST BERLIN’ MODEL

Some Eastern Europeans want NATO’s new ballistic missile defense shield, which includes a site in Romania, to be part of NATO’s eastern posture vis-a-vis Russia.

Slideshow (6 Images)

“The Aegis Ashore system would add another level of deterrence,” said Maciej Kowalski, an analyst at the Polish Casimir Pulaski Foundation, referring to the U.S.-built system.

NATO says the system is to intercept any Iranian rockets.

As in the Baltics and Poland, where the U.S.-led alliance has some 4,000 troops, NATO says the relatively light multinational model recalls allied support for West Berlin in the 1950s, when the presence of British, French and U.S. forces ensured the Soviet Union could not control all of Berlin.

Under NATO’s founding treaty, an attack on one ally is an attack on all, meaning all 28 NATO nations would be required to respond in the case of any potential Russian aggression.

While months in planning, the establishment of the force comes as Russia winds down its biggest war games since 2013. The Zapad, or West, games showed off Moscow’s latest weaponry and its ability to quickly mass forces on NATO’s borders.

The enhanced NATO presence in Romania and Bulgaria marks a diplomatic success for Bucharest, which gained greater persuasive power because it is set to reach a NATO goal of spending 2 percent of economic output on defense this year, a priority for U.S. President Donald Trump.

Romania pushed for bigger NATO naval presence on the Black Sea for more than a year, but found its neighbor Bulgaria wary of provoking Russia.

Donald Trump mentioned Afghanistan just once in his speech to the United Nations Tuesday. His “new strategy for victory” there, he said, would help “crush the loser terrorists and stop the reemergence of safe havens they use to launch attacks on all of our people.”

Trump outlined that new strategy on August 21, in an address that was a curious mixture of the vague and the specific. Speaking at Fort Myer, the U.S. president announced plans to deploy additional American troops, but did not give details about numbers, policy specifics or an exit strategy. He mentioned Pakistan 12 times – criticizing it for “housing the very terrorists that we are fighting” – but did not make a single mention of the two other countries ramping up resistance to the U.S. presence in the region: Russia and Iran.

That was a serious omission on Trump’s part. No U.S. plan for Afghanistan can accomplish even its most minimal objective of destroying militant groups like al Qaeda or the Taliban unless it factors in the mounting evidence that Tehran and Moscow are playing a more aggressive role in resisting the American presence in the region.

Sharif Yaftali, chief of general staff of the Afghan national army, told the BBC in an exclusive interview on September 6 that Kabul has evidence showing that Iran had provided the Taliban with weapons and equipment in western Afghanistan. While Yaftali acknowledged that Afghan security forces have not yet found any evidence of Russian support for the Taliban, others believe Tehran is consolidating its South Asian partnership with Russia by serving as a mediator between Moscow and Afghan insurgents.

“The regional politics have changed,” Mohammed Arif Shah Jehan, an Afghan senior intelligence official recently appointed the governor of Farah province adjacent to Iran told The New York Times in August. “The strongest Taliban here are Iranian Taliban.”

Iran also helps Russia provide various types of weaponry to the Taliban, Hayatullah Hayat, the provincial governor of Helmand province, told the Washington Post. The arms deliveries include rocket-propelled grenades, landmines, sniper rifles and 82mm mortar rounds.

In a similar vein, construction of the largely India-funded Chabahar port in Iran’s southeastern Sistan and Baluchistan province is arguably pursued with a view to the Afghan war and the strategic rivalries unfolding there. A counterweight to Pakistan’s Chinese-backed Gwadar port only 62 miles away, Chabahar will enhance Delhi's foothold in landlocked Afghanistan by offering it convenient access through the Gulf of Oman, thereby enabling India to bypass rival Pakistan. This can in turn boost Iran’s military mobility and political influence over events in the conflict-ridden nation.

Perhaps the most telling sign of Tehran-Taliban collaboration dates back to May 2016, when a U.S. drone targeted a lone vehicle on a desert route in the southwest Pakistani province of Baluchistan, killing the driver and his only passenger. The passenger’s passport listed his name as Wali Mohammad; U.S. and Afghan officials said he was really Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansour.

Intriguingly, the mystery passenger was returning from Iran; the passport indicated that it was at least his second trip to the neighboring Islamic Republic that year.

The catalyst for Shiite Iran’s unlikely yet growing relationship with the Sunni Taliban has been the rise of the more militant, rabidly anti-Shiite Islamic State in parts of Afghanistan. For Iran, the Taliban is the lesser evil with the potential to serve as a local bulwark against the spread of the most aggressive anti-Iranian forces to its east.

Trump needs to recognize the profound regional shift in interests and alliances since the U.S. invaded Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington. Back in 2001, Tehran helped the U.S.-led coalition topple the Taliban, which it blamed for the killing of Iranian diplomats during the storming of Iran’s consulate in Mazar-i-Sharif three years earlier. The intelligence and military assistance offered by Iran and its Afghan allies in the Northern Alliance – a military front that also enjoyed the backing of Russia and India at the time – was indispensable to the U.S. mission.

Sixteen years on, Trump’s anti-Iran sentiments make a similar collaboration unlikely. However, Washington does have to recognize that it cannot ignore Iran’s national security concerns in its immediate neighborhood or Russia’s strategic interests in Central and South Asia. Trump doesn’t have to become Moscow or Tehran’s best friend, but he should be considering measures like offering to de-list Iran as a “state sponsor of terrorism” and easing sanctions against Tehran and Moscow in return for their withdrawing support from anti-American forces in Afghanistan. Those measures aren’t going to end Afghanistan’s internal conflict, but they might de-escalate it enough for Trump to work on a new exit strategy for U.S. troops.",Commentary: The real deal Trump has to make on Afghanistan,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-behravesh-afghanistan-commentary/commentary-the-real-deal-trump-has-to-make-on-afghanistan-idUSKCN1BV28K

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) will remain an industry leader, with growth driven by the Internet of Things (IoT), automotive, high-performance computing (HPC) and mobile, its chairman Morris Chang said in an interview.

Chang, 86 and dubbed the father of Taiwan’s semiconductor industry as he built up the Apple Inc supplier into the world’s biggest foundry chipmaker, said he expects driverless taxis in 10-20 years and sees artificial intelligence (AI) replacing many doctors.

“We’re going to be right there, hopefully ahead of anybody. But at least we’re going to be there with other people to the upper limits of technology,” Chang told Reuters at the company’s headquarters in Taipei.

Chang expects TSMC, which has a market value of about $185 billion, to increase its capital spending by 5-10 percent over the next five years, and to continue to invest in research and development where it employs about 6,000 workers. He also expects further consolidation in the chip industry.

His remarks come just days after he said he would retire next June. He will be succeeded as chairman by Mark Liu, with C.C. Wei appointed as chief executive. The two have worked together as co-CEOs since 2013.

Puffing on a pipe, Chang said he would offer his successors advice until he steps down, and a key message would be the importance of sealing partnerships.

“We need to establish partnerships in IoT, automotive, high-performance computing,” he said, adding that mobile still has bright prospects for the next few years. “Those are the four growth platforms we have identified.”

Chang’s remarks come as TSMC, which has thrived on booming demand for chips used in smartphones, seeks to diversify its customer base and move into emerging sectors such as AI.

It must also deal with a growing threat from Samsung Electronics, the world’s top memory chipmaker, which plans to triple the market share of its contract chipmaking business within five years by aggressively adding clients.

To fend off competitors, TSMC needed to compete on every front, Chang said, adding that chip subsidies in China were a challenge for the semiconductor industry.

“We still sell in China, but the fact is that China is subsidizing a lot of companies ... so the result is that companies in China can continue to lose money for a long time and yet still survive,” he said.

While TSMC was still looking to identify the best potential partners, Chang highlighted its current partner Nvidia as a rising star in AI.

Chang founded TSMC in 1987 with paid-in capital of T$1.4 billion ($45 million), and pioneered contract chip manufacturing for chip design firms which don’t have their own factories.

Among his achievements, Chang said he was most proud of building TSMC into its present position, and also noted his time at Texas Instruments where he helped build the semiconductor business.

Chang spent 25 years at Texas Instruments and holds a doctorate from Stanford. Born in China, he went to Taiwan in 1985 after being recruited by the government to head a body promoting industrial and technological development.

He says he is bowing out after 30 years of service to TSMC to spend more time with his family, but he’ll keep a close eye on the company.

“After I leave, I’ll be looking at the balance sheet, the P&L, and I’ll be listening to the analyst calls,” he said. “I don’t think I’ll be asking questions, I’ll just be a very interested investor.”

Chang owns 0.48 percent of TSMC shares, according to the company’s website, worth around $926 million.","Retiring TSMC founder predicts fewer doctors, no taxi drivers",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tsmc-chang/retiring-tsmc-founder-predicts-fewer-doctors-no-taxi-drivers-idUSKBN1CB22B

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) said on Friday its general counsel, Bruce Sewell, will retire and be succeeded by former Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) executive Katherine Adams, who will take over Apple’s multinational legal battle against Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O).

Adams, who will also be senior vice president of legal and global security, will report to Chief Executive Tim Cook, the company said.

Before joining Honeywell in 2003, Adams was an attorney with Sidley Austin LLP in New York. Earlier, she had served as a clerk for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor and for Stephen Breyer, who was then an appeals court judge but later was appointed to the Supreme Court.

Sewell, who has been Apple’s general counsel since 2009, will retire at the end of the year, the company said. Sewell, who came to Apple from Intel Corp (INTC.O), guided Apple through its massive patent infringement lawsuit against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) over design patents for the original iPhone, a case that is still simmering nearly six years after it was filed and eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court. A U.S. appeals court is currently working to decide the final amount of damages Samsung owes Apple.

In taking the legal reins at Apple, Adams will take over a wide-ranging dispute with Qualcomm over how that chipmaker licenses its technology to Apple. At the heart of the dispute is Qualcomm’s long-held practice of charging a percentage of the total price of iPhones and other Apple devices as a licensing fee for its mobile connectivity patent portfolio.

Apple has sued Qualcomm over that practice in U.S. civil courts as well as 11 foreign jurisdictions. Qualcomm has brought an action against Apple before the U.S. International Trade Commission seeking to ban imports of some iPhones. Qualcomm filed a separate civil lawsuit accusing Apple of infringing the patents at issue in that action.

Qualcomm also faces an antitrust complaint from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In addition, four of Apple’s contract manufacturers have sued Qualcomm on antitrust allegations, and Apple has joined that lawsuit.",Apple names former Honeywell executive as new general counsel,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-moves/apple-names-former-honeywell-executive-as-new-general-counsel-idUSKBN1CB211

PARIS (Reuters) - Apple (AAPL.O) boss Tim Cook went out of his way on Monday to single out a small French firm behind innovative features in the latest iPhones ahead of meeting with President Emmanuel Macron, who has called for a tougher line on technology company taxes.

The Apple chief executive paid a surprise visit to Eldim, a Normandy-based firm that develops optical technology used in the facial recognition system inside new top-of-the-line iPhone X smartphones due out next month. Prices start at $999.

Face ID, as the iPhone X feature is known, will replace the fingerprint sensor for unlocking the phone and features in Apple’s campaign to distinguish the phone from rival devices.

“Bravo for your work!”, Cook said on his official Twitter account in French. A picture of him chatting with Eldim employees was also posted. He also hailed the contributions of French start-ups on Twitter while on his way to a scheduled meeting with Macron on Monday afternoon.

The meeting between the French president and Apple CEO follows calls by Macron last week for Apple and other tech companies such as Amazon.com to pay more in taxes in Europe.

“Bravo to Europe for acting with determination to get tax rules and justice respected,” Macron said in a tweet last week praising European Union officials for taking member-state Ireland to court to reclaim 13 billion euros ($15.26 billion) in back taxes from Apple.

Eldim, located outside Caen, near the northern coast of France, had quietly worked with Apple on research projects for nearly a decade before gaining recognition for its optical work on behalf of Apple, the world’s most highly valued company.

“They (Eldim) certainly have a top-notch technology,” said industry analyst Thomas Husson of Forrester Research. “Facial recognition is one of iPhone X’s differentiating features.”

Apple is normally highly secretive about the suppliers it uses to develop new phones, computers and other devices.

A spokeswoman for Apple declined to comment.

Berlin (Reuters) - Deutschland dringt unmittelbar vor der Jahrestagung von Weltbank und Internationalem Währungsfonds (IWF) auf ein Ende der weltweit lockeren Geld- und Finanzpolitik.

“Wir brauchen jetzt einen Ausstieg aus dem Außergewöhnlichen”, schrieb der Chef-Volkswirt des Bundesfinanzministeriums, Ludger Schuknecht, am Montag in einer Veröffentlichung seines Hauses. Das IWF-Jahrestreffen, das am Dienstag in Washington beginnt, wäre ein exzellenter Zeitpunkt, um ein Signal in diese Richtung auszusenden. Für diese Position, die mit einem Appell zu mehr Schulden verbunden ist, sprächen auch die verbesserten Wachstumsaussichten in der Welt. Wie aus deutschen Regierungskreisen verlautet, wird der IWF seine Wachstumsprognosen für 2017 und 2018 anheben.

Der IWF erwartet bislang für das laufende Jahr ein globales Wachstum von 3,5 Prozent und für 2018 von 3,6 Prozent. Für Deutschland rechnet der Fonds mit 1,8 Prozent Wachstum in diesem und 1,6 Prozent im nächsten Jahr. Am Dienstag will der IWF neue Prognose vorlegen. IWF-Chefin Christine Lagarde hat bereits eine leichte Revision der bisherigen Zahlen nach oben signalisiert.

Schuknecht, der auch G20-Chefvorbereiter im Bundesfinanzministeriums ist, wünscht sich ein “starkes Bekenntnis” auf internationaler Ebene, die Politik übermäßiger Schulden und von lockeren Ausgaben und Geld zu beenden. Er sieht sich von Warnungen des IWF bestätigt, in denen von wachsenden Risiken einer lockeren Politik für die Finanzstabilität die Rede ist. Es komme jetzt darauf an, für mehr Nachhaltigkeit beim Wachstum zu sorgen, sich besser gegen etwaige externe Schocks zu wappnen und übergroße Verwundbarkeiten zu vermeiden, schrieb er. Nach vielen Jahren der Nachfragestärkung rund um den Globus müsse nun die Grundlage für Wachstum gefestigt werden.

Mit Blick auf das G20-Finanzministertreffen wertete ein hoher deutscher Regierungsvertreter die deutsche G20-Präsidentschaft als Erfolg. Der Internationale Währungsfonds (IWF) habe vieles von dem aufgegriffen, was Deutschland als Schwerpunkte gesetzt habe, argumentierte er. Dazu zähle etwa die Haltung zur Notwendigkeit einer Haushaltskonsolidierung in vielen Ländern und zu Strukturreformen. Am Rande treffen sich traditionell die Finanzminister der G20-Länder.

O bancário aposentado, de 70 anos, disse estar descontente com as disputas internas e as mudanças de funcionários na Casa Branca. Ele também desaprova as várias viagens de Trump a seus clubes de golfe particulares, gostaria que o presidente fizesse mais para melhorar o sistema de saúde e teme que ele recue em sua promessa de expulsar imigrantes ilegais do país.

“Todo presidente comete erros”, disse Wilson. “Mas se você soma um a outro, e a outro, e a outro, existe um limite”.

Trump, que conquistou milhões de eleitores em locais como o condado de Morgan em 2016, vem perdendo apoio na chamada América rural.

De acordo com uma pesquisa Reuters/Ipsos, a popularidade do presidente republicano está caindo em cidades pequenas e comunidades rurais, que concentram 15 por cento da população do país. A sondagem com mais de 15 mil adultos em áreas “não metropolitanas” revelou que estes estão igualmente inclinados a aprovar e desaprovar Trump.

Em setembro, 47 por cento dos habitantes de áreas não metropolitanas aprovavam Trump, e outros 47 por cento desaprovavam -- uma queda na aprovação em relação às quatro primeiras semanas de Trump no cargo, quando 55 por cento diziam aprová-lo e 39 por cento o desaprovavam.

A pesquisa apontou que Trump perdeu apoio em áreas rurais entre homens, brancos e pessoas sem ensino universitário, além de republicanos do interior e eleitores rurais que o escolheram no dia da eleição.

Embora Trump ainda mostre números relativamente altos no levantamento quanto à condução da economia e da segurança nacional, os norte-americanos do interior estão cada vez mais insatisfeitos com seu desempenho na imigração, uma parte central de sua campanha presidencial.

Em setembro 47 por cento dos cidadãos rurais disseram aprovar a forma como Trump está lidando com a imigração, uma queda em reação aos 56 por cento de seu primeiro mês no poder.

Os entrevistados pela Reuters apontaram razões diferentes para sua insatisfação com o presidente neste quesito. Alguns disseram estar cansados de esperar que Trump cumpra sua promessa de construir um muro na fronteira sul com o México, e outros afirmaram que estão incomodados com os esforços de seu governo para restringir as viagens aos EUA.

O governo Trump não quis comentar a pesquisa Reuters/Ipsos.

Mas é certo que Trump ainda é muito mais popular nas áreas rurais do que em quaisquer outras.

Desde que tomou posse, “eu gosto dele menos, mas o apoio mais”, disse Robert Cody, engenheiro químico de 87 anos de Bartlesville, no Oklahoma, argumentando que Trump pode irritar algumas pessoas pela maneira como fala, mas que este é um preço pequeno a se pagar para um presidente que lutará para acabar com as regulamentações do governo e fortalecer a fronteira.","Popularidade de Trump registra queda no interior dos EUA, aponta pesquisa",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idBRKBN1CE1KC-OBRTP

SUZUKA, Japan (Reuters) - The question of whether Lewis Hamilton will win his fourth Formula One world championship this year now looks more a matter of when and where after his Japanese Grand Prix triumph on Sunday.

Fifty nine points clear of Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel with four races remaining, the Mercedes driver can wrap things up at the next race in Austin, Texas, in two weeks if everything goes to plan.

Anything can happen in Formula One, but it will take a monumental collapse for the 32-year-old Briton to be overhauled by a rival whose challenge has imploded.

Vettel knows the score, even if he has not given up hope entirely.

“I don’t need to be a genius or a mathematician,” he said when asked about his chances.

And yet Hamilton and Mercedes, a whopping 145 points clear of Ferrari in their constructors’ battle, will still cling to their mantra of one race at a time and no chickens counted until they hatch.

“There’s no change in approach,” Mercedes boss Toto Wolff said on Sunday.

”We’ve benefited from Ferrari’s misfortune and reliability woes in the last three races, but it doesn’t mean that we are clapping ourselves on the back. On the contrary, I think we need to continue to push.

“You can see how quickly it goes with Sebastian.”

Vettel had lined up in Suzuka on the front row alongside Hamilton but a humble spark plug, one of the cheapest components on a car packed with hi-tech wizardry, stopped his challenge after four laps.

Engine failure in qualifying in Malaysia and a first-corner collision in Singapore put paid to any hopes of victory in those races.

If Hamilton wins in Austin and the German fails to finish higher than sixth, it is game over. Mexico follows a week later and then Brazil with the chances of a decider in Abu Dhabi looking minimal.

Sunday’s twist took the sting out of what was, until the August break, a close fight between four-times champion Vettel and triple titleholder Hamilton.

And then Formula One went on holiday and everything changed.

In the five races since the break, Hamilton has won four times and taken 118 points compared to a mere 45 for Vettel. The German had led his rival by 14 points after Hungary at the end of July.

In the last four races alone, Vettel has given away 66 points to Hamilton.

The Briton, who has finished his last 21 races in the points, said he could only have dreamed of holding such an advantage and credited his team for their efforts.

“They’ve done a phenomenal job, reliability has really been on point,” he said.",Motor racing: Hamilton's fourth title more a question of when and where,https://www.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idCAKBN1CE19D-OCASP

LONDON (Reuters) - Iran promised on Monday to give a “crushing” response if the United States designated its elite Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist group.

The pledge came a week before President Donald Trump announces a final decision on how he wants to contain the Islamic Republic.

He is expected on Oct. 15 to “decertify” a landmark 2015 international deal to curb Iran’s nuclear program, a step that by itself stops short of pulling out of the agreement but gives Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions.

Trump is also expected to designate Iran’s most powerful security force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corp (IRGC) as a terrorist organization, as he rolls out a broader, more hawkish U.S. strategy on Iran.

“We are hopeful that the United States does not make this strategic mistake,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi was quoted as saying by the state news agency IRNA.

“If they do, Iran’s reaction would be firm, decisive and crushing and the United States should bear all its consequences,” he told a news conference reported by IRNA.

Individuals and entities associated with the IRGC are already on the U.S. list of foreign terrorist organizations, but the organization as a whole is not.

IRGC commander Mohammad Ali Jafari said on Sunday, “If the news is correct about the stupidity of the American government in considering the Revolutionary Guards a terrorist group, then the Revolutionary Guards will consider the American army to be like Islamic State all around the world.”

Jafari also said that additional sanctions would end chances for future dialogue with the United States and that the Americans would have to move their regional bases outside the 2,000 km (1,250 mile) range of IRGC’s missiles.

WARY EUROPE

U.S. sanctions on the IRGC could affect conflicts in Iraq and Syria, where Tehran and Washington both support warring parties that oppose the Islamic State militant group (IS).

France said on Monday it was worried that classifying the IRGC as a terrorist group could exacerbate tensions in the region.

Germany said it was worried Trump would decide Iran is not respecting the nuclear deal, negotiated under his predecessor Barack Obama, and fears such a step will worsen insecurity in the Middle East.

A U.S. pullout could unravel an accord seen by supporters as vital to preventing a Middle East arms race and tamping down regional tensions, since it limits Iran’s ability to enrich uranium for nuclear fuel in exchange for the lifting of sanctions that damaged its oil-based economy.

The U.N. nuclear watchdog’s inspectors have repeatedly declared Iran in compliance with the terms of the nuclear deal.

Trump called Iran “a corrupt dictatorship” during his first speech to the U.N. General Assembly and said the nuclear deal was “the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into”.

The other five world powers in the deal were Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China.

The prospect of the United States reneging on the agreement has worried other partners that helped negotiate it.

The Kremlin said that any U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal would have “negative consequences.”

British Prime Minister Theresa May, who supports the nuclear pact, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who opposes it, agreed in a phone call on Monday that they need to be “clear-eyed” about the threat Iran poses to the Middle East.

“They agreed that ... the international community should continue working together to push back against Iran’s destabilizing regional activity,” May’s spokesman said.

“MALIGN ACTIVITIES”

Despite the nuclear deal, Washington still maintains its own more limited sanctions on Iran over its ballistic missile program and over accusations Tehran supports terrorism.

Iran says it is developing missiles solely for defensive purposes and denies involvement in terrorism.

The Trump administration aims to put more pressure on the IRGC, especially over recent missile tests and what Washington has called its “malign activities” across the Middle East.

The U.S. government imposed sanctions in July on 18 entities and people for supporting the IRGC in developing drones and military equipment. In August, Congress overwhelmingly approved the “Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act” which imposed new sanctions on Iran for its ballistic missile program, as well as sanctions on Russia and North Korea.

In an interview aired on Saturday night, Trump accused Iran of “funding North Korea” and “doing things with North Korea that are totally inappropriate”.

Qasemi, Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman, said the U.S. accusations were “baseless”. He added, “Israel and some specific countries are raising these accusations to create Iranophobia.”",Iran promises 'crushing' response if U.S. designates Guards a terrorist group,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-iran-usa-irgc/iran-promises-crushing-response-if-u-s-designates-guards-a-terrorist-group-idUKKBN1CE0M8?il=0

COX‘S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Thousands of Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar fled to Bangladesh on Monday in a new surge of refugees driven by fears of starvation and violence the United Nations has denounced as ethnic cleansing.

About 519,000 Rohingya have crossed the border since Aug. 25, when attacks by Rohingya militants on security posts in Rakhine state sparked a ferocious military response.

The European Union (EU) is proposing shunning contact with Myanmar’s top generals as a first step toward new targeted sanctions to punish the military for the violence, according to a draft document seen by Reuters.

Reuters reporters on the Bangladeshi side of the border, in Palong Khali district, saw several thousand people crossing from northern Rakhine on Monday, filing along embankments between flooded fields and scrubby forest.

“Half of my village was burnt down. I saw them do it,” said Sayed Azin, 46, who said he had walked for eight days carrying his 80-year-old mother in a basket strung on a bamboo pole between him and his son.

Soldiers and Buddhist mobs had torched his village, he said.

“I left everything,” he said, sobbing. “I can’t find my relatives ... I can’t take this any more.”

Some new arrivals spoke of bloody attacks by Buddhist mobs on people trekking toward the border.

Refugees and rights groups say the army and Buddhist vigilantes have engaged in a campaign of killing and arson aimed at driving the Rohingya out of Myanmar.

Myanmar rejects accusations of ethnic cleansing and has labeled the militants from the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army who launched the initial attacks as terrorists who have killed civilians and burnt villages.

Among those fleeing were up to 35 people on a boat that capsized off the Bangladesh coast on Sunday. At least 12 of them drowned while 13 were rescued, Bangladeshi police said.

“We faced so many difficulties, for food and survival,” Sayed Hossein, 30, told Reuters, adding that his wife, three children, mother and father in law had drowned.

“We came here to save our lives.”

“GETTING WORSE”

Myanmar leader and Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi has faced scathing international criticism for not doing more to stop the violence, although she has no power over the security forces under a military-drafted constitution.

The United States and EU have been considering targeted sanctions against Myanmar military leaders, diplomats and officials have told Reuters, though they are wary of action that could destabilize the country’s transition to democracy.

EU foreign ministers will discuss the situation in Myanmar on Oct. 16, and their draft joint statement said the bloc “will suspend invitations to the commander-in-chief of the Myanmar/Burma armed forces and other senior military officers”.

Such a move would be largely symbolic, but could be followed by further action.

The Myanmar government has said its “clearance operations” against the militants ended in early September and people had no reason to flee. But in recent days the government has reported large numbers of Muslims preparing to leave, with more than 17,000 people in one area alone.

The government cited worries about food and security as their reasons.

Some villagers in Rakhine said food was running out because rice in the fields was not ready for harvest and the state government had closed village markets and restricted the transport of food, apparently to cut supplies to the militants.

“The situation’s getting worse. We have no food and no guarantee of security,” said a Rohingya resident of Hsin Hnin Pyar village on the south of the state’s Buthidaung district.

He said a lot of people were preparing to flee.

“While the Myanmar military has engaged in a campaign of violence, there is mounting evidence that Rohingya women, men and children are now also fleeing the very real threat of starvation,” rights group Amnesty International said.

Senior state government official Kyaw Swar Tun declined to go into details when asked about the food, except to ask: “Have you heard of anyone dying of hunger in Buthidaung?”

The reports of food shortages will add to the urgency of calls by aid agencies and the international community for unfettered humanitarian access to the conflict zone.

COMING, GOING

The insurgents declared a one-month ceasefire from Sept. 10 to enable the delivery of aid but the government rebuffed them, saying it did not negotiate with terrorists.

The ceasefire is due to end at midnight on Monday, but the insurgents said in a statement they were ready to respond to any peace move by the government.

The ability of the group to mount any sort of challenge to the army is unclear, but it does not appear to have been able to put up resistance to the latest military offensive.

Bangladesh was already home to 400,000 Rohingya who had fled earlier bouts of violence.

Mostly Buddhist Myanmar does not recognize the Rohingya as citizens, even though many have lived there for generations.

But even as refugees arrive, Bangladesh insists they will all have to go home. Myanmar has responded by saying it will take back those who can be verified as genuine refugees.

Many Rohingya fear they will not be able to prove their right to return.

U.S. stocks have been on a tear this year, hitting new records almost everyday in the past week, and the upcoming earnings reports will help justify the lofty valuations.

“The relatively high valuation, where the market is trading 17 to 18 times earnings, is merited by a very low interest rate environment,” said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.

“We are not danger yet if you keep your eye on rates.”

Overall, earnings at S&P 500 companies are expected to have increased 4.9 percent last quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data, down from the double-digit growth recorded in the first two quarters of this year.

Ten S&P 500 companies are expected to report earnings this week, including some of the biggest Wall Street banks. JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) and Citigroup (C.N) will report on Thursday.

At 11:00 a.m. ET (1500 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was up 5.13 points, or 0.02 percent, at 22,778.8, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was up 0.08 points, flat on a percentage basis, at 6,590.26. Both indexes hit record intraday highs.

The S&P 500 .SPX was down 1.76 points, or 0.07 percent, at 2,547.57, which is just 5 points shy of its record high. The benchmark's eight-day winning streak came to a halt on Friday due to weak jobs numbers.

Eight of the 11 major S&P indexes were higher, led by a 0.31 percent gain in the technology sector .SPLRCT. The healthcare index .SPXHC was down 0.56 percent.

GE shares (GE.N) sank 3 percent and was the top drag on the S&P after the conglomerate named a new CFO said it gave activist investment firm Trian Fund Management a board seat.

Medtronic (MDT.N) dropped about 4 percent after the medical device maker said Hurricane Maria hurt second-quarter earnings and sales.

DaVita (DVA.N) tumbled 7 percent, the most on the S&P, after JPMorgan cut its rating on the dialysis service provider, while Express Scripts (ESRX.O) fell 4.5 percent on a Raymond James downgrade.

Tesla (TSLA.O) fell 2.51 percent after pushing back the unveiling of the big rig truck to mid-November.

Viacom (VIAB.O) slipped more than 4 percent after Citigroup downgraded the stock to “sell”, citing risks that pay TV firms would stop carrying its channels.

Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,453 to 1,262. On the Nasdaq, 1,481 issues fell and 1,177 advanced.","Wall Street little changed, with earnings in sight",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks/wall-street-little-changed-with-earnings-in-sight-idUSKBN1CE19E?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

The bombing was claimed by Islamic State and is the latest sectarian attack in the restive province.

The attack took place in Quetta, where nearly half a million Hazaras have settled since fleeing Afghanistan to escape the

violence in their homeland during the past four decades.

The attackers opened fire from a motorcycle killing the five men who were travelling in the back of a pick-up truck, on their way to sell vegetables at a market, the official said.

“It was a sectarian target killing. Five Hazara men died on the spot,” senior police officer Malik Nisar told Reuters, adding that the attackers escaped after opening fire.

No group has claimed responsibility for the attack.

Hazaras are frequently targeted by Taliban and Islamic State militants, and other Sunni Muslim militant groups in both Pakistan and Afghanistan.

More than 20 Hazaras have been killed in similar shootings in Baluchistan in the past two years, police say.

In 2013, three separate bombings killed over 200 people in Hazara neighbourhoods, raising international awareness of the plight of the community.

The ongoing violence in Pakistan’s Baluchistan province has fuelled concern about security for projects in the $57-billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor, a transport and energy link planned to run from western China to Pakistan’s southern deep-water port of Gwadar.

A suicide bombing at a Sufi shrine in the Baluch town of Jhal Magsi on Thursday killed 22 people and wounded more than 30 others.

The bombing was claimed by Islamic State and is the latest sectarian attack in the restive province.

Taliban and other Sunni Islamist militants are active in the province, while ethnic Baluch separatists have run a low level insurgency for decades, mounting attacks on security forces and other targets linked to the central government.

Elsewhere in Pakistan on Monday, an official said gunmen killed three soldiers and wounded eight in an attack on their vehicle in the semi-autonomous tribal region of North Waziristan.

North Waziristan was a Taliban stronghold until 2014, when Pakistan’s military launched a major offensive against the group and pushed many of its fighters across the border into Afghanistan.

Trump did not make clear to what he was referring, but his comments seemed to be a further suggestion that military action was on his mind.

The president has previously said the United States would “totally destroy” North Korea if necessary to protect itself and its allies from Pyongyang’s nuclear threats.

Earlier this week, during a meeting with top U.S. military leaders and their spouses, Trump told reporters it was the “calm before the storm.” Asked for clarification then on what he meant, Trump said: “You’ll find out.”

Speaking to reporters on Saturday ahead of a trip to North Carolina, Trump said he had nothing more to clarify.

The Pentagon referred a question for clarification to the White House and said the Defense Department’s job was to “present the president military options and carry out orders.”

Trump repeatedly has made clear his distaste for dialogue with North Korea. On Sunday he dismissed the idea of talks as a waste of time, a day after Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Washington was maintaining open lines of communication with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s government.

Trump said on Saturday that he had a good relationship with his secretary of state despite some disagreements.

”We have a very good relationship. We disagree on a couple of things. Sometimes I’d like him to be a little bit tougher, but other than that we have a very good relationship,” he said.

A Russian lawmaker on Friday was quoted saying North Korea was preparing to test a long-range missile that it believes can reach the west coast of the United States. Anton Morozov, a member of the Russian lower house of parliament’s international affairs committee, was part of a Russian delegation that visited Pyongyang from Oct. 2-6, according to Russian RIA news agency.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Scientists have answered one of nature’s most pungent questions: what gives the world’s smelliest fruit its distinctive aroma.

Scientists in Singapore said on Monday they have mapped the genome of the durian, known throughout Southeast Asia as the “king of fruits” for its unique smell, flavor and formidable spiny appearance.

They identified a group of genes responsible for odor compounds called volatile sulfur compounds, and found that these genes become highly activated as the fruit ripens, driving its unusual smell.

“The durian smell has been described as a mix of an onion-like sulfury aroma with notes of sweet fruitiness and savory soup-seasoning. A key component of the durian smell are volatile sulfur compounds, or VSCs, which have been characterized as decaying, onion-like, rotten eggs, sulfury and fried shallots,” said geneticist Bin Tean Teh, deputy director of the National Cancer Center Singapore, co-leader of the study published in the journal Nature Genetics.

Unlike other plant species that typically have one or two copies of these genes, this species boasted four copies, demonstrating that VSC production is, as Teh put it, “turbocharged” in durian fruits.

The researchers said this odor may be important to the durian in the wild, helping to attract animals to eat it and disperse its seeds.

The scientists sequenced the genome of the Musang King variety of durian, discovering it has about 46,000 genes, nearly double the number in the human genome.

They were able to trace the evolution of the fruit back 65 million years, finding an ancient relationship to the cacao tree, whose seeds produce chocolate.

“Most of us in Singapore have grown up with the durian, and we are very familiar with it,” said geneticist Patrick Tan, a professor at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore. “However, even within the same family, there are individuals that love the taste, while others have learned to simply tolerate it, especially during durian season. For those who have never experienced durian before, it can indeed elicit opposing emotions of devotion and revulsion.”

Durian is eaten fresh, cooked, fermented or as an ingredient in candies, baked goods and other food.

The researchers said there are at least 30 other durian species, some edible, some inedible, and some with other distinctive features. Several are endangered.

Durian is economically important, with imports to China last year worth $600 million to $800 million, the researchers said.",What’s that smell?

The Madrid government, grappling with Spain’s biggest political crisis since an attempted military coup in 1981, made it clear on Monday it would respond immediately to any such unilateral declaration.

A week on from a referendum on independence which the government did its utmost to thwart, more signs were emerging that the fraught situation was also taking its toll on the business climate of Spain’s wealthiest region.

Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont is due to address the regional parliament on Tuesday afternoon and the Madrid government is worried it will vote for a unilateral declaration of independence.

Catalan officials say people voted overwhelmingly for secession in the ballot, which was declared illegal by the government and was marked by police violence against independence supporters.

But the issue has deeply divided the northeastern region itself as well the Spanish nation. Hundreds of thousands of unionists took to the streets of Barcelona at the weekend to protest against the region breaking away.

Buoyed by the show of support, Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaría said on Monday: “I‘m calling on the sensible people in the Catalan government... don’t jump off the edge because you’ll take the people with you.”

“If there is a unilateral declaration of independence there will be decisions made to restore law and democracy,” Saenz de Santamaría told COPE radio station.

Backing also came from European heavyweights Germany and France.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke to Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy on Saturday about the crisis, her spokesman said on Monday. She stressed her support for Spain’s unity but also encouraged more dialogue.

France said it would not recognize Catalonia if the region unilaterally declared independence. Doing so would lead to Catalonia’s automatic exit from the European Union, it said.

“This crisis needs to be resolved through dialogue at all levels of Spanish politics,” France’s European affairs minister Nathalie Loiseau said.

The European Union has shown no interest in an independent Catalonia, despite an appeal by Puigdemont for Brussels to mediate in the crisis.

NEW ELECTIONS?

Under Catalonia’s referendum law, deemed unconstitutional by Madrid, a vote for independence in the assembly on Tuesday would start a six-month process that would envisage divorce talks with Spain before regional elections and a final act of separation.

Rajoy has not ruled out the so-called “nuclear option” of removing Catalonia’s government and calling new regional elections if it claims independence.

He gained some political cover for such a move on Monday when opposition Socialist leader Pedro Sanchez said in Barcelona he would “support the response of the rule of law in the face of any attempt to break social harmony”.

Sanchez stopped short, however, of explicitly saying his party would back dissolving the regional parliament, a possibility written into the 1978 constitution.

Losing Catalonia, which has its own language and culture, would deprive Spain of a fifth of its economic output and more than a quarter of exports. A stream of Catalonia-based firms and banks have moved their legal bases outside the region.

The boards of Catalonia-based infrastructure firm Abertis (ABE.MC), telecoms company Cellnex (CLNX.MC) and property group Inmobiliaria Colonial (COL.MC) will meet on Monday to discuss moving, sources said.

Banks Caixabank (CABK.MC) and Sabadell (SABE.MC) have already resolved to leave the region.

The crisis has also reopened old divisions in a nation where the right-wing dictatorship of General Francisco Franco is a living memory easily revived by strong displays of nationalism.

Among many moderate Spaniards there is widespread opposition to a breakaway, including in Catalonia. Regional authorities say about 90 percent of those who voted in the referendum backed secession, but turnout was 43 percent, with most unionists boycotting it.

Sunday's demonstration in the Catalan capital helped calm Spanish markets on Monday, along with comments on Friday from credit rating agencies Moody's and DBRS that they expected Spain to remain united. Spanish borrowing costs fell to a one-week low and the main share index .IBEX touched a week high.

Puigdemont appeared resolute in a television interview on Sunday, saying the region’s referendum law called for a declaration of independence in the event of a “yes” vote.

“We will apply what the law says,” he told TV3.

Catalonia’s High Court asked for more security in case independence is declared, specifically drafting in the national police, who were called in to stop the referendum when the Catalan police force failed to act.

Madrid sent thousands of national police to the region to prevent the vote. About 900 people were injured when officers used rubber bullets and batons against voters in scenes that shocked Spain and the world, and escalated the dispute.

Under a blueprint for independence drawn up by the Catalan parliament last month, the High court would be turned into a new Supreme Court of Catalonia.

Puigdemont said on Sunday he had not been in contact with the Madrid government for some time because it refused to discuss independence.

“What is happening in Catalonia is real, whether they like it or not. Millions of people have voted, who want to decide. We have to talk about this,” he said.

MONROVIA (Reuters) - After a dozen years of recovery under Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for helping bring peace after civil war turned her country into a wasteland, Liberians are hopeful about their first democratic power transfer for 73 years.

Twenty candidates are standing to replace Johnson Sirleaf in a first round on Tuesday. With nobody likely to win a majority outright, the top two are expected to face each other in a run-off in around a month. While the election campaign has been rambunctious, it has been mainly peaceful so far, and most expectations are that it will come off without bloodshed.

Johnson Sirleaf, 78, has many accomplishments to boast since she became Africa’s first modern female head of state.

The economy is four times the size it was when she took office in 2005. The gangs of drug addled youths who raped and mutilated their way across the nation during a civil war that ended in 2003 are a vivid but receding memory.

Charles Taylor, the warlord who ruled in Liberia’s darkest days, is now in a British jail, serving a life sentence for crimes against humanity, including terrorism, pillage, rape, murder and sexual slavery -- the first former head of state convicted by an international tribunal since Nuremburg.

Yet the country is still one of the world’s poorest. It survived another existential crisis three years ago with an outbreak of the Ebola virus that overwhelmed its health services. Residents complain of corruption from officials and poor public services, and say that while they are thankful for the peace that Johnson Sirleaf brought, they are excited about the prospect of change.

“For me, the only thing about this administration is peace. I gave her a plus in that,” said Timothy Sambulah, a taxi driver in the capital Monrovia. But, he said: “She has not been able to fight corruption. She failed to deal with people who took money to build their big houses.”

FRONT-RUNNERS INCLUDE WEAH

Among the front-runners seen as likely to win a place in the run-off are Vice President Joseph Nyuma Boakai, representing the ruling Unity Party, and football star George Weah, who lost to Johnson Sirleaf in 2005. Weah has served in the senate since 2014 for the opposition Congress for Democratic Change.

Candidates have held enthusiastic rallies attended by thousands of supporters wearing T-shirts, drenched by downpours in a carnival atmosphere.

Many have promised a break from the past. One poster carried around by opponents read: “Another six years of this...” with a photograph of a distressed woman seated in a damp home with walls made of corrugated iron.

“There will be no business as usual. We are going to end the era of selective justice so people are given equal protection under the law,” Charles Walker Brumskine, a lawyer running as the candidate of the Liberty Party, third biggest in Congress, told Reuters.

But one diplomat said it would be difficult to accelerate development just as millions of dollars in aid money pledged during the Ebola outbreak is drying up.

Liberia, Africa’s oldest republic, was founded by freed U.S. slaves in the 19th century.

Its recovery since the war has been remarkable. GDP for the country of 4.6 million reached $2.1 billion last year up from just $550 million the year Sirleaf Johnson took office.

A former finance minister in the 1970s who fled after a coup and worked for the World Bank and Citibank during her exile, she restored a measure of professionalism to a government that had been seized by a military junta in 1980 and collapsed under the predation of the warlords.

Outside her home country, Johnson Sirleaf has served as an ambassador for peace in an unstable region, donning colorful headscarves on diplomatic missions such as one last year to persuade Gambia’s ruler Yahya Jammeh to step down.

Still, many Liberians say she failed to stamp out graft and nepotism that have held the country back.

Her son Robert Sirleaf was a senior advisor and ran state oil firm NOCAL, which collapsed after his tenure as crude prices slumped in 2015. Her other son, Charles, was among 45 government officials suspended in 2012 for failing to declare their assets to anti-corruption authorities. She declared her own assets this year.

Last year a grand jury indicted government officials, including the speaker of parliament on charges including bribery.

“High level corruption has been a slap in the face for Liberians, most of whom live in abject poverty,” said Liberian political analyst Robtel Neajai Pailey who also criticized what she described as “hero worship” of Johnson Sirleaf.","As Johnson Sirleaf exits, Liberians thankful for peace, excited about change",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1CE0DY-OZATP

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices stabilized on Monday after one of the most bearish weeks in months, propped up by OPEC comments signaling the possibility of continued action to restore market balance in the long term.

Oil production platforms in the Gulf of Mexico started returning to service after Hurricane Nate forced the shutdown of more than 90 percent of crude output in the area. The prospective restarts kept price gains in check.

Former hurricane Nate has become a post-tropical cyclone that continues to pack heavy rain and gusty winds, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said on Monday.

“Quiet market overall this morning though (refined) products are weaker as it looks like Nate was a non-event for refining,” said Scott Shelton, broker at ICAP in Durham, North Carolina.

“I think that without the support of products and Brent, the market may get dragged lower in the near term as its apparent that the market doesn’t care much about OPEC already jawboning about an extension of the deal.”

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is due to meet in Vienna on Nov. 30, when it will discuss its pact to reduce output in order to prop up the market.

OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said on Sunday that consultations were under way for an extension of the agreement beyond March 2018 and that more oil-producing nations may join the pact, possibly at the November meeting.

He also said OPEC members and other producers may have to take some “extraordinary measures” to ensure the market is in balance in the long term.

In a speech to the Reuters Global Commodities Summit on Monday, Barkindo said he saw clear evidence the oil market was rebalancing.

Global benchmark Brent crude LCOc1 was down 2 cents at $55.60 a barrel at 11:31 a.m. EDT (1531 GMT). Earlier in the session it touched a three-week low of $55.06. It ended last week 3.3 percent lower, its biggest weekly loss since June 2017.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures CLc1 were trading at $49.46, up 17 cents. They came close to a four-week low when they fell to $49.13 earlier in the session. WTI’s losses last week came to 4.6 percent.

In further signs that OPEC members are sticking to agreed cuts, Saudi Arabia said it had curtailed crude allocations for November by 560,000 barrels per day and Iraq’s oil minister said the country was fully committed to its OPEC production target.

Among other bullish news for oil, Morgan Stanley cut its forecast for U.S. crude output growth, citing a range of operational headwinds including limited availability of fracking crews.

Money managers raised their bullish bets on U.S. crude futures for the third week in a row, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission reported on Friday.

However, data published by InterContinental Exchange showed investors had slightly reduced their bets on rising Brent prices in the week ending Oct. 3.",Oil prices steady after OPEC signals possible deal extension,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil/oil-prices-stable-after-opec-signals-possible-further-action-idINKBN1CE011?il=0

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia and China called for restraint on North Korea on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump warned over the weekend that “only one thing will work” in dealing with Pyongyang, hinting that military action was on his mind.

When asked what Russia made of Trump’s comments, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a reporters on a conference call:

“Moscow has called and continues to call on the parties involved in the conflict and on those who have anything to do with this issue to exercise restraint and to avoid any steps that would only worsen the situation.”

Commenting on a Trump statement that the United States might withdraw from a nuclear deal with Iran, Peskov said such a move would have “negative consequences.”

In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying repeated China’s position that all parties exercise restraint, describing the situation as extremely complex and serious.

China hopes all sides do nothing to irritate each other or worsen the problem and speak and act cautiously, she told a daily news briefing.

In recent weeks, North Korea has launched two missiles over Japan and conducted its sixth nuclear test, all in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions, and may be fast advancing toward its goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.

Trump repeatedly has made clear his distaste for dialogue with North Korea. Last week, he dismissed the idea of talks as a waste of time, a day after Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Washington was maintaining open lines of communication with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s government.

“Our country has been unsuccessfully dealing with North Korea for 25 years, giving billions of dollars & getting nothing. Policy didn’t work!” the U.S. president said in a Twitter post on Monday.

Trump’s comments seemed to further suggest that military action was on his mind.

On Saturday, Trump made a similar comment on Twitter about how negotiations have failed for 25 years and said “only one thing will work” with North Korea.

U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Monday told the U.S. Army to be ready with military options on North Korea, but emphasized that efforts to deal with Pyongyang were being led diplomatically.

“There is one thing the U.S. Army can do and that is you have got to be ready to ensure that we have military options that our President can employ if needed,” Mattis said in a speech at an annual U.S. Army conference.

“We currently are in a diplomatically led effort and how many times have you seen the U.N.

The failure by Prime Minister Theresa May to win a parliamentary majority in last week's election has pushed the world's fifth largest economy toward a level of political uncertainty not seen since the 1970s.

May called the election to secure a mandate for her vision of a “hard Brexit” -- driving down migration by taking Britain out of the single market and the customs union.

Instead, she got a hung parliament in which no single party has a majority. Business leaders demanded a re-think.

“The UK has had a reputation, earned over the generations, for stability and predictability in its government,” a senior executive at a multi-national company listed on the London FTSE 100 told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

“That reputation in 12 months has been destroyed, truly destroyed. First by Brexit and now through this election.”

A survey by the Institute of Directors (IoD) found only 20 percent of its nearly 700 members were now optimistic about the British economy over the next 12 months, compared with 57 percent who were quite or very pessimistic.

The IoD survey, taken after the election, found a negative swing of 34 points in confidence in the economy from its previous survey in May.

“It is hard to overstate what a dramatic impact the current political uncertainty is having on business leaders, and the consequences could – if not addressed immediately – be disastrous for the UK economy,” said Stephen Martin, director general of the IoD.

The collapse in confidence, which follows a short-term drop after last year’s Brexit vote, coincides with a slowdown in the wider economy that has taken hold since the start of this year, as rising inflation pushes up the price of goods.

Figures from credit card firm Visa showed British consumers turned more cautious even before the shock election result, with households cutting their spending for the first time in nearly four years last month.

The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) warned there was now a risk businesses would cut back on investment which has largely held up since last year’s Brexit vote.

And the trade group that represents manufacturers, the EEF, said its members were having to navigate the most uncertain political territory in Britain for decades.

Both groups called on the government to rethink its approach to Brexit, saying the country needed tariff-free access to the single market and a steady flow of migrant workers.

Some executives hoped the political paralysis would lead to a ‘softer Brexit’, with access to markets prioritized over a clamp down on immigration.

“Here we are again: another bolt from the blue, a political earthquake that we didn’t think used to happen in the UK,” CBI Director General Carolyn Fairbairn said at a conference hosted by the Resolution Foundation.

“But I do think there are opportunities in this, and it is an opportunity to refocus back on the economy to talk about jobs, growth, future prosperity.”

Having slid to its lowest for nearly two months against the dollar on Friday, the pound fell broadly again on Monday.

LEFT IN LIMBO

Business executives warned the political uncertainty could be felt across a wave of sectors.

Leaders of the drugs industry warned of the hazards of government limbo at a critical time for the highly regulated sector as companies seek clarity on the rules that will govern their business after Brexit.

Andy Bruce, the CEO of Lookers (LOOK.L), one of Britain’s biggest car dealerships, said the lack of a clear result meant the highly successful industry had now entered “uncharted waters” in terms of how many new cars it could sell.

And Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP (WPP.L), the world’s largest advertising agency, told Reuters he feared increased economic uncertainty, which meant “weak investment and postponement of decision making.”

“Now it seems that we could have no deal because of the short time fuse and lack of decisive government decision making, or a soft Brexit, the latter with more movement and membership of the single market,” he said.

Bankers, at the heart of London’s huge financial center, cautioned of the impact on takeover activity.

“So long as uncertainty is there I don’t see that as particularly positive for M&A in the short term,” Karen Cook, chairman of investment banking at Goldman Sachs said at the Reuters Global M&A summit.

Gareth Vale, marketing director at recruitment group Manpower, said its clients were very apprehensive, and had not yet fully grasped the impact that Brexit would have.

“I think the uncertainty around Brexit, and more recently the general election, has created a sense of almost inertia, which has prevented them from considering some of the bigger seismic shifts that are on the horizon.”",Business confidence plummets as political crisis grips Britain,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-economy/business-confidence-plummets-as-political-crisis-grips-britain-idUSKBN1931P9

LONDRES (Reuters) - O Irã prometeu nesta segunda-feira dar uma resposta “esmagadora” se os Estados Unidos designarem a força militar de elite do país, a Guarda Revolucionária, como um grupo terrorista.

A promessa foi feita uma semana antes de o presidente dos EUA, Donald Trump, anunciar sua decisão final sobre a maneira como quer conter Teerã. Trump tem até o dia 15 de outubro para retirar a certificação de um acordo internacional histórico de 2015 para conter o programa nuclear iraniano, uma medida que poderia anular o acordo.

Também existe a possibilidade de Trump qualificar a força de segurança mais poderosa do Irã, a Guarda Revolucionária, como uma organização terrorista ao divulgar uma estratégia mais abrangente para o regime.

“Estamos esperançosos de que os Estados Unidos não cometerão este erro estratégico”, disse o porta-voz do Ministério das Relações Exteriores, Bahram Qasemi, segundo a agência estatal de notícia Irna, em uma coletiva de imprensa.

“Se eles o fizerem, a reação do Irã será firma, decisiva e esmagadora e os Estados Unidos arcarão com suas consequências”, acrescentou.

Indivíduos e entidades associados à Guarda Revolucionária já estão em uma lista de organizações terroristas estrangeiras de Washington, mas não a organização como um todo.

Seu comandante, Mohammad Ali Jafari, disse no domingo que “se estiver correta a notícia sobre a estupidez do governo americano ao considerar a Guarda Revolucionária um grupo terrorista, a Guarda Revolucionária considerará o Exército americano como se fosse o Estado Islâmico em todo o mundo”.

Jafari também disse que sanções adicionais acabariam com as chances de um diálogo futuro com os EUA e que os norte-americanos teriam que colocar suas bases regionais fora dos dois mil quilômetros de alcance dos mísseis da Guarda.

O porta-voz da chancelaria também negou acusações norte-americanas segundo as quais o Irã cooperou com a Coreia do Norte.

Em uma entrevista televisionada na noite de sábado, Trump acusou o Irã de “financiar a Coreia do Norte” e de “fazer coisas com a Coreia do Norte que são totalmente impróprias”.

Qasemi classificou as acusações de “infundadas”.","Irã promete resposta ""esmagadora"" se EUA designarem Guarda Revolucionária como grupo terrorista",https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idBRKBN1CE18U-OBRWD

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices stabilized on Monday after one of the most bearish weeks in months, propped up by OPEC comments signaling the possibility of continued action to restore market balance in the long term.

Oil production platforms in the Gulf of Mexico started returning to service after Hurricane Nate forced the shutdown of more than 90 percent of crude output in the area. The prospective restarts kept price gains in check.

Former hurricane Nate has become a post-tropical cyclone that continues to pack heavy rain and gusty winds, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said on Monday.

“Quiet market overall this morning though (refined) products are weaker as it looks like Nate was a non-event for refining,” said Scott Shelton, broker at ICAP in Durham, North Carolina.

“I think that without the support of products and Brent, the market may get dragged lower in the near term as its apparent that the market doesn’t care much about OPEC already jawboning about an extension of the deal.”

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is due to meet in Vienna on Nov. 30, when it will discuss its pact to reduce output in order to prop up the market.

OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said on Sunday that consultations were under way for an extension of the agreement beyond March 2018 and that more oil-producing nations may join the pact, possibly at the November meeting.

He also said OPEC members and other producers may have to take some “extraordinary measures” to ensure the market is in balance in the long term.

In a speech to the Reuters Global Commodities Summit on Monday, Barkindo said he saw clear evidence the oil market was rebalancing.

Global benchmark Brent crude LCOc1 was down 2 cents at $55.60 a barrel at 11:31 a.m. EDT (1531 GMT). Earlier in the session it touched a three-week low of $55.06. It ended last week 3.3 percent lower, its biggest weekly loss since June 2017.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures CLc1 were trading at $49.46, up 17 cents. They came close to a four-week low when they fell to $49.13 earlier in the session. WTI’s losses last week came to 4.6 percent.

In further signs that OPEC members are sticking to agreed cuts, Saudi Arabia said it had curtailed crude allocations for November by 560,000 barrels per day and Iraq’s oil minister said the country was fully committed to its OPEC production target.

Among other bullish news for oil, Morgan Stanley cut its forecast for U.S. crude output growth, citing a range of operational headwinds including limited availability of fracking crews.

Money managers raised their bullish bets on U.S. crude futures for the third week in a row, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission reported on Friday.

However, data published by InterContinental Exchange showed investors had slightly reduced their bets on rising Brent prices in the week ending Oct. 3.",Oil prices steady after OPEC signals possible deal extension,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil/oil-prices-steady-after-opec-signals-possible-deal-extension-idUSKBN1CE011

REUTERS/Brian Snyder

In his home just outside of Boston in the early hours of Monday Michael Rosbash, clad in his bathrobe and pajamas, answered the door when a Reuters photographer rang the doorbell.

He invited the man, whom he’d never met, into his home and allowed him to photograph him drinking coffee in his kitchen because, for Rosbash, this was not an ordinary morning. He had just been named one of three American scientists awarded the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work unravelling molecular mechanisms that control our internal body clocks.

Even as Reuters photographer Brian Snyder was making his overture to Rosbash, his Reuters colleague Mike Blake was working to capture another iconic image – this one related to the tragedy at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino where a lone gunman opened fire on a country music concert and killed 59 people. Both photos tell vastly different stories but both relied on the same depth of preparation that goes into what photographers call “making” a picture.

In the case of the Nobel Prize winner, the photographer’s road to Rosbash’s door - and the viral of image of the professor in his dressing gown clutching a mug of coffee that produced - involved journalists on two continents, who had spent almost a month planning Reuters’ coverage of the Nobel Prizes, which are shrouded in secrecy.

The effort is coordinated in our Stockholm bureau and an important part of it is having journalists on standby in cities such as Boston because so many winners come from Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

As the news of the winners hit the Reuters wire on Monday, a senior photo editor alerted his counterparts globally on the winners’ names and their potential locations.

Snyder, who has been based in Boston for almost 30 years, was woken at 5:45 a.m. on Monday by a phone call from his editor, putting him on the hunt for Rosbash, a professor at nearby Brandeis University.

He found his address, and managing to avoid Boston’s notorious rush-hour traffic, made it to Rosbash’s home in 20 minutes. The first photographer to arrive at the scene, he found the scientist taking congratulatory phone calls.

To get access to Rosbash, Snyder simply rang the doorbell and was invited in to take his pictures of the pajama-clad prize-winner.

""There's no downside to winning the Nobel,” Snyder said. ""Maybe that makes them less likely to turn you away.”

At the same time Snyder was getting his early morning assignment, Blake got a call in the middle of the night. He was expecting it to be a Nobel Prize winner—but this assignment was grim. Blake was dispatched to Las Vegas from Southern California to cover the aftermath of the mass shooting.

Because the police had the adjacent area locked down really well, Blake decided to stay at a Hooters hotel, which had a limited view of Mandalay Bay resort and the outdoor Las Vegas Village where the Route 91 Harvest country music festival took place.

On Wednesday, ahead of the president’s visit to Las Vegas, Blake got an idea for a frame.

From his hotel room window, which faced the Mandalay Bay, he had seen planes taking off over the hotel. He decided to try to capture the president’s plane and hotel together in one photograph.

The president’s schedule was not well known at that point. The media had had an idea he would leave around 1 p.m., so the team sat and waited.

Eventually, the plane came into Blake’s viewfinder, and much lower than he expected. “I zoomed out a little to put the plane over the stage of the venue. I zoomed in as it went over a Mandalay Bay sign and then it disappeared behind the hotel. I quickly framed up the broken windows and waited for it to appear somewhere behind them,” he said. “When it did, I hit the motor drive, captured the scene and sent three images back to the news desk.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Mauritius’ SBM Holdings has given a non-binding offer for the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities belonging to Kenya’s Chase Bank, the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) said on Monday.

The central bank wants to find a strategic investor for Chase but has not specified how big a stake it seeks to sell.

In May, CBK said 12 parties - including local and foreign banks - had expressed interest in the bank, which has no association with JP Morgan Chase & Co.

Also in May, SBM Holdings said it was bidding to buy a stake in Chase Bank.

“Central Bank of Kenya and Kenya Deposit Insurance Corporation announces that they have received a non-binding offer from SBM Holdings Limited with respect to Chase Bank (Kenya) Limited (In Receivership) (CBLR),” the central bank said in a statement.

“The non-binding offer includes the acquisition of certain assets and matched liabilities from CBLR. Whilst the non-binding offer is still subject to confirmatory due diligence and a binding contract.”

The central bank and the Kenya Deposit Insurance Corporation said the offer was a viable avenue to resolve Chase Bank’s receivership and that Chase Bank shareholders had supported the offer.

“If agreed, it is expected that the proposed transaction will be concluded by the end of 2017,” the central bank said.

Regulators placed the mid-sized Chase Bank under receivership in April 2016 after an unexplained loss of billions of Kenyan shillings.

Chase is in the hands of the Kenya Deposit Insurance Corporation, a state body that protects depositors in case of bank failure.

In November 2016, SBM Holdings acquired Kenya’s Fidelity Bank for a token payment of 100 shillings ($0.97) and said it would inject 1.45 billion shillings of fresh capital into it.

(Reuters) - With a businessman turned politician now in the Oval Office, a small but growing number of bankers and Wall Street financiers across the United States have set their sights on politics.

In New Jersey, Connecticut and California, former bankers, hedge fund managers and private equity executives have either announced bids for legislative and gubernatorial seats, or associates have told Reuters they are considering running.

Meanwhile, industry trade groups including the American Bankers Association are launching formal programs to teach members in various states how to campaign successfully.

It is not the first time well-heeled candidates have entered American politics, and there are not a great number of them. But historians, political scientists and bankers say the atmosphere has changed abruptly under President Donald Trump.

“It’s certainly raised the visibility of folks who in the past may have said ‘I‘m not a politician,” said Richard Baier, president of the Nebraska Bankers Association, which is launching a training school for potential legislative candidates. “We’ve shown that you don’t really need that background.”

The Oklahoma Bankers Association is also planning to launch its own candidate school, a spokesman said.

Foreclosures, job losses and growing income inequality after the 2007-2009 financial crisis made anyone with Wall Street ties into a political pariah. But Trump, a self-described billionaire who made a fortune in New York real estate and entertainment, has stocked his cabinet with Wall Street bankers and industry tycoons.

His presidency has inspired others in the financial community to pursue civic duty, according to people who have studied campaigns or are involved with current election efforts.

Trump’s ascendance shows that candidates’ backgrounds matter less than whether they can connect with voters, said Joshua Sandman, a political science professor at the University of New Haven.

“Trump running has encouraged more people in financial services to test the waters,” he said, “but the water could be murky for them unless they have a real set of positive experiences within business and are reflective of creating jobs and helping people.”

It is hard to say quantitatively whether more candidates with finance backgrounds are pursuing political office now compared with prior election cycles. But Paul Herrnson, a political science professor at the University of Connecticut who has researched candidates’ backgrounds, says he is skeptical about how successful the new crop of candidates will be.

“Sure, the mood is better than it was when the market collapsed, but I don’t think people say, ‘Wall Street financier – that’s someone I can vote for,” he said.

Phil Murphy, the Democratic candidate for New Jersey governor in 2017, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc executive who spent 23 years at the firm, is perhaps the most prominent moneyed candidate.

His campaign has focused on bolstering the middle class with proposals to create a millionaire’s tax and launch other initiatives to help low-income residents.

Murphy has won support from labor unions, environmental groups and consumer rights activists, as well as bold-faced names in the Democratic party like former Vice Presidents Joe Biden and Al Gore, who have both endorsed him.

An Oct. 3 Monmouth University Poll has him leading his Republican rival, Kim Guadagno by 14 points, and over 60 percent of New Jersey voters said Murphy’s ties to Goldman do not matter in a recent Quinnipiac Poll.

“Obviously Goldman was his career,” said Tony Bianchini, spokesman for the Northeast Regional Council of Carpenters, which is backing Murphy. “Everyone has a career.”

In Connecticut, former UBS Group AG executive Robert Stefanowski is running for governor, according to a public filing, and hedge fund manager David Stemerman recently said he may do the same.

The two Republicans have given few clues about their campaign strategies other than to cast themselves as outsiders who can fix Connecticut’s problems.

In California, two Wall Street veterans are mulling runs as progressive Democrats.

Tom Steyer, an environmentalist who worked at Goldman Sachs and was a hedge fund manager, may run for Senate or governor, a person familiar with the matter said. Joseph Sanberg, a former Tiger Global Management LLC executive, is also considering a Senate run, according to Politico. He casts himself as a “progressive entrepreneur” on his website.

Other ex-Wall Streeters who have entered politics have a mixed history, and much depends on how well their messages align with voters’ concerns, political historians said.

For instance, while Mitt Romney’s private-equity career helped doom his 2012 presidential bid, Illinois voters elected private equity executive Bruce Rauner as governor in 2014.",New Wall Street candidates emerge to test Trump-era appeal,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trump-effect-bankers/new-wall-street-candidates-emerge-to-test-trump-era-appeal-idUKKBN1CE1BX

The dilemma over energy prices shows economic reforms, designed to eliminate a huge state budget deficit caused by low oil prices while weaning the economy off dependence on oil exports, are running into a difficult phase.

Austerity steps so far, including an initial round of energy price hikes announced in December 2015, have begun to reduce the deficit. But this has come at a high cost to the economy: data last week showed Saudi Arabia in recession during the second quarter, and unemployment among Saudis at 12.8 percent.

That means further austerity will be hard to introduce without risking a sharp economic slowdown which would deter the private investment that the reforms aim to attract. A prolonged recession could turn public sentiment against reforms.

A government official said Riyadh was delaying a decision on energy prices until it had finished designing a system of cash payments to lower- and middle-income households, which would partially compensate citizens for the pain of austerity.

“There are still some discussions over who is going to be compensated and who is not,” he said. “The government has to consider the implications of higher taxes and ways to mitigate risks for both gross domestic product growth and the budget.”

DELAY

At the end of 2016, officials indicated rises in heavily subsidized energy prices would occur around mid-2017. Along with water price reforms, the changes would save the government 29 billion riyals ($7.7 billion) in 2017, according to a long-term fiscal plan which Riyadh released in December.

But since then, the economy has slowed more than expected. The non-oil sector expanded only 0.6 percent year-on-year in the second quarter, casting doubt on the International Monetary Fund’s forecast of 1.7 percent non-oil growth this year.

The economy’s weakness has already caused Riyadh to partially reverse one austerity step: this year it restored financial allowances for civil servants that it had abolished last year, although it is now disbursing allowances much less generously than previously.

The timing of energy price increases may be another casualty of the recession. Although some sources said they still expected hikes to occur this year, others said they could be delayed into 2018.

One thing which could force a delay is the government’s plan to introduce a 5 percent value-added tax in January. The tax will hit domestic demand; if it is closely preceded by fuel price hikes, the impact could be severe.

Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih implied last week that the hikes were still on the cards for 2017, telling a Moscow conference: “We in Saudi Arabia are putting a lot of emphasis on energy efficiency. We will be reforming our energy prices in due course this year...”

Major Saudi newspaper Okaz, quoting anonymous sources, reported last month that gasoline prices would rise 80 percent by end-November, with 95 octane climbing to 43 U.S. cents a liter. Even then, Saudi prices would remain among the lowest in the world.

Sources said that hike was not set in stone, however. The IMF has been urging Riyadh to delay fuel price rises to protect the economy; it said last week that Saudi officials were not yet convinced, but were reconsidering the speed of austerity steps.

“The authorities indicated that they were considering the appropriate pace of fiscal adjustment given the weak growth,” the IMF said.

Even if gasoline prices rise sharply, other energy reforms may be watered down or delayed. Diesel prices - key for Saudi Arabia’s fleet of trucks - would increase only moderately, and prices of jet fuel would be raised only cautiously for fear of hurting the aviation industry, the sources said.

Under the fiscal plan, Riyadh intended to raise electricity prices for households this year. It is not clear if this will occur in 2017, however, partly because electricity prices are linked to restructuring and partial privatization of utility Saudi Electricity Co 5110.SE, still under consideration.

The government’s plan to sell shares in oil giant Saudi Aramco by the end of 2018 may limit any delays to energy reforms. Riyadh is keen to get a high valuation for the company - officials have talked of at least $2 trillion - and investors will want to see the new structure of energy price regulation before committing themselves.","Saudi balances recession, deficit in tough decision on energy reform",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-energy-reform/saudi-balances-recession-deficit-in-tough-decision-on-energy-reform-idINKBN1CE1RN?il=0

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Google has discovered Russian operatives spent tens of thousands of dollars on ads on its YouTube, Gmail and Google Search products in an effort to meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, a person briefed on the company’s probe told Reuters on Monday.

The ads do not appear to be from the same Kremlin-affiliated entity that bought ads on Facebook Inc, but may indicate a broader Russian online disinformation effort, according to the source, who was not authorized to discuss details of Google’s confidential investigation.

The revelation is likely to fuel further scrutiny of the role that Silicon Valley technology giants may have unwittingly played during last year’s election. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Moscow’s goal was to help elect Donald Trump.

Google has uncovered less than $100,000 in ad spending potentially linked to Russian actors, the source said.

Both Twitter Inc and Facebook recently detected and disclosed that suspected Russian operatives, working for a content farm known as the Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg, Russia, used their platforms to purchase ads and post content that was politically divisive in a bid to influence Americans before and after the November 2016 presidential election.

The Internet Research Agency employ hundreds of so-called “trolls” who post pro-Kremlin content, much of it fake or discredited, under the guise of phony social media accounts that posed as American or European, according to lawmakers and researchers.

Facebook announced last month it had unearthed $100,000 in spending by the Internet Research Agency and, under pressure from lawmakers, has pledged to be more transparent about how its ads are purchased and targeted.

Google’s review had been more robust than ones undertaken so far by Facebook or Twitter, the source said.

Russia’s ad purchases were first reported by the Washington Post.

Google, owned by Alphabet Inc, did not deny the story, and in a statement pointed to its existing ad policies that limit political ad targeting and prohibit targeting based on race or religion.

“We are taking a deeper look to investigate attempts to abuse our systems, working with researchers and other companies, and will provide assistance to ongoing inquiries,” a Google spokeswoman said on Monday.

Google runs the world’s largest online advertising business and YouTube is the world’s largest online video site.

Congressional committees have launched multiple investigations into the Russian interference. Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have said Russia intended to sow discord in the United States, spread propaganda and sway the election.

Google officials have been invited to testify publicly about Russian attempts to use their platforms to influence the election before both the House and Senate intelligence committees on Nov. 1 alongside Facebook and Twitter.

ROME (Reuters) - The brother of the man who killed two women with a knife outside Marseille train station last week was probably a foreign fighter in Syria and Iraq, Italian investigators said on Monday.

Italian police arrested 25-year-old Tunisian Anis Hannachi in Northern Italy on Saturday evening. He had been in Italy since Oct. 4 or earlier, police said.

His older brother, the 29-year-old Ahmed, was shot dead by a French soldier after killing the two women on Oct. 1.

Ahmed lived south of Rome with his Italian wife from 2008 to 2014, and was known to police only for “petty crimes”, Italy’s chief anti-terrorism prosecutor Franco Roberti told reporters.

“Ahmed never showed any signs of radicalization in Italy,” Roberti said. “The investigative hypothesis we’re working on is that the younger brother radicalized the older one.”

The militant Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the Marseille attack, but did not name Ahmed as the assailant.

Anis has refused to talk to Italian investigators, Roberti said. He was arrested on an international arrest warrant issued by the French, who are investigating the Marseille attack as a “probable” terrorist action.

It is likely that Anis will be extradited to France in a matter of days, Roberti added.

“Anis was flagged as a dangerous individual who probably had been a foreign fighter” in Iraq and Syria, Claudio Galzerano, director of an Italian anti-terrorism police squad, told reporters.

Anis was arrested on suspicion of complicity in his brother’s attack and membership of a terrorist group. He had been fingerprinted and photographed by police in 2014, when he reached Italy by boat and was immediately sent back home.

However, that previous identification meant police were sure they had arrested the right man when they tracked him down on Saturday evening riding a bicycle in the center of Ferrara, in Northern Italy.

He had no identification on him, gave police a false name, and told them he was Algerian, Galzerano said.

Police are now investigating Anis’s possible contacts in Italy.

The Marseille attacker’s estranged wife told Italy’s Corriere della Sera newspaper on Sunday that she did not believe Ahmed had become a radical Islamist.

“He didn’t care about religion,” Ramona Cargnelutti told Corriere in an interview. “I’ve never seen him enter a Mosque.”

While admitting she had not seen him for more than two years, she said the murder of the two women was more likely a robbery gone wrong because he was a drug user and always in need of cash.

LONDON (Reuters) - Aldi plans to build a new distribution centre in the southeast of England to supply the German discount supermarket chain’s expanding British network, it said on Monday.

The company has earmarked more than 75 million pounds to build a centre in Bedford on a site covering an area equivalent to 20 soccer pitches, creating 400 jobs.

The battle over Britain’s supermarket shoppers has ramped up over the past decade as fast-growing discounters Aldi and Lidl have forced market leaders such as Tesco and Sainsbury’s to cut prices.

Aldi last month reported a third straight year of falling profit but reiterated its commitment to expansion in Britain. Already the UK’s fifth-biggest supermarket chain, Aldi aims to lift the number of its UK stores to 1,000, from 726, by 2022.

“More than half of all UK households now regularly shop with us and many more prospective customers tell us they would switch supermarkets if there was an Aldi nearby,” said Matthew Barnes, chief executive of Aldi UK and Ireland.

SUZUKA, Japan (Reuters) - The question of whether Lewis Hamilton will win his fourth Formula One world championship this year now looks more a matter of when and where after his Japanese Grand Prix triumph on Sunday.

Fifty nine points clear of Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel with four races remaining, the Mercedes driver can wrap things up at the next race in Austin, Texas, in two weeks if everything goes to plan.

Anything can happen in Formula One, but it will take a monumental collapse for the 32-year-old Briton to be overhauled by a rival whose challenge has imploded.

Vettel knows the score, even if he has not given up hope entirely.

“I don’t need to be a genius or a mathematician,” he said when asked about his chances.

And yet Hamilton and Mercedes, a whopping 145 points clear of Ferrari in their constructors’ battle, will still cling to their mantra of one race at a time and no chickens counted until they hatch.

“There’s no change in approach,” Mercedes boss Toto Wolff said on Sunday.

”We’ve benefited from Ferrari’s misfortune and reliability woes in the last three races, but it doesn’t mean that we are clapping ourselves on the back. On the contrary, I think we need to continue to push.

“You can see how quickly it goes with Sebastian.”

Vettel had lined up in Suzuka on the front row alongside Hamilton but a humble spark plug, one of the cheapest components on a car packed with hi-tech wizardry, stopped his challenge after four laps.

Engine failure in qualifying in Malaysia and a first-corner collision in Singapore put paid to any hopes of victory in those races.

If Hamilton wins in Austin and the German fails to finish higher than sixth, it is game over. Mexico follows a week later and then Brazil with the chances of a decider in Abu Dhabi looking minimal.

Sunday’s twist took the sting out of what was, until the August break, a close fight between four-times champion Vettel and triple titleholder Hamilton.

And then Formula One went on holiday and everything changed.

In the five races since the break, Hamilton has won four times and taken 118 points compared to a mere 45 for Vettel. The German had led his rival by 14 points after Hungary at the end of July.

In the last four races alone, Vettel has given away 66 points to Hamilton.

The Briton, who has finished his last 21 races in the points, said he could only have dreamed of holding such an advantage and credited his team for their efforts.

Muhammad Safdar, a lawmaker married to Sharif’s daughter and heir-apparent Maryam, was arrested after he failed to appear at previous National Accountability Bureau (NAB) court hearings about corruption allegations stemming from a probe into the Sharif family wealth.

The Sharifs have denied any wrongdoing and have labelled the corruption proceedings against them as politically motivated. Two of Nawaz’s sons are also due to appear before the NAB court, along with Finance Minister Ishaq Dar.

Nawaz was disqualified by the Supreme Court in July for not declaring a source of income that he disputes receiving. Pakistan’s top court also ordered a wide-ranging NAB investigation and trial into Sharif family members.

The Supreme Court specified that the trial be concluded within six months by NAB, which has in the past been derided as toothless because rich and powerful politicians were seldom convicted.

Safdar, who was arrested soon after midnight, was expected to be released after his NAB court appearance with Maryam this morning.

Television footage showed some supporters from the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) trying to stop the car from leaving the airport, including some who lay down in front of it. A senior PML-N official urged them to give way.

Khawaja Saad Rafique, a minister in the PML-N Cabinet, said on Twitter no resistance was made to Safdar’s arrest, even though the party had “serious reservations” about the judicial process.

Sharif’s disqualification stems from the Panama Papers leaks in 2016 that appeared to show that his daughter and two sons owned offshore holding companies registered in the British Virgin Islands and used them to buy properties in London.

The Supreme Court initially declined to dismiss Nawaz but ordered an investigation into his family’s wealth. After the probe it disqualified him and ordered a NAB investigation and trial into the family.

Some senior PML-N officials, including Maryam, have hinted that elements of Pakistan’s powerful military had a hidden hand in the Supreme Court disqualification that forced Nawaz to resign. The army denied playing a role.

The case against the Sharifs has gripped Pakistan, with analysts expecting the negative newsflow from the hearings to hurt PML-N in the run-up to the next general elections, likely in mid-2018.",Pakistani anti-corruption body arrests son-in-law of ousted PM Sharif,https://www.reuters.com/article/pakistan-politics/pakistani-anti-corruption-body-arrests-son-in-law-of-ousted-pm-sharif-idINKBN1CE0CI

LONDON (Reuters) - World shares rose on Monday, with Chinese stocks hitting 21-month highs and the German index setting a new record, while political uncertainty triggered big moves in sterling, the Turkish lira and Spanish debt.

Wall Street looked set to open higher, with e-mini futures on the S&P 500 index ESc1 up 0.2 percent and signaling a rebound from Friday’s fall after six days of gains.

European shares rose. The pan-European STOXX 600 index added 0.3 percent and Germany's DAX .GDAXI touched an all-time high after data showing industrial output far overshot forecasts.

Spanish shares outperformed, rising 0.6 percent, and Spain’s government bond yields fell after a big show of support for the country remaining together and against Catalan independence appeared to calm markets.

Hundreds of thousands demonstrated on Sunday in the Catalan capital Barcelona, carrying banners saying “Catalonia is Spain” and “Together we are stronger”. Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont was due to address the regional parliament on Tuesday on “the current political situation”.

LONDON (Reuters) - Iranian authorities have opened a new case against a British-Iranian charity worker serving five years in jail in Tehran, leveling charges that could carry a sentence of 16 additional years in prison, her family said on Monday.

Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, was arrested by the elite Revolutionary Guards in April 2016 at a Tehran airport, as she was about to return to Britain with her two-year-old daughter after a family visit.

She was convicted of plotting to overthrow Iran’s clerical establishment, a charge denied by her family and the Foundation, a charity organization that is independent of Thomson Reuters and operates independently of Reuters News. She was sentenced to five years in prison.

In a hearing in Evin Prison, where she is serving her term, Zaghari-Ratcliffe was told on Sunday that a new case had been opened at the insistence of the Revolutionary Guards, Iran’s most powerful security force, her family said in a statement.

The new charges include joining and receiving money from organizations working to overthrow the Islamic Republic, and attending a demonstration outside the Iranian Embassy in London, the family said.

“Nazanin and the rest of her family are bewildered at this turn,” the family statement said.

Her husband Richard Ratcliffe said the Revolutionary Guards were “inventing new charges to prevent her early release”.

Iran’s judiciary was not immediately available for comment.

Zaghari-Ratcliffe used to work in London for the BBC, which Iran says is seeking to topple the Islamic theocracy. During Sunday’s hearing she rejected all the new charges, the family said.

Iran refuses to recognize dual nationals and denies them access to consular assistance.

Kim Yo Jong was named as an alternate member of the politburo within the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea - the opaque, all-powerful party organ where top state affairs are decided, the North’s official media said on Sunday.

It makes her only the second woman in patriarchal North Korea to join the exclusive club after Kim Kyong Hui, who held powerful roles when her brother Kim Jong Il ruled the country.

“Since she is a female, Kim Jong Un likely does not see her as a threat and a challenge to his leadership,” said Moon Hong-sik, research fellow at the Institute for National Security Strategy. “As the saying goes ‘blood is thicker than water,’ Kim Jong Un thinks Kim Yo Jong can be trusted.”

Unlike her aunt, who was promoted to the politburo in 2012 after serving more than three decades in the party, Kim Yo Jong has risen to power at an unprecedented pace.

Kim Kyong Hui has not been seen since her husband, Jang Song Thaek, once regarded as the No.2 leader in Pyongyang, was executed in 2013. South Korea’s spy agency believes she is now in a secluded place near Pyongyang undergoing a treatment for an unidentified disease, according to an August briefing to parliament.

Jang and his wife are not the only relatives to fall from Kim Jong Un’s favor.

Kim Jong Un’s estranged half-brother, Kim Jong Nam, was killed with a toxic nerve agent at a Malaysian airport in February. Two women are on trial for the murder, which South Korean and U.S. officials believe Kim Jong Un’s regime was behind.

Kim Jong Nam, who lived in exile in Macau, had criticized his family’s dynastic rule and his brother had issued a standing order for his execution, according to some South Korean lawmakers.

IN A PONYTAIL AND BLACK SUITS

The smartly dressed Kim Yo Jong, her hair usually pulled back in a ponytail and mostly seen in black suits and black-heeled shoes, made her first debut on state media in December 2011, seen standing tearfully next to Kim Jong Un at the funeral of their father.

Since then, Kim has made several appearances with her brother, giggling at concerts, riding a white horse, smiling as she receives flowers on his behalf at state functions.

Her youth and bubbly personality seen in state media are in stark contrast to the usually glum generals and aging party cadres who follow Kim Jong Un on official duties.

Having previously only occasionally appeared in the background, the young heiress has moved to the front and center of media photos more recently, assisting her brother at numerous high-profile state events.

At a massive military parade in April to mark the 105th birth anniversary of founding father Kim Il Sung, she was seen rushing out from behind pillars to bring paperwork to her brother as he prepared to give an address.

The same month, she stood alongside him during the unveiling ceremony of a construction project in Pyongyang.

In March 2016, she accompanied Kim Jong Un to a field guidance for nuclear scientists, where he claimed successful miniaturisation of nuclear warheads.

“Kim Yo Jong’s official inclusion in the 30-strong exclusive club of North Korea’s chief policy makers means her role within the regime will be expanded further,” Cheong Seong-chang, senior fellow at the Sejong Institute south of Seoul.

BEHIND THE VEIL

Apart from her age, little is known about Kim Yo Jong. She was publicly identified for the first time in February 2011 when a South Korean TV station caught her at a Eric Clapton concert in Singapore with her other brother, Kim Jong Chol.

The three, who all reportedly went to school in Switzerland, are full blood siblings, born to Kim Jong Il’s fourth partner, Ko Yong Hui.

Kim Jong Chol, the oldest of Kim Jong Il’s sons, does not involve himself in politics, leading a quiet life in Pyongyang where he plays guitar in a band, according to Thae Yong Ho, North Korea’s former deputy ambassador in London who defected to the South.

In 2014, Kim Yo Jong was made vice director of the Workers’ Party’s Propaganda and Agitation Department, which handles ideological messaging through the media, arts and culture.

The position led the U.S. Treasury Department to blacklist her along with six other North Korean officials in January for “severe human rights abuses” and censorship that concealed the regime’s “inhumane and oppressive behavior”.

Last year, South Korea’s former spy chief said Kim Yo Jong was seen “abusing power”, punishing propaganda department executives for “minor mistakes”.

In a North Korean state media photo in January 2015, she was spotted wearing a ring on her fourth finger during a visit to a child care center.

Prime Minister Theresa May made clear in speech she was to deliver to parliament that she hoped her EU partners would make proposals at a new round of talks opening the way to the next stage of negotiations, saying “the ball is in their court”.

But even before she had delivered the speech, an EU spokesman hit back in Brussels, saying “the ball is entirely in the UK court for the rest to happen”.

May is desperate to try to regain some of her authority and refocus on talks to unravel more than 40 years of union after a speech at her party conference last week, marred by a repetitive cough, a prankster and a stage malfunction, left her weaker than ever.

She has so far fought off attempts to unseat her by critics already angry over an ill-judged election when she lost her governing Conservatives’ majority, but her weakness has opened the door for many in her party to challenge her Brexit strategy with just 18 months to go before Britain leaves the EU.

With Brussels quietly preparing for a collapse in the talks and Britain getting ready for what May calls “all eventualities”, some officials and business chiefs worry the country will crash out of the EU without a deal.

Speaking in parliament later on Monday, May will say she is determined to secure a new partnership with the other 27 members of the wealthy political and trade bloc.

“Achieving that partnership will require leadership and flexibility, not just from us but from our friends, the 27 nations of the EU,” she will say, according to excerpts of her speech.

“And as we look forward to the next stage, the ball is in their court. But I am optimistic we will receive a positive response.”

But the EU was clear: “There is a clear sequencing to these talks and there has been so far no solution found on step one, which is the divorce proceedings,” European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas told a regular briefing.

“SEE WHAT HAPPENS”

May, who will host businesses later on Monday to listen to their Brexit concerns, is keen to push the talks beyond a discussion of the divorce to try to offer firms some certainty about future trading conditions.

A report that aerospace manufacturer BAE Systems (BAES.L) is planning to cut more than 1,000 jobs can only add pressure for May to press her case for the EU to move beyond talks on the divorce settlement, the rights of expatriates and the border with EU-member Ireland.

EU negotiators say that while they see no big breakthrough at the summit next week, they may offer May a hand by offering some hope of a shift at the next scheduled meeting in mid-December.

Aides to May have signaled that the prime minister has accepted that her October deadline will not be met despite a speech in Italy last month which attempted to reset the tone of the difficult negotiations.

Her spokesman told reporters: “Let’s see what happens in the next round of talks”.

But some pro-Brexit campaigners are calling on the prime minister to get ready to step away from the talks - underlining the deep divisions in the Conservative Party.

Those differences were aired again on Monday with negative briefings in the local media against finance minister Philip Hammond, who supports prolonging the status quo with the EU for as long as possible, and foreign minister Boris Johnson, who angered some Conservatives for setting his own Brexit red lines.

Some have suggested that May will reshuffle her cabinet, but on Monday her spokesman said she had full confidence in both ministers.

(Reuters) - Ford Motor Co has begun to develop new transportation service applications using a software platform developed by Autonomic Inc, a small Silicon Valley startup.

One of the first such businesses is a “microtransit” service called Non-Emergency Medical Transport, launched this summer by Ford and Michigan-based Beaumont Hospital. Patients can schedule pickups and appointments from a mobile app that was built on the Autonomic software platform, said Sundeep Madra, Autonomic’s chief executive officer and co-founder.

Vehicle manufacturers are exploring a wide array of digital services to supplement their existing businesses, including ride-hailing, car-sharing and delivery of food and goods. However, when it comes to developing consumer-facing smartphone apps and the data systems behind them, automakers have lagged Silicon Valley rivals.

Ford in the past month has announced partnerships with Domino’s and Lyft, using self-driving vehicles developed by Ford and its Argo affiliate. The Dearborn, Michigan automaker is also experimenting with a service called Chariot that offers access to van rides.

Ford CEO Jim Hackett mentioned the automaker’s investment in Autonomic during a presentation to investors last week. The 15-month-old company is developing “an open platform for transportation” on which Ford plans to build new in-vehicle and mobility-related services with a variety of partners, Hackett said.

If Ford elects to build its own ride-hailing or fleet management businesses, the Autonomic software platform could enable digital payment processing and customer identification, as well as directing the flow of data between the vehicle and the customer, according to a source familiar with the automaker’s plans.

Using the Autonomic software platform as a base, along with data from the vehicles, Ford and its partners then could build and charge consumers for products and services, said Marcy Klevorn, Ford president of mobility.

Klevorn cited FordPass as an earlier example of a software platform that has enabled Ford to provide digital services to subscribers, from parking to payments.

In an investor briefing on Tuesday, Jim Farley, Ford president of global markets, said the most important part of the company’s strategy in self-driving vehicles “is a diverse group of revenue streams . . . not just one revenue stream like ride- hailing, but multiple revenue streams,” including providing digital content to vehicle occupants.",Ford taps Silicon Valley startup to build transportation software,https://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCAKBN1CE1S9-OCATC

A range of activists, politicians and media groups oppose the law, which passed by a healthy margin in July and gives agencies the power to gather data covertly from large groups of people at once.

The petition for a referendum must now be submitted to the Voting Commission to vet whether it has met the 300,000 signature threshold.

If it has, the government is obliged to hold a non-binding referendum on whether the law should be upheld, likely together with municipal elections on March 21.

The government argues that the expanded powers are needed for spy agencies to counter threats to national security and their use can be tested by an oversight panel.

The referendum law is itself controversial and may be repealed.

After it was passed in 2015 its first use was to block the Dutch government from ratifying an economic treaty it and other European Union countries had negotiated with Ukraine.

Parts of an industry long used to labour unrest are now contending with community protests that have cut production of the country’s largest mineral export earner, platinum, and may shut some operations down altogether.

At the heart of the conflict are tribal leaders who have royal titles and feudal-style control over the homelands, poor rural areas designated to South Africa’s black majority by its former white minority rulers during apartheid.

Tribal leaders are also key allies of President Jacob Zuma, whose political base has become increasingly rural, and his African National Congress party has drafted a law that would cement their control.

But with protests spreading across the homelands, the communities, mining companies and some within the ANC itself are moving to change what they see as an anachronistic system.

The traditional leaders have acted as intermediaries with companies which have discovered chrome and coal as well as platinum in the homelands and hope to find shale gas. Many locals say they are seeing none of the proceeds.

“If they don’t give us that 175 million rand ($13 million), we are going to shut down the mine,” said Chippa Langa, a leader of the community around the Mogalakwena platinum mine, referring to a community fund set up by Anglo American Platinum (Amplats).

To avoid such an outcome, a leading human rights lawyer is negotiating with the local royal house to allow community representatives more control over the fund.

“We are renegotiating the agreement to make it more accountable,” said the lawyer, Richard Spoor, whose work has included spearheading a class action suit against gold producers over the fatal lung disease silicosis which miners contract.

It is a plan that, if copied elsewhere, would dilute the power of the tribal leaders and could do the same to the ANC, which has ruled South Africa since the end of apartheid in 1994.

But Spoor says he and his legal team, who are acting for the communities rather than the mine, are not undermining tradition.

“Our view is that this more democratic model is far more aligned with traditional law and custom. We don’t regard the current very authoritarian top-down style of chieftanship as consistent with the traditional institution.”

Zolani Mkiva, head of presidency at Contralesa, the umbrella group for South Africa’s traditional leaders, agreed that the African way is bottom up, but said what he called isolated cases involving some mining deals were giving the chiefs a bad name.

“They tend to attract attention and create an impression that this represents the African way of leadership,” he said.

Chris Griffith, chief executive of Amplats, a unit of Anglo American, said the company was fully behind the restructuring of the community trust and was applying the lessons learned to other deals.

“What we are trying to do is get away from some of the previous structures where we felt obliged to pay the money over to the Kgoshi (chief),” Griffiths told Reuters, noting a new-style deal on a chrome project in February. At that project, there have been no protests so far.

LAND RIGHTS

Discontent has not been confined to Mogalakwena, the world’s largest open-pit platinum mine, where Amplats says protests two years ago cost it 8,600 ounces of its annual 200,000-plus ounces of production.

Impala Platinum’s Marula mine says it lost 10,000 ounces of almost 80,000 ounces of production in the last financial year to community protests that included road blocks, vehicle stonings and assaults on people reporting for work.

A nearby chrome project it set up with a tribal council - made up of a chief and his aides - has collapsed and Impala says it may soon have to close Marula, which would be the first such shutdown in South Africa linked purely to social upheaval.

Falling platinum prices have multiplied the pressure.

Implats CEO Nico Muller told Reuters the company would not change the structure itself but wanted the two sides to resolve their differences. “The way they apply the proceeds is perceived not to benefit the broader community,” he said.

Around Mogalakwena, set amid rust-tinged rocky outcrops in sweltering latitudes north of Johannesburg, resentment over grinding poverty runs deep.

“I never worked in the mine. I never got benefit, nothing,” said 57-year-old Leg Phalanea as he walked down a dusty street near the mine.

The bill before parliament formalises the current political system in the homelands with a clause allowing traditional councils to enter partnerships with any “body or institution”. It says such deals “must be beneficial to the community represented by such council”, but does not require consultation.

However, Richard Mdakane, an ANC MP who chairs the parliamentary committee on traditional matters, said villagers should have more say. “We are amending many clauses that were there just to make sure that the bill allows community participation in these processes,” he said.

Some in the ANC are seeking to go further by ending the chief’s role as custodians of land now regarded as communal by giving villagers title deeds to the land they plough.

ANC Treasurer Secretary Zweli Mkhize - seen as a contender to replace Zuma as party chief at a December conference where policy positions will also be adopted - told Reuters: “We are discussing this issue. There is a huge discussion about what kind of land tenure we need in the former homelands.”

Tribal power is already ebbing in places such as Mogalakwena. Villagers there have agreed a new trust structure with four trustees: one from Amplats, one independent, and the other two from the royal Mapela clan, to replace a structure dominated by the tribal council.

Former chief Kgabagare Langa, who has been ousted in a dispute, said he is challenging his removal in court. The new chief, or Kgoshi, Hans Langa, said he could not comment on the restructuring as his lawyers were working on it.

Residents say they have received positive signals from the new chief’s camp and Amplats’ Griffith said the company was just waiting for him to settle in.

“It’s clear the new Kgoshi will want to see peace in Mapela,” said Jonathon Manamela, 53, treasurer of the Mapela Executive Committee, a community group involved in the talks. “Our culture believes you are a king because of the people.”

The greenback reached 14-year highs at the start of 2017, but it had spent most of the rest of the year weakening, as weak economic data as well as doubts over U.S. President Donald Trump’s ability to push through tax reforms weighed on the currency.

Since then, though, the dollar has recovered almost 3 percent against a basket of major currencies, on signs that Trump’s tax reform plans could be back on track, and on a firming-up of bets that the Fed will in December hike rates for the third time this year.

The closely watched non-farm payrolls report on Friday showed the first fall in U.S. employment in seven years, but investors reckoned that was down to the temporary effects of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, and focused on the largest gain in U.S. wages since December.

Some strategists, though, said the numbers were not enough to materially shift expectations for the Fed’s tightening path.

“Friday’s wage data were promising but the report was so distorted, I‘m not sure investors can take too much from them,” said Commerzbank currency strategist Esther Reichelt, in Frankfurt.

“I don’t think the market is looking further than the December meeting ... I think we’ll stay around these levels for the time being,” she added.

Data on Friday showed speculators cut their bearish bets on the U.S. dollar in the week up to last Tuesday.

The dollar index - which measures the greenback against a basket of six other major currencies - hit its highest since late July on the numbers, at 94.267. It traded close to that level on Monday, inching down 0.1 percent to 93.701.

Investors were focused on U.S. inflation and retail sales due later in the week, as well as minutes from the Fed’s latest policy meeting.

“The gradual firming of earnings growth supports the Fed’s plans to continue raising rates gradually, although it remains a concern that underlying inflation pressures have slowed this year,” wrote MUFG currency economist Lee Hardman in a note to clients.

Trade was thinned by public holidays in Japan, South Korea and the United States.

The New Zealand dollar touched a four-month low after a final vote count in the country’s tight general election released over the weekend failed to identify a clear winner.

The euro edged up 0.1 percent to $1.1745, up from Friday’s low of $1.1669 - its weakest level since Aug. 17.

Just a day after Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies severed transport links with Qatar over a diplomatic row, bans on Doha’s fleet using regional ports and anchorages threatened to halt some of its exports and disrupt those of liquefied natural gas (LNG).

Traders worried that Riyadh’s allies would refuse to accept LNG shipments from the Gulf state, and that Egypt might even bar tankers carrying Qatari cargoes from using the Suez Canal as they head to Europe and beyond - although Cairo is bound by an international agreement to let them use the waterway.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

U.S. President Donald Trump joined in the dispute on Tuesday, saying leaders he met on a Middle East trip had warned him that Doha was funding “radical ideology”. Qatar vehemently denies the accusations made against it.

Qatar is now unable to load crude oil onto supertankers together with other Gulf-based grades, and price agency S&P Global Platts said it would not automatically include the country in its Middle East price benchmark.

The agency noted that tankers usually combine Qatari shipments with crude from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Oman before heading from the Gulf. “Restrictions on vessels calling into Qatar and associated uncertainty could impact the inherent value of crude loading from Qatar,” it said.

More worryingly, food imports are affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies. Sources said the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already cut exports of white sugar to Qatar. Consumption is traditionally higher during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is currently being observed.

Qatar, which largely depends on food imports for its population of 2.5 million, has assured residents it has taken measures to assure that normal life continues.

However, Maersk (MAERSKb.CO), the world’s biggest container shipping line, said it can no longer transport goods in or out of Qatar.

Containers carrying food and other consumer goods are usually shipped to Qatar via the UAE port of Jebel Ali. A Maersk Line spokesman said: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

Shoppers packed stores in Doha on Monday to stock up. On Tuesday, fresh poultry and some types of milk were in short supply at two supermarkets visited by a Reuters reporter. However, plenty of fruit and vegetables remained on the shelves.

EXCLUSION ZONES

With exclusion zones sweeping into effect, vessels from Qatar are no longer able to dock in the UAE or Saudi Arabia as planned. According to shipping data on Thomson Reuters Eikon, around half a dozen oil, chemical and LNG tankers have had to leave UAE waters or have halted in the open ocean.

Bans on Qatar-linked oil and LNG vessels refueling at the UAE’s port of Fujairah have added to chaos, pushing shippers to find new refueling points at extra cost, industry sources said.

Lying near the Strait of Hormuz, through which ships pass on their way to customers in Asia, the United States or Europe, Fujairah is one of the world’s most important ports for the global energy market.

Qatar, the world’s biggest LNG seller, is moving to send a first batch of LNG tankers as far afield as Singapore and Gibraltar to refuel with Fujairah now off limits. Some trade sources said this could increase costs and delay deliveries to its clients globally.

The UAE’s ban also effectively halts deliveries of LNG produced in Qatar to the Gulf state, trade sources said. Royal Dutch Shell has a deal with the Dubai Supply Authority to deliver up to three LNG cargoes per month, typically sourced from Qatar.

“This shouldn’t affect the spot market though. Shell will simply need to go into its global portfolio and find LNG from elsewhere to send to Dubai. It’s a minor inconvenience,” one LNG trader said.

LNG traders are on high alert for signs of disruption through the Suez Canal. They are tracking the Al Ruwais LNG tanker, which is nearing the waterway and plans to become the first Qatari cargo to pass through since the row erupted.

Cairo has made no official statement. However, a Suez Canal Authority official said that under an international agreement, Cairo allows all ships to pass through except for those from countries at war with Egypt. The Suez Canal does not have the power to prevent Qatari ships from passing, the official added, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Any tanker barred from using the canal would have to sail around Africa, adding a month to shipping times. Such disruption could boost demand for Russian gas, just as Europe is trying to reduce its reliance on such supplies due to disputes with Moscow over its role in the Ukraine crisis.

Another test will be a batch of LNG shipments of Qatari origin being brought by commodity trader Trafigura to Egypt. These are due to arrive at the country’s Ain Sokhna port over the coming days and weeks, trade sources said.

Any sign that state-run importer Egyptian Natural Gas Holding would bar LNG of Qatari origin would probably push up spot prices sharply as middlemen seek alterative supplies.

Last year Qatar produced 60 percent of all LNG imported by Egypt, all of which was brought in by third-party traders such as Trafigura, Glencore and Vitol.

“The biggest impact will be if Egypt tries to restrict vessels coming through the canal or if they ban Qatari LNG from local ports,” a trading source said.

The rift has also hit aluminum exports from a Qatari plant part-owned by Norway’s Norsk Hydro (NHY.OL) as it has lost access to the Jebel Ali port, through which it typically runs exports operations.

Circumventing barriers to customers in Asia, Europe and the United States will take some time, the company said, showing how the diplomatic face-off is inflicting havoc on global supply chains.",Port bans choke Qatar's commodity trade as gas supply worries grow,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gulf-qatar-commodities/port-bans-choke-qatars-commodity-trade-as-gas-supply-worries-grow-idUSKBN18X1Y2

LONDON (Reuters) - Iran promised on Monday to give a “crushing” response if the United States designated its elite Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist group.

The pledge came a week before President Donald Trump announces a final decision on how he wants to contain the Islamic Republic.

He is expected on Oct. 15 to “decertify” a landmark 2015 international deal to curb Iran’s nuclear program, a step that by itself stops short of pulling out of the agreement but gives Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions.

Trump is also expected to designate Iran’s most powerful security force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corp (IRGC) as a terrorist organization, as he rolls out a broader, more hawkish U.S. strategy on Iran.

“We are hopeful that the United States does not make this strategic mistake,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi was quoted as saying by the state news agency IRNA.

“If they do, Iran’s reaction would be firm, decisive and crushing and the United States should bear all its consequences,” he told a news conference reported by IRNA.

Individuals and entities associated with the IRGC are already on the U.S. list of foreign terrorist organizations, but the organization as a whole is not.

IRGC commander Mohammad Ali Jafari said on Sunday, “If the news is correct about the stupidity of the American government in considering the Revolutionary Guards a terrorist group, then the Revolutionary Guards will consider the American army to be like Islamic State all around the world.”

Jafari also said that additional sanctions would end chances for future dialogue with the United States and that the Americans would have to move their regional bases outside the 2,000 km (1,250 mile) range of IRGC’s missiles.

WARY EUROPE

U.S. sanctions on the IRGC could affect conflicts in Iraq and Syria, where Tehran and Washington both support warring parties that oppose the Islamic State militant group (IS).

France said on Monday it was worried that classifying the IRGC as a terrorist group could exacerbate tensions in the region.

Germany said it was worried Trump would decide Iran is not respecting the nuclear deal, negotiated under his predecessor Barack Obama, and fears such a step will worsen insecurity in the Middle East.

A U.S. pullout could unravel an accord seen by supporters as vital to preventing a Middle East arms race and tamping down regional tensions, since it limits Iran’s ability to enrich uranium for nuclear fuel in exchange for the lifting of sanctions that damaged its oil-based economy.

The U.N. nuclear watchdog’s inspectors have repeatedly declared Iran in compliance with the terms of the nuclear deal.

Trump called Iran “a corrupt dictatorship” during his first speech to the U.N. General Assembly and said the nuclear deal was “the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into”.

The other five world powers in the deal were Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China.

The prospect of the United States reneging on the agreement has worried other partners that helped negotiate it.

The Kremlin said that any U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal would have “negative consequences.”

British Prime Minister Theresa May, who supports the nuclear pact, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who opposes it, agreed in a phone call on Monday that they need to be “clear-eyed” about the threat Iran poses to the Middle East.

“They agreed that ... the international community should continue working together to push back against Iran’s destabilizing regional activity,” May’s spokesman said.

“MALIGN ACTIVITIES”

Despite the nuclear deal, Washington still maintains its own more limited sanctions on Iran over its ballistic missile program and over accusations Tehran supports terrorism.

Iran says it is developing missiles solely for defensive purposes and denies involvement in terrorism.

The Trump administration aims to put more pressure on the IRGC, especially over recent missile tests and what Washington has called its “malign activities” across the Middle East.

The U.S. government imposed sanctions in July on 18 entities and people for supporting the IRGC in developing drones and military equipment. In August, Congress overwhelmingly approved the “Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act” which imposed new sanctions on Iran for its ballistic missile program, as well as sanctions on Russia and North Korea.

In an interview aired on Saturday night, Trump accused Iran of “funding North Korea” and “doing things with North Korea that are totally inappropriate”.

Qasemi, Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman, said the U.S. accusations were “baseless”. He added, “Israel and some specific countries are raising these accusations to create Iranophobia.”",Iran promises 'crushing' response if U.S. designates Guards a terrorist group,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-usa-irgc/iran-promises-crushing-response-if-u-s-designates-guards-a-terrorist-group-idUSKBN1CE0M2

RAQQA, Syria (Reuters) - In the gutted four-storey building that he and five other U.S.-backed fighters have turned into a frontline fortress, Babel can peer out at Islamic State positions just 150 meters away.

The jihadist militants expected to make a last stand for this stronghold of their self-proclaimed caliphate are cornered and desperate here in Raqqa, the city on the Euphrates river that has served as their de-facto Syrian capital since 2014.

“Let Daesh come - we’re ready for them. We have explosives to drop downstairs,” said Babel, which is his nom de guerre. He and his fellow members of the U.S.-backed Syrian Defense Forces have occupied the frontline building for three weeks and are now preparing for a final showdown with Islamic State, the group also known as ISIS, ISIL or Daesh.

The SDF fighters’ position is well prepared in case the cornered IS militants attempt an attack. The front porch steps have been demolished, leaving a drop to the basement that can be crossed only by climbing a section of iron fence - a makeshift ladder, which the defenders can pull up. Inside, plastic bottles have been strewn across the floor to squeak when stepped on and alert them to intruders.

After months of intense fighting and heavy U.S. bombardment, the SDF have surrounded Islamic State militants in a small part of the city. As the Kurdish and Arab militias of the SDF close in and U.S.-led air raids increase, they expect fierce fighting to mark the final stages of the campaign.

“Daesh regularly launch small raids, even behind our position. Yesterday they attacked the building opposite and tried to push toward us. We killed a few and they retreated to the hospital,” Babel said.

SDF units have a clear view over the Raqqa hospital, one of Islamic State’s last strongholds in the city, from a line of buildings they occupy to its northwest. Apartment blocks between them and the hospital have been flattened by air strikes.

Commanders say the hospital and a nearby stadium, where the jihadists are said to be holding civilian hostages, will be where they make their last stand.

Babel’s unit are holding the front line ahead of an anticipated final push, firing at militants whenever they can spot them.

“The last few nights they’ve been shining spotlights from the hospital towards our lines, so we can’t really see,” he said.

Another fighter in the unit said sniper fire from Islamic State had recently reduced, possibly as a means of conserving ammunition for more intense fighting to come.

SURRENDER OR DIE

An SDF field commander said on Sunday assaults were to begin soon as part of a final push against Islamic State, focused initially on surrounding the stadium. The hospital is already encircled.

“Daesh is amassing, preparing to fight. This is the last stage, so they’ll resist and then surrender or die,” the commander who gave his name as Ardal Raqqa said.

U.S. coalition spokesman Ryan Dillon was more cautious about calling the current stage of the offensive a final assault.

“Whether this is the final assault or an assault, I won’t characterize it either way,” Dillon said by phone. The fight was “concentrated around the complex which was the national hospital and the stadium,” he said.

The SDF predicted ahead of a major push in June that it could take just weeks to drive Islamic State out of Raqqa. That has proven overly optimistic, with the militants holding out for months so far.

Their use of civilians for cover, tunnels to launch counter attacks, snipers and countless booby traps have slowed SDF advances.

“Many are being wounded, especially by snipers. Daesh snipers often shoot to wound, not to kill, so they can target whoever comes to save an injured comrade,” Babel said.

One shaken SDF fighter in a nearby base last week showed cuts on his face from where a sniper bullet had ricocheted.

Both the U.S. spokesman Dillon and the SDF fighter Babel said that some Islamic State fighters were surrendering.

“The other day a Saudi fighter escaped and handed himself over. The guys who surrender usually have families,” Babel said.

Interrogations of surrendering militants revealed IS had dug a tunnel between the hospital and stadium, he said.

Dillon said several IS militants and leaders had surrendered in recent weeks. “It is a growing trend,” he said.

At the front line, SDF fighters said morale was high. One fighter belted pop music to other units over his walkie talkie.

“Hopefully we’ll be done soon,” Babel said.",Fighters on Raqqa front line brace for final showdown with Islamic State,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-mideast-crisis-syria-raqqa/fighters-on-raqqa-front-line-brace-for-final-showdown-with-islamic-state-idUKKBN1CE1MF

PARIS (Reuters) - Apple (AAPL.O) boss Tim Cook went out of his way on Monday to single out a small French firm behind innovative features in the latest iPhones ahead of meeting with President Emmanuel Macron, who has called for a tougher line on technology company taxes.

The Apple chief executive paid a surprise visit to Eldim, a Normandy-based firm that develops optical technology used in the facial recognition system inside new top-of-the-line iPhone X smartphones due out next month. Prices start at $999.

Face ID, as the iPhone X feature is known, will replace the fingerprint sensor for unlocking the phone and features in Apple’s campaign to distinguish the phone from rival devices.

“Bravo for your work!”, Cook said on his official Twitter account in French. A picture of him chatting with Eldim employees was also posted. He also hailed the contributions of French start-ups on Twitter while on his way to a scheduled meeting with Macron on Monday afternoon.

The meeting between the French president and Apple CEO follows calls by Macron last week for Apple and other tech companies such as Amazon.com to pay more in taxes in Europe.

“Bravo to Europe for acting with determination to get tax rules and justice respected,” Macron said in a tweet last week praising European Union officials for taking member-state Ireland to court to reclaim 13 billion euros ($15.26 billion) in back taxes from Apple.

Eldim, located outside Caen, near the northern coast of France, had quietly worked with Apple on research projects for nearly a decade before gaining recognition for its optical work on behalf of Apple, the world’s most highly valued company.

“They (Eldim) certainly have a top-notch technology,” said industry analyst Thomas Husson of Forrester Research. “Facial recognition is one of iPhone X’s differentiating features.”

Apple is normally highly secretive about the suppliers it uses to develop new phones, computers and other devices.

A spokeswoman for Apple declined to comment.

(Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc said on Monday it would speed up the process for in-store returns of items bought on its website, just ahead of the busy holiday season, as it looks to steal a march on e-commerce giant Amazon.com.

Wal-Mart has been increasingly using its more than 4,700 stores to provide hassle-free shopping on its website - by offering services that allow customers to pick up products ordered online as well as make returns in store.

The new service aims to drastically reduce the time taken to return an item bought online, as the company battles Amazon’s aggressive moves to establish its own brick-and-mortar presence.

Under Wal-Mart’s Mobile Express Returns, starting in early November, customers can, for the first time, use the retailer’s app to initiate a return.

The process can then be completed at “express” lanes in a store by scanning a QR code and handing over the item, eliminating the need to wait in queues.

The new process reduces the time taken for returning products at stores to as little as 30 seconds from five minutes previously, said Daniel Eckert, head of Wal-Mart’s U.S. services and digital acceleration business.

The new returns process also allows customers to get refunds as soon as the next day. Some items, including shampoo and color cosmetics, will be eligible for instant refunds even without the products being returned in store, then company said.

Wal-Mart said it planned to extend the new process to items bought in its stores by early next year, and is working on a similar returns policy for items bought from third-party sellers on Walmart.com.

Wal-Mart is investing $2 billion into its online business and has snapped up a number of popular online retailers since last year, including Jet.com.

Influential in the field of behavioral economics, his research showed how traits such as lack of self-control and fear of losing what you already have prompt decisions that may not have the best outcome in the longer term.

“I think the most important impact (of my research) is the recognition that economic agents are human and economic models have to incorporate that,” Thaler, a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, said in call broadcast at the Nobel news conference.

Awarding the 9 million Swedish crown ($1.1 million) prize, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said: “Richard Thaler’s contributions have built a bridge between the economic and psychological analyses of individual decision-making.”

“His empirical findings and theoretical insights have been instrumental in creating the new and rapidly expanding field of behavioral economics, which has had a profound impact on many areas of economic research and policy.”

Thaler brought to prominence the idea of “nudge” economics, where individuals are subtly guided toward beneficial behaviors without heavy-handed compulsion, the theme of a 2008 book he co-wrote which caught the eye of policymakers around the world.

In researching how self-control - or the lack of it - Thaler touched on an age-old problem: why New Year’s resolutions to change aspects of your life are notoriously hard to keep.

The issue has relevance for economics as individuals’ tendency to fall prey to temptation often negatively affects plans to, for instance, save for retirement.

Together with Professor Cass Sunstein, he argued that society - while maintaining freedom of choice - should actively try to guide individuals in the right direction.

Their book, titled ‘Nudge: Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth, and Happiness’ became popular with some western politicians seeking ways to encourage their citizens to save and live healthily, without incurring voters’ wrath for raising taxes or banning behavior outright.

“This has also been used in public pension systems in the United States and the general idea of ‘nudging’ ... has made a breakthrough in public policy making,” Torsten Persson, economics prize committee member, told Reuters.

“There’s also a nudging unit for the UK government, there’s one for the Australian government, it even affects the Swedish government when they think about these things.”’

David Laibson, chair of Harvard University’s economics department, said many of Thaler’s theories have been widely applied by business and government, aiming to get individuals to do a range of actions such as paying parking tickets and getting flu shots.

“If you live in a developed country, there’s some firm or entity that has read these ideas and started to affect your life,” Laibson said.

Influential in academic circles, the movie-going public may have noticed Thaler make a brief cameo in the 2015 film “The Big Short”, explaining the so-called “hot-hand fallacy” where past success is expected to also warrant success in the future, with pop star Selena Gomez.

Asked how he would spend his prize money, Thaler said:

“I will spend it as irrationally as possible.”

MANY AMERICANS, NO WOMEN

The economics prize, officially called the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, was established in 1968. It was not part of the original group of awards set out in dynamite tycoon Nobel’s 1895 will.

Economy is the last of this year’s Nobels, with prizes for physiology or medicine, physics, chemistry, literature and peace awarded last week.

The United States has dominated the economics prize, with American economists accounting for roughly half of laureates since the inception of the award. Indeed, between 2000 and 2013, U.S. academics won or shared the prize every year.

While Americans have dominated the Nobel science and economics prizes, another category of researchers - women - have been few and far between. Indeed only one women - Elinor Ostrom in 2009 - has won the economics prize to date, and not a single individual women won any Nobel award in 2017.

“We are disappointed looking in a larger perspective that there aren’t more women who have been rewarded,” the Academy’s secretary general Goran Hansson said.

He said the Academy would hold a conference to discuss the issue and nominators will be asked to identify women scientists for recognition and also consider ethnic and geographic diversity.

“We are concerned, we are taking measures. I hope that in five years, ten years, we will see a very different distribution,” Hansson said.",We're all human: 'Nudge' theorist Thaler wins economics Nobel,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1CE0X5-OCATP

With post-Maria Puerto Rico the latest example of that trope, it’s time for a better understanding of how disaster management works.

A disaster destroys in hours infrastructure that took decades to build. Millions of people lose the services that separate a middle-class suburb from an impoverished slum – clean water, sewers, power, hospitals, roads. And Maria was the strongest storm to strike the area in 80 years.

Meanwhile, the media tends to focus on drama and controversy. They often overplay the story via anecdotal reporting (“Here’s Mrs. Hernandez without electricity,” says the reporter [pause], “with no help in sight”) and underplay the work being done, especially at the beginning of the response where progress is hard to see. First responders on laptops methodically solving supply problems are not very mediagenic, after all.

At the moment of any disaster, needs are at 100 percent while the response is at a zero point. The response starts in deficit. It always looks grim, especially to participants and outside observers unfamiliar with the process. They want what is a marathon to play out like a sprint.

In dealing with a major disaster, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the military follow a standard playbook. I know, I worked with both on and off for two decades while with the State Department. I trained with them, and was on the ground for relief efforts after the 1995 Kobe, Japan earthquake (more than 6,000 dead) and 2004 Asian tsunami (280,000 dead.) I worked the Washington DC-end of many other disasters. I read after-action reporting from 20-30 other such events.

The critical initial step is a needs assessment, from which everything else flows. Everyone wants to jump in and do something, but responders need time to visit sites, confer with local officials, and determine what is needed and where the needs are greatest. It is a slow process in a chaotic environment, delayed by weather, roads, and communications. From the outside it can look like nothing is being done; Mrs. Hernandez still doesn’t have electricity even as helicopters are flying around, apparently ignoring her!

The needs assessment gets the right help to the right places in order of priority. As an example, I was part of a liaison team with the American Navy at Phuket, Thailand following the Asian tsunami of 2005. Without any local input, the U.S. first helicopters brought in huge fresh water bladders. It turned out most of the water was unneeded; the city had warehouses full of the bottled version.

It took a day for us to track down, but the most urgent need the Navy could address was a buildup of medical waste at local hospitals. Waste pre-disaster was trucked out daily; the tsunami wrecked the roads, and so boxes of soiled bandages and infected sharps accumulated. When American resources turned to help dispose of that, hospitals were able to run at peak capacity. Lives were saved. The water bladders lay abandoned in parking lots around town.

Other decisions that can flow from a needs assessment might include restoring power to one school to shelter 50 families before fixing 50 individual homes. It can mean blocking people from calling internationally so limited cell capacity can be directed to local emergency calls. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, for example, set as a priority reopening dialysis centers across Puerto Rico. Somebody else didn’t get helped first to make that possible.

At the early-to-intermediate stages of a disaster response people in less affected areas will wait in long lines for supplies. It looks bad on TV, but can actually mean the system is working, as help was directed to a higher priority. It takes good reporting to know if that’s the case. Instead, progress is often too quickly defined as “make everything back to the way it was before the storm.”

The military plays a key role in disaster response. The problem is Americans are conditioned to believe there are unlimited resources of all types, instantly movable across notable distances.

Military units tend to have war fighting as their primary job, and most are somewhere doing that, or training to do that. Shifting to a disaster mission can happen quickly but not instantly. It’s also essential to gather people with the right skills – electrical engineers, teams that desalinate sea water for drinking, and sewage crews (3.4 million people’s waste festering with fecal-borne disease is a dreaded secondary killer in this disaster.)

Much mockery has been directed at Trump’s statement about Puerto Rico being an island, surrounded by “big water.” His phrasing was callous, but the fact Puerto Rico is an island is significant. Unlike Texas or Florida, no one can self-evacuate, by car or even on foot. Same for incoming aid. Everything must travel by plane, or, more likely, ship.

Puerto Ricans now need some two million gallons of fresh water a day. A gallon weighs about eight pounds, so that’s 16 million pounds of water. A C-130 cargo plane can carry some 42,000 pounds. So that’s 380 flights a day, every day, just for water. There are bigger aircraft, but the bottom line is always the same: you simply have to move the epic quantities required to respond to an epic island disaster by ship to a port, then inland by truck.

That last step, moving supplies from a port (or airport) to those who need them is known as the “last mile” problem. It haunts every disaster response.

Success with the last mile depends on local infrastructure. If it was neglected before the disaster, it will never be better (and often worse) during the disaster response. Next comes the need for trucks, fuel for those trucks, drivers, security, and personnel and equipment to offload the ships and load the vehicles. If you’re missing one link in the chain, the aid does not move.

These are tough realities, not excuses for why more hasn’t been done for desperate people. It can be a complex, methodical process, addressing a single problem (get water to that village) as a cascading string of nested problems. While the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s remark that Puerto Rico relief is the “most logistically challenging event” the United States has ever faced seems exaggerated, it does underscore the size of the job at hand.

So don’t be distracted by the apocalyptic tweets between Trump and his critics; they exist independent of the ground truth. Because while no response is ever fast and robust enough, the systemic breakdowns that hit New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina have largely been fixed, well-before Trump even took office.

Responses are always imperfect; lack of drinking water remains a critical issue. The loss of life in Puerto Rico is sure to rise from 16, as rescuers reach more remote areas. For Harvey, the death toll was at least 70, Irma 72. Katrina saw 1,836 fatalities with over 700 people still missing.

But a tipping point will take place, where adequate services are restored and people will start to receive the help they need. Problems will reduce from regions without power to villages without power to an isolated home without power. The principles of disaster management should not be lost in the politics surrounding events in Puerto Rico. Everything else right now seems to be just Twitter wars.","Commentary: For hurricane-hit Puerto Rico, an insider’s guide to disaster management",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-vanburen-disaster-commentary/commentary-for-hurricane-hit-puerto-rico-an-insiders-guide-to-disaster-management-idUSKCN1C805X

RAQQA, Syria (Reuters) - In the gutted four-storey building that he and five other U.S.-backed fighters have turned into a frontline fortress, Babel can peer out at Islamic State positions just 150 meters away.

The jihadist militants expected to make a last stand for this stronghold of their self-proclaimed caliphate are cornered and desperate here in Raqqa, the city on the Euphrates river that has served as their de-facto Syrian capital since 2014.

“Let Daesh come - we’re ready for them. We have explosives to drop downstairs,” said Babel, which is his nom de guerre. He and his fellow members of the U.S.-backed Syrian Defense Forces have occupied the frontline building for three weeks and are now preparing for a final showdown with Islamic State, the group also known as ISIS, ISIL or Daesh.

The SDF fighters’ position is well prepared in case the cornered IS militants attempt an attack. The front porch steps have been demolished, leaving a drop to the basement that can be crossed only by climbing a section of iron fence - a makeshift ladder, which the defenders can pull up. Inside, plastic bottles have been strewn across the floor to squeak when stepped on and alert them to intruders.

After months of intense fighting and heavy U.S. bombardment, the SDF have surrounded Islamic State militants in a small part of the city. As the Kurdish and Arab militias of the SDF close in and U.S.-led air raids increase, they expect fierce fighting to mark the final stages of the campaign.

“Daesh regularly launch small raids, even behind our position. Yesterday they attacked the building opposite and tried to push toward us. We killed a few and they retreated to the hospital,” Babel said.

SDF units have a clear view over the Raqqa hospital, one of Islamic State’s last strongholds in the city, from a line of buildings they occupy to its northwest. Apartment blocks between them and the hospital have been flattened by air strikes.

Commanders say the hospital and a nearby stadium, where the jihadists are said to be holding civilian hostages, will be where they make their last stand.

Babel’s unit are holding the front line ahead of an anticipated final push, firing at militants whenever they can spot them.

“The last few nights they’ve been shining spotlights from the hospital towards our lines, so we can’t really see,” he said.

Another fighter in the unit said sniper fire from Islamic State had recently reduced, possibly as a means of conserving ammunition for more intense fighting to come.

SURRENDER OR DIE

An SDF field commander said on Sunday assaults were to begin soon as part of a final push against Islamic State, focused initially on surrounding the stadium. The hospital is already encircled.

“Daesh is amassing, preparing to fight. This is the last stage, so they’ll resist and then surrender or die,” the commander who gave his name as Ardal Raqqa said.

U.S. coalition spokesman Ryan Dillon was more cautious about calling the current stage of the offensive a final assault.

“Whether this is the final assault or an assault, I won’t characterize it either way,” Dillon said by phone. The fight was “concentrated around the complex which was the national hospital and the stadium,” he said.

The SDF predicted ahead of a major push in June that it could take just weeks to drive Islamic State out of Raqqa. That has proven overly optimistic, with the militants holding out for months so far.

Their use of civilians for cover, tunnels to launch counter attacks, snipers and countless booby traps have slowed SDF advances.

“Many are being wounded, especially by snipers. Daesh snipers often shoot to wound, not to kill, so they can target whoever comes to save an injured comrade,” Babel said.

One shaken SDF fighter in a nearby base last week showed cuts on his face from where a sniper bullet had ricocheted.

Both the U.S. spokesman Dillon and the SDF fighter Babel said that some Islamic State fighters were surrendering.

“The other day a Saudi fighter escaped and handed himself over. The guys who surrender usually have families,” Babel said.

Interrogations of surrendering militants revealed IS had dug a tunnel between the hospital and stadium, he said.

Dillon said several IS militants and leaders had surrendered in recent weeks. “It is a growing trend,” he said.

At the front line, SDF fighters said morale was high. One fighter belted pop music to other units over his walkie talkie.

“Hopefully we’ll be done soon,” Babel said.",Fighters on Raqqa front line brace for final showdown with Islamic State,https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1CE1MF

SINGAPORE/LONDON (Reuters) - When OPEC leader Saudi Arabia pledged in May to do “whatever it takes” to defend world oil prices, it didn’t expect the market to be testing its resolve just one month later.

As the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended oil production cuts, oil prices fell 18 percent in just 20 days. OPEC members appear determined not to rush into deeper output curbs despite market pressure.

Oil traders have chosen to ignore bullish news for prices - including a long-awaited decline in U.S. oil stocks on Wednesday - and focused instead on negative factors such as a stubborn global glut.

As a result, the oil market posted its worst performance in the first six months in two decades effectively signaling its refusal to accept the effectiveness of the OPEC statement and its desire for further production cuts.

The “whatever it takes” pledge was made by Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur in early May, echoing a promise by European central banker Mario Draghi five years ago during his successful fight to defend the euro.

“You cannot fight the Federal Reserve but you can fight OPEC,” said Bob McNally, President of the Rapidan Group, a Washington-based energy market and policy consultant. “Somebody at OPEC has to cut further but no one is willing.”

The oil price decline and Saudi’s ability to defend prices also puts in the spotlight Saudi Arabia’s future king, 31-year-old Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who on Wednesday was made next in line to the throne by his father King Salman.

Prince Mohammed has been the ultimate Saudi energy decision-maker in the last two years and his strategy has shifted from orders to raise oil production to defend OPEC market share to curbing output to prop up prices.

WAITING IT OUT

Falih and other OPEC ministers and officials have said the cartel would not rush to deepen production cuts from the current four percent to arrest the price decline.

They said the group would rather wait until existing joint cuts with non-OPEC Russia finally result in a global stocks decline during the third quarter when demand for crude oil is usually strong.

OPEC and Russian sources also told Reuters there were few signs the group is preparing any extraordinary action ahead of a joint ministerial monitoring committee meeting in Russia at the end of July.

“We are in discussions with OPEC members to prepare ourselves for a new decision,” Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Wednesday. “But making decisions in this organization is very difficult because any decision will mean production cuts for the members,” he added.

An oil price surge at the end of the last decade and the start of this one spurred multiple oil production projects around the world, including from U.S. shale formations, resulting in global oversupply which sent prices tumbling from $120 per barrel in 2014 to below $30 per barrel last year.

OPEC and Russia tried to stabilize prices with cuts at around $50-$60 per barrel, but this week Brent prices fell toward $44 per barrel on persistent oversupply worries.

Traders and investors have raised their bets that the oil price will remain under pressure. The U.S. crude options market shows that the largest change since the OPEC meeting in holdings of derivatives maturing in December this year is in put, or sell, options at $45 a barrel.

Open interest, which shows the number of contracts that are open that have been traded but not yet liquidated, has risen by more than 5,000 lots in the last month to nearly 38,000 lots, equivalent to 38 million barrels of oil.

SHALE RETURNS AT FULL FORCE

""Global supply outages have fallen to a new low not seen in years. U.S. shale is returning at full force ... (and there are) high storage levels afloat and on land,"" said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for oil trading company Strong Petroleum.

The United States is not part of any supply reduction deals and is expected to increase production from shale formations by up to one million barrels per day or almost 10 percent of the country’s total crude output.

Berentsen said that unless OPEC deepened cuts or there was a large, unexpected production stoppage, prices will remain low.

“A deeper cut could arrest the price decline but OPEC needs to actually do it rather than just talk about it,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader.

OPEC sources have said that one of the options could be to include sooner rather than later OPEC members Nigeria and Libya in output cuts after their production grew steeply in recent months from levels previously depressed by unrest. At the moment Nigeria and Libya are exempt from the production cuts agreement.

MISTAKES OF THE PAST

Saudi Arabia, which has the cheapest production costs in the world, has repeatedly said it had learned from its mistakes of the past, when it drastically cut production in the 1980s to prop up prices but lost market share to rivals.

Earlier this year, Saudi officials told top independent U.S. oil firms in a closed-door meeting they should not assume OPEC would extend curbs to offset rising U.S. output.

Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA, said OPEC’s other choice would be to allow oil prices to drop to levels at which even “the newly slimline U.S. shale industry struggles to break even at”.

That may not be far off as prices approach cost levels for U.S. shale drillers, who are responsible for a rise in production that has undermined OPEC efforts.

“For the (Bakken shale), wells completed in 2016-2017, wellhead break-evens average around $38 per barrel,” said consultancy Rystad Energy, which specialises in exploration and production.

Besides closely following production patterns of its rivals, OPEC needs to keep a keen eye on global demand.

While major forecasters including the International Energy Agency sees global oil demand growing by a healthy 1.5 percent next year, there are signs growth is slowing in major Asian hubs China and India, the engines of demand growth in recent years.",Traders test OPEC 'whatever it takes' resolve to defend oil price,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-markets-slump/traders-test-opec-whatever-it-takes-resolve-to-defend-oil-price-idUSKBN19D1PX

PARIS (Reuters) - Apple (AAPL.O) boss Tim Cook went out of his way on Monday to single out a small French firm behind innovative features in the latest iPhones ahead of meeting with President Emmanuel Macron, who has called for a tougher line on technology company taxes.

The Apple chief executive paid a surprise visit to Eldim, a Normandy-based firm that develops optical technology used in the facial recognition system inside new top-of-the-line iPhone X smartphones due out next month. Prices start at $999.

Face ID, as the iPhone X feature is known, will replace the fingerprint sensor for unlocking the phone and features in Apple’s campaign to distinguish the phone from rival devices.

“Bravo for your work!”, Cook said on his official Twitter account in French. A picture of him chatting with Eldim employees was also posted. He also hailed the contributions of French start-ups on Twitter while on his way to a scheduled meeting with Macron on Monday afternoon.

The meeting between the French president and Apple CEO follows calls by Macron last week for Apple and other tech companies such as Amazon.com to pay more in taxes in Europe.

“Bravo to Europe for acting with determination to get tax rules and justice respected,” Macron said in a tweet last week praising European Union officials for taking member-state Ireland to court to reclaim 13 billion euros ($15.26 billion) in back taxes from Apple.

Eldim, located outside Caen, near the northern coast of France, had quietly worked with Apple on research projects for nearly a decade before gaining recognition for its optical work on behalf of Apple, the world’s most highly valued company.

“They (Eldim) certainly have a top-notch technology,” said industry analyst Thomas Husson of Forrester Research. “Facial recognition is one of iPhone X’s differentiating features.”

Apple is normally highly secretive about the suppliers it uses to develop new phones, computers and other devices.

A spokeswoman for Apple declined to comment.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian wage growth accelerated at its fastest pace in over a year in September, keeping alive the possibility that the Bank of Canada could hike interest rates for a third time by the end of the year.

Average hourly wages for permanent employees rose 2.2 percent last month from a year ago, Statistics Canada said in its jobs report on Friday.

The acceleration, which was the fastest annual pace since June 2016, suggested there may be a recovery in wage growth, which has been weak despite strong labor market gains over the past year and is being closely watched by the Bank of Canada.

Analysts said the growth in wages was more encouraging than September’s increase of 10,000 jobs, which was below forecasts and pointed to a cooling economy over the second half of the year.

The Bank of Canada has raised interest rates twice this year, spurred by strong economic growth that has put Canada at the top of the Group of Seven nations.

While expectations for a third rate hike later this month have dwindled following cautious comments from policymakers, markets placed the odds of an increase at 18 percent after the jobs report, compared to 12.2 percent before.

“I think this is going to reinforce the Bank of Canada’s expectations that we’re spiraling upward on wage and price pressures in the Canadian economy,” said Derek Holt, vice president of economics at Scotiabank.

Although Holt continues to expect a hike at the central bank’s meeting in December, he said the possibility of an October increase was still in play.

Markets put the odds of a December hike at 64.3 percent.

The Canadian dollar touched a five-week low against its U.S. counterpart immediately after the Canadian jobs report before recovering some losses to trade little changed.

Jimmy Jean, senior economist at Desjardins Capital Markets, said the wage growth was “a pretty rapid improvement,” though he did not expect it to move the needle on the October rate decision.

“It is a sign that the job market is tightening,” Jean said.

September’s job gains were driven by the public sector, which added 26,200 positions, while the private sector shed 15,500 jobs. The unemployment rate held steady at 6.2 percent as the number of people looking for work edged down.

The education sector led the way up, adding 20,000 positions, while the public administration field added 4,500 jobs.

In a list of “principles” laid out in documents released by the White House, the Trump administration also pressed for a crackdown on unaccompanied minors who enter the United States, many of them from Central America.

The plan, which was delivered to leaders in Congress on Sunday night, drew a swift rebuke from Democrats, who are seeking a legislative fix for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) programme that Trump ended last month.

“The administration can’t be serious about compromise or helping the Dreamers if they begin with a list that is anathema to the Dreamers, to the immigrant community and to the vast majority of Americans,” said House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer.

“The list includes the wall, which was explicitly ruled out of the negotiations. If the president was serious about protecting the Dreamers, his staff has not made a good faith effort to do so,” they said in a statement.

The Trump administration wants the wish list to guide immigration reform in Congress and accompany a bill to replace DACA, the Obama-era programme that protected nearly 800,000 “Dreamers” from deportation and allowed them to secure work permits.

If enacted, the White House priorities could result in the deportation of Dreamers’ parents.

The proposals emphasise immigration enforcement and include a request for funds to hire 370 more immigration judges, 1,000 attorneys for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, 300 federal prosecutors and 10,000 additional ICE agents to enforce immigration laws.

“These priorities are essential to mitigate the legal and economic consequences of any grant of status to DACA recipients,” Trump’s legislative affairs director, Marc Short, told reporters on a conference call. The White House made clear it would not be pushing for Dreamers to achieve U.S. citizenship, only legal status, in a potential deal.

Trump told Congress it had six months to come up with legislation to help Dreamers, who are a fraction of the 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States, most of whom are Hispanic.

The documents call for tighter standards for those seeking U.S. asylum, denial of federal grants to “sanctuary cities” that serve as refuges for illegal immigrants, and a requirement that employers use an electronic verification system known as “E-Verify” to keep illegal immigrants from securing jobs.

HARD LINE

Trump campaigned for president on a pledge to toughen immigration policies and build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. He vowed repeatedly that Mexico would pay for the wall, but began prodding Congress earlier this year to approve funding. Mexico has said it will not pay for the wall.

Trump’s suggestion after a meeting with Schumer and Pelosi that wall funding would not have to be part of a DACA fix alarmed some of his supporters.

The White House sees the wall as a priority but has indicated that it could be established as part of a DACA bill or through other legislative avenues. Administration officials said that legislation that did not include all of the priorities on the list would not necessarily trigger a presidential veto.

Republicans in Congress have introduced several bills that include aspects of Trump’s ideas, but many Democrats and immigration groups see the proposals as too harsh.

“The Trump administration has put forth a serious proposal to address the enforcement of our immigration laws and border security,“ said Republican House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte in a statement. ”We cannot fix the DACA problem without fixing all of the issues that led to the underlying problem of illegal immigration in the first place.”

The White House’s wish list targets the flow of unaccompanied minors into the United States. It would require such children to be treated the same, regardless of their countries of origin “so long as they are not victims of human trafficking and can be safely returned home or removed to safe third countries,” the White House documents said.

It would expand the list of “inadmissible aliens” to include members of gangs, those who have been convicted of an aggravated felony, and former spouses and children of drug and human traffickers if they receive benefits from such behaviour.

The plan also seeks to reduce the number of people who overstay their visas and reform how green cards that establish legal permanent residents are granted.

Trump’s White House has so far not been able to achieve a major legislative victory, casting doubt on the potential for a breakthrough on immigration reform, which Republican and Democratic presidents have tried before without success.

Since Trump took office in January, his fellow Republicans have failed to repeal and replace former Democratic President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, and a White House plan for tax reform needs more support.","Trump seeks border wall, crackdown on unaccompanied minors for 'Dreamer' deal",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-immigration-exclusive/trump-seeks-border-wall-crackdown-on-unaccompanied-minors-for-dreamer-deal-idUKKBN1CD10M

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s prime minister sees scope for further reform of the country’s energy sector and has received “focused suggestions” from some of the world’s leading energy companies, the office of the premier said on Monday.

Executives from companies including Rosneft, BP, Exxon Mobil, Reliance Industries, Saudi Aramco, Royal Dutch Shell, Vedanta, Schlumberger and Halliburton met Modi as the industry gathered in New Delhi for the three-day India Energy Forum, which finishes on Tuesday.

“Participants appreciated the pace and drive with which Prime Minister Modi has brought about reform in the energy sector,” Modi’s office said in a statement after the meeting.

“Subjects such as the need for a unified energy policy, contract frameworks and arrangements, requirement of seismic data sets, encouragement for biofuels, improving gas supply, setting up of a gas hub and regulatory issues came up for discussion.”

The statement said that many suggestions at the last meeting in 2016 have helped guide Indian policy-making and that Modi said he appreciated the “focused suggestions” made this year and that “scope for reform in many areas still exists”.

Modi was quoted as saying he looked forward to “various opportunities” for cooperation between India and Saudi Arabia, the second biggest oil exporter to the country behind Iraq.

State-run Saudi Aramco, which on Sunday launched a new office near New Delhi, is in talks with several Indian refiners for a possible joint venture by next year.

Its Chief Executive Amin Nasser told the conference after the Modi meeting that India’s oil demand would double by 2040 to about 10 million barrels per day, making it the world’s largest market for the fuel and a priority for the company.

In the meeting, Modi thanked Russian President Vladimir Putin and Rosneft for their support to India’s energy sector.

In another vote of confidence for India’s energy sector, BP and Reliance have previously said they would jointly invest $6 billion to boost India’s gas output. A BP executive said on Monday that the company was “excited about gas, upstream and digital innovation in India”.

Alay Patel, a senior analyst with consultancy Wood Mackenzie, the global president of which also met Modi, said that India’s domestic energy production outlook was positive thanks to steps such as a simplified licensing regime and clarity on contracts.

“But more is needed,” said Patel. “Allowing marketing and pricing freedom for all gas production, regardless of shore status and contract vintage, would incentivize companies to develop gas in the less explored basins.”",Indian PM Modi targets more energy reforms after meeting oil chiefs,https://www.reuters.com/article/india-energy-modi/pm-modi-targets-more-energy-reforms-after-meeting-oil-chiefs-idINKBN1CE1ES

DETROIT (Reuters) - No. 1 U.S. automaker General Motors Co (GM.N) said on Monday it would buy Strobe Inc, which uses LIDAR technology to help self-driving cars identify objects at a distance, to speed up development of autonomous vehicles and slash sensor costs.

LIDAR is one of the major sensor technologies used in autonomous, or self-driving vehicles, and there is fierce competition between large automakers to bring the cars to market first.

Fully self-driving vehicles are expected to hit the market in a limited form by around 2020. GM and its U.S. rival Ford Motor Co (F.N) have both publicly stated that they aim to have fully self-driving cars on sale by 2021.

”This acquisition is a game changer for GM and Cruise,“ because of the cost savings it will bring,” Kyle Vogt, chief executive of GM’s Cruise Automation unit, said.

“We’ve made this acquisition because we aim to speed our path to market,” he added.

Strobe’s new microchip LIDAR system would significantly enhance the capabilities of the self-driving cars GM was developing, Vogt said in a blog post and on a conference call with reporters.

By reducing the entire sensor down to a single chip, Strobe’s system should reduce the cost of each LIDAR on its self-driving cars by 99 percent, he said.

The technology provided not just a distance measurement for an object on the road - vehicles, people and objects - but also measured that object’s velocity.

“This is really important for self-driving cars, especially in challenging situations,” Vogt said.

Vogt did not disclose financial terms, but said 11 full-time Strobe employees would join Cruise as part of the deal.

He said last week that the unit was making “rapid progress” toward deploying self-driving cars in part through testing vehicles on the crowded streets of San Francisco.

The waste comes in that a better version of a de facto tri-state Iraq was available in 2006. Every life lost (out of a million some, including 4,424 Americans), every dollar spent (in the trillions), and every unanticipated outcome suffered (rise of Islamic State, conflict in Syria, de-democratization of Turkey) since then has been unnecessary.

The post-World War One failure to create a Kurdish state resulted in 30 million Kurds scattered across modern Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Syria. The 2003 American invasion of Iraq destroyed civil order in much of the area populated by those Kurds, and opened the door to Iranian influence. Iran and its Iraqi Shiite allies directed political violence against Iraqi Sunnis, paving the way for a Sunni protector, Islamic State, to move in.

When the American-trained (cost: $25 billion) Iraqi national army dropped its weapons and ran in 2014, and Shiite militias proved too weak to fill the breach, Obama reinserted the American military into Iraq, saving the Kurds, by then also under threat from Islamic State. The United States subsequently turned those Kurdish fighters loose in Iraq and later Syria against Islamic State. It was expediency over strategy; there was no force otherwise available in bulk.

And it kind of worked. In the short run.

The Kurds, with American help, blunted Islamic State’s progress. The problem was that while American diplomacy, the carrot-and-stick of aid, and the difficulty of maintaining long-distance logistics saw the Kurdish forces replaced by Shiite militias in some locations, the Kurds held on to their gains in the north, having in most instances displaced Iraqi Sunnis. Victorious and bloodied, the Kurds were not about to renounce their hard-earned gains.

The need for American arms did force Kurdish leaders to postpone an independence referendum, opposed by Washington, in 2014. Three years later, with Islamic State mortally weakened, Washington no longer holds sway over Kurdish ambitions. And although the Sept. 25 referendum has no legal force, Kurdish leaders will use the vote to push Baghdad for full autonomy. Donald Trump, the fifth consecutive American president to make war on Iraq, may be the last simply for lack of an Iraq to fight over.

The ground truth of autumn 2017 -- a Kurdistan in the north, a Shiite state in the south, a marginalized Sunni population out west -- is pretty much the deal that could have been had in 2006 when then-Senator Joe Biden proposed dividing Iraq into statelets. Biden wanted the United States to leave a ""residual force to combat terrorists and keep the [three] neighbors honest.” The Senate actually passed a resolution supporting Biden's idea.

It probably would have stabilized the region. The Middle East in 2006 was a very different place.

In 2006 Iran faced an American military as yet undamaged by an additional decade of grinding war. That military sat on both Iran's western border with Iraq and its eastern border with Afghanistan. The Iranian nuclear program was years behind where it is today. Syria was a relatively stable place under not-then-yet-enemy of the free world Bashar al-Assad; indeed, the British-educated Assad was initially seen as a minor reformer. Turkey was stable. Russia was not a major player in the Middle East.

With many of 2017's regional Pandoras still in the box, by Middle Eastern standards security in a divided Iraq would have been manageable via a modest American military presence.

Instead, events of the last decade mean the chance of Kurdish independence adding to regional stability is near zero. Iran, fearing that an independent Kurdish state could threaten its own sectarian balance, is already conducting maneuvers on the border, has canceled flights to and from Kurdistan, and will push its proxies in Baghdad to take action. Will Turkey, now politically distant from NATO, move to open war over disputed borderlands with Kurdistan? The Turkish parliament just extended its authorization for cross-border incursions for another year. Will Kurdish minorities in Turkey and Iran see this all as their moment to rise? Will Israel, which backs Kurdish independence in its search for regional allies, supply weapons?

In a best-case scenario, where everyone tacitly acknowledges Kurdistan while maintaining the status quo (as with Taiwan, which officially exists as a part of China even as it acts like an independent nation) there may be a measure of stability in the near term. Baghdad will talk tough even as it allows the Kurds a surprising amount of free reign -- for example, Baghdad has withdrawn its police from contested Kirkuk, leaving Kurdish forces fully in charge of the oil-rich city. Kurdistan already has full control over its own education, security, military, taxes, and diplomatic representation. Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdistan regional government, has experimented with diplomatically vague language, saying “self-determination wouldn't mean a direct separation from Iraq.”

Darker predictions involve Syrian-Russian forces contesting Kurdish occupiers inside Syria. Iranian-backed Shiite militias have signaled plans to re-enter Kirkuk, and Turkey already has a running war with Kurdish fighters; tank maneuvers are ongoing with new threats gushing out of Ankara.

American policy has been a blurry gray for some time, calling for the referendum to be postponed without actually supporting or opposing independence. Traditionally the State Department favored a united Iraq somehow, while the Pentagon, with its history of in-the-dirt cooperation with Kurdish fighters stretching back to the 1991 no-fly zone and Operation Provide Comfort that essentially established the preliminary borders of Kurdistan, has been more sympathetic towards independence. The wording of America’s reaction (there has been no post-election statement issued as this is written) to the referendum could signal which part of government is making foreign policy in Iraq these days.

What seems clear is the American role going forward will be mostly limited to diplomacy, and that, regardless of who is carrying out the task, is not the country’s strong suit these days. There seems no appetite in Washington for large-scale troop redeployments, the kind of boots-on-the-ground necessary to decisively shape events.

The American military, which once could have played a role similar to its help in bringing peace to former Yugoslavia, instead will exist as a crumple zone among its own warring semi-allies.

Such a scenario exposes what might have been in 2006 when the United States could have managed events, and 2017, when America can do little more than witness them.",Commentary: Why the Kurdish referendum means the end of Iraq,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-vanburen-kurds-commentary/commentary-why-the-kurdish-referendum-means-the-end-of-iraq-idUSKCN1C125Q

Pence was attending a game in his home state of Indiana between the Indianapolis Colts and the San Francisco 49ers.

When the national anthem was played before the start of the game, some 49ers knelt while some Colts, their arms locked, wore black T-shirts with the words “We Will” on the front and “Stand for equality, justice, unity, respect, dialogue, opportunity” on the back.

“I left today’s Colts game because President Trump and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem,” Pence said in a statement issued by the White House.

Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said after his team’s game on Sunday that he would bench players who disrespect the U.S. flag.

“If there is anything that is disrespectful to the flag then we will not play,” Jones told reporters.

Asked about Pence’s departure, Jones said: ”We cannot in the NFL in any way give the implication that we tolerate disrespecting the flag.

“I know the vice president did leave, because in his opinion the teams were,” he said, adding: “There is no question in my mind that the National Football League and the Dallas Cowboys are going to stand up for the flag.”

But the NFL Players Association in a statement defended players’ right to protest.

“We should not stifle these discussions and cannot allow our rights to become subservient to the very opinions our Constitution protects,” the association said, adding, in words that borrowed from the national anthem, “that is what makes us the land of the free and the home of the brave.”

After Pence’s departure, critics began to question whether he had only attended the game in order to make a production of leaving, pointing out he flew from Las Vegas on Saturday and was then going to fly to California on Sunday evening.

Pence had planned for “several weeks” to attend Sunday’s Colts game, where former quarterback Peyton Manning was being honored, an official in his office said, asking not to be named. Additionally, he made a last-minute decision to travel to Las Vegas for a prayer service on Saturday, the official said.

“As he had discussed with the president, when several 49ers players disrespected the flag and the national anthem, the vice president decided to leave the game,” the official said.

President Donald Trump said in a tweet on Sunday that he had asked Pence to leave the stadium “if any player kneeled, disrespecting our country.”

NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy declined to comment.

The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution bars the government from limiting free speech, including prohibiting protests of the national anthem or punishing people who choose not to stand. The national anthem is played before every NFL football game and many other sporting events.

Less than an hour after issuing Pence’s statement, the White House released a picture of him and his wife at the stadium where the game took place, standing with hands over their hearts during the performance of the national anthem.

Trump’s criticism of the NFL players has played well with his conservative base while he grapples with controversies over Iran and North Korea, an investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 election and policy struggles in Congress.

Liberals have a tricky task ahead, to address two different publics: one alarmed by hate speech and militant messages, the other by measures to stop them.","In a flurry of confident pronouncements within an hour of the massacre at a Las Vegas country music festival, conservative commentators and activists linked the perpetrator, Stephen Paddock, to liberal or Islamist influences. Rush Limbaugh, still the doyen of right-wing talk radio, credited Islamic State with being Paddock’s ideological home, arguing that it was disguised by the liberal media because “for the American left, there is no such thing as militant Islamic terrorism.” Pat Robertson, the socially conservative activist and televangelist, said the shooting stemmed from the news media’s and liberal protesters’ “profound disrespect for our president” and other institutions.

On the other side of the American culture war, a CBS vice president and legal counsel, Hayley Geftman-Gold, posted a Facebook comment that she was “not even sympathetic” to the victims because “country music fans often are Republican gun toters.” Unlike her right wing opposites, she suffered for her opinion: she was fired from what must have been a lawyer’s dream job.

Should any of these comments ­­­− the work of, at most, a few minutes when not that of a few seconds − be the concern of the state? They easily fall into the category of bad taste. Some remarks, especially Geftman-Gold’s sneeringly callous comment – for which she has since apologized – could cause further misery in those seeking to cope with the trauma of injury or loss of someone close to them.

The general opinion, especially in the United States, is that governments should stay out of it. For Washington, the anger such remarks may rouse and the distress they may cause must be endured in deference to the near-absolute right of free speech protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

But should we tolerate such verbal brutality? Can it not be “cured?” Do people have to suffer distress because of the voiced prejudices of others who often – as Limbaugh does – make a rich living from their display? There’s a growing faction saying no, and it has reached, at least in Europe, the stage of state action. The European Union Justice Commissioner, Vera Jourova has told the social media giants, such as Facebook and Twitter, that they must eliminate both hate speech and fake news, or face legislation criminalizing them for not doing so. That’s a sweeping statement: unpacking what it might mean in practice takes us deep into an area which should be marked with signs saying: “Danger! Free speech in Peril!”

Fake news is not the same as hate speech, but it can also be used to inflame social tensions. In Italy, the anti-trust chief Giovanni Petruzella has said that EU countries should create government-appointed bodies to remove fake news and even fine the media for violations. But how is fake news to be distinguished, by either artificial or human intelligence, from true news? It’s a delicate operation, since much news striving to be “true” contains false information, and much fake news has the ring of truth and would take careful investigation to disprove.

In Germany, a new law came into force this month criminalizing some digital platforms being used for hate speech. Called, challengingly, the Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz, NetzDG for short, it commands that Facebook and Twitter take down “blatantly illegal” hate speech within 24 hours or, if the offending material is less obviously illegal, in a week – on pain of a fine of up to 50 million euro ($58.6 million). The problem with it, critics claim, is that it is imprecise about what constitutes hate speech. It merely points to the passage in the German Criminal Code which declares the ""defamation of religions, religious and ideological associations"" illegal. What is defamation? When is one person’s unbearable insult another’s opinion?

Sticks and stones may break my bones/But words will never hurt me” has been a comfort of sorts to those who have been the victims of taunting and insult, but modern psychiatry claims it isn’t so. Lisa Feldman Barrett, professor of psychology at Northeastern University, in a careful parsing of what constitutes harmful speech, argues that “there is a difference between permitting a culture of casual brutality and entertaining an opinion you strongly oppose. The former is a danger to a civil society (and to our health); the latter is the lifeblood of democracy.” Speech of the first kind, which “bullies and torments,” is “from the perspective of our brain cells… literally a form of violence.”

Put that way, it appears obvious: the speech which harms should be criminalized, as much as a physical assault, and in parts of Europe it is being so. Facebook, Twitter and Google are now under increasing state and public pressure to clean up their sites, to stop posting material that causes more than distress but, apparently, real damage to the brain. Embattled UK Prime Minister Theresa May spoke out at the United Nations last month, calling on the tech companies to go much further and faster in combating the dangerous messages they carry.

At a background-only session with Google staff in London this past week, where these issues were broached, I was told that the concerns of governments and the public were registered, and reform was on the way.

When I quoted the view of Fiyaz Mughal, head of the anti-extremist British advocacy organization Faith Matters, that the companies with which he had been working are “not dealing with the problem” because their “bottom line is money,” I was met with an assurance that this was not so. The automatic default of the communications behemoths to absolutism in free speech has been replaced, it was said, by a finer-grained examination of cause and effect, and of what could reasonably be done to address concerns.

It’s true that to juggle the demands of free speech and those of security now constitutes one of the largest ethical and practical problems facing democratic states − and the tech corporations. And it’s also true that even if Mughal is right that the companies’ first care is the bottom line – for which corporation is that not true? – the large fines now being prepared for not heeding the call to reform would be a large incentive to change.

Yet in the course of this complex balancing act, between security and liberty, profit and regulation, there is the danger of substantial damage to the freedoms of speech and the news media which democracies have been able to safeguard for most of the post-World War Two period.

En+ Group, a company owned by Russian tycoon Oleg Deripaska which supplies electricity to and controls aluminium outfit Rusal, aims to raise $1.5 billion in a London and Moscow listing. It touts its clean, mostly Siberian hydropower, but new public investors will have little say. The cornerstone backer, a Singapore-based partner of the Chinese group that just bought into Rosneft, may see greater advantage.

The combination of remote hydro assets and a 48 percent stake in Hong Kong-listed Rusal isn’t easy to value reliably. Adjusted EBITDA for the year to June, which consolidates Rusal, was around $2.8 billion. Apply a 12 times multiple – between Norsk Hydro’s and Rusal’s own – and deduct $5 billion of debt, as reported by Reuters, and other interests in the aluminium producer worth around $6 billion, and En+ equity would be worth a bit more than $20 billion. Estimate enterprise value as two times some $11 billion of consolidated annual sales instead, and the market cap comes out nearer $10 billion.

The final figure depends, of course, on investor appetite. Aluminium made with clean energy has appeal, as dirtier sources have led to the closure of some smelters and end-users are increasingly concerned about the environmental impact of their entire supply chains. Demand from China and other Asian countries, including for cars, could provide growth opportunities. And En+ reports strong cash flow, supporting dividends.

Yet Russian listings with control concentrated in the hands of Deripaska and his peers don’t have a stellar record. One close-to-home example is Rusal, which listed in 2010 at HK$10.80 a share and promptly traded down 11 percent on its debut. The stock did better in 2011, but since 2012 has languished below HK$7. Another reason for investor caution is that En+ is set to be the first major Russian float in London since 2014, when sanctions were imposed over Crimea.

The IPO’s big backer, though, may have grander ideas. AnAn, a company related to CEFC China Energy, has committed $500 million to the En+ offering. That in part endorses the investment case.

(Reuters) - With a businessman turned politician now in the Oval Office, a small but growing number of bankers and Wall Street financiers across the United States have set their sights on politics.

In New Jersey, Connecticut and California, former bankers, hedge fund managers and private equity executives have either announced bids for legislative and gubernatorial seats, or associates have told Reuters they are considering running.

Meanwhile, industry trade groups including the American Bankers Association are launching formal programs to teach members in various states how to campaign successfully.

It is not the first time well-heeled candidates have entered American politics, and there are not a great number of them. But historians, political scientists and bankers say the atmosphere has changed abruptly under President Donald Trump.

“It’s certainly raised the visibility of folks who in the past may have said ‘I‘m not a politician,” said Richard Baier, president of the Nebraska Bankers Association, which is launching a training school for potential legislative candidates. “We’ve shown that you don’t really need that background.”

The Oklahoma Bankers Association is also planning to launch its own candidate school, a spokesman said.

Foreclosures, job losses and growing income inequality after the 2007-2009 financial crisis made anyone with Wall Street ties into a political pariah. But Trump, a self-described billionaire who made a fortune in New York real estate and entertainment, has stocked his cabinet with Wall Street bankers and industry tycoons.

His presidency has inspired others in the financial community to pursue civic duty, according to people who have studied campaigns or are involved with current election efforts.

Trump’s ascendance shows that candidates’ backgrounds matter less than whether they can connect with voters, said Joshua Sandman, a political science professor at the University of New Haven.

“Trump running has encouraged more people in financial services to test the waters,” he said, “but the water could be murky for them unless they have a real set of positive experiences within business and are reflective of creating jobs and helping people.”

It is hard to say quantitatively whether more candidates with finance backgrounds are pursuing political office now compared with prior election cycles. But Paul Herrnson, a political science professor at the University of Connecticut who has researched candidates’ backgrounds, says he is skeptical about how successful the new crop of candidates will be.

“Sure, the mood is better than it was when the market collapsed, but I don’t think people say, ‘Wall Street financier – that’s someone I can vote for,” he said.

Phil Murphy, the Democratic candidate for New Jersey governor in 2017, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc executive who spent 23 years at the firm, is perhaps the most prominent moneyed candidate.

His campaign has focused on bolstering the middle class with proposals to create a millionaire’s tax and launch other initiatives to help low-income residents.

Murphy has won support from labor unions, environmental groups and consumer rights activists, as well as bold-faced names in the Democratic party like former Vice Presidents Joe Biden and Al Gore, who have both endorsed him.

An Oct. 3 Monmouth University Poll has him leading his Republican rival, Kim Guadagno by 14 points, and over 60 percent of New Jersey voters said Murphy’s ties to Goldman do not matter in a recent Quinnipiac Poll.

“Obviously Goldman was his career,” said Tony Bianchini, spokesman for the Northeast Regional Council of Carpenters, which is backing Murphy. “Everyone has a career.”

In Connecticut, former UBS Group AG executive Robert Stefanowski is running for governor, according to a public filing, and hedge fund manager David Stemerman recently said he may do the same.

The two Republicans have given few clues about their campaign strategies other than to cast themselves as outsiders who can fix Connecticut’s problems.

In California, two Wall Street veterans are mulling runs as progressive Democrats.

Tom Steyer, an environmentalist who worked at Goldman Sachs and was a hedge fund manager, may run for Senate or governor, a person familiar with the matter said. Joseph Sanberg, a former Tiger Global Management LLC executive, is also considering a Senate run, according to Politico. He casts himself as a “progressive entrepreneur” on his website.

Other ex-Wall Streeters who have entered politics have a mixed history, and much depends on how well their messages align with voters’ concerns, political historians said.

The NRA, which has seldom embraced new firearms-control measures, stunned gun control advocates last week when it issued a statement voicing willingness to support a restriction on bump stocks.

On Sunday, the organization said it was open to regulation but opposed any legislation banning the devices.

“We don’t believe that bans have ever worked on anything. What we have said has been very clear - that if something transfers a semiautomatic to function like a fully automatic, then it ought to be regulated differently,” Chris Cox, the NRA’s chief lobbyist, said on “Fox News Sunday.”

Police said the gunman, Stephen Paddock, 64, fitted 12 of his weapons with bump-stock devices that allow semi-automatic rifles to operate as if they were fully automatic machine guns, which are otherwise outlawed in the United States.

Cox and Wayne LaPierre, the NRA’s chief executive, accused the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives under Democratic former President Barack Obama of paving the way for the use of bump stocks and creating legal confusion about their usage.

Republican President Donald Trump, whose party controls both chambers of the U.S. Congress, was an outspoken advocate of gun rights during his 2016 campaign for the White House. The NRA spent more than $30 million in support of his candidacy.

Several Republican lawmakers suggested last week that they were receptive to legislation to curb the use of bump stocks, including Kevin McCarthy, the No. 2 Republican in the House of Representatives, who said such controls were an area where Congress may be able to act.

But House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, a Republican who himself was nearly killed by a gunman earlier this year while at a baseball practice, was cautious on Sunday about potential new legislation.

“I do think it’s a little bit early for people to say they know what to do to fix this problem,” he said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”

FILE PICTURE: Attendees walk past the words ""If they can ban one they can ban them all"" referencing a recent effort to ban ""green tip"" ammunition during the National Rifle Association's annual meeting in Nashville, Tennessee April 11, 2015. REUTERS/Harrison McClary

“A week ago most people didn’t know what a bump stock was so to think that we’re now all experts and know how to write some panacea law, it’s fallacy,” Scalise added.

NO REPUBLICAN SUPPORT

LaPierre lashed out at U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat who has pushed for gun-control legislation on Capitol Hill.

“I think you want to tell ATF to do its job. It’s an interpretive issue and they need to get the job done. But not let Dianne Feinstein, which is what she wants to do - turn this all of this into some Christmas tree on the Hill where she brings all of her anti-gun circus she has been trying to do for years into this,” LaPierre said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”

Feinstein said she has garnered some Republican interest, but no support, for the measure. “I have nobody lined up,” she told the CBS program.

Some gun-control advocates praised the NRA for showing some flexibility.

“This is the first time that the gun lobby has shown willingness to come to the table and I think that’s in part because Americans just simply do not accept mass shooting after mass shooting happening and Congress doing absolutely nothing,” Democratic Senator Chris Murphy said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

But Sunday’s comments from the NRA representatives suggested nothing may have changed as they castigated calls for gun-control measures in the emotional aftermath of a mass shooting.

“There used to be a common decency in this country where people paused talking about policy. Unfortunately with Dianne Feinstein and Michael Bloomberg, they want to exploit a tragedy from Day One. It’s shameful, but apparently that’s the new normal.” Cox said on the “Fox News Sunday” program.

Bloomberg, a billionaire and former mayor of New York, has been an outspoken critic of the National Rifle Association through the group Everytown for Gun Safety.

As Gisela Stuart, one of the few Labour MPs who campaigned enthusiastically for Brexit as the head of the “Vote Leave” campaign put it, the electors “wanted to restore genuine democratic government and take back control of the laws that govern them.”

Brexit is what happened when people were given a voice. No doubt that many who voted for it were uninformed; some were voting for a better yesterday; many were fearful of the effects of mass immigration – especially of Muslims. A few Britons didn’t want any foreigners at all. But above all, they wanted to “take back control,” and believed that political power should reside in the British parliament – which is comprehensible in its workings and dignified by centuries of existence – rather than in a series of institutions in Brussels, confusing in their overlapping and largely mysterious operations.

No matter that those with more sophisticated views of governance saw the desire as foolish: “an attempt to create a romantic idea of what Britain could be like out of the EU,” said the Liverpool University political scientist Andrew Crines. The majority wanted politics to be at least within their understanding, their representatives – liked or loathed – familiar.

It is this view that has rumbled along beneath the surface for most of the 44 years in which Britain has been a member of the European Union; it is what Prime Minster Theresa May meant in her Brexit speech to politicians in Florence on Friday, when she said that the EU “never felt to us like an integral part of our national story.”

That feeling was quiescent at times, especially during the 13 years of a Labour government, from 1997 to 2010, fevered at others. It was most turbulent during Conservative administrations: the last three Conservative Prime Ministers – Margaret Thatcher (1979-1990) John Major (1990-1997) and David Cameron (2010-2016) all lost power because they were fatally weakened by the internal argument on Europe within their party. No one gives Theresa May much hope of avoiding the Brussels curse which has wreaked so much damage on her predecessors.

The British prime minister is seen as someone clinging on to power, at the mercy of fellow ministers who could, at any time, bring her down. The most ambitious of these, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, has revealed his desire to lead his country most clearly. In an article in the Telegraph, he lauded the UK in the most elevated rhetoric employed in the Brexit cause, largely devoid of his trademark jests, expressing a bounding belief that “we can become the greatest country on earth.”

Giving only the briefest mention to his prime minister, he took over 4000 words to make the vision of a liberated Britain his own, striking a Churchillian pose with “I do not underestimate the scale of the task ahead as we take back control of our destiny” – the kind of rhetoric wholly absent from May’s cautious, if more precise, speeches.

Her Florence speech, clearly something of a compromise between her cabinet factions, vague on many details, nevertheless laid down a process, if not a destination: honoring commitments (that is, probably a 20 billion GBP – about $27 billion – payment to the EU), adopting new laws to protect the existing rights of European citizens living in the UK and passing through a two-year transition to give both sides, especially the UK, time to adjust to a customized relationship not based on the trade pacts which other, non-EU countries, have with the EU.

May’s all-but-impossible job is – as she interprets it – to keep a party and a cabinet with many Remainers in it relatively united, and to retain at least the acquiescence of the senior diplomats and civil servants, of the Bank of England and the main institutions of state, many – probably most – of whom believe Brexit to be most grievously self-wounding, consigning Britain not to greatness but to marginality.

Speaking in Washington earlier this week, Mark Carney, the Canadian who leads the Bank of England, warned of higher inflation, interest rate rises and slower growth, and forecast that Britain – unlike the other advanced countries – would be “an example of deglobalization, not globalization.”

The former close aide to the prime minister, Nick Timothy – whom May was told to fire after nearly losing the election in June – wrote ahead of May’s Florence speech that Chancellor Philip Hammond, was “maneuvering” towards a partial Brexit, failing to promote its advantages and, in his behind-the-scenes arguments with Boris Johnson, playing “games” with the future of the country.

These “maneuvers,” and many more at every level of government, are deployed around the office of an embattled prime minister who, with a relatively modest personality (for a senior politician), has no powerful public presence with which to offset the impression of barely-controlled chaos. Meanwhile, every institution at home and abroad affected by Brexit – there are many – call loudly and daily for a certainty at which the government has not yet arrived, and an easy transition which it cannot guarantee.

In a much-discussed book, “The Road to Somewhere”, the journalist David Goodhart (disclosure: a former Financial Times colleague, and a friend, of this columnist) sees in British society a widening split. On one side there are those who are anywhere people: at home in a globalizing world, with liberal views, enthusiastically pro-European, scornful of rootedness - “progressive individualists.” On the other, somewhere people, much more rooted in family and local work and friendships, not (in the main) bigoted but slow to adapt, worried by too-rapid change - “decent populists.”

Admitting that each side usually shares aspects of the other, he argues that the somewhere people have lost out in status, income and visibility in the last few decades, to the point where they often tell pollsters that they barely recognize the country they live in. Much more strongly represented in the working and lower middle class, less often university-educated, generally older than the anywheres, they still are the largest bloc in the country – and in the referendum, their pent-up vexations were allowed a release.

Their decision was probably not a wise act, but it was a thoroughly democratic one. They have given their country’s leadership one monster of a job: to reconcile what is a still globalizing world with their need for esteem and a restored sense that their country is recognizable, and that it is theirs.

Prime Minister May, brave as she is to shoulder the task, may not be up to it. Foreign Secretary Johnson careless as he is with both the truth and his loyalty, may be.

The announcement underlines the deteriorating security for aid groups in Afghanistan, where the ICRC has been operating for more than 30 years and has been running its fourth biggest humanitarian program.

“Exposure to risk has become our greatest challenge and concern,” Monica Zanarelli, head of the ICRC in Afghanistan, told a news conference in the capital, Kabul.

“We have no choice but to drastically reduce our presence in Afghanistan,” she said, adding that the decision would particularly affect operations in the north, where facilities in Kunduz, Faryab, and Balkh provinces would be closed or downsized.

Red Cross officials said the assessments are ongoing and could not say how many of its 1,800 staff would be affected.

The Red Cross had already warned of the threat to its operations following a series of attacks over the past year.

In February, the organization put all of its operations on hold after six of its staff were killed in an attack on an aid convoy in the far north.

Operations gradually resumed over the summer, but last month, a Spanish Red Cross physiotherapist working in the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif was shot dead by one of her patients.

In addition, four of its staff have been abducted over the past year.

The spreading conflict has combined with an increase in criminality, making for more “blurred lines” between the various armed groups which complicate efforts to safely provide aid, Zanarelli said.

“I would say there are more gray areas than there were in the past, and this is certainly what is affecting our capacity to assess our security,” she said.

According to U.S. military estimates, the government controls no more than 60 percent of the country, with the rest either controlled or contested by the Taliban and other insurgent groups.","International Red Cross to ""drastically"" cut Afghan operations after attacks",https://www.reuters.com/article/afghanistan-icrc/international-red-cross-to-drastically-cut-afghan-operations-after-attacks-idINKBN1CE0AM

LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - On paper, Catalonia looks viable as an independent state. The region which accounts for around a fifth of Spain’s economy has gross domestic product roughly comparable to Finland’s. Its residents are on average richer and more likely to have a job than other Spaniards. Nevertheless, the economic odds are stacked against the secessionists.

First, Catalonia may become much less wealthy if it breaks away. Some large companies are taking steps to transfer their registered headquarters out of the region following the Oct. 1 independence referendum that was branded unconstitutional by the central government. They include Banco Sabadell, Spain’s fifth-largest lender, which decided on Thursday to move its legal base to Alicante. The more likely independence becomes, the greater the chances that jobs and actual activity shift elsewhere.

Second, breaking away would trigger harmful disputes over tax and debt with Madrid, which trenchantly opposes a divorce. Granted, Catalonia pays more in taxes to the central government than it receives in spending. But unilaterally declaring independence would not necessarily allow the region to stand on its own. Citizens and businesses might face duplicate tax demands from Barcelona and Madrid. In the event of a standoff, companies with branch offices in Spain could be presented with bills for the whole business.

There’s also the thorny issue of how to smooth out Catalan debt obligations, which it currently does with the help of state liquidity. Net borrowing from the central government surpassed 50 billion euros at the end of 2016, equivalent to three-quarters of Catalonia’s total debt, according to Fitch. The credit rating firm also points out that more than a quarter of debt outstanding at the end of 2016 comes due over the next three years. And that’s assuming Catalonia can escape without taking on any of Spain’s sovereign debt, currently equivalent to around 100 percent of national GDP.

A final problem is what currency Catalonia would use. Even if independence were recognised by other countries, the region is unlikely to remain a part of the euro zone. Granted, it could always create a currency that is pegged to the euro. But a newly-created Catalan central bank would need access to foreign exchange reserves that the central government has no interest in handing over. Politics are not the only bar to independence.",Breakingviews - Economic odds stacked against Catalonia breakaway,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-catalonia-breakingviews/breakingviews-economic-odds-stacked-against-catalonia-breakaway-idUSKBN1CB1DY

(Reuters) - Wall Street was little changed in late morning trading on Monday, as losses in healthcare stocks were offset by gains in technology shares, with the third-quarter earnings season looming.

U.S. stocks have been on a tear this year, hitting new records almost everyday in the past week, and the upcoming earnings reports will help justify the lofty valuations.

“The relatively high valuation, where the market is trading 17 to 18 times earnings, is merited by a very low interest rate environment,” said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.

“We are not danger yet if you keep your eye on rates.”

Overall, earnings at S&P 500 companies are expected to have increased 4.9 percent last quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data, down from the double-digit growth recorded in the first two quarters of this year.

Ten S&P 500 companies are expected to report earnings this week, including some of the biggest Wall Street banks. JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) and Citigroup (C.N) will report on Thursday.

At 11:00 a.m. ET (1500 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was up 5.13 points, or 0.02 percent, at 22,778.8, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was up 0.08 points, flat on a percentage basis, at 6,590.26. Both indexes hit record intraday highs.

The S&P 500 .SPX was down 1.76 points, or 0.07 percent, at 2,547.57, which is just 5 points shy of its record high. The benchmark's eight-day winning streak came to a halt on Friday due to weak jobs numbers.

Eight of the 11 major S&P indexes were higher, led by a 0.31 percent gain in the technology sector .SPLRCT. The healthcare index .SPXHC was down 0.56 percent.

GE shares (GE.N) sank 3 percent and was the top drag on the S&P after the conglomerate named a new CFO said it gave activist investment firm Trian Fund Management a board seat.

Medtronic (MDT.N) dropped about 4 percent after the medical device maker said Hurricane Maria hurt second-quarter earnings and sales.

DaVita (DVA.N) tumbled 7 percent, the most on the S&P, after JPMorgan cut its rating on the dialysis service provider, while Express Scripts (ESRX.O) fell 4.5 percent on a Raymond James downgrade.

Tesla (TSLA.O) fell 2.51 percent after pushing back the unveiling of the big rig truck to mid-November.

Viacom (VIAB.O) slipped more than 4 percent after Citigroup downgraded the stock to “sell”, citing risks that pay TV firms would stop carrying its channels.

The Madrid government, grappling with Spain’s biggest political crisis since an attempted military coup in 1981, made it clear on Monday it would respond immediately to any such unilateral declaration.

A week on from a referendum on independence which the government did its utmost to thwart, more signs were emerging that the fraught situation was also taking its toll on the business climate of Spain’s wealthiest region.

Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont is due to address the regional parliament on Tuesday afternoon and the Madrid government is worried it will vote for a unilateral declaration of independence.

Catalan officials say people voted overwhelmingly for secession in the ballot, which was declared illegal by the government and was marked by police violence against independence supporters.

But the issue has deeply divided the northeastern region itself as well the Spanish nation. Hundreds of thousands of unionists took to the streets of Barcelona at the weekend to protest against the region breaking away.

Buoyed by the show of support, Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaría said on Monday: “I‘m calling on the sensible people in the Catalan government... don’t jump off the edge because you’ll take the people with you.”

“If there is a unilateral declaration of independence there will be decisions made to restore law and democracy,” Saenz de Santamaría told COPE radio station.

Backing also came from European heavyweights Germany and France.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke to Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy on Saturday about the crisis, her spokesman said on Monday. She stressed her support for Spain’s unity but also encouraged more dialogue.

France said it would not recognize Catalonia if the region unilaterally declared independence. Doing so would lead to Catalonia’s automatic exit from the European Union, it said.

“This crisis needs to be resolved through dialogue at all levels of Spanish politics,” France’s European affairs minister Nathalie Loiseau said.

The European Union has shown no interest in an independent Catalonia, despite an appeal by Puigdemont for Brussels to mediate in the crisis.

NEW ELECTIONS?

Under Catalonia’s referendum law, deemed unconstitutional by Madrid, a vote for independence in the assembly on Tuesday would start a six-month process that would envisage divorce talks with Spain before regional elections and a final act of separation.

Rajoy has not ruled out the so-called “nuclear option” of removing Catalonia’s government and calling new regional elections if it claims independence.

He gained some political cover for such a move on Monday when opposition Socialist leader Pedro Sanchez said in Barcelona he would “support the response of the rule of law in the face of any attempt to break social harmony”.

Sanchez stopped short, however, of explicitly saying his party would back dissolving the regional parliament, a possibility written into the 1978 constitution.

Losing Catalonia, which has its own language and culture, would deprive Spain of a fifth of its economic output and more than a quarter of exports. A stream of Catalonia-based firms and banks have moved their legal bases outside the region.

The boards of Catalonia-based infrastructure firm Abertis (ABE.MC), telecoms company Cellnex (CLNX.MC) and property group Inmobiliaria Colonial (COL.MC) will meet on Monday to discuss moving, sources said.

Banks Caixabank (CABK.MC) and Sabadell (SABE.MC) have already resolved to leave the region.

The crisis has also reopened old divisions in a nation where the right-wing dictatorship of General Francisco Franco is a living memory easily revived by strong displays of nationalism.

Among many moderate Spaniards there is widespread opposition to a breakaway, including in Catalonia. Regional authorities say about 90 percent of those who voted in the referendum backed secession, but turnout was 43 percent, with most unionists boycotting it.

Sunday's demonstration in the Catalan capital helped calm Spanish markets on Monday, along with comments on Friday from credit rating agencies Moody's and DBRS that they expected Spain to remain united. Spanish borrowing costs fell to a one-week low and the main share index .IBEX touched a week high.

Puigdemont appeared resolute in a television interview on Sunday, saying the region’s referendum law called for a declaration of independence in the event of a “yes” vote.

“We will apply what the law says,” he told TV3.

Catalonia’s High Court asked for more security in case independence is declared, specifically drafting in the national police, who were called in to stop the referendum when the Catalan police force failed to act.

Madrid sent thousands of national police to the region to prevent the vote. About 900 people were injured when officers used rubber bullets and batons against voters in scenes that shocked Spain and the world, and escalated the dispute.

Under a blueprint for independence drawn up by the Catalan parliament last month, the High court would be turned into a new Supreme Court of Catalonia.

Puigdemont said on Sunday he had not been in contact with the Madrid government for some time because it refused to discuss independence.

“What is happening in Catalonia is real, whether they like it or not. Millions of people have voted, who want to decide. We have to talk about this,” he said.

O bancário aposentado, de 70 anos, disse estar descontente com as disputas internas e as mudanças de funcionários na Casa Branca. Ele também desaprova as várias viagens de Trump a seus clubes de golfe particulares, gostaria que o presidente fizesse mais para melhorar o sistema de saúde e teme que ele recue em sua promessa de expulsar imigrantes ilegais do país.

“Todo presidente comete erros”, disse Wilson. “Mas se você soma um a outro, e a outro, e a outro, existe um limite”.

Trump, que conquistou milhões de eleitores em locais como o condado de Morgan em 2016, vem perdendo apoio na chamada América rural.

De acordo com uma pesquisa Reuters/Ipsos, a popularidade do presidente republicano está caindo em cidades pequenas e comunidades rurais, que concentram 15 por cento da população do país. A sondagem com mais de 15 mil adultos em áreas “não metropolitanas” revelou que estes estão igualmente inclinados a aprovar e desaprovar Trump.

Em setembro, 47 por cento dos habitantes de áreas não metropolitanas aprovavam Trump, e outros 47 por cento desaprovavam -- uma queda na aprovação em relação às quatro primeiras semanas de Trump no cargo, quando 55 por cento diziam aprová-lo e 39 por cento o desaprovavam.

A pesquisa apontou que Trump perdeu apoio em áreas rurais entre homens, brancos e pessoas sem ensino universitário, além de republicanos do interior e eleitores rurais que o escolheram no dia da eleição.

Embora Trump ainda mostre números relativamente altos no levantamento quanto à condução da economia e da segurança nacional, os norte-americanos do interior estão cada vez mais insatisfeitos com seu desempenho na imigração, uma parte central de sua campanha presidencial.

Em setembro 47 por cento dos cidadãos rurais disseram aprovar a forma como Trump está lidando com a imigração, uma queda em reação aos 56 por cento de seu primeiro mês no poder.

Os entrevistados pela Reuters apontaram razões diferentes para sua insatisfação com o presidente neste quesito. Alguns disseram estar cansados de esperar que Trump cumpra sua promessa de construir um muro na fronteira sul com o México, e outros afirmaram que estão incomodados com os esforços de seu governo para restringir as viagens aos EUA.

O governo Trump não quis comentar a pesquisa Reuters/Ipsos.

Mas é certo que Trump ainda é muito mais popular nas áreas rurais do que em quaisquer outras.

Desde que tomou posse, “eu gosto dele menos, mas o apoio mais”, disse Robert Cody, engenheiro químico de 87 anos de Bartlesville, no Oklahoma, argumentando que Trump pode irritar algumas pessoas pela maneira como fala, mas que este é um preço pequeno a se pagar para um presidente que lutará para acabar com as regulamentações do governo e fortalecer a fronteira.","Popularidade de Trump registra queda no interior dos EUA, aponta pesquisa",https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idBRKBN1CE1KC-OBRWD

In a list of “principles” laid out in documents released by the White House, the Trump administration also pressed for a crackdown on unaccompanied minors who enter the United States, many of them from Central America.

The plan, which was delivered to leaders in Congress on Sunday night, drew a swift rebuke from Democrats, who are seeking a legislative fix for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program that Trump ended last month.

“The administration can’t be serious about compromise or helping the Dreamers if they begin with a list that is anathema to the Dreamers, to the immigrant community and to the vast majority of Americans,” said House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer.

“The list includes the wall, which was explicitly ruled out of the negotiations. If the president was serious about protecting the Dreamers, his staff has not made a good faith effort to do so,” they said in a statement.

The Trump administration wants the wish list to guide immigration reform in Congress and accompany a bill to replace DACA, the Obama-era program that protected nearly 800,000 “Dreamers” from deportation and allowed them to secure work permits.

If enacted, the White House priorities could result in the deportation of Dreamers’ parents.

The proposals emphasize immigration enforcement and include a request for funds to hire 370 more immigration judges, 1,000 attorneys for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, 300 federal prosecutors and 10,000 additional ICE agents to enforce immigration laws.

“These priorities are essential to mitigate the legal and economic consequences of any grant of status to DACA recipients,” Trump’s legislative affairs director, Marc Short, told reporters on a conference call. The White House made clear it would not be pushing for Dreamers to achieve U.S. citizenship, only legal status, in a potential deal.

Trump told Congress it had six months to come up with legislation to help Dreamers, who are a fraction of the 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States, most of whom are Hispanic.

The documents call for tighter standards for those seeking U.S. asylum, denial of federal grants to “sanctuary cities” that serve as refuges for illegal immigrants, and a requirement that employers use an electronic verification system known as “E-Verify” to keep illegal immigrants from securing jobs.

HARD LINE

Trump campaigned for president on a pledge to toughen immigration policies and build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. He vowed repeatedly that Mexico would pay for the wall, but began prodding Congress earlier this year to approve funding. Mexico has said it will not pay for the wall.

Trump’s suggestion after a meeting with Schumer and Pelosi that wall funding would not have to be part of a DACA fix alarmed some of his supporters.

The White House sees the wall as a priority but has indicated that it could be established as part of a DACA bill or through other legislative avenues. Administration officials said that legislation that did not include all of the priorities on the list would not necessarily trigger a presidential veto.

Republicans in Congress have introduced several bills that include aspects of Trump’s ideas, but many Democrats and immigration groups see the proposals as too harsh.

“The Trump administration has put forth a serious proposal to address the enforcement of our immigration laws and border security,“ said Republican House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte in a statement. ”We cannot fix the DACA problem without fixing all of the issues that led to the underlying problem of illegal immigration in the first place.”

The White House’s wish list targets the flow of unaccompanied minors into the United States. It would require such children to be treated the same, regardless of their countries of origin “so long as they are not victims of human trafficking and can be safely returned home or removed to safe third countries,” the White House documents said.

It would expand the list of “inadmissible aliens” to include members of gangs, those who have been convicted of an aggravated felony, and former spouses and children of drug and human traffickers if they receive benefits from such behavior.

The plan also seeks to reduce the number of people who overstay their visas and reform how green cards that establish legal permanent residents are granted.

Trump’s White House has so far not been able to achieve a major legislative victory, casting doubt on the potential for a breakthrough on immigration reform, which Republican and Democratic presidents have tried before without success.

Since Trump took office in January, his fellow Republicans have failed to repeal and replace former Democratic President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, and a White House plan for tax reform needs more support.","Trump seeks border wall, crackdown on unaccompanied minors for 'Dreamer' deal",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-exclusive/trump-seeks-border-wall-crackdown-on-unaccompanied-minors-for-dreamer-deal-idUSKBN1CD10L?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Google has discovered Russian operatives spent tens of thousands of dollars on ads on its YouTube, Gmail and Google Search products in an effort to meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, a person briefed on the company’s probe told Reuters on Monday.

The ads do not appear to be from the same Kremlin-affiliated entity that bought ads on Facebook Inc, but may indicate a broader Russian online disinformation effort, according to the source, who was not authorized to discuss details of Google’s confidential investigation.

The revelation is likely to fuel further scrutiny of the role that Silicon Valley technology giants may have unwittingly played during last year’s election. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Moscow’s goal was to help elect Donald Trump.

Google has uncovered less than $100,000 in ad spending potentially linked to Russian actors, the source said.

Both Twitter Inc and Facebook recently detected and disclosed that suspected Russian operatives, working for a content farm known as the Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg, Russia, used their platforms to purchase ads and post content that was politically divisive in a bid to influence Americans before and after the November 2016 presidential election.

The Internet Research Agency employ hundreds of so-called “trolls” who post pro-Kremlin content, much of it fake or discredited, under the guise of phony social media accounts that posed as American or European, according to lawmakers and researchers.

Facebook announced last month it had unearthed $100,000 in spending by the Internet Research Agency and, under pressure from lawmakers, has pledged to be more transparent about how its ads are purchased and targeted.

Google’s review had been more robust than ones undertaken so far by Facebook or Twitter, the source said.

Russia’s ad purchases were first reported by the Washington Post.

Google, owned by Alphabet Inc, did not deny the story, and in a statement pointed to its existing ad policies that limit political ad targeting and prohibit targeting based on race or religion.

“We are taking a deeper look to investigate attempts to abuse our systems, working with researchers and other companies, and will provide assistance to ongoing inquiries,” a Google spokeswoman said on Monday.

Google runs the world’s largest online advertising business and YouTube is the world’s largest online video site.

Congressional committees have launched multiple investigations into the Russian interference. Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have said Russia intended to sow discord in the United States, spread propaganda and sway the election.

Google officials have been invited to testify publicly about Russian attempts to use their platforms to influence the election before both the House and Senate intelligence committees on Nov. 1 alongside Facebook and Twitter.

LONDON (Reuters) - Iran promised on Monday to give a “crushing” response if the United States designated its elite Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist group.

The pledge came a week before President Donald Trump announces a final decision on how he wants to contain the Islamic Republic.

He is expected on Oct. 15 to “decertify” a landmark 2015 international deal to curb Iran’s nuclear program, a step that by itself stops short of pulling out of the agreement but gives Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions.

Trump is also expected to designate Iran’s most powerful security force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corp (IRGC) as a terrorist organization, as he rolls out a broader, more hawkish U.S. strategy on Iran.

“We are hopeful that the United States does not make this strategic mistake,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi was quoted as saying by the state news agency IRNA.

“If they do, Iran’s reaction would be firm, decisive and crushing and the United States should bear all its consequences,” he told a news conference reported by IRNA.

Individuals and entities associated with the IRGC are already on the U.S. list of foreign terrorist organizations, but the organization as a whole is not.

IRGC commander Mohammad Ali Jafari said on Sunday, “If the news is correct about the stupidity of the American government in considering the Revolutionary Guards a terrorist group, then the Revolutionary Guards will consider the American army to be like Islamic State all around the world.”

Jafari also said that additional sanctions would end chances for future dialogue with the United States and that the Americans would have to move their regional bases outside the 2,000 km (1,250 mile) range of IRGC’s missiles.

WARY EUROPE

U.S. sanctions on the IRGC could affect conflicts in Iraq and Syria, where Tehran and Washington both support warring parties that oppose the Islamic State militant group (IS).

France said on Monday it was worried that classifying the IRGC as a terrorist group could exacerbate tensions in the region.

Germany said it was worried Trump would decide Iran is not respecting the nuclear deal, negotiated under his predecessor Barack Obama, and fears such a step will worsen insecurity in the Middle East.

A U.S. pullout could unravel an accord seen by supporters as vital to preventing a Middle East arms race and tamping down regional tensions, since it limits Iran’s ability to enrich uranium for nuclear fuel in exchange for the lifting of sanctions that damaged its oil-based economy.

The U.N. nuclear watchdog’s inspectors have repeatedly declared Iran in compliance with the terms of the nuclear deal.

Trump called Iran “a corrupt dictatorship” during his first speech to the U.N. General Assembly and said the nuclear deal was “the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into”.

The other five world powers in the deal were Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China.

The prospect of the United States reneging on the agreement has worried other partners that helped negotiate it.

The Kremlin said that any U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal would have “negative consequences.”

British Prime Minister Theresa May, who supports the nuclear pact, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who opposes it, agreed in a phone call on Monday that they need to be “clear-eyed” about the threat Iran poses to the Middle East.

“They agreed that ... the international community should continue working together to push back against Iran’s destabilizing regional activity,” May’s spokesman said.

“MALIGN ACTIVITIES”

Despite the nuclear deal, Washington still maintains its own more limited sanctions on Iran over its ballistic missile program and over accusations Tehran supports terrorism.

Iran says it is developing missiles solely for defensive purposes and denies involvement in terrorism.

The Trump administration aims to put more pressure on the IRGC, especially over recent missile tests and what Washington has called its “malign activities” across the Middle East.

The U.S. government imposed sanctions in July on 18 entities and people for supporting the IRGC in developing drones and military equipment. In August, Congress overwhelmingly approved the “Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act” which imposed new sanctions on Iran for its ballistic missile program, as well as sanctions on Russia and North Korea.

In an interview aired on Saturday night, Trump accused Iran of “funding North Korea” and “doing things with North Korea that are totally inappropriate”.

Qasemi, Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman, said the U.S. accusations were “baseless”. He added, “Israel and some specific countries are raising these accusations to create Iranophobia.”",Iran promises 'crushing' response if U.S. designates Guards a terrorist group,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-iran-usa-irgc/iran-promises-crushing-response-if-u-s-designates-guards-a-terrorist-group-idUKKBN1CE0M8

The documents call for tighter standards for those seeking U.S. asylum, denial of federal grants to “sanctuary cities” that serve as refuges for illegal immigrants, and a requirement that employers use an electronic verification system known as “E-Verify” to keep illegal immigrants from securing jobs.

HARD LINE

Trump campaigned for president on a pledge to toughen immigration policies and build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. He vowed repeatedly that Mexico would pay for the wall, but began prodding Congress earlier this year to approve funding. Mexico has said it will not pay for the wall.

Trump’s suggestion after a meeting with Schumer and Pelosi that wall funding would not have to be part of a DACA fix alarmed some of his supporters.

The White House sees the wall as a priority but has indicated that it could be established as part of a DACA bill or through other legislative avenues. Administration officials said that legislation that did not include all of the priorities on the list would not necessarily trigger a presidential veto.

Republicans in Congress have introduced several bills that include aspects of Trump’s ideas, but many Democrats and immigration groups see the proposals as too harsh.

“The Trump administration has put forth a serious proposal to address the enforcement of our immigration laws and border security,“ said Republican House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte in a statement. ”We cannot fix the DACA problem without fixing all of the issues that led to the underlying problem of illegal immigration in the first place.”

The White House’s wish list targets the flow of unaccompanied minors into the United States. It would require such children to be treated the same, regardless of their countries of origin “so long as they are not victims of human trafficking and can be safely returned home or removed to safe third countries,” the White House documents said.

It would expand the list of “inadmissible aliens” to include members of gangs, those who have been convicted of an aggravated felony, and former spouses and children of drug and human traffickers if they receive benefits from such behavior.

The plan also seeks to reduce the number of people who overstay their visas and reform how green cards that establish legal permanent residents are granted.

Trump’s White House has so far not been able to achieve a major legislative victory, casting doubt on the potential for a breakthrough on immigration reform, which Republican and Democratic presidents have tried before without success.

Since Trump took office in January, his fellow Republicans have failed to repeal and replace former Democratic President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, and a White House plan for tax reform needs more support.","Trump seeks border wall, crackdown on unaccompanied minors for 'Dreamer' deal",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-exclusive/trump-seeks-border-wall-crackdown-on-unaccompanied-minors-for-dreamer-deal-idUSKBN1CD10L

LONDON (Reuters) - Iran promised on Monday to give a “crushing” response if the United States designated its elite Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist group.

The pledge came a week before President Donald Trump announces a final decision on how he wants to contain the Islamic Republic.

He is expected on Oct. 15 to “decertify” a landmark 2015 international deal to curb Iran’s nuclear program, a step that by itself stops short of pulling out of the agreement but gives Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions.

Trump is also expected to designate Iran’s most powerful security force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corp (IRGC) as a terrorist organization, as he rolls out a broader, more hawkish U.S. strategy on Iran.

“We are hopeful that the United States does not make this strategic mistake,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi was quoted as saying by the state news agency IRNA.

“If they do, Iran’s reaction would be firm, decisive and crushing and the United States should bear all its consequences,” he told a news conference reported by IRNA.

Individuals and entities associated with the IRGC are already on the U.S. list of foreign terrorist organizations, but the organization as a whole is not.

IRGC commander Mohammad Ali Jafari said on Sunday, “If the news is correct about the stupidity of the American government in considering the Revolutionary Guards a terrorist group, then the Revolutionary Guards will consider the American army to be like Islamic State all around the world.”

Jafari also said that additional sanctions would end chances for future dialogue with the United States and that the Americans would have to move their regional bases outside the 2,000 km (1,250 mile) range of IRGC’s missiles.

WARY EUROPE

U.S. sanctions on the IRGC could affect conflicts in Iraq and Syria, where Tehran and Washington both support warring parties that oppose the Islamic State militant group (IS).

France said on Monday it was worried that classifying the IRGC as a terrorist group could exacerbate tensions in the region.

Germany said it was worried Trump would decide Iran is not respecting the nuclear deal, negotiated under his predecessor Barack Obama, and fears such a step will worsen insecurity in the Middle East.

A U.S. pullout could unravel an accord seen by supporters as vital to preventing a Middle East arms race and tamping down regional tensions, since it limits Iran’s ability to enrich uranium for nuclear fuel in exchange for the lifting of sanctions that damaged its oil-based economy.

The U.N. nuclear watchdog’s inspectors have repeatedly declared Iran in compliance with the terms of the nuclear deal.

Trump called Iran “a corrupt dictatorship” during his first speech to the U.N. General Assembly and said the nuclear deal was “the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into”.

The other five world powers in the deal were Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China.

The prospect of the United States reneging on the agreement has worried other partners that helped negotiate it.

The Kremlin said that any U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal would have “negative consequences.”

British Prime Minister Theresa May, who supports the nuclear pact, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who opposes it, agreed in a phone call on Monday that they need to be “clear-eyed” about the threat Iran poses to the Middle East.

“They agreed that ... the international community should continue working together to push back against Iran’s destabilizing regional activity,” May’s spokesman said.

“MALIGN ACTIVITIES”

Despite the nuclear deal, Washington still maintains its own more limited sanctions on Iran over its ballistic missile program and over accusations Tehran supports terrorism.

Iran says it is developing missiles solely for defensive purposes and denies involvement in terrorism.

The Trump administration aims to put more pressure on the IRGC, especially over recent missile tests and what Washington has called its “malign activities” across the Middle East.

The U.S. government imposed sanctions in July on 18 entities and people for supporting the IRGC in developing drones and military equipment. In August, Congress overwhelmingly approved the “Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act” which imposed new sanctions on Iran for its ballistic missile program, as well as sanctions on Russia and North Korea.

In an interview aired on Saturday night, Trump accused Iran of “funding North Korea” and “doing things with North Korea that are totally inappropriate”.

Qasemi, Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman, said the U.S. accusations were “baseless”. He added, “Israel and some specific countries are raising these accusations to create Iranophobia.”",Iran promises 'crushing' response if U.S. designates Guards a terrorist group,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1CE0M2-OCATP

KIGALI (Reuters) - A critic of Rwandan President Paul Kagame cannot plan her defence on charges of insurrection and forgery because prosecutors have denied access to her case file, her lawyer said on Monday.

Diane Shima Rwigara, a 35-year-old accountant, is the latest in a series of political opponents of Kagame to face criminal charges.

She is accused of faking the registration papers she filed to stand against Kagame in an August election. She was barred from running and he won with 98.8 percent of the vote.

Rwigara accuses Kagame of stifling dissent and has criticised the Rwandan Patriotic Front’s (RPF) tight grip on the country since it fought its way to power to end a genocide in 1994.

On Monday, her lawyer Buhuru Pierre Celestin told the court in the capital Kigali he should have been handed the full charge sheet before the hearing resumed.

“They (defendants) should not be here without their file,” Buhuru said. “This raises my worry that the court is hearing the case without all elements of the case.”

Buhuru’s comments came days after Rwigara told the court she had been forced to appear without her lawyer because authorities had not told him about the hearing in time.

The defendants were first taken from their home in Kigali on Aug. 30 on tax evasion allegations related to the family’s tobacco company.

“I request that we should have the case file. I and my children should have access to the case file so that we should plan our defence,” Adeline, the politician’s mother, said during Monday’s session.

Both women and Rwigara’s sister have been charged. The three defendants have said the accusations are politically motivated.

Prosecutors said they would not disclose details of the charges as an investigation was still taking place.

“We cannot hand it out for the secrecy of its content,” Michel Nshimiyimana told the court.

Kagame is praised for restoring stability in Rwanda and for rapid economic progress. Rights groups say he has muzzled independent media and suppressed opponents, several of whom have been killed. The government dismisses the accusations as false.

Rwanda last month also charged another opposition official and eight others with forming an armed group and seeking to overthrow the government.

“The current move by RPF to jail people because they want to ... run for the presidency is a gift. They won’t finish us all,” Bernard Ntaganda, an opposition politician who was once jailed for four years, told journalists outside the court.

(Reuters) - Wall Street was little changed in late morning trading on Monday, as losses in healthcare stocks were offset by gains in technology shares, with the third-quarter earnings season looming.

U.S. stocks have been on a tear this year, hitting new records almost everyday in the past week, and the upcoming earnings reports will help justify the lofty valuations.

“The relatively high valuation, where the market is trading 17 to 18 times earnings, is merited by a very low interest rate environment,” said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.

“We are not danger yet if you keep your eye on rates.”

Overall, earnings at S&P 500 companies are expected to have increased 4.9 percent last quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data, down from the double-digit growth recorded in the first two quarters of this year.

Ten S&P 500 companies are expected to report earnings this week, including some of the biggest Wall Street banks. JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) and Citigroup (C.N) will report on Thursday.

At 11:00 a.m. ET (1500 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was up 5.13 points, or 0.02 percent, at 22,778.8, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was up 0.08 points, flat on a percentage basis, at 6,590.26. Both indexes hit record intraday highs.

The S&P 500 .SPX was down 1.76 points, or 0.07 percent, at 2,547.57, which is just 5 points shy of its record high. The benchmark's eight-day winning streak came to a halt on Friday due to weak jobs numbers.

Eight of the 11 major S&P indexes were higher, led by a 0.31 percent gain in the technology sector .SPLRCT. The healthcare index .SPXHC was down 0.56 percent.

GE shares (GE.N) sank 3 percent and was the top drag on the S&P after the conglomerate named a new CFO said it gave activist investment firm Trian Fund Management a board seat.

Medtronic (MDT.N) dropped about 4 percent after the medical device maker said Hurricane Maria hurt second-quarter earnings and sales.

DaVita (DVA.N) tumbled 7 percent, the most on the S&P, after JPMorgan cut its rating on the dialysis service provider, while Express Scripts (ESRX.O) fell 4.5 percent on a Raymond James downgrade.

Tesla (TSLA.O) fell 2.51 percent after pushing back the unveiling of the big rig truck to mid-November.

Viacom (VIAB.O) slipped more than 4 percent after Citigroup downgraded the stock to “sell”, citing risks that pay TV firms would stop carrying its channels.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Re-testing of more than a thousand samples from the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics uncovered only one athlete to have taken banned substances, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Monday.

The IOC said it had conducted re-tests of 1,195 urine samples, including those of all medalists from the winter Games seven years ago as well as of all Russian athletes.

“Three adverse analytical findings, all coming from one athlete, are being taken forward for results management,” the IOC said in a statement. It did provide any details of the athlete in question, nor of his or her sport or nationality.

The low number of positive re-tests from Vancouver is in stark contrast with the results from samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics.

More than 100 athletes tested positive in total in those re-tests and some 75 medals had to be reallocated. More than 80 percent of those cases involved the sports of weightlifting and athletics.

“This wide-ranging re-analysis is another demonstration of the IOC’s commitment to fight against doping and to protect clean athletes,” IOC President Thomas Bach said.

“The Vancouver 2010 reanalysis program was done in full cooperation with the World Anti-Doping Agency and with the help and support of stakeholders such as International Federations and experts,” he added.

The IOC stores athletes’ samples for a decade as it looks to re-test them using newer methods or testing for substances that at the time of the competition were not yet known.

It has also started reanalyzing the samples of all Russian athletes from the 2014 Sochi Olympics as part of ongoing investigations into the country’s doping scandal and its alleged manipulation of athletes’ drugs samples during those Games.",Olympics: Only one athlete positive in Vancouver Games re-tests - IOC,https://www.reuters.com/article/oympics-doping-vancouver/olympics-only-one-athlete-positive-in-vancouver-games-re-tests-ioc-idINKBN1CE1R1?il=0

CRAIOVA, Romania (Reuters) - NATO launched a new multinational force in Romania on Monday to counter Russia along its eastern flank and to check a growing Russian presence in the Black Sea following the Kremlin’s 2014 seizure of Crimea.

The force will initially be built around a Romanian brigade of up to 4,000 soldiers, supported by troops from nine other NATO countries, and complementing a separate deployment of 900 U.S. troops who are already in place. The plans are to include additional air and sea assets to give the force greater capabilities.

“Our purpose is peace, not war,” Romanian President Klaus Iohannis told the NATO Parliamentary Assembly of alliance lawmakers, which is meeting this year in Bucharest.

“We are not a threat for Russia. But we need dialogue from a strong position of defense and discouragement,” he said, before flying to the Craiova military base in south-eastern Romania.

At the base, as military bands played, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg stood alongside Iohannis, addressed some of the troops in green face paint and inspected vehicles and weapons.

“We are sending a very clear message: NATO is here, NATO is strong and NATO is united,” Stoltenberg told assembled Polish, Romanian, Spanish and Portuguese soldiers.

Russia accuses NATO of trying to encircle it and threatening stability in Eastern Europe, which NATO denies. Around the Black Sea, Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey are NATO members while Georgia and Ukraine aspire to join.

The NATO force aims to develop its presence in the Black Sea region, rich in oil and gas, without escalating tensions as it seeks to counter Russia’s own plans to create what military analysts say is a “buffer zone”.

The 2008 Russian operation to put troops in Georgia’s South Ossetia region, its support for separatists in eastern Ukraine since 2014 and its annexation of Crimea have raised the stakes, with all sides warning of a new, Cold-War style scenario.

Apart from Romania, Poland is the biggest troop contributor. Bulgaria, Italy and Portugal will train regularly with the force in Craiova, and Germany is also expected to contribute.

In additional to existing NATO Black Sea naval patrols, a maritime presence will include more allied visits to Romanian and Bulgarian ports, training and exercises.

‘WEST BERLIN’ MODEL

Some Eastern Europeans want NATO’s new ballistic missile defense shield, which includes a site in Romania, to be part of NATO’s eastern posture vis-a-vis Russia.

Slideshow (6 Images)

“The Aegis Ashore system would add another level of deterrence,” said Maciej Kowalski, an analyst at the Polish Casimir Pulaski Foundation, referring to the U.S.-built system.

NATO says the system is to intercept any Iranian rockets.

As in the Baltics and Poland, where the U.S.-led alliance has some 4,000 troops, NATO says the relatively light multinational model recalls allied support for West Berlin in the 1950s, when the presence of British, French and U.S. forces ensured the Soviet Union could not control all of Berlin.

Under NATO’s founding treaty, an attack on one ally is an attack on all, meaning all 28 NATO nations would be required to respond in the case of any potential Russian aggression.

While months in planning, the establishment of the force comes as Russia winds down its biggest war games since 2013. The Zapad, or West, games showed off Moscow’s latest weaponry and its ability to quickly mass forces on NATO’s borders.

The enhanced NATO presence in Romania and Bulgaria marks a diplomatic success for Bucharest, which gained greater persuasive power because it is set to reach a NATO goal of spending 2 percent of economic output on defense this year, a priority for U.S. President Donald Trump.

Romania pushed for bigger NATO naval presence on the Black Sea for more than a year, but found its neighbor Bulgaria wary of provoking Russia.

Turkey supports only limited NATO reinforcements, concerned about breaking international rules limiting the scale of patrols in the Black Sea.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar steadied close to its highest level in ten weeks on Monday, with strong U.S. wages data at the end of last week giving investors confidence that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates in December.

Sterling was the biggest mover among developed-market currencies, recovering as much as 0.9 percent on signs that a plot to topple Prime Minister Theresa May would not be successful, easing political uncertainty a touch.

The greenback reached 14-year highs at the start of 2017, but it had spent most of the rest of the year weakening, as weak economic data as well as doubts over U.S. President Donald Trump’s ability to push through tax reforms weighed on the currency.

Since then, though, the dollar has recovered almost 3 percent against a basket of major currencies, on signs that Trump’s tax reform plans could be back on track, and on a firming-up of bets that the Fed will in December hike rates for the third time this year.

The closely watched non-farm payrolls report on Friday showed the first fall in U.S. employment in seven years, but investors reckoned that was down to the temporary effects of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, and focused on the largest gain in U.S. wages since December.

Some strategists, though, said the numbers were not enough to materially shift expectations for the Fed’s tightening path.

“Friday’s wage data were promising but the report was so distorted, I‘m not sure investors can take too much from them,” said Commerzbank currency strategist Esther Reichelt, in Frankfurt.

“I don’t think the market is looking further than the December meeting ... I think we’ll stay around these levels for the time being,” she added.

Data on Friday showed speculators cut their bearish bets on the U.S. dollar in the week up to last Tuesday.

The dollar index - which measures the greenback against a basket of six other major currencies - hit its highest since late July on the numbers, at 94.267. It traded close to that level on Monday, inching down 0.1 percent to 93.701.

Investors were focused on U.S. inflation and retail sales due later in the week, as well as minutes from the Fed’s latest policy meeting.

“The gradual firming of earnings growth supports the Fed’s plans to continue raising rates gradually, although it remains a concern that underlying inflation pressures have slowed this year,” wrote MUFG currency economist Lee Hardman in a note to clients.

Trade was thinned by public holidays in Japan, South Korea and the United States.

The New Zealand dollar touched a four-month low after a final vote count in the country’s tight general election released over the weekend failed to identify a clear winner.

The euro edged up 0.1 percent to $1.1745, up from Friday’s low of $1.1669 - its weakest level since Aug. 17.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Toronto home sales plunged in September from a year earlier and prices were down 15.5 percent from their April peak, but sales and prices inched up from August, suggesting housing in Canada’s largest city may be stabilizing, data showed on Wednesday.

Sales fell 35.1 percent from September 2016, the Toronto Real Estate Board (TREB) said in a report. It was the sixth straight month of declining year-on-year sales after a years-long boom that sparked fears of a bubble.

The average selling price was up 2.6 percent compared with a year earlier, while new listings and days on the market both rose, TREB said. Market watchers have been waiting to see if buyers and sellers would come back to the market after taking to the sidelines during the traditionally slow summer months.

The average selling price for all home types combined was C$775,546 ($621,680), down 15.5 percent from a peak of C$918,285 in April.

The Ontario government introduced multiple measures in late April, including a foreign buyers tax, in a bid to cool the housing market in Toronto and the surrounding areas.

“The improvement in listings in September compared to a year earlier suggests that home owners are anticipating an uptick in sales activity as we move through the fall,” TREB President Tim

Syrianos said in a statement.

”As we move through the fourth quarter we could see some buyers moving off the sidelines, taking advantage of a better-supplied marketplace,” he added.

New listings rose 9.4 percent from a year earlier, while active listings were up 69.0 percent as properties sit on the market for longer.

The Bank of Canada has begun what most analysts believe will be a gradual process of raising interest rates from near historic lows, which has in turn boosted mortgage rates and other borrowing costs.

The central bank raised its key rate by a total of 50 basis points to 1.00 percent in two back-to-back moves in July and September, and some expect at least one more hike before the end of the year.","Toronto home sales fall again, prices down 15.5 percent from peak",https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCAKCN1C91FI-OCADN

UNLVR.L

The 3-second video clip, posted on Dove’s U.S. Facebook page on Friday, reminded some social media users of racist soap adverts from the 19th century or early 20th century that showed black people scrubbing their skin to become white.

Dove removed the clip and apologized, saying on Twitter that the post had “missed the mark in representing women of color thoughtfully”.

But the apology failed to stem a torrent of online criticism, with some social media users calling for a boycott of Dove products, while conventional media outlets in the United States and Europe were also seizing on the story.

In Britain, the controversy featured prominently in Monday’s television breakfast shows, with guests debating how the ad got through the company’s approval process and whether it was indicative of a broader problem with racism in marketing.

On Twitter, posts including the hashtag #BoycottDove, which started over the weekend among U.S. users, were appearing in multiple European languages.

“In short, racism is back in fashion and brands are looking to benefit,” wrote user @Beatrix B. in French.

In the full clip, the black woman removed her t-shirt to reveal the white woman, who then lifted her own top to reveal an Asian woman.

“The short video was intended to convey that Dove body wash is for every woman and be a celebration of diversity, but we got it wrong,” Dove said in a statement.

The black-to-white transition was reminiscent in the eyes of some viewers of infamous soap ads from history, some of which were posted on social media.

In one example from the 1880s, a black child is pictured bathing in a tub while a white child offers him a bar of soap. After using the soap, the black child looks delighted to see that his skin has turned white.

Dove declined to say how the ad was produced and approved. It said it was “re-evaluating our internal processes for creating and approving content”.

A previous Dove ad, which showed three women side by side in front of a before-and-after image of cracked and smooth skin, caused an uproar in 2011 because the woman positioned on the “before” side was black while the “after” woman was white. Dove said at the time all three were supposed to “demonstrate the ‘after’ product benefit”.",Dove faces PR disaster over ad that showed black woman turning white,https://in.reuters.com/article/unilever-dove-advert/dove-faces-pr-disaster-over-ad-that-showed-black-woman-turning-white-idINKBN1CE16X

GENEVA (Reuters) - Geneva prosecutors are investigating after toilets in a bank and three restaurants were blocked by about $100,000 in high-denomination euro banknotes, they said on Monday.

“We are not so interested in the motive but we want to be sure of the origin of the money,” spokesman Vincent Derouand said, adding that neither throwing money away nor blocking a toilet was a crime.

The Tribune de Geneve newspaper, which first reported the unusual deposit, said the first blockage occurred in the toilet serving the vault at UBS bank (UBSG.S) in Geneva’s financial district, and three nearby bistros found their facilities bunged up with 500-euro notes a few days later.

Derouand said two people had agreed to compensate the restaurants for the costs of the blockage, and the restaurants had withdrawn a complaint that they made when the incident happened in May.

The cash was confiscated during the investigation and it was unclear who would get it if it was found to be lawful. There was no immediate reason to think it was dirty money, Derouand said.

The European Central Bank said last year it had decided to discontinue the 500-euro note because of concerns that it was being used too often for illicit activities including money laundering.

The ECB last week issued new proposals that will force banks from 2018 to set aside more cash against newly classified bad loans and, early next year, could revise recent guidelines for the reduction of the soured debt stock.

Italy - whose banks hold nearly 30 percent of the bloc’s 915 billion euro bad loans - has reacted angrily to the proposals, asking the ECB to soften them following a public consultation that runs until Dec. 8.

“We have found already a solution for non-performing loans going forward (but) we are still concerned we have to deal with the existing stock,” Mersch told a conference at Milan’s Bocconi University when asked about Italy’s worries over the new rules and whether they would apply only to new NPLs.

His comments weighed on Italian banking stocks, traders said, making BPER Banca (EMII.MI) the biggest loser among blue-chips with a 3.6 percent drop, followed by Banco BPM (BAMI.MI) which fell 2.6 percent and UBI Banca (UBI.MI), down 1.8 percent.

Lengthy recovery procedures put Italian banks at a disadvantage as the new rules require lenders to set aside cash at regular intervals against loan losses.

Mersch acknowledged bad loans were a bigger problem for some countries, but said that the euro zone’s financial system had to shed risks so that its integration could progress.

“If we have rules in Europe, we cannot always put forward cultural exceptions, especially if these cultural exceptions are ... home-made,” he said.

“Bankruptcy laws are still a national competence and judiciary reform is a national competence. So in order to speed up the European banking union... you need to bring your own house in order in every country.”

Separately, the ECB also said on Monday that 51 unnamed large euro zone banks are leaving themselves exposed to a sudden change in interest rates and may need to aside more capital against that risk.

STIMULUS

Asked whether the ECB this month should provide a firm date to end its quantitative easing program, Mersch said: “While it is true that the outlook has considerably improved, broadly-based, geographically and also across different sectors, it is also true that we have seen some disappointments in the development of inflationary pressures.”

He added that the ECB still needed to process the latest data and incorporate them into its policy decision.

Mersch is considered a hawk, more aligned with the German-led camp, but his comments on Monday suggest support for the “patience and persistence” approach advocated by ECB President Mario Draghi.

The Madrid government, grappling with Spain’s biggest political crisis since an attempted military coup in 1981, made it clear on Monday it would respond immediately to any such unilateral declaration.

A week on from a referendum on independence which the government did its utmost to thwart, more signs were emerging that the fraught situation was also taking its toll on the business climate of Spain’s wealthiest region.

Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont is due to address the regional parliament on Tuesday afternoon and the Madrid government is worried it will vote for a unilateral declaration of independence.

Catalan officials say people voted overwhelmingly for secession in the ballot, which was declared illegal by the government and was marked by police violence against independence supporters.

But the issue has deeply divided the northeastern region itself as well the Spanish nation. Hundreds of thousands of unionists took to the streets of Barcelona at the weekend to protest against the region breaking away.

Buoyed by the show of support, Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaría said on Monday: “I‘m calling on the sensible people in the Catalan government...don’t jump off the edge because you’ll take the people with you.”

“If there is a unilateral declaration of independence there will be decisions made to restore law and democracy,” Saenz de Santamaría told COPE radio station.

Backing also came from European heavyweights Germany and France.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke to Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy on Saturday about the crisis, her spokesman said on Monday. She stressed her support for Spain’s unity but also encouraged more dialogue.

France said it would not recognise Catalonia if the region unilaterally declared independence. Doing so would lead to Catalonia’s automatic exit from the European Union, it said.

“This crisis needs to be resolved through dialogue at all levels of Spanish politics,” France’s European affairs minister Nathalie Loiseau said.

The European Union has shown no interest in an independent Catalonia, despite an appeal by Puigdemont for Brussels to mediate in the crisis.

NEW ELECTIONS?

Under Catalonia’s referendum law, deemed unconstitutional by Madrid, a vote for independence in the assembly on Tuesday would start a six-month process that would envisage divorce talks with Spain before regional elections and a final act of separation.

Rajoy has not ruled out the so-called “nuclear option” of removing Catalonia’s government and calling new regional elections if it claims independence.

He gained some political cover for such a move on Monday when opposition Socialist leader Pedro Sanchez said in Barcelona he would “support the response of the rule of law in the face of any attempt to break social harmony”.

Sanchez stopped short, however, of explicitly saying his party would back dissolving the regional parliament, a possibility written into the 1978 constitution.

Losing Catalonia, which has its own language and culture, would deprive Spain of a fifth of its economic output and more than a quarter of exports. A stream of Catalonia-based firms and banks have moved their legal bases outside the region.

The boards of Catalonia-based infrastructure firm Abertis (ABE.MC), telecoms company Cellnex (CLNX.MC) and property group Inmobiliaria Colonial (COL.MC) will meet on Monday to discuss moving, sources said.

Banks Caixabank (CABK.MC) and Sabadell (SABE.MC) have already resolved to leave the region.

The crisis has also reopened old divisions in a nation where the right-wing dictatorship of General Francisco Franco is a living memory easily revived by strong displays of nationalism.

Among many moderate Spaniards there is widespread opposition to a breakaway, including in Catalonia. Regional authorities say about 90 percent of those who voted in the referendum backed secession, but turnout was 43 percent, with most unionists boycotting it.

Sunday's demonstration in the Catalan capital helped calm Spanish markets on Monday, along with comments on Friday from credit rating agencies Moody's and DBRS that they expected Spain to remain united. Spanish borrowing costs fell to a one-week low and the main share index .IBEX touched a week high.

Puigdemont appeared resolute in a television interview on Sunday, saying the region’s referendum law called for a declaration of independence in the event of a “yes” vote.

“We will apply what the law says,” he told TV3.

Catalonia’s High Court asked for more security in case independence is declared, specifically drafting in the national police, who were called in to stop the referendum when the Catalan police force failed to act.

Madrid sent thousands of national police to the region to prevent the vote. About 900 people were injured when officers used rubber bullets and batons against voters in scenes that shocked Spain and the world, and escalated the dispute.

Under a blueprint for independence drawn up by the Catalan parliament last month, the High court would be turned into a new Supreme Court of Catalonia.

Puigdemont said on Sunday he had not been in contact with the Madrid government for some time because it refused to discuss independence.

“What is happening in Catalonia is real, whether they like it or not. Millions of people have voted, who want to decide. We have to talk about this,” he said.

CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt’s capital crackled with fireworks and blared with horns as the soccer-crazy country reached the World Cup for the first time in 28 years as rare scenes of joy took hold of city blocks celebrating a 2-1 victory over Congo.

Winger Mohamed Salah scored twice, securing victory with a last-gasp penalty to put Egypt four points clear with one match left in their African group E qualifying campaign.

The win clinched Egypt a long-awaited spot in Russia for the 2018 World Cup finals, where the Arab world’s most populous country will compete on football’s ultimate stage for the first time since Italy in 1990.

“It’s been 28 years and we’re finally going to enter the World Cup. Today is a day of celebration for the entire country,” said 41-year-old Gaber Fathy.

The raucous mood spilling out on the streets marked a respite for Egyptians after years of hardship, from IMF-backed austerity reforms that have pushed inflation to record highs to a tough law on protests that has made public gatherings exceedingly rare after two presidents were toppled since a 2011 uprising.

“You can look around and see how people are happy. This is something you never witness in Egypt,” said 23-year-old Gamal Mohamed in downtown Cairo’s Tahrir Square, the iconic centre of the country’s once-active protest movement, which has since been quashed by tough security measures.

Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi congratulated the Egyptian people after the match as tireless fans draped in flags turned the streets into an impromptu parade of red, white and black.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Google has discovered Russian operatives spent tens of thousands of dollars on ads on its YouTube, Gmail and Google Search products in an effort to meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, a person briefed on the company’s probe told Reuters on Monday.

The ads do not appear to be from the same Kremlin-affiliated entity that bought ads on Facebook Inc, but may indicate a broader Russian online disinformation effort, according to the source, who was not authorized to discuss details of Google’s confidential investigation.

The revelation is likely to fuel further scrutiny of the role that Silicon Valley technology giants may have unwittingly played during last year’s election. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Moscow’s goal was to help elect Donald Trump.

Google has uncovered less than $100,000 in ad spending potentially linked to Russian actors, the source said.

Both Twitter Inc and Facebook recently detected and disclosed that suspected Russian operatives, working for a content farm known as the Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg, Russia, used their platforms to purchase ads and post content that was politically divisive in a bid to influence Americans before and after the November 2016 presidential election.

The Internet Research Agency employ hundreds of so-called “trolls” who post pro-Kremlin content, much of it fake or discredited, under the guise of phony social media accounts that posed as American or European, according to lawmakers and researchers.

Facebook announced last month it had unearthed $100,000 in spending by the Internet Research Agency and, under pressure from lawmakers, has pledged to be more transparent about how its ads are purchased and targeted.

Google’s review had been more robust than ones undertaken so far by Facebook or Twitter, the source said.

Russia’s ad purchases were first reported by the Washington Post.

Google, owned by Alphabet Inc, did not deny the story, and in a statement pointed to its existing ad policies that limit political ad targeting and prohibit targeting based on race or religion.

“We are taking a deeper look to investigate attempts to abuse our systems, working with researchers and other companies, and will provide assistance to ongoing inquiries,” a Google spokeswoman said on Monday.

Google runs the world’s largest online advertising business and YouTube is the world’s largest online video site.

Congressional committees have launched multiple investigations into the Russian interference. Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have said Russia intended to sow discord in the United States, spread propaganda and sway the election.

Google officials have been invited to testify publicly about Russian attempts to use their platforms to influence the election before both the House and Senate intelligence committees on Nov. 1 alongside Facebook and Twitter.

EDMONTON, Alberta (Reuters) - The Somali immigrant charged with attempted murder in connection with a weekend vehicle and knife attack in Edmonton, Alberta, was detained in the United States pending deportation before claiming refugee status in Canada, U.S. officials said on Tuesday.

Abdulahi Hasan Sharif, 30, is accused of running down a police officer with his car on Saturday night and then stabbing him repeatedly. Police said he fled before driving a U-Haul truck into four pedestrians during an attempt to evade capture.

Sharif was in custody in the United States for about four months in the summer and autumn of 2011, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) spokeswoman Lauren Mack said in a statement.

He was ordered deported to Somalia but released on an “order of supervision” on Nov. 23, 2011. Sharif did not appear for a scheduled meeting in January 2012, and efforts to locate him “were not successful,” the statement said.

Sharif “had no known criminal history at the time of his encounters with ICE,” the ICE statement added.

Canadian Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said Sharif made a refugee claim at a Canadian border crossing in 2012 and obtained refugee status later that year.

In 2015, a complaint led police to probe Sharif’s alleged extremist ideology, but officers found no grounds for criminal charges after what the Royal Canadian Mounted Police described as an “exhaustive investigation.”

Goodale said on Monday it would be wrong to blame the attack on any shortcomings in Canada’s immigration and refugee vetting system.

Sharif, who faces 11 charges including five counts of attempted murder, appeared via video in an Edmonton court on Tuesday wearing an orange jail uniform. He had a Somali interpreter, although he did not speak.

He occasionally looked down or clasped his hands in front of him and still bore facial bruises that police say he sustained while evading capture.

A community leader, Mahamad Accord, who did not speak to Sharif but learned about him from the local Somali community, said Sharif was from a Somali ethnic minority and little known in the community.

Edmonton police did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Sharif’s lawyer, Chady Moustarah, said he had stepped in on short notice to help someone without representation but that the accused would have to find another lawyer going forward.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrat Dianne Feinstein, the oldest current U.S. senator, said on Monday she was “all in” to run for re-election next year in her home state of California.

In a post on Twitter, Feinstein, 84, said there is “lots more to do: ending gun violence, combating climate change, access to healthcare. I’m all in!”

Feinstein, who was first elected to the Senate in 1992, is the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee and the first woman to hold that role. She is also a senior member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and was the first woman to lead that panel, from 2009 through 2015.

Feinstein has been a leading advocate for stricter gun safety laws for decades, and last week introduced legislation that would ban so-called bump stocks. The devices, which were used in the attack that killed 58 people at an outdoor concert in Las Vegas on Oct. 1, enable some rifles to be used like automatic weapons.

Stockholm (Reuters) - Der US-Verhaltensökonomen Richard Thaler erhält den Nobelpreis für Wirtschaft.

Seine Arbeit habe eine Brücke geschlagen zwischen den wirtschaftlichen und psychologischen Analysen der Entscheidungsprozesse von Individuen, begründete die Königlich-Schwedische Akademie der Wissenschaften am Montag in Stockholm die Entscheidung. “Seine empirischen Befunde und theoretischen Einsichten waren maßgeblich für die Schaffung des neuen und schnell wachsenden Gebiets der Verhaltensökonomie, die einen tiefgehenden Einfluss auf viele Bereiche der wirtschaftlichen Forschung und Politik gehabt hat.” Thaler arbeitet an der University of Chicago.

In der Fachwelt erhielt die Akademie für ihre Entscheidung Beifall. “Richard Thalers Forschung ist hochaktuell und bietet nicht nur neue Einsichten, sondern auch praktische Lebenshilfen”, sagte der Präsident des Münchner Ifo-Instituts, Clemens Fuest. “Er hat in seiner Forschung gezeigt, dass Menschen häufig nicht vollständig rational handeln, sondern eher einfachen Entscheidungsregeln folgen.” Als Beispiel nannte Fuest einen Taxifahrer, der als generelle Regel so lange fährt, bis er einen bestimmten Umsatz erreicht an. An Tagen mit hoher Nachfrage höre er früher auf, an Tagen mit schwacher Nachfrage dagegen später. “Wenn viele Fahrgäste gerne ein Taxi hätten, wird das Angebot verknappt, und wenn wenige Gäste da sind, steigt das Angebot”, erklärte Fuest. “Genau das Gegenteil wäre notwendig.”

Mit seiner Arbeit hat es der 72-Jährige bis nach Hollywood geschafft. In dem Film “The Big Short” - in dem es um das Entstehen der Finanzkrise 2007/08 geht - spielte Thaler in einem Kurzauftritt sich selbst. Gemeinsam mit Selena Gomez erklärt er dabei in einem Spielcasino, wie das Geschäft mit synthetischen “Collateralized Debt Obligations” (CDO) die Finanzkrise befeuerte, die die Weltwirtschaft in ihre schwerste Rezession seit Ende des Zweiten Weltkriegs stürzte.

Wirtschaftsministerin Brigitte Zypries findet die Preisverleihung an Thaler ebenfalls gerechtfertigt. “Seine Forschungsleistung im Bereich Verhaltensökonomik wurde zurecht geehrt und verdeutlicht, dass sich die ökonomische Forschung zunehmend den Erkenntnissen der Psychologie und anderen Disziplinen öffnet”, sagte sie. Die Erkenntnisse der Verhaltensökonomik würden auch für die wirtschaftspolitische Analyse immer wichtiger. “Denn die Wahrnehmungen von Fairness oder Selbstbeherrschung haben Einfluss auf unser wirtschaftliches Handeln.”

Der Nobelpreis im Fach Wirtschaftswissenschaften wird seit Ende der 60er Jahre verliehen. Er wird von der schwedischen Notenbank gestiftet und ist mit neun Millionen Kronen (etwa 900.000 Euro) dotiert. 2016 war der Preis an die in den USA lehrenden Vertragstheoretiker Oliver Hart und Bengt Holmström verliehen worden, 2015 an den britischen Ökonom Angus Deaton für seine Analysen zu den Themen Konsum, Armut und Sozialhilfe.

LONDON (Reuters) - British defence company BAE Systems will announce more than 1,000 job cuts this week, mainly affecting its Warton plant in Lancashire, northern England, where it assembles the Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jet, Sky News said on Monday.

BAE Systems, which employs 34,600 people in Britain, has already slowed production of the jet while it awaits an expected major order from Saudi Arabia.

Chief Executive Charles Woodburn, who recently took over from Ian King, said in August he was confident about future orders for the aircraft, which is a joint project between BAE, France’s Airbus and Italy’s Finmeccanica.

The Typhoon has won fewer orders this year than the rival Rafale built by France’s Dassault Aviation, although Qatar agreed to buy 24 Typhoons in September.

BAE said in August that any new orders were unlikely to impact production delivery rates positively for at least 24 months, and production would be under constant review.

“We obviously have to review our (Typhoon) production demand very carefully,” Woodburn said in August.

Sky News said BAE would also trim its workforce at other locations, with the total number of job losses coming in at “well over 1,000”.

The company told Sky News: “BAE Systems continually reviews its operations to make sure we are performing as effectively and efficiently as possible, delivering our commitments to existing customers and ensuring we are best placed to secure future business.”

“If and when there are any changes proposed we are committed to communicating with our employees and their representatives first.”

BAE was not immediately available for further comment.

Reuters analysis of federal jobs data shows that out of 656,000 new manufacturing jobs created between 2010 and 2014, two thirds can be attributed to foreign direct investment.

More recent jobs numbers are not yet available, but over $700 billion in foreign capital has poured in over the last two years bringing total foreign investment to $3.7 trillion at the end of 2016, a world record.

Now foreign companies that have spent billions of dollars on U.S. factories and local leaders who host them worry that global supply networks that back those investments will fray if Trump makes good on his pledge to roll back trade liberalization.

The U.S. president has threatened to tear up North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico and slap higher tariffs on nations that run trade surpluses with the United States, such as Germany or China. The administration is also discussing tighter immigration rules and more security screening of investment.

The tough message helped sway swing northeastern and Midwestern Rust Belt states Trump’s way in the 2016 election, but puts him at odds with companies and local leaders in the south, which has driven the recent growth in manufacturing jobs.

The southern states have voted for Trump, but have also spent decades wooing foreign companies with flexible labor laws, financial incentives and investment in ports, roads and other infrastructure.

POSTER CHILD AND WHIPPING BOY

The courtship has spawned new auto plants from Kentucky to Georgia, and a new Airbus (AIR.PA) plant in Mobile, Alabama.

Few places highlight the gap between Trump’s rhetoric and local aspirations better than Spartanburg in South Carolina.

German carmaker BMW (BMWG.DE) has invested here $8 billion in a 1.2 million square foot (11.15 hectares) assembly plant, which has become the largest single exporter of cars by value from the United States.

South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster, a Republican and Trump supporter, credits the German automaker for putting his state on the global investment map.

“The presence of this company changed everything in the trajectory of our state,” McMaster said on Monday at an event unveiling BMW’s newest X3 sports utility vehicle.

Its Chief Executive Harald Krueger said the carmaker would invest additional $600 million in Spartanburg over the next four years, adding 1,000 jobs to the 9,000-strong workforce, and spend further $200 million on employee training and education.

But the poster child of South Carolina’s success also doubles as a whipping boy. In January, BMW’s plans to build a plant in Mexico drew Trump’s ire and last month the U.S. president was quoted as saying Germany was “very bad” on trade and selling too many cars in the United States.

And even as the company highlights its contribution to the U.S. economy and the benefits of free trade, it is hedging its bets by preparing for a possible protectionist backlash.

Outside of the spotlight, BMW is retooling factories in South Africa and China to build volume models like the X3 SUV, reducing its dependence on Spartanburg.

“We have a big footprint here, and we are flexible enough,“ Oliver Zipse, BMW’s board member responsible for manufacturing, told Reuters. ”We will build the X3 not only in Spartanburg, we will split it into South Africa and then to China, so we will have some flexibility to produce cars somewhere else,” he said.

“If something happens at the political level - which we don’t know yet - we are able to have a flexible response.”

The Trump administration has said it welcomes foreign investment and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, who spoke at an opening of a new Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) plant in South Carolina, said such projects showed that ”America is becoming an even stronger destination for global businesses looking to grow.”

The southern U.S. states owe much of their success to coastal port authorities and cities that have invested heavily to make their channels and docks fit for shipments to and from China and Mexico.

Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina who has often clashed with Trump, said protectionism would undermine those accomplishments and hurt American workers.

DOOMSDAY SCENARIO

“Negotiate a trade agreement with Europe, modernize NAFTA, don’t tear it up,” Graham told Reuters at the BMW factory. “We’re going in the wrong direction. We need more trade agreements, not less.”

Graham noted how low-cost competition from China and Mexico destroyed South Carolina’s once thriving textile industry and how the state reinvented itself as a manufacturing hub, bringing the likes of BMW or French tire maker Michelin (MICP.PA).

The now humming port city of Charleston has a similar story to tell. When a major navy base shut down in the 1990s wiping out 20,000 jobs, local officials worked to bring foreign manufacturers, which now employ around 10,000 in the three counties around the city and more is set to come.

Mercedes-Benz, part of Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE), is adding 1,300 jobs so it can make its Sprinter van here rather than merely assemble it with imported parts, which also means more business for local suppliers.

Up the road, Volvo Car Group, part of Chinese conglomerate Geely [GEELY.UL], is due to open its first North American plant next year with a target workforce of 2,000.

Local development officials expect more jobs and investment to come, but worry that some steps discussed by the Trump administration could have a chilling effect.

Claire Gibbons, director of global marketing at the Charleston Regional Development Alliance, said the proposed new tariffs, tougher immigration rules and stricter reviews of foreign investment projects would amount to a “doomsday scenario” for the region.

“This is an education opportunity for us all, for the people making the decisions that don’t understand the ramifications.”

The Madrid government, grappling with Spain’s biggest political crisis since an attempted military coup in 1981, made it clear on Monday it would respond immediately to any such unilateral declaration.

A week on from a referendum on independence which the government did its utmost to thwart, more signs were emerging that the fraught situation was also taking its toll on the business climate of Spain’s wealthiest region.

Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont is due to address the regional parliament on Tuesday afternoon and the Madrid government is worried it will vote for a unilateral declaration of independence.

Catalan officials say people voted overwhelmingly for secession in the ballot, which was declared illegal by the government and was marked by police violence against independence supporters.

But the issue has deeply divided the northeastern region itself as well the Spanish nation. Hundreds of thousands of unionists took to the streets of Barcelona at the weekend to protest against the region breaking away.

Buoyed by the show of support, Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaría said on Monday: “I‘m calling on the sensible people in the Catalan government... don’t jump off the edge because you’ll take the people with you.”

“If there is a unilateral declaration of independence there will be decisions made to restore law and democracy,” Saenz de Santamaría told COPE radio station.

Backing also came from European heavyweights Germany and France.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke to Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy on Saturday about the crisis, her spokesman said on Monday. She stressed her support for Spain’s unity but also encouraged more dialogue.

France said it would not recognize Catalonia if the region unilaterally declared independence. Doing so would lead to Catalonia’s automatic exit from the European Union, it said.

“This crisis needs to be resolved through dialogue at all levels of Spanish politics,” France’s European affairs minister Nathalie Loiseau said.

The European Union has shown no interest in an independent Catalonia, despite an appeal by Puigdemont for Brussels to mediate in the crisis.

NEW ELECTIONS?

Under Catalonia’s referendum law, deemed unconstitutional by Madrid, a vote for independence in the assembly on Tuesday would start a six-month process that would envisage divorce talks with Spain before regional elections and a final act of separation.

Rajoy has not ruled out the so-called “nuclear option” of removing Catalonia’s government and calling new regional elections if it claims independence.

He gained some political cover for such a move on Monday when opposition Socialist leader Pedro Sanchez said in Barcelona he would “support the response of the rule of law in the face of any attempt to break social harmony”.

Sanchez stopped short, however, of explicitly saying his party would back dissolving the regional parliament, a possibility written into the 1978 constitution.

Losing Catalonia, which has its own language and culture, would deprive Spain of a fifth of its economic output and more than a quarter of exports. A stream of Catalonia-based firms and banks have moved their legal bases outside the region.

The boards of Catalonia-based infrastructure firm Abertis (ABE.MC), telecoms company Cellnex (CLNX.MC) and property group Inmobiliaria Colonial (COL.MC) will meet on Monday to discuss moving, sources said.

Banks Caixabank (CABK.MC) and Sabadell (SABE.MC) have already resolved to leave the region.

The crisis has also reopened old divisions in a nation where the right-wing dictatorship of General Francisco Franco is a living memory easily revived by strong displays of nationalism.

Among many moderate Spaniards there is widespread opposition to a breakaway, including in Catalonia. Regional authorities say about 90 percent of those who voted in the referendum backed secession, but turnout was 43 percent, with most unionists boycotting it.

Sunday's demonstration in the Catalan capital helped calm Spanish markets on Monday, along with comments on Friday from credit rating agencies Moody's and DBRS that they expected Spain to remain united. Spanish borrowing costs fell to a one-week low and the main share index .IBEX touched a week high.

Puigdemont appeared resolute in a television interview on Sunday, saying the region’s referendum law called for a declaration of independence in the event of a “yes” vote.

“We will apply what the law says,” he told TV3.

Catalonia’s High Court asked for more security in case independence is declared, specifically drafting in the national police, who were called in to stop the referendum when the Catalan police force failed to act.

Madrid sent thousands of national police to the region to prevent the vote. About 900 people were injured when officers used rubber bullets and batons against voters in scenes that shocked Spain and the world, and escalated the dispute.

Under a blueprint for independence drawn up by the Catalan parliament last month, the High court would be turned into a new Supreme Court of Catalonia.

Puigdemont said on Sunday he had not been in contact with the Madrid government for some time because it refused to discuss independence.

“What is happening in Catalonia is real, whether they like it or not. Millions of people have voted, who want to decide. We have to talk about this,” he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar steadied close to its highest level in ten weeks on Monday, with strong U.S. wages data at the end of last week giving investors confidence that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates in December.

Sterling was the biggest mover among developed-market currencies, recovering as much as 0.9 percent on signs that a plot to topple Prime Minister Theresa May would not be successful, easing political uncertainty a touch.

The greenback reached 14-year highs at the start of 2017, but it had spent most of the rest of the year weakening, as weak economic data as well as doubts over U.S. President Donald Trump’s ability to push through tax reforms weighed on the currency.

Since then, though, the dollar has recovered almost 3 percent against a basket of major currencies, on signs that Trump’s tax reform plans could be back on track, and on a firming-up of bets that the Fed will in December hike rates for the third time this year.

The closely watched non-farm payrolls report on Friday showed the first fall in U.S. employment in seven years, but investors reckoned that was down to the temporary effects of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, and focused on the largest gain in U.S. wages since December.

Some strategists, though, said the numbers were not enough to materially shift expectations for the Fed’s tightening path.

“Friday’s wage data were promising but the report was so distorted, I‘m not sure investors can take too much from them,” said Commerzbank currency strategist Esther Reichelt, in Frankfurt.

“I don’t think the market is looking further than the December meeting ... I think we’ll stay around these levels for the time being,” she added.

Data on Friday showed speculators cut their bearish bets on the U.S. dollar in the week up to last Tuesday.

The dollar index - which measures the greenback against a basket of six other major currencies - hit its highest since late July on the numbers, at 94.267. It traded close to that level on Monday, inching down 0.1 percent to 93.701.

Investors were focused on U.S. inflation and retail sales due later in the week, as well as minutes from the Fed’s latest policy meeting.

“The gradual firming of earnings growth supports the Fed’s plans to continue raising rates gradually, although it remains a concern that underlying inflation pressures have slowed this year,” wrote MUFG currency economist Lee Hardman in a note to clients.

Trade was thinned by public holidays in Japan, South Korea and the United States.

The New Zealand dollar touched a four-month low after a final vote count in the country’s tight general election released over the weekend failed to identify a clear winner.

The euro edged up 0.1 percent to $1.1745, up from Friday’s low of $1.1669 - its weakest level since Aug. 17.

(Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc said on Monday it would speed up the process for in-store returns of items bought on its website, just ahead of the busy holiday season, as it looks to steal a march on e-commerce giant Amazon.com.

Wal-Mart has been increasingly using its more than 4,700 stores to provide hassle-free shopping on its website - by offering services that allow customers to pick up products ordered online as well as make returns in store.

The new service aims to drastically reduce the time taken to return an item bought online, as the company battles Amazon’s aggressive moves to establish its own brick-and-mortar presence.

Under Wal-Mart’s Mobile Express Returns, starting in early November, customers can, for the first time, use the retailer’s app to initiate a return.

The process can then be completed at “express” lanes in a store by scanning a QR code and handing over the item, eliminating the need to wait in queues.

The new process reduces the time taken for returning products at stores to as little as 30 seconds from five minutes previously, said Daniel Eckert, head of Wal-Mart’s U.S. services and digital acceleration business.

The new returns process also allows customers to get refunds as soon as the next day. Some items, including shampoo and color cosmetics, will be eligible for instant refunds even without the products being returned in store, then company said.

Wal-Mart said it planned to extend the new process to items bought in its stores by early next year, and is working on a similar returns policy for items bought from third-party sellers on Walmart.com.

Wal-Mart is investing $2 billion into its online business and has snapped up a number of popular online retailers since last year, including Jet.com.

(Reuters) - Outside the Morgan County fair in McConnelsville, in a rural swath of Ohio that fervently backed U.S. President Donald Trump in last year’s election, ticket seller John Wilson quietly counts off a handful of disappointments with the man he helped elect.

The 70-year-old retired banker said he is unhappy with infighting and turnover in the White House. He does not like Trump’s penchant for travelling to his personal golf resorts. He wishes the president would do more to fix the healthcare system, and he worries that Trump might back down from his promise to force illegal immigrants out of the country.

“Every president makes mistakes,” Wilson said. “But if you add one on top of one, on top of another one, on top of another, there’s just a limit.”

Trump, who inspired millions of supporters last year in places like Morgan County, has been losing his grip on rural America.

According to the Reuters/Ipsos daily tracking poll, the Republican president’s popularity is eroding in small towns and rural communities where 15 percent of the country’s population lives. The poll of more than 15,000 adults in “non-metro” areas shows that they are now as likely to disapprove of Trump as they are to approve of him.

In September, 47 percent of people in non-metro areas approved of Trump while 47 percent disapproved. That is down from Trump’s first four weeks in office, when 55 percent said they approved of the president while 39 percent disapproved.

The poll found that Trump has lost support in rural areas among men, whites and people who never went to college. He lost support with rural Republicans and rural voters who supported him on Election Day.

And while Trump still gets relatively high marks in the poll for his handling of the economy and national security, rural Americans are increasingly unhappy with Trump’s record on immigration, a central part of his presidential campaign.

Forty-seven percent of rural Americans said in September they approved of the president’s handling of immigration, down from 56 percent during his first month in office.

Poll respondents who were interviewed by Reuters gave different reasons for their dissatisfaction with the president on immigration.

A few said they are tired of waiting for Trump to make good on his promise to build a wall along America’s southern border, while others said they were uncomfortable with his administration’s efforts to restrict travel into the United States.

“There should be some sort of compromise between a free flow of people over the border and something that’s more controlled,” said Drew Carlson, 19, of Warrensburg, Missouri, who took the poll.

But Trump’s “constant fixation on deportation is a little bit unsettling to me.”

The Trump administration would not comment about the Reuters/Ipsos poll. (For a graphic depicting poll results, see: tmsnrt.rs/2yuVIun)

To be sure, Trump is still much more popular in rural America than he is elsewhere.

Since he took office, “I like him less, but I support him more,” said Robert Cody, 87, a retired chemical engineer from Bartlesville, Oklahoma who took the poll.

Cody said that Trump may rankle some people with the way he talks and tweets, but it is a small price to pay for a president who will fight to strip away government regulations and strengthen the border.

DROPPING OFF THE SCREEN

When Trump called the election a ”last shot“ for the struggling coal industry and when he called for protecting the nation’s southern border with a “big, fat, beautiful wall”, he was speaking directly to rural America, said David Swenson, an economist at Iowa State University.

“Feelings of resentment and deprivation have pervaded a lot of these places,” Swenson said. “And here comes a candidate (Trump) who’s offering simplistic answers” to issues that concern them.

Rural Americans responded by supporting Trump over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton by 26 percentage points during the election, an advantage that helped tip the balance in battleground states, such as Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, where Trump won by less than 1 percentage point.

But after 10 months, many are still waiting to see concrete changes that could make life easier in rural America, said Karl Stauber, who runs a private economic development agency serving a patchwork of manufacturing communities in south central Virginia.

“Rural people are more cynical about the federal government than people in general are,” Stauber said. “They’ve heard so many promises, and they’ve not seen much done.”

Despite all the talk of bringing manufacturing jobs back, Stauber said he has not seen any companies which have relocated to his region, or anyone expand their workforce, due to new federal policies.

“It just seems like we’ve dropped off the screen,” he said.

According to the poll, Trump’s overall popularity has dropped gradually, and for different reasons, this year.

Rural Americans were increasingly unhappy with Trump’s handling of healthcare in March and April after he lobbied for a Republican plan to overhaul Obamacare and cut coverage for millions of Americans.

In May and June, they were more critical of Trump’s ability to carry out U.S. foreign policy, and they gave him lower marks for “the way he treats people like me.”

In August, they were increasingly unhappy with “the effort he’s making to unify the country” after he blamed “both sides” for the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, in which a suspected white nationalist drove his car into a crowd of anti-racist demonstrators.

The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English across the United States. It asked people to rate the president’s performance and the results were filtered for people who lived in zip codes that fell within counties designated as “non-metro” by the federal government.

The poll combined the results of “non-metro” respondents into nine, four-week periods. Each period included between 1,300 and 2,000 responses and had a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points.",Trump's popularity is slipping in rural America - poll,https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-ruralamerica-poll/trumps-popularity-is-slipping-in-rural-america-poll-idUKKBN1CE15S?il=0

The company expects approvals to be in place by the end of October, Sudhir Mathur told Reuters on the sidelines of the India Energy Forum in New Delhi, as Cairn undertakes a fresh investment plan after the extension of its production contract until 2030.

No debt will be raised for the investment, Mathur said, adding that the money will be spent over a period of three to four years.

Cairn Oil and Gas was formerly known as Cairn India before it merged with Anil Agarwal’s Indian mining major Vedanta Ltd. The business received got a shot in the arm in March when the government approved the extension of its production-sharing contract in the Barmer basin in Rajasthan.

The company had said earlier this year that it could invest more in further developing its four main Barmer fields on the condition its production-sharing contract was extended.

The fresh investments are part of the company’s plan to produce oil and gas in India beyond 2020, Mathur said.

Cairn will also start drilling for oil and gas in the Krishna-Godawari (KG) basin in the Bay of Bengal by the end of March.

“Difficult to say at this time but we believe it’s quite prospective ... We would say anywhere between 250 million to 500 mln barrels of reserves would make it very viable for us,” Mathur said.

“The investments include all projects and will start with the $1 billion dollars we have already announced.”

The projects, apart from KG basin, include its gas field in the Raageshwari field in Barmer and an enhanced oil recovery (EOR) programme in the Bhagyam and Aishwariya fields. EOR involves chemicals being pumped into ageing fields to help to recov crude oil.

The company is now planning to increase output from its Mangala field in Barmer under a second EOR phase, Mathur said.

Cairn will also announce within a month a technology partner for its Rajasthan block to help to expedite production.

Mathur said that Cairn is keen to partner state-owned explorers such as Oil and Natural Gas Corp or Oil India if the incentives are right.

India’s government is working on a proposal to bring private investment into ONGC and Oil India-owned blocks where production has been poor.

LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - Euro zone finance ministers were discussing on Monday the role of their bailout fund in the planned deepening of the economic integration of the 19 countries sharing the euro and whether the fund should backstop institutions in the EU’s banking union.

The fund -- the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) -- was created at the height of the sovereign debt crisis as a lender of last resort to euro zone governments. It has a lending capacity of 500 billion euros.

“It is the right time to discuss what is the future role of the ESM, its involvement in dealing with programs in member states, what is its role in the banking union,” European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis said.

“We are trying to emphasize the role of the ESM as a potential backstop for the Single Resolution Fund while bringing it into the community framework,” he said on entering monthly talks of euro zone finance ministers.

The Single Resolution Fund was created for the resolution of failing euro zone banks and is financed from annual bank contributions. It has so far accumulated 17 billion euros and is due to reach full capacity of around 55 billion euros in 2023.

Should it find before then that it needs more money than it has received from banks, it will need a backstop -- and ministers are likely to agree the ESM should play that role.

The ESM could potentially provide a similar underpinning for the yet-to-be-created European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS), which will insure deposits in all euro zone countries up to 100,000 euros if opposition from Germany can be overcome.

The ministers are also set to discuss whether to bring the ESM into the community framework -- EU jargon for changing the status of the ESM, now an institution owned by euro zone governments, into a European Union institution, like the European Commission or the European Central Bank.

The ministers will also discuss ideas to turn the ESM into a European Monetary Fund, a move that would eliminate the need to involve the International Monetary Fund or the European Central Bank in future euro zone crises like the one that was triggered by Greece and engulfed also Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Cyprus.

The talks in Luxembourg are part of a broader discussion among finance ministers from the 19 euro zone countries on how to better organize the single currency area and integrate it more deeply after Britain leaves the European Union in 2019.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Ericsson has picked the former boss of high-flying mining gear maker Atlas Copco as its new chairman, boosting hopes of a recovery at the Swedish mobile equipment company.

Shares in Ericsson rose as much as 2.2 percent on Monday after it said Ronnie Leten would succeed Leif Johansson as chairman, pending a shareholder vote planned for March 28. Johansson said in July he wanted to step down.

Investors said Leten, under whose leadership Atlas Copco shares rose twice as much as the European industrial sector index, was a good choice, despite a lack of experience in the telecoms sector.

“This mission is more about leading a work for change together with the CEO. Ronnie will manage that in an excellent way,” said Lars Soderfjell, a fund manager at Alandsbanken.

Ericsson has been hit hard by competition from China’s Huawei and Finland’s Nokia as well as weak emerging markets and falling spending by telecoms operators, with demand for next-generation 5G technology still years away. Its shares have almost halved in value in the past two years.

Earlier this year, it drafted in Borje Ekholm as its new CEO, but activist investor Cevian Capital, which has bought a more than 5-percent stake, has been pushing for further change.

Cevian Managing Partner Christer Gardell welcomed the choice of Leten, a 60-year old Belgian who stepped down as CEO of Atlas Copco earlier this year.

“He has an outstanding track record as value creator,” said Gardell, who is on Ericsson’s nomination committee, in an email.

Under Leten’s leadership, investors applauded Atlas Copco’s nimble cost structure and strong aftermarket sales that drove high margins and a robust cashflow.

Leten is also leaving his position as chairman at Electrolux, the home appliance maker said in a separate statement on Monday.

At 0950 GMT, Ericsson shares were up 1 percent at 47.20 Swedish crowns, while Electrolux’s were down 0.9 percent at 275.80 crowns.

Leten was seen by Swedish media and analysts as one of three likely candidates to become Ericsson’s chairman. The other two were Autoliv CEO Jan Carlson and Johan Molin, CEO of Assa Abloy.

“Mr Leten is a very skilled businessman, technically savvy and strategically versatile,” Johan Forssell, chairman of Ericsson’s nomination committee, said in a statement.

Ericsson also proposed Kurt Jofs as a new board member. Jofs was responsible for Ericsson’s networks business from 2003-2008 and is currently chairman of Finnish IT services company Tieto.",Recovery hopes rise as Ericsson picks ex-Atlas Copco boss as chairman,https://www.reuters.com/article/ericsson-chairman/recovery-hopes-rise-as-ericsson-picks-ex-atlas-copco-boss-as-chairman-idINKBN1CE0EW

COX‘S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Thousands of Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar fled to Bangladesh on Monday in a new surge of refugees driven by fears of starvation and violence the United Nations has denounced as ethnic cleansing.

About 519,000 Rohingya have crossed the border since Aug. 25, when attacks by Rohingya militants on security posts in Rakhine state sparked a ferocious military response.

The European Union (EU) is proposing shunning contact with Myanmar’s top generals as a first step towards new targeted sanctions to punish the military for the violence, according to a draft document seen by Reuters.

Reuters reporters on the Bangladeshi side of the border, in Palong Khali district, saw several thousand people crossing from northern Rakhine on Monday, filing along embankments between flooded fields and scrubby forest.

“Half of my village was burnt down. I saw them do it,” said Sayed Azin, 46, who said he had walked for eight days carrying his 80-year-old mother in a basket strung on a bamboo pole between him and his son.

Soldiers and Buddhist mobs had torched his village, he said.

“I left everything,” he said, sobbing. “I can’t find my relatives ... I can’t take this any more.”

Some new arrivals spoke of bloody attacks by Buddhist mobs on people trekking towards the border.

Refugees and rights groups say the army and Buddhist vigilantes have engaged in a campaign of killing and arson aimed at driving the Rohingya out of Myanmar.

Myanmar rejects accusations of ethnic cleansing and has labelled the militants from the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army who launched the initial attacks as terrorists who have killed civilians and burnt villages.

Among those fleeing were up to 35 people on a boat that capsized off the Bangladesh coast on Sunday. At least 12 of them drowned while 13 were rescued, Bangladeshi police said.

“We faced so many difficulties, for food and survival,” Sayed Hossein, 30, told Reuters, adding that his wife, three children, mother and father in law had drowned.

“We came here to save our lives.”

“GETTING WORSE”

Myanmar leader and Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi has faced scathing international criticism for not doing more to stop the violence, although she has no power over the security forces under a military-drafted constitution.

The United States and EU have been considering targeted sanctions against Myanmar military leaders, diplomats and officials have told Reuters, though they are wary of action that could destabilise the country’s transition to democracy.

EU foreign ministers will discuss the situation in Myanmar on Oct. 16, and their draft joint statement said the bloc “will suspend invitations to the commander-in-chief of the Myanmar/Burma armed forces and other senior military officers”.

Such a move would be largely symbolic, but could be followed by further action.

The Myanmar government has said its “clearance operations” against the militants ended in early September and people had no reason to flee. But in recent days the government has reported large numbers of Muslims preparing to leave, with more than 17,000 people in one area alone.

The government cited worries about food and security as their reasons.

Some villagers in Rakhine said food was running out because rice in the fields was not ready for harvest and the state government had closed village markets and restricted the transport of food, apparently to cut supplies to the militants.

“The situation’s getting worse. We have no food and no guarantee of security,” said a Rohingya resident of Hsin Hnin Pyar village on the south of the state’s Buthidaung district.

He said a lot of people were preparing to flee.

“While the Myanmar military has engaged in a campaign of violence, there is mounting evidence that Rohingya women, men and children are now also fleeing the very real threat of starvation,” rights group Amnesty International said.

Senior state government official Kyaw Swar Tun declined to go into details when asked about the food, except to ask: “Have you heard of anyone dying of hunger in Buthidaung?”

The reports of food shortages will add to the urgency of calls by aid agencies and the international community for unfettered humanitarian access to the conflict zone.

COMING, GOING

The insurgents declared a one-month ceasefire from Sept. 10 to enable the delivery of aid but the government rebuffed them, saying it did not negotiate with terrorists.

The ceasefire is due to end at midnight on Monday, but the insurgents said in a statement they were ready to respond to any peace move by the government.

The ability of the group to mount any sort of challenge to the army is unclear, but it does not appear to have been able to put up resistance to the latest military offensive.

Bangladesh was already home to 400,000 Rohingya who had fled earlier bouts of violence.

Mostly Buddhist Myanmar does not recognise the Rohingya as citizens, even though many have lived there for generations.

But even as refugees arrive, Bangladesh insists they will all have to go home. Myanmar has responded by saying it will take back those who can be verified as genuine refugees.

Many Rohingya fear they will not be able to prove their right to return.

HELSINKI (Reuters) - He runs a company that is a byword for technological innovation -- but Nokia’s chairman had no qualms about going back to school to learn more about artificial intelligence (AI).

Risto Siilasmaa, 51, said he signed up this summer for online courses on AI programming run by Stanford University.

“I realized that I don’t have deep enough knowledge on this phenomenon... Now I‘m back studying programming after 30 years,” he told Reuters on Friday by email.

“I do not want to become an AI programmer. I want to deeply understand the abilities and limitations of AI.”

Since starting the courses, Siilasmaa said he had briefed the Finnish telecom infrastructure firm’s board and managers on the subject.

“I want to raise awareness ...on this, because AI will be a key driver of the ongoing industrial revolution.”

Once the preserve of researchers, artificial intelligence has grabbed the attention of businesses from healthcare to financial services looking to use algorithms to parse data in search of patterns to solve problems.

Nokia aims to offer more sophisticated software to analyze the mountains of data that telecom network operators collect, in order to create more powerful and more personalized services.

Potential AI applications Nokia has begun to roll out this year include troubleshooting network bottlenecks and traffic analysis for use in driverless cars and “smart cities” filled with billions of network-linked devices.

Siilasmaa received plaudits for transforming the Finnish company from an ailing mobile phone manufacturer into one of the world’s biggest telecoms network equipment makers.

“I’ve noticed that when doing something ...that people are not used to see the chairman doing, that inspires people and encourages them to think out of the box,” he added.

Nokia sold the phone business to Microsoft in 2014, which has largely abandoned the mobile device market.

LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union’s banking watchdog will publish guidance on new EU hubs for lenders from Britain seeking a base in the bloc after Brexit, its chairman said on Monday.

Banks in London are looking to open or expand hubs in the EU to ensure they can continue serving customers there after Britain leaves the bloc in March 2019.

“In light of the decision of the UK to withdraw from the EU, the EBA has identified a series of areas that need common regulatory and supervisory approaches across the other 27 Member States of the EU, to support a smooth relocation process and avoid regulatory competition,” EBA Chairman Andrea Enria told the European Parliament.

“These include authorizations, approval of internal models, treatment of outsourcing, back-to-back operations and risk transfers, matters related to resolution and deposit guarantee schemes.”

The guidance will be published in the coming days, he said. It aims to stop regulators in Frankfurt, Paris, Amsterdam and elsewhere offering sweeteners to lure UK firms.

“We are fast reaching the point when the prime minister should assert the authority of her office over the negotiations and call time,” Bernard Jenkin, a Conservative lawmaker, wrote in the Guardian newspaper.
Asked whether he meant Britain should walk away if there was no progress at the October summit, Jenkin told Reuters: “Yes”.","LONDON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Britain and its European Union partners clashed on Monday over which side should make the next move to unblock Brexit talks, despite concerns they will miss a deadline for a divorce deal and that London is heading for a chaotic departure.

Prime Minister Theresa May made clear in speech she was to deliver to parliament that she hoped her EU partners would make proposals at a new round of talks opening the way to the next stage of negotiations, saying “the ball is in their court”.

But even before she had delivered the speech, an EU spokesman hit back in Brussels, saying “the ball is entirely in the UK court for the rest to happen”.

May is desperate to try to regain some of her authority and refocus on talks to unravel more than 40 years of union after a speech at her party conference last week, marred by a repetitive cough, a prankster and a stage malfunction, left her weaker than ever.

She has so far fought off attempts to unseat her by critics already angry over an ill-judged election when she lost her governing Conservatives’ majority, but her weakness has opened the door for many in her party to challenge her Brexit strategy with just 18 months to go before Britain leaves the EU.

With Brussels quietly preparing for a collapse in the talks and Britain getting ready for what May calls “all eventualities”, some officials and business chiefs worry the country will crash out of the EU without a deal.

Speaking in parliament later on Monday, May will say she is determined to secure a new partnership with the other 27 members of the wealthy political and trade bloc.

“Achieving that partnership will require leadership and flexibility, not just from us but from our friends, the 27 nations of the EU,” she will say, according to excerpts of her speech.

“And as we look forward to the next stage, the ball is in their court. But I am optimistic we will receive a positive response.”

But the EU was clear: “There is a clear sequencing to these talks and there has been so far no solution found on step one, which is the divorce proceedings,” European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas told a regular briefing.

“So the ball is entirely in the UK court for the rest to happen.”

“SEE WHAT HAPPENS”

May, who will host businesses later on Monday to listen to their Brexit concerns, is keen to push the talks beyond a discussion of the divorce to try to offer firms some certainty about future trading conditions.

A report that aerospace manufacturer BAE Systems (BAES.L) is planning to cut more than 1,000 jobs can only add pressure for May to press her case for the EU to move beyond talks on the divorce settlement, the rights of expatriates and the border with EU-member Ireland.

EU negotiators say that while they see no big breakthrough at the summit next week, they may offer May a hand by offering some hope of a shift at the next scheduled meeting in mid-December.

Aides to May have signaled that the prime minister has accepted that her October deadline will not be met despite a speech in Italy last month which attempted to reset the tone of the difficult negotiations.

Her spokesman told reporters: “Let’s see what happens in the next round of talks”.

But some pro-Brexit campaigners are calling on the prime minister to get ready to step away from the talks - underlining the deep divisions in the Conservative Party.

Those differences were aired again on Monday with negative briefings in the local media against finance minister Philip Hammond, who supports prolonging the status quo with the EU for as long as possible, and foreign minister Boris Johnson, who angered some Conservatives for setting his own Brexit red lines.

Some have suggested that May will reshuffle her cabinet, but on Monday her spokesman said she had full confidence in both ministers.

“We are fast reaching the point when the prime minister should assert the authority of her office over the negotiations and call time,” Bernard Jenkin, a Conservative lawmaker, wrote in the Guardian newspaper.

Asked whether he meant Britain should walk away if there was no progress at the October summit, Jenkin told Reuters: “Yes”.","Ball in your court: Britain, EU clash over next Brexit move",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-may/ball-in-your-court-britain-eu-clash-over-next-brexit-move-idUSKBN1CD10O

LONDON (Reuters) - Iran promised on Monday to give a “crushing” response if the United States designated its elite Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist group.

The pledge came a week before President Donald Trump announces a final decision on how he wants to contain the Islamic Republic.

He is expected on Oct. 15 to “decertify” a landmark 2015 international deal to curb Iran’s nuclear program, a step that by itself stops short of pulling out of the agreement but gives Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions.

Trump is also expected to designate Iran’s most powerful security force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corp (IRGC) as a terrorist organization, as he rolls out a broader, more hawkish U.S. strategy on Iran.

“We are hopeful that the United States does not make this strategic mistake,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi was quoted as saying by the state news agency IRNA.

“If they do, Iran’s reaction would be firm, decisive and crushing and the United States should bear all its consequences,” he told a news conference reported by IRNA.

Individuals and entities associated with the IRGC are already on the U.S. list of foreign terrorist organizations, but the organization as a whole is not.

IRGC commander Mohammad Ali Jafari said on Sunday, “If the news is correct about the stupidity of the American government in considering the Revolutionary Guards a terrorist group, then the Revolutionary Guards will consider the American army to be like Islamic State all around the world.”

Jafari also said that additional sanctions would end chances for future dialogue with the United States and that the Americans would have to move their regional bases outside the 2,000 km (1,250 mile) range of IRGC’s missiles.

WARY EUROPE

U.S. sanctions on the IRGC could affect conflicts in Iraq and Syria, where Tehran and Washington both support warring parties that oppose the Islamic State militant group (IS).

France said on Monday it was worried that classifying the IRGC as a terrorist group could exacerbate tensions in the region.

Germany said it was worried Trump would decide Iran is not respecting the nuclear deal, negotiated under his predecessor Barack Obama, and fears such a step will worsen insecurity in the Middle East.

A U.S. pullout could unravel an accord seen by supporters as vital to preventing a Middle East arms race and tamping down regional tensions, since it limits Iran’s ability to enrich uranium for nuclear fuel in exchange for the lifting of sanctions that damaged its oil-based economy.

The U.N. nuclear watchdog’s inspectors have repeatedly declared Iran in compliance with the terms of the nuclear deal.

Trump called Iran “a corrupt dictatorship” during his first speech to the U.N. General Assembly and said the nuclear deal was “the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into”.

The other five world powers in the deal were Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China.

The prospect of the United States reneging on the agreement has worried other partners that helped negotiate it.

The Kremlin said that any U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal would have “negative consequences.”

British Prime Minister Theresa May, who supports the nuclear pact, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who opposes it, agreed in a phone call on Monday that they need to be “clear-eyed” about the threat Iran poses to the Middle East.

“They agreed that ... the international community should continue working together to push back against Iran’s destabilizing regional activity,” May’s spokesman said.

“MALIGN ACTIVITIES”

Despite the nuclear deal, Washington still maintains its own more limited sanctions on Iran over its ballistic missile program and over accusations Tehran supports terrorism.

Iran says it is developing missiles solely for defensive purposes and denies involvement in terrorism.

The Trump administration aims to put more pressure on the IRGC, especially over recent missile tests and what Washington has called its “malign activities” across the Middle East.

The U.S. government imposed sanctions in July on 18 entities and people for supporting the IRGC in developing drones and military equipment. In August, Congress overwhelmingly approved the “Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act” which imposed new sanctions on Iran for its ballistic missile program, as well as sanctions on Russia and North Korea.

In an interview aired on Saturday night, Trump accused Iran of “funding North Korea” and “doing things with North Korea that are totally inappropriate”.

Qasemi, Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman, said the U.S. accusations were “baseless”. He added, “Israel and some specific countries are raising these accusations to create Iranophobia.”",Iran promises 'crushing' response if U.S. designates Guards a terrorist group,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-usa-irgc/iran-promises-crushing-response-if-u-s-designates-guards-a-terrorist-group-idUSKBN1CE0M2?il=0

Relations between Ankara and Washington have been plagued by disputes over U.S. support for Kurdish fighters in Syria, Turkey’s calls for the extradition of a U.S.-based cleric and the indictment of a Turkish former minister in a U.S. court.

But last week’s arrest of a Turkish employee of the U.S. consulate in Istanbul marked a fresh low. Turkey said the employee had links to U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, blamed by Ankara for a failed military coup in July 2016.

The U.S. embassy in Ankara condemned those charges as baseless and announced on Sunday night it was halting all non-immigrant visa services in Turkey while it reassessed Turkey’s commitment to the security of its missions and staff.

Within hours, Ankara announced it was taking the same measures against U.S. citizens seeking visas for Turkey.

On Monday the Turkish foreign ministry summoned a U.S. diplomat to urge the United States to lift the visa suspension, saying it was causing “unnecessary tensions”.

Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gul said that if Washington had serious security concerns about its missions in Turkey, steps would be taken to address them.

“But if it’s an issue regarding the arrest of the consulate employee, then this is a decision the Turkish judiciary has made,” Gul told A Haber television. “Trying a Turkish citizen for a crime committed in Turkey is our right.”

State-run Anadolu news agency said another U.S. consulate worker had been summoned to testify over his wife and daughter’s suspected links to Gulen - which it said had emerged during the questioning of Metin Topuz, the employee arrested last week.

INVESTORS RATTLED

The diplomatic spat spooked investors. The lira dropped 3.4 percent and stood at 3.7385 against the dollar after being quoted overnight as touching a level of 3.9223.

The main BIST 100 stock index fell as much as 4.7 percent, closing the day down 2.73 percent at 101,298 points.

Airline shares were particularly hard hit, with flag carrier Turkish Airlines falling 9 percent.

The central bank said it was following developments closely.

“This looks like a really serious situation,” said Blue Bay Asset Management strategist Timothy Ash, adding that the central bank would need to move quickly to calm market nerves and possibly hike interest rates - something President Tayyip Erdogan has resisted.

Turkey’s leading business association, TUSIAD, warned that the dispute would harm bilateral economic, social and cultural ties, and called for disagreements to be settled calmly.

The dispute with the United States coincides with deep strains in Turkey’s relations with Germany, another key ally, and with Turkish military activity at the Syrian and Iraqi borders, though their market impact has so far been limited.

U.S.-Turkish tensions have risen in recent months over U.S. military support for Kurdish YPG fighters in Syria, considered by Ankara to be an extension of the banned PKK which has waged an insurgency for three decades in southeast Turkey.

Turkey has also pressed, so far in vain, for the United States to extradite Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, viewed in Ankara as the mastermind behind the failed coup in which more than 240 people were killed. Gulen denies any involvement.

Friction with the United States has also arisen from the indictment last month by a U.S. court of Turkey’s former economy minister Zafer Caglayan, charged with conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran.

Sinan Ulgen, an analyst and former Turkish diplomat, said those underlying disputes had created a crisis of confidence which made this latest fallout particularly bitter.

“This harshness is a result of a build-up,” he said. “We should not consider this as solely a reaction to the detentions of consulate employees”.","Turkey urges U.S. to review visa suspension as lira, stocks tumble",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-turkey-security/turkey-urges-u-s-to-review-visa-suspension-as-lira-stocks-tumble-idUSKBN1CD0SC

REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke

Berlin (Reuters) - Nach der Einigung der Union auf ein Asyl- und Zuwanderungskonzept kommt Bewegung in die geplante Bildung einer Jamaika-Regierung: Bundeskanzlerin und CDU-Chefin Angela Merkel kündigte am Montag erste Sondierungen mit FDP und Grünen für kommende Woche an.

Am Mittwoch will die Union demnach zunächst mit FDP und danach mit den Grünen reden. Am darauffolgenden Freitag soll es dann ein erstes gemeinsames Gespräch von CDU/CSU, FDP und Grünen geben. CSU-Chef Horst Seehofer sagte in einer gemeinsamen Pressekonferenz mit Merkel, nun sei nicht die Zeit für rote Linien, sondern für “ergebnisoffene Gespräche”. Von Grünen und FDP kam zwar Kritik am Obergrenzen-Kompromiss der Union, aber keine Absage an die Sondierungseinladung.

“Das ist etwas, was uns auch schnell Schwung geben wird”, sagte Merkel mit Blick auf die ersten Sondierungen der drei Lager am 20. Oktober. Grüne und FDP kommen nach Angaben beider Parteien am 19. Oktober zu eigenen Gesprächen zusammen. CDU und CSU hatten am Sonntagabend den Streit über eine Obergrenze für Flüchtlinge beigelegt. Die Spitzen beider Parteien einigten sich auf eine Formulierung, nach der die Nettozuwanderung aus humanitären Gründen im Jahr nicht mehr als 200.000 Menschen betragen soll. Die Gesamtsumme solle aus ankommenden und ausreisenden Personen berechnet werden und beinhaltet den Familiennachzug von Flüchtlingen.

Das Wort “Obergrenze”, das monatelang von der CSU gefordert worden war, taucht nicht auf. Zudem vereinbarte die Union, dass es ein Zuwanderungsgesetz für Fachkräfte geben soll, was Wirtschaftsverbände begrüßten. Das CDU-Präsidium und die CSU-Spitzen stimmten dem Kompromiss am Montag zu.

VORSICHTIGE KRITIK VON GRÜNEN UND FDP

Die Grünen reagierten kritisch auf die Unions-Vereinbarungen. “Das ist eine Einigung zwischen CDU und CSU und noch lange nicht das Ergebnis der Jamaika-Sondierung”, sagte Grünen-Chefin Simone Peter der Nachrichtenagentur Reuters. Ihr Kollege Cem Özdemir vermied aber ein klares “Nein” und ließ damit die Tür für eine Koalition offen. “Für mich ist das ein Kompromiss zwischen CDU und CSU und keine vorweggenommene Verständigung der Koalition”, sagte er. Den Grünen sei vor allem der Familiennachzug wichtig.

Ähnlich äußerte sich FDP-Vizechef Wolfgang Kubicki. Der Unions-Kompromiss werde die Koalitionsverhandlungen nicht überstehen, sagte er zu Reuters. “Die Unions-Einigung zur Obergrenze beziehungsweise Kontingentierung wird nur eine kurze Halbwertszeit haben.” Allerdings sei anerkennenswert, dass die CDU die CSU auf dem Weg zu einem Zuwanderungsgesetz mitgenommen habe. “Es ist ein erster Schritt, auf dieser Basis kann man jetzt die Sondierungen beginnen”, sagte FDP-Generalsekretärin Nicola Beer.

MERKEL UND SEEHOFER ERLEICHTERT

Merkel und Seehofer lobten den Kompromiss als gute Grundlage für die Gespräche. Beide halten es damit für ausgeschlossen, dass sich eine Situation wie 2015 wiederholen könne. CDU und CSU hätten “einen klassischen Kompromiss” erreicht, der den Positionen beider Unionsparteien Rechnung trage, sagte Merkel. Es sei sichergestellt, dass die Zielgröße von 200.000 Flüchtlingen im Jahr nicht bedeute, dass die 200.001. Person abgewiesen werde, sondern ebenfalls ein Recht auf eine individuelle Prüfung habe. Das Maßnahmenpaket sorge aber dafür, dass diese Zahl nicht überschritten werde.

Auf die Frage, ob die Einigung eine rote Linie für die Sondierungsgespräche bedeute, sagte CSU-Chef Seehofer: “Ich bin ja auch gelegentlich jemand, der gerne mal in der Öffentlichkeit so etwas wie eine rote Linie definiert. Jetzt ist aber die Zeit, ergebnisoffen zu reden.” Kanzlerin Merkel betonte, man gehe mit dieser Position in die Gespräche. “Dann werden wir die Reaktion abwarten, die uns entgegenkommt.”

ANPASSUNG BEI STEIGENDER ARBEITSLOSIGKEIT MÖGLICH

Sowohl die CDU-Vorsitzende als auch Seehofer betonten, dass sich dieser Richtwert sowohl nach unten als auch nach oben verändern könne. Dies sei zwar nicht geplant. Beide verwiesen aber auf eine möglicherweise wieder steigende Arbeitslosigkeit in Deutschland oder einen Krieg, der eine neue Position bewirken könnte. Entscheidend sei, dass in eine solche Entscheidung der Bundestag eingebunden werde, betonte Seehofer.

Ein Streitpunkt mit den Grünen dürften die Entscheidungs- und Rückführungszentren werden, in denen Asylbewerber bis zur Entscheidung über ihr Bleiberecht untergebracht werden sollen. Seehofer sagte, dass man mit solchen Zentren für Bewerber vom Westbalkan gute Erfahrungen gemacht habe. Die durchschnittliche Wartezeit betrage dort nur sechs Wochen.

CDU und CSU wollen vor der Sondierung mit FDP und Grünen am 20. Oktober auch gemeinsame Positionen zu anderen Themenfeldern festlegen.

LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - “Blade Runner 2049” is heading for a downbeat $31.5 million opening weekend at 4,058 sites in North America.

Sunday’s estimated result throws serious doubt onto what had been high hopes for a box office success story. In one of the most surprising turnarounds in recent years, “Blade Runner 2049” fell far short of expectations, which had been in the $45 million to $50 million range at the start of the weekend amid stellar reviews, strong advance ticket sales, and the revered status of 1982’s original “Blade Runner.”

Instead, the film grossed only a moderate $12.7 million on Friday, including $4 million from Thursday night previews. Saturday saw an 11% decline to $11.4 million and Sunday’s projected total was $7.4 million.

The key factors for the under-performance were the movie’s 163-minute running time -- which limits the number of showings each day -- plus far less traction among younger moviegoers than anticipated.

“The core of enthusiastic and loyal ‘Blade Runner’ fans were over 25 and predominantly male and propelled the film as expected to the top spot, but a lengthy running time and lesser interest among females made it tougher for the film to reach the original weekend box office projections,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst with comScore.

According to PostTrack, males over 25 represented 50% of the audience and females over 25 were 27%, while males under 25 represented 15% of moviegoers and females under 25 were 8%. Males gave the movie an A CinemaScore, while females gave it a B+.

Warner Bros. is handling domestic distribution on “Blade Runner 2049,” starring Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford, through its output deal with Alcon Entertainment. Financed by Alcon and Sony and laden with special effects, the film carries a $150 million price tag. Denis Villeneuve helms the sequel film, which is set in a bleak 2049 Los Angeles with Gosling starring as an LAPD officer dealing with replicants seeking freedom.

Warner Bros. domestic distribution president Jeff Goldstein said “Blade Runner 2049” had fallen short of expectations in mid-sized and smaller markets along with the South and Midwest, where the running time and Major League Baseball playoffs appeared to have held down attendance.

“We did well in the major and high-profile markets,” he added. “Alcon and Denis made an amazing movie. The audience for it was narrower than we anticipated.”

Fox’s opening of survival drama “The Mountain Between Us,” starring Idris Elba and Kate Winslet, was the weekend’s runner-up, coming in slightly below projections with a moderate $10.1 million at 3,088 venues. Based on the Charles Martin novel, the film stars Elba as a surgeon and Winslet as a journalist who are left stranded together following a plane crash. Reviews have been mixed, earning the film a 46% score on Rotten Tomatoes.

Lionsgate’s animated “My Little Pony” trotted in with a modest $8.8 million at 2,528 locations, slightly above forecasts. Based on the Hasbro toys and TV series, the movie’s voice cast includes Emily Blunt, Kristin Chenoweth, Uzo Aduba, and Sia.

The fifth weekend of New Line’s blockbuster “It” showed plenty of staying power in third place with $9.6 million at 3,197 sites. It will close the weekend with $305 million domestically plus $298.8 million internationally to top the $600 million worldwide mark.

Fox’s third weekend of “Kingsman: The Golden Circle” and Universal’s second weekend of “American Made” were battling for fifth place with about $8.1 million each, followed by Warner’s third weekend of “The Lego Ninjago Movie” with $6.8 million. Focus Features’ expansion of Judi Dench’s “Victoria & Abdul” came in eighth with $4.1 million at 732 locations.",Box Office: 'Blade Runner 2049' fades to $31.5 million opening weekend,https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idCAKBN1CD0SM-OCAEN

(Reuters) - With a businessman turned politician now in the Oval Office, a small but growing number of bankers and Wall Street financiers across the United States have set their sights on politics.

In New Jersey, Connecticut and California, former bankers, hedge fund managers and private equity executives have either announced bids for legislative and gubernatorial seats, or associates have told Reuters they are considering running.

Meanwhile, industry trade groups including the American Bankers Association are launching formal programs to teach members in various states how to campaign successfully.

It is not the first time well-heeled candidates have entered American politics, and there are not a great number of them. But historians, political scientists and bankers say the atmosphere has changed abruptly under President Donald Trump.

“It’s certainly raised the visibility of folks who in the past may have said ‘I‘m not a politician,” said Richard Baier, president of the Nebraska Bankers Association, which is launching a training school for potential legislative candidates. “We’ve shown that you don’t really need that background.”

The Oklahoma Bankers Association is also planning to launch its own candidate school, a spokesman said.

Foreclosures, job losses and growing income inequality after the 2007-2009 financial crisis made anyone with Wall Street ties into a political pariah. But Trump, a self-described billionaire who made a fortune in New York real estate and entertainment, has stocked his cabinet with Wall Street bankers and industry tycoons.

His presidency has inspired others in the financial community to pursue civic duty, according to people who have studied campaigns or are involved with current election efforts.

Trump’s ascendance shows that candidates’ backgrounds matter less than whether they can connect with voters, said Joshua Sandman, a political science professor at the University of New Haven.

“Trump running has encouraged more people in financial services to test the waters,” he said, “but the water could be murky for them unless they have a real set of positive experiences within business and are reflective of creating jobs and helping people.”

It is hard to say quantitatively whether more candidates with finance backgrounds are pursuing political office now compared with prior election cycles. But Paul Herrnson, a political science professor at the University of Connecticut who has researched candidates’ backgrounds, says he is skeptical about how successful the new crop of candidates will be.

“Sure, the mood is better than it was when the market collapsed, but I don’t think people say, ‘Wall Street financier – that’s someone I can vote for,” he said.

Phil Murphy, the Democratic candidate for New Jersey governor in 2017, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc executive who spent 23 years at the firm, is perhaps the most prominent moneyed candidate.

His campaign has focused on bolstering the middle class with proposals to create a millionaire’s tax and launch other initiatives to help low-income residents.

Murphy has won support from labor unions, environmental groups and consumer rights activists, as well as bold-faced names in the Democratic party like former Vice Presidents Joe Biden and Al Gore, who have both endorsed him.

FILE PHOTO: Phil Murphy, a candidate for governor of New Jersey, speaks during the First Stand Rally in Newark, N.J., U.S. January 15, 2017. REUTERS/Stephanie Keith/File Photo

An Oct. 3 Monmouth University Poll has him leading his Republican rival, Kim Guadagno by 14 points, and over 60 percent of New Jersey voters said Murphy’s ties to Goldman do not matter in a recent Quinnipiac Poll.

“Obviously Goldman was his career,” said Tony Bianchini, spokesman for the Northeast Regional Council of Carpenters, which is backing Murphy. “Everyone has a career.”

In Connecticut, former UBS Group AG executive Robert Stefanowski is running for governor, according to a public filing, and hedge fund manager David Stemerman recently said he may do the same.

The two Republicans have given few clues about their campaign strategies other than to cast themselves as outsiders who can fix Connecticut’s problems.

In California, two Wall Street veterans are mulling runs as progressive Democrats.

Tom Steyer, an environmentalist who worked at Goldman Sachs and was a hedge fund manager, may run for Senate or governor, a person familiar with the matter said. Joseph Sanberg, a former Tiger Global Management LLC executive, is also considering a Senate run, according to Politico. He casts himself as a “progressive entrepreneur” on his website.

Other ex-Wall Streeters who have entered politics have a mixed history, and much depends on how well their messages align with voters’ concerns, political historians said.

For instance, while Mitt Romney’s private-equity career helped doom his 2012 presidential bid, Illinois voters elected private equity executive Bruce Rauner as governor in 2014.",New Wall Street candidates emerge to test Trump-era appeal,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trump-effect-bankers/new-wall-street-candidates-emerge-to-test-trump-era-appeal-idUSKBN1CE1BX

“Our country has been unsuccessfully dealing with North Korea for 25 years, giving billions of dollars & getting nothing.

When asked what Russia made of Trump’s comments, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a reporters on a conference call:

“Moscow has called and continues to call on the parties involved in the conflict and on those who have anything to do with this issue to exercise restraint and to avoid any steps that would only worsen the situation.”

Commenting on a Trump statement that the United States might withdraw from a nuclear deal with Iran, Peskov said such a move would have “negative consequences.”

In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying repeated China’s position that all parties exercise restraint, describing the situation as extremely complex and serious.

China hopes all sides do nothing to irritate each other or worsen the problem and speak and act cautiously, she told a daily news briefing.

In recent weeks, North Korea has launched two missiles over Japan and conducted its sixth nuclear test, all in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions, and may be fast advancing toward its goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.

Trump repeatedly has made clear his distaste for dialogue with North Korea. Last week, he dismissed the idea of talks as a waste of time, a day after Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Washington was maintaining open lines of communication with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s government.

“Our country has been unsuccessfully dealing with North Korea for 25 years, giving billions of dollars & getting nothing. Policy didn’t work!” the U.S. president said in a Twitter post on Monday.

Trump’s comments seemed to further suggest that military action was on his mind.

On Saturday, Trump made a similar comment on Twitter about how negotiations have failed for 25 years and said “only one thing will work” with North Korea.

U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Monday told the U.S. Army to be ready with military options on North Korea, but emphasized that efforts to deal with Pyongyang were being led diplomatically.

“There is one thing the U.S. Army can do and that is you have got to be ready to ensure that we have military options that our President can employ if needed,” Mattis said in a speech at an annual U.S. Army conference.

“We currently are in a diplomatically led effort and how many times have you seen the U.N.

To put major emphasis on labor reforms may, in any case, not be the main point.
If France’s CGT and the left/far-right cannot mobilize enough opposition, the labor reforms will be implemented, and they could be part of a general renaissance of the French economy.","Protestors against President Emmanuel Macron’s proposed liberalization of French labor laws were on the streets of the country’s cities on Tuesday. The marchers, chanting slogans and brandishing placards, halted traffic as they moved slowly through the streets. A fringe of anarchists broke windows; police responded by firing tear gas. But this was no rerun of the mass marches of past years, let alone the semi-revolutionary eruptions of 1968.

France’s second-largest union, the Conféderation Générale du Travail (CGT) was the only one of the three main workers’ organizations that took part. Another protest, this one organized by the far-left France Insoumise (France Unbowed) party is scheduled for Sept. 23. This week’s marching columns numbered, nationwide, in the few hundred thousand rather than the many millions hoped for – the police claimed 223,000, the organizers 400,000. There was little effect on production, services or transport.

It was neither victory nor defeat for either side. Instead, Macron’s changes to the vast labor code – hiring and firing will be easier, some workplace issues will be negotiated at company level – hang in the balance. The CGT, the left and the far-right National Front all oppose them, but Macron and his government have a solid, if inexperienced, majority in the Assembly.

More than his predecessors who tried and failed to liberalize France’s labor market – the center-right Nicolas Sarkozy and the center-left Francois Hollande – Macron has pinned the credibility of his presidency on systemic, cultural change, a deliberate jolting of French society and economy out of the rut into which he believes it has fallen. He is contemptuous of both former presidents (he knew Hollande well, having been both his advisor and Finance Minister), believing them to have given up too soon and too easily. When Macron spoke, as he did earlier this month, of “slackers,” he said when challenged that he meant those who retreated from the necessary surgery on France’s body politic The marchers, however, seized on the word and put it on their placards: “Macron, the slackers will kick you out,” read one.

The slackers have a point. Indeed, they have several. Labor productivity in France is relatively good, only a little behind that of the United States and the highest of Europe’s major economies. When French workers work, they work well.

Though both Macron’s labor and economic reforms have won support from the center-right and from many economists, France remains doubtful, even hostile. Perhaps the best-known Frenchman in political and intellectual circles before Macron was the economist Thomas Piketty, whose “Capital in the 21st Century” (2013) is a best seller and who has excoriated his country both for its steeply rising inequality and its hypocrisy in pretending it is egalitarian. Hypocritical it may be, but it clings to the myth, and perfectly bourgeois Frenchmen and -women may recoil from an obvious widening of the income and wealth gaps.

To put major emphasis on labor reforms may, in any case, not be the main point. Germany liberalized its labor market through the so-called Hartz reforms between 2003 and 2005, but unlike France the German unions were relatively moderate, wage bargaining was already localized and investment was rising. In addition, the costs of German unification had already been paid.

If France’s CGT and the left/far-right cannot mobilize enough opposition, the labor reforms will be implemented, and they could be part of a general renaissance of the French economy. That is also dependent on other ifs – if the present improvement in the European Union economy continues (the European Commission, while underscoring that all members are growing, warns of “higher-than-usual uncertainty) and if investment increases, then France could become more like Germany. The German (and EU) leader Chancellor Angela Merkel wants to see that, and Macron wishes to show her he can deliver.

Yet delivery of this kind of economy now comes with an apparently unavoidable cost. Faster growth and even a fall in unemployment produces an ever-larger underclass, composed both of those with few qualifications and the still-increasing numbers of immigrants, often from poor countries. Macron’s opponents like to quote the Cambridge University economist Christopher Bickerton, who argued in a New York Times column that “not since the economic boom of the 1950s and ’60s has capitalism in Europe been dynamic enough to combine high levels of employment with long-term material gains for the masses.” It will not do so, he believes, under Macron.

The deeper movement, about which Macron can do little, is that the greater integration into the global economy that he champions produces huge gains for the top one percent, more modest rises for the well educated and skilled, but a much larger tail of the precarious, insecure and low paid. The leftist German think tank, the Rosa Luxemburg Institute, called this trend “the end of social capitalism.” A sign of this is the general decline of social democratic parties such as the once-mighty German Social Democrats and the shrunken French Socialists. Only in the UK has the main left party, Labour, made substantial political gains with a far-left leadership.

Social democracy depended on, and greatly furthered, “social capitalism.” It did so in France, under socialist governments, did so again in Germany and still does, though with difficulty, in the Scandinavian states. Organized labor had a place, even an honored and at times powerful one. Now, its gains are a hindrance, its ideology no longer attractive. The leaders of the further left – such as Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn in the UK and Jean-Luc Melenchon, leader of France Insoumise in France - gain by being fundamentalists, opposed to capitalism itself, social or not.

In moving France towards the globalist model, Macron echoes the claim made nearly four decades ago by British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, that there is no alternative. In this, he may be more right than she: there is presently no popular base, no public assent, no powerful parties able to show that cooperation with capitalism is best for the workers. And that, sooner or later, will be a large problem – for leftists, or course, for the state which must provide some support for the poor and ultimately, for the capitalist system itself.",Commentary: Labor reform in France’s Macron economy,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lloyd-macron-commentary/commentary-labor-reform-in-frances-macron-economy-idUSKCN1BQ2DJ

LONDON (Reuters) - Iran promised on Monday to give a “crushing” response if the United States designated its elite Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist group.

The pledge came a week before President Donald Trump announces a final decision on how he wants to contain the Islamic Republic.

He is expected on Oct. 15 to “decertify” a landmark 2015 international deal to curb Iran’s nuclear program, a step that by itself stops short of pulling out of the agreement but gives Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions.

Trump is also expected to designate Iran’s most powerful security force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corp (IRGC) as a terrorist organization, as he rolls out a broader, more hawkish U.S. strategy on Iran.

“We are hopeful that the United States does not make this strategic mistake,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi was quoted as saying by the state news agency IRNA.

“If they do, Iran’s reaction would be firm, decisive and crushing and the United States should bear all its consequences,” he told a news conference reported by IRNA.

Individuals and entities associated with the IRGC are already on the U.S. list of foreign terrorist organizations, but the organization as a whole is not.

IRGC commander Mohammad Ali Jafari said on Sunday, “If the news is correct about the stupidity of the American government in considering the Revolutionary Guards a terrorist group, then the Revolutionary Guards will consider the American army to be like Islamic State all around the world.”

Jafari also said that additional sanctions would end chances for future dialogue with the United States and that the Americans would have to move their regional bases outside the 2,000 km (1,250 mile) range of IRGC’s missiles.

WARY EUROPE

U.S. sanctions on the IRGC could affect conflicts in Iraq and Syria, where Tehran and Washington both support warring parties that oppose the Islamic State militant group (IS).

France said on Monday it was worried that classifying the IRGC as a terrorist group could exacerbate tensions in the region.

Germany said it was worried Trump would decide Iran is not respecting the nuclear deal, negotiated under his predecessor Barack Obama, and fears such a step will worsen insecurity in the Middle East.

A U.S. pullout could unravel an accord seen by supporters as vital to preventing a Middle East arms race and tamping down regional tensions, since it limits Iran’s ability to enrich uranium for nuclear fuel in exchange for the lifting of sanctions that damaged its oil-based economy.

The U.N. nuclear watchdog’s inspectors have repeatedly declared Iran in compliance with the terms of the nuclear deal.

Trump called Iran “a corrupt dictatorship” during his first speech to the U.N. General Assembly and said the nuclear deal was “the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into”.

The other five world powers in the deal were Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China.

The prospect of the United States reneging on the agreement has worried other partners that helped negotiate it.

The Kremlin said that any U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal would have “negative consequences.”

British Prime Minister Theresa May, who supports the nuclear pact, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who opposes it, agreed in a phone call on Monday that they need to be “clear-eyed” about the threat Iran poses to the Middle East.

“They agreed that ... the international community should continue working together to push back against Iran’s destabilizing regional activity,” May’s spokesman said.

“MALIGN ACTIVITIES”

Despite the nuclear deal, Washington still maintains its own more limited sanctions on Iran over its ballistic missile program and over accusations Tehran supports terrorism.

Iran says it is developing missiles solely for defensive purposes and denies involvement in terrorism.

The Trump administration aims to put more pressure on the IRGC, especially over recent missile tests and what Washington has called its “malign activities” across the Middle East.

The U.S. government imposed sanctions in July on 18 entities and people for supporting the IRGC in developing drones and military equipment. In August, Congress overwhelmingly approved the “Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act” which imposed new sanctions on Iran for its ballistic missile program, as well as sanctions on Russia and North Korea.

In an interview aired on Saturday night, Trump accused Iran of “funding North Korea” and “doing things with North Korea that are totally inappropriate”.

Qasemi, Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman, said the U.S. accusations were “baseless”. He added, “Israel and some specific countries are raising these accusations to create Iranophobia.”",Iran promises 'crushing' response if U.S. designates Guards a terrorist group,https://www.reuters.com/article/iran-usa-irgc/iran-promises-crushing-response-if-u-s-designates-guards-a-terrorist-group-idINKBN1CE0ML

Turkey supports only limited NATO reinforcements, concerned about breaking international rules limiting the scale of patrols in the Black Sea.","CRAIOVA, Romania (Reuters) - NATO launched a new multinational force in Romania on Monday to counter Russia along its eastern flank and to check a growing Russian presence in the Black Sea following the Kremlin’s 2014 seizure of Crimea.

The force will initially be built around a Romanian brigade of up to 4,000 soldiers, supported by troops from nine other NATO countries, and complementing a separate deployment of 900 U.S. troops who are already in place. The plans are to include additional air and sea assets to give the force greater capabilities.

“Our purpose is peace, not war,” Romanian President Klaus Iohannis told the NATO Parliamentary Assembly of alliance lawmakers, which is meeting this year in Bucharest.

“We are not a threat for Russia. But we need dialogue from a strong position of defense and discouragement,” he said, before flying to the Craiova military base in south-eastern Romania.

At the base, as military bands played, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg stood alongside Iohannis, addressed some of the troops in green face paint and inspected vehicles and weapons.

“We are sending a very clear message: NATO is here, NATO is strong and NATO is united,” Stoltenberg told assembled Polish, Romanian, Spanish and Portuguese soldiers.

Russia accuses NATO of trying to encircle it and threatening stability in Eastern Europe, which NATO denies. Around the Black Sea, Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey are NATO members while Georgia and Ukraine aspire to join.

The NATO force aims to develop its presence in the Black Sea region, rich in oil and gas, without escalating tensions as it seeks to counter Russia’s own plans to create what military analysts say is a “buffer zone”.

The 2008 Russian operation to put troops in Georgia’s South Ossetia region, its support for separatists in eastern Ukraine since 2014 and its annexation of Crimea have raised the stakes, with all sides warning of a new, Cold-War style scenario.

Apart from Romania, Poland is the biggest troop contributor. Bulgaria, Italy and Portugal will train regularly with the force in Craiova, and Germany is also expected to contribute.

In additional to existing NATO Black Sea naval patrols, a maritime presence will include more allied visits to Romanian and Bulgarian ports, training and exercises.

‘WEST BERLIN’ MODEL

Some Eastern Europeans want NATO’s new ballistic missile defense shield, which includes a site in Romania, to be part of NATO’s eastern posture vis-a-vis Russia.

“The Aegis Ashore system would add another level of deterrence,” said Maciej Kowalski, an analyst at the Polish Casimir Pulaski Foundation, referring to the U.S.-built system.

NATO says the system is to intercept any Iranian rockets.

As in the Baltics and Poland, where the U.S.-led alliance has some 4,000 troops, NATO says the relatively light multinational model recalls allied support for West Berlin in the 1950s, when the presence of British, French and U.S. forces ensured the Soviet Union could not control all of Berlin.

Under NATO’s founding treaty, an attack on one ally is an attack on all, meaning all 28 NATO nations would be required to respond in the case of any potential Russian aggression.

While months in planning, the establishment of the force comes as Russia winds down its biggest war games since 2013. The Zapad, or West, games showed off Moscow’s latest weaponry and its ability to quickly mass forces on NATO’s borders.

The enhanced NATO presence in Romania and Bulgaria marks a diplomatic success for Bucharest, which gained greater persuasive power because it is set to reach a NATO goal of spending 2 percent of economic output on defense this year, a priority for U.S. President Donald Trump.

Romania pushed for bigger NATO naval presence on the Black Sea for more than a year, but found its neighbor Bulgaria wary of provoking Russia.

EDINBURGH (Reuters) - Britain’s struggles to chart a way out of the European Union are boosting the case for Scottish independence, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Sunday, but she shied away from committing to a date for another referendum vote.

Scotland rejected independence by a 10 percentage point margin in a 2014 vote, and polls indicate that support for it has not shifted significantly since then.

“We will consider the (independence referendum) timing again when we have more clarity on what we face,” Sturgeon said, speaking as her Scottish National Party (SNP) began a three-day conference in Glasgow.

“People watch the chaos that is engulfing the UK right now and people look ahead and see the damage that is likely to be done by this unfolding disaster that is not just Brexit but this incompetent and chaotic approach to Brexit being presided over by (Conservative Prime Minister) Theresa May,” she told the BBC.

“I think the case for Scotland’s future in Scotland’s hands (...) is becoming greater and stronger by the day.”

Sturgeon, who heads the devolved Scottish government, saw her party lose more than one third of its seats in Britain’s June election after it mistimed a push for another vote on secession. It subsequently put the plan on hold.

Brexit has put the union of the UK’s four nations under strain because Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to remain while Wales and the larger England voted to leave.

Britain’s main parties are fighting over what new relationship is needed with the bloc after 40 years of shared trade and politics. May has seen her authority over the Conservatives erode since a June’s snap election in which she lost her parliamentary majority.

That means Britain still has a choice over the shape of its future trading relations, Sturgeon argued.

PARIS (Reuters) - Apple (AAPL.O) boss Tim Cook went out of his way on Monday to single out a small French firm behind innovative features in the latest iPhones ahead of meeting with President Emmanuel Macron, who has called for a tougher line on technology company taxes.

The Apple chief executive paid a surprise visit to Eldim, a Normandy-based firm that develops optical technology used in the facial recognition system inside new top-of-the-line iPhone X smartphones due out next month. Prices start at $999.

Face ID, as the iPhone X feature is known, will replace the fingerprint sensor for unlocking the phone and features in Apple’s campaign to distinguish the phone from rival devices.

“Bravo for your work!”, Cook said on his official Twitter account in French. A picture of him chatting with Eldim employees was also posted. He also hailed the contributions of French start-ups on Twitter while on his way to a scheduled meeting with Macron on Monday afternoon.

The meeting between the French president and Apple CEO follows calls by Macron last week for Apple and other tech companies such as Amazon.com to pay more in taxes in Europe.

“Bravo to Europe for acting with determination to get tax rules and justice respected,” Macron said in a tweet last week praising European Union officials for taking member-state Ireland to court to reclaim 13 billion euros ($15.26 billion) in back taxes from Apple.

Eldim, located outside Caen, near the northern coast of France, had quietly worked with Apple on research projects for nearly a decade before gaining recognition for its optical work on behalf of Apple, the world’s most highly valued company.

“They (Eldim) certainly have a top-notch technology,” said industry analyst Thomas Husson of Forrester Research. “Facial recognition is one of iPhone X’s differentiating features.”

Apple is normally highly secretive about the suppliers it uses to develop new phones, computers and other devices.

A spokeswoman for Apple declined to comment.

As Reuters recently reported, the White House is preparing to shift oversight of the sale of American-manufactured small arms from the diligent State Department review process to the business-friendly Commerce Department. By loosening the inter-agency guidelines in an attempt to boost America’s share in the global marketplace, the Trump administration runs the risk of fueling the civil wars currently bringing misery to millions worldwide.

The aim of this policy is to enable U.S. weapons manufactures to sell their products overseas quickly by trimming the bureaucratic red tape now governing the export of non-military grade weapons and ammunition. According to the Reuters report, the new plan would mean that commercial gun exports would no longer be given the same scrutiny as missile and fighter jet sales, which often require congressional approval. The shift would also move weapons like assault rifles and handguns from the State Department’s tightly-restricted Munitions list to the Commerce Control Lists, which allows for more streamlined licensing for international sales. While the administration has explained these new procedures as a logical extension of a U.S. president who is solidly pro-business, the transfer of authority from Foggy Bottom will have unintended and damaging foreign policy repercussions.

In contrast to the significant decline in major conventional conflicts over the last 50 years, unconventional conflicts within a sovereign state’s territory, such as the current war in Syria, have become the new normal. Small weapons like AK-47’s assault rifles, Kalashnikovs, sniper rifles, and low-grade explosives are used in most of these confrontations. Indeed, the ease with which a combatant with little military training can use semi-automatic weapons on the battlefield is part of the weapons’ appeal.

Light arms have many advantages for guerilla armies: an AK-47 is a lot cheaper than a tank, a missile defense system, or a fighter aircraft and it can be smuggled across porous borders. As Senators Ben Cardin, Patrick Leahy, and Dianne Feinstein wrote in a letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in opposing the new rules, the civil wars and rebellions currently taking place are being fueled by the illegal sales of what many Americans would categorize as sports rifles or hunting equipment.

Relaxing the rules on small arms exports is counterproductive to the U.S. objective of de-escalating these conflicts. The new administration policy has the potential to squander the inclusive diplomatic processes Washington has encouraged in order to promote peaceful approaches to conflict resolution in states as varied as South Sudan, Ukraine, and Colombia. Multiple agencies and departments within the U.S. government would in effect be working against one another, with the State Department hoping to end the very hostilities that are sustained by American-manufactured weapons.

Washington would not be deliberately arming combatants in a civil war, but the handguns and assault rifles American firearms manufacturers sell on the open market could find their way to a conflict zone through smuggling and diversion. In one highly-publicized case last year, corrupt Jordanian intelligence officers sold a cache of rocket-propelled grenades and Kalashnikov rifles that were destined for the moderate Syrian opposition to arms merchants on the underground market. The FBI later determined that one of those weapons was likely to have been responsible for the shooting deaths of two American contractors in Jordan that same year.

The civil war in Libya illustrates the insecurity that can result when governments send weapons into a conflict zone without crafting the necessary oversight and security measures that help prevent them from being sold off elsewhere. During the 2011 armed rebellion against Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, Washington's Arab partners – with the secret blessing of the Obama administration – delivered military assistance to the rebels trying to oust the regime. While the military aid helped to drive Gaddafi from power after eight months of combat, that same equipment eventually helped fuel the civil war still ravaging Libya. Libyan militias previously concerned with overthrowing Qaddafi began stockpiling arms to increase their political leverage for later internal battles. The availability of weapons in Libya remains so overwhelming that U.N. experts have categorized the North African country as a regional weapons bazaar. Weapons that were sent into the country to aid the Libyan rebellion have been diverted to other regional conflicts, either through arms smuggling across lightly defended borders or through illicit arms deals. African officials claim that some of these arms likely assisted the jihadist Boko Haram group to recover after serious territorial losses against the Nigerian army.

According to the Small Arms Survey, the United States is already the world’s top exporter of small arms, having reached a total of $1.1 billion in 2014. While this figure is small compared to the far larger conventional weapons contracts U.S. defense manufacturers sign every year, the possibility that even a fraction of these commercial weapons could leak into a conflict zone would have a deeply negative impact.

The question is whether the monetary benefits that are likely to result from the administration’s new rules are enough to compensate for the instability and violence that are likely to increase with more small arms available for sale around the world. The ease with which U.S. arms companies will now be able to export their products may be terrific from a business perspective. But from the standpoint of international peace and security, this policy is a dangerous gamble for the White House to take.

(Reuters) - Wall Street was little changed in late morning trading on Monday, as losses in healthcare stocks were offset by gains in technology shares, with the third-quarter earnings season looming.

U.S. stocks have been on a tear this year, hitting new records almost everyday in the past week, and the upcoming earnings reports will help justify the lofty valuations.

“The relatively high valuation, where the market is trading 17 to 18 times earnings, is merited by a very low interest rate environment,” said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.

“We are not danger yet if you keep your eye on rates.”

Overall, earnings at S&P 500 companies are expected to have increased 4.9 percent last quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data, down from the double-digit growth recorded in the first two quarters of this year.

Ten S&P 500 companies are expected to report earnings this week, including some of the biggest Wall Street banks. JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) and Citigroup (C.N) will report on Thursday.

At 11:00 a.m. ET (1500 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was up 5.13 points, or 0.02 percent, at 22,778.8, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was up 0.08 points, flat on a percentage basis, at 6,590.26. Both indexes hit record intraday highs.

The S&P 500 .SPX was down 1.76 points, or 0.07 percent, at 2,547.57, which is just 5 points shy of its record high. The benchmark's eight-day winning streak came to a halt on Friday due to weak jobs numbers.

Eight of the 11 major S&P indexes were higher, led by a 0.31 percent gain in the technology sector .SPLRCT. The healthcare index .SPXHC was down 0.56 percent.

GE shares (GE.N) sank 3 percent and was the top drag on the S&P after the conglomerate named a new CFO said it gave activist investment firm Trian Fund Management a board seat.

Medtronic (MDT.N) dropped about 4 percent after the medical device maker said Hurricane Maria hurt second-quarter earnings and sales.

DaVita (DVA.N) tumbled 7 percent, the most on the S&P, after JPMorgan cut its rating on the dialysis service provider, while Express Scripts (ESRX.O) fell 4.5 percent on a Raymond James downgrade.

Tesla (TSLA.O) fell 2.51 percent after pushing back the unveiling of the big rig truck to mid-November.

Viacom (VIAB.O) slipped more than 4 percent after Citigroup downgraded the stock to “sell”, citing risks that pay TV firms would stop carrying its channels.

Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,453 to 1,262. On the Nasdaq, 1,481 issues fell and 1,177 advanced.","Wall Street little changed, with earnings in sight",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks/wall-street-little-changed-with-earnings-in-sight-idUKKBN1CE19E

NEW YORK (Reuters) - When reporters descended on upstate New York to ask about a stunning prison break in 2015, state police spokesman Major Charles Guess took their questions.

A dog named Trigger stepped on his owner’s 12-gauge shotgun during an Indiana waterfowl hunt just months later and shot her in the foot.

Sometimes the name fits the news story. Correspondent Julie Weed writes about legal marijuana for Forbes. This month, a front-page New York Times story on obesity was edited by Hilary Stout.

And former U.S. Representative Anthony Weiner on Monday was sentenced to prison for sending explicitly sexual pictures of a certain body part to an underage girl.

This phenomenon has secured its own line of scientific research, called nominative determinism. It even has a name of its own: aptronym.

In some cases, it may be rooted in the tradition of a profession determining a family name, such as Baker, Smith or Taylor.

Other times, it is a coincidence. But it nearly always raises an eyebrow or even a smile from those realizing the unusual pairing.

Recent news stories have mentioned Jack Dagger, the U.S. director of the International Knifethrowers Hall of Fame. Then there is Detective Martin Speechley, the ever-quotable spokesman for the New York Police Department.

Sometimes the odd connections can be horrifying. When a gunman at a community college in Roseburg, Oregon, killed nine people, including a woman in a wheelchair, her service dog named Bullet survived.

But strange synergies also can signal hope. Josh Outman now pitches for Mexico’s Triple-A Minor League Pericos de Puebla but was once with the New York Yankees, Oakland Athletics and other U.S. Major League Baseball teams. Perhaps a streak of no-hitters by Outman could get him back to the big leagues.","Having the right name at the right, or sometimes wrong, time",https://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idAFKCN1C425Q

(Reuters) - Juan Martin del Potro saved four break points in the decider to battle past Georgian qualifier Nikoloz Basilashvili on Monday and reach the Shanghai Masters second round.

“A lot of us younger guys are playing well, doing well, and it’s going to help others step up,” he said. “I think you’re going to see a lot of us in the top 50. The other guys are going to have to leave eventually.”

Also advancing to the next round were Feliciano Lopez who defeated big-serving Ivo Karlovic 7-6(1) 7-6(6) and Britain’s Kyle Edmund who downed Jiri Vesely 6-3 6-2.

LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - Can thousands of people standing in lines to spell out “Stop Adani” actually scupper the Indian company’s plans to develop a huge coal mine in the Australian outback?

Perhaps a more relevant question is whether the protesters are enough to make Australia’s federal and Queensland state politicians lose their nerve, and quietly withdraw support for what is the world’s largest new coal mine planned.

While Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull’s Liberal Party, which holds federal power, and the Labor Party, which rules Queensland state, have maintained their backing for Adani Enterprises’ Carmichael mine so far, both have also previously backed down on political issues over possible electoral losses.

Thousands of people opposed to the $4 billion, 25 million tonnes-a-year Carmichael mine turned out at various locations across Australia on Oct. 7, attending events organised by an umbrella organisation of groups opposed to the development.

While the presence of protesters isn’t enough itself to cause the federal and state governments to abandon Adani, there is an opinion poll showing a majority of Australians are against the mine. Also, media coverage has grown increasingly sceptical, if not hostile.

The state Australian Broadcasting Corp last week aired a programme alleging Adani engaged in bribery, corruption and environmentally damaging practices in India. The programme also reported that Adani has set up complex corporate structures in tax havens to minimise any potential tax payments in Australia.

Adani has dismissed the allegations and stated that the Carmichael project remains on track.

Adani Australia’s chief executive officer Jeyakumar Janakaraj, in an interview published on Oct. 5 in India’s Economic Times, said Adani’s corporate structure was above board and that work on the mine will start in a “couple of weeks.”

Janakaraj did acknowledge, however, that the company still has to secure A$4.2 billion ($3.3 billion) for the Carmichael mine and associated rail project, and that it intended to achieve this by March next year.

MONEY, POLITICS

Part of the problem for Adani is that the company is seeking about A$900 million of this cash from Australia’s federal government to build the near 400 km (260 mile) rail line from the mine to a port on Queensland’s coast.

It’s this money that environmental activists are hoping to target by ramping up pressure on Prime Minister Turnbull, who holds power by a razor-thin majority in parliament.

If there is any realistic chance of seats in Queensland falling to the Labor Party, or even the Australian Greens, Turnbull will be tempted to reverse course on support for Adani.

Turnbull’s government has so far sought to distance itself from the liquefied natural gas (LNG) industry in Queensland amid mounting public anger over high local natural gas prices and the idea that three export LNG plants in the state are to blame.

State governments, both Liberal and Labor, have also given into activists by banning or restricting natural gas exploration and production in New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and the Northern Territory.

That has the anti-Adani activists feeling they have the wind at their backs and their campaign against the Carmichael mine is gaining traction.

It doesn’t seem to matter to the activists that many of the claims against the mine are exaggerated, as long as the public believes it is the tipping point for man-made climate change and the destruction of Australia’s iconic Great Barrier Reef.

Carmichael’s 25 million tonnes of coal a year obviously won’t help mitigate climate change, but it’s a spit in the bucket when viewed against China’s annual consumption of around 3.5 billion tonnes and India’s demand of nearly 1 billion.

However, it seems that Adani is losing the public relations battle in Australia, and that increases the risk its political support will evaporate as well.

If the environmentalists do manage to halt Adani, the victory may well have implications beyond coal.

Any resource project could be targeted given environmentalists are generally opposed to any fossil fuel or mineral extraction, making it harder for Australia to expand or replenish the sector that is the nation’s major export earner.

Single-issue activists rarely consider the wider implications of their campaigns, but politicians are supposed to do just that. The potential costs of weak political decisions are mounting in Australia.","Column: In people vs Adani's coal mine, people may win",https://in.reuters.com/article/column-russell-coal-adani-ent/column-in-people-vs-adanis-coal-mine-people-may-win-idINKBN1CE0BA

LONDON (Reuters) - Angola’s state oil company Sonangol is aiming to slash breakeven costs on new oil production to as low as $20-$30 per barrel and make its contracts more attractive to investors and oil and gas companies, the company’s chief Isabel dos Santos told Reuters.

On the sidelines of the FT Africa Summit in London, dos Santos said changes to the Sonangol board announced last week would help the company revamp new exploration and production agreements and significantly cut costs.

“We are rethinking all our strategy, with a view of being able to produce barrels within $40-$50 per barrel,” said dos Santos, the billionaire daughter of Angola’s President Jose Eduardo dos Santos.

She said some projects were targeting a breakeven as low as $20-$30 per barrel, adding the changes were essential so new concession agreements could begin “delivering dollars per barrel, rather than just cost.”

“In the past, we had investments that were quite heavy, quite capex heavy. That leaves us with a portfolio with barrels over $70, over $80, so we have some issues with some fields,” dos Santos said.

Sonangol has been trying since the recent slump in oil prices to reduce costs and attract investment, but dos Santos said bringing in new talent, particularly people with experience at multinational companies and oil majors, could deliver further results.

In a statement on Friday, Sonangol said it had saved $1.7 billion thanks to spending cuts since 2014. But it also said it had replaced the chairman of its executive committee, Paulino Jeronimo, who had managed new concessions and relationships with operators.

The company said the functions would now be carried out by two managers who could enable “the faster treatment of the challenges of the sector.”

Earlier in the week, it appointed three new board members to help restructure the company, including former ExxonMobil executive Ivan Sá de Almeida, who used to work for Sonangol.

“We are redrawing our terms and conditions to make them more attractive,” dos Santos said, adding that under the previously designed contracts, “the level of commitment (for companies) was not attractive.”

Sonangol in May cancelled an auction of oil exploration licences for eight blocks, saying the drop in oil prices since the bidding opened had made the terms uneconomic.

Dos Santos said Sonangol had recruited new talent at other levels as well, and had thus far brought in roughly 26 people “on the first and second layers of governance,” including from oil companies such as Chevron and Total, and it was still “looking at different multinationals that had Angolan talent.”",Sonangol aims to slash oil production costs with board revamp,https://www.reuters.com/article/investingNews/idAFKBN1CE1F7-OZABS

PARIS (Reuters) - Apple (AAPL.O) boss Tim Cook went out of his way on Monday to single out a small French firm behind innovative features in the latest iPhones ahead of meeting with President Emmanuel Macron, who has called for a tougher line on technology company taxes.

The Apple chief executive paid a surprise visit to Eldim, a Normandy-based firm that develops optical technology used in the facial recognition system inside new top-of-the-line iPhone X smartphones due out next month. Prices start at $999.

Face ID, as the iPhone X feature is known, will replace the fingerprint sensor for unlocking the phone and features in Apple’s campaign to distinguish the phone from rival devices.

“Bravo for your work!”, Cook said on his official Twitter account in French. A picture of him chatting with Eldim employees was also posted. He also hailed the contributions of French start-ups on Twitter while on his way to a scheduled meeting with Macron on Monday afternoon.

The meeting between the French president and Apple CEO follows calls by Macron last week for Apple and other tech companies such as Amazon.com to pay more in taxes in Europe.

“Bravo to Europe for acting with determination to get tax rules and justice respected,” Macron said in a tweet last week praising European Union officials for taking member-state Ireland to court to reclaim 13 billion euros ($15.26 billion) in back taxes from Apple.

Eldim, located outside Caen, near the northern coast of France, had quietly worked with Apple on research projects for nearly a decade before gaining recognition for its optical work on behalf of Apple, the world’s most highly valued company.

“They (Eldim) certainly have a top-notch technology,” said industry analyst Thomas Husson of Forrester Research. “Facial recognition is one of iPhone X’s differentiating features.”

Apple is normally highly secretive about the suppliers it uses to develop new phones, computers and other devices.

A spokeswoman for Apple declined to comment.

(Reuters) - Wall Street was little changed in late morning trading on Monday, as losses in healthcare stocks were offset by gains in technology shares, with the third-quarter earnings season looming.

U.S. stocks have been on a tear this year, hitting new records almost everyday in the past week, and the upcoming earnings reports will help justify the lofty valuations.

“The relatively high valuation, where the market is trading 17 to 18 times earnings, is merited by a very low interest rate environment,” said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.

“We are not danger yet if you keep your eye on rates.”

Overall, earnings at S&P 500 companies are expected to have increased 4.9 percent last quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data, down from the double-digit growth recorded in the first two quarters of this year.

Ten S&P 500 companies are expected to report earnings this week, including some of the biggest Wall Street banks. JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) and Citigroup (C.N) will report on Thursday.

At 11:00 a.m. ET (1500 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was up 5.13 points, or 0.02 percent, at 22,778.8, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was up 0.08 points, flat on a percentage basis, at 6,590.26. Both indexes hit record intraday highs.

The S&P 500 .SPX was down 1.76 points, or 0.07 percent, at 2,547.57, which is just 5 points shy of its record high. The benchmark's eight-day winning streak came to a halt on Friday due to weak jobs numbers.

Eight of the 11 major S&P indexes were higher, led by a 0.31 percent gain in the technology sector .SPLRCT. The healthcare index .SPXHC was down 0.56 percent.

GE shares (GE.N) sank 3 percent and was the top drag on the S&P after the conglomerate named a new CFO said it gave activist investment firm Trian Fund Management a board seat.

Medtronic (MDT.N) dropped about 4 percent after the medical device maker said Hurricane Maria hurt second-quarter earnings and sales.

DaVita (DVA.N) tumbled 7 percent, the most on the S&P, after JPMorgan cut its rating on the dialysis service provider, while Express Scripts (ESRX.O) fell 4.5 percent on a Raymond James downgrade.

Tesla (TSLA.O) fell 2.51 percent after pushing back the unveiling of the big rig truck to mid-November.

Viacom (VIAB.O) slipped more than 4 percent after Citigroup downgraded the stock to “sell”, citing risks that pay TV firms would stop carrying its channels.

The 70-year-old retired banker said he is unhappy with infighting and turnover in the White House. He does not like Trump’s penchant for traveling to his personal golf resorts. He wishes the president would do more to fix the healthcare system, and he worries that Trump might back down from his promise to force illegal immigrants out of the country.

“Every president makes mistakes,” Wilson said. “But if you add one on top of one, on top of another one, on top of another, there’s just a limit.”

Trump, who inspired millions of supporters last year in places like Morgan County, has been losing his grip on rural America.

According to the Reuters/Ipsos daily tracking poll, the Republican president’s popularity is eroding in small towns and rural communities where 15 percent of the country’s population lives. The poll of more than 15,000 adults in “non-metro” areas shows that they are now as likely to disapprove of Trump as they are to approve of him.

In September, 47 percent of people in non-metro areas approved of Trump while 47 percent disapproved. That is down from Trump’s first four weeks in office, when 55 percent said they approved of the president while 39 percent disapproved.

The poll found that Trump has lost support in rural areas among men, whites and people who never went to college. He lost support with rural Republicans and rural voters who supported him on Election Day.

And while Trump still gets relatively high marks in the poll for his handling of the economy and national security, rural Americans are increasingly unhappy with Trump’s record on immigration, a central part of his presidential campaign.

Forty-seven percent of rural Americans said in September they approved of the president’s handling of immigration, down from 56 percent during his first month in office.

Poll respondents who were interviewed by Reuters gave different reasons for their dissatisfaction with the president on immigration.

A few said they are tired of waiting for Trump to make good on his promise to build a wall along America’s southern border, while others said they were uncomfortable with his administration’s efforts to restrict travel into the United States.

“There should be some sort of compromise between a free flow of people over the border and something that’s more controlled,” said Drew Carlson, 19, of Warrensburg, Missouri, who took the poll.

But Trump’s “constant fixation on deportation is a little bit unsettling to me.”

The Trump administration would not comment about the Reuters/Ipsos poll.

To be sure, Trump is still much more popular in rural America than he is elsewhere.

Since he took office, “I like him less, but I support him more,” said Robert Cody, 87, a retired chemical engineer from Bartlesville, Oklahoma who took the poll.

Cody said that Trump may rankle some people with the way he talks and tweets, but it is a small price to pay for a president who will fight to strip away government regulations and strengthen the border.

DROPPING OFF THE SCREEN

When Trump called the election a ”last shot“ for the struggling coal industry and when he called for protecting the nation’s southern border with a “big, fat, beautiful wall”, he was speaking directly to rural America, said David Swenson, an economist at Iowa State University.

“Feelings of resentment and deprivation have pervaded a lot of these places,” Swenson said. “And here comes a candidate (Trump) who’s offering simplistic answers” to issues that concern them.

Rural Americans responded by supporting Trump over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton by 26 percentage points during the election, an advantage that helped tip the balance in battleground states, such as Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, where Trump won by less than 1 percentage point.

But after 10 months, many are still waiting to see concrete changes that could make life easier in rural America, said Karl Stauber, who runs a private economic development agency serving a patchwork of manufacturing communities in south central Virginia.

“Rural people are more cynical about the federal government than people in general are,” Stauber said. “They’ve heard so many promises, and they’ve not seen much done.”

Despite all the talk of bringing manufacturing jobs back, Stauber said he has not seen any companies which have relocated to his region, or anyone expand their workforce, due to new federal policies.

“It just seems like we’ve dropped off the screen,” he said.

According to the poll, Trump’s overall popularity has dropped gradually, and for different reasons, this year.

Rural Americans were increasingly unhappy with Trump’s handling of healthcare in March and April after he lobbied for a Republican plan to overhaul Obamacare and cut coverage for millions of Americans.

In May and June, they were more critical of Trump’s ability to carry out U.S. foreign policy, and they gave him lower marks for “the way he treats people like me.”

In August, they were increasingly unhappy with “the effort he’s making to unify the country” after he blamed “both sides” for the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, in which a suspected white nationalist drove his car into a crowd of anti-racist demonstrators.

The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English across the United States. It asked people to rate the president’s performance and the results were filtered for people who lived in zip codes that fell within counties designated as “non-metro” by the federal government.

The poll combined the results of “non-metro” respondents into nine, four-week periods. Each period included between 1,300 and 2,000 responses and had a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points.",Trump's popularity is slipping in rural America: poll,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-ruralamerica-poll/trumps-popularity-is-slipping-in-rural-america-poll-idUSKBN1CE162?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

With Radar, BlackBerry enables customers to track trailers across country, and drivers can quickly locate vacant trailers scattered across vast parking lots.
On its last earnings call, the company named Trailer Wizards, a Canadian trailer rental and storage company with 25,000 trailers, as its third Radar customer.
Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.
“Its future earnings growth as a software company is only starting to be understood,” said Rivett.","BOLTON, Ontario (Reuters) - A visit to trucking firm Titanium Transportation helps explain why BlackBerry’s stock is once again a darling in Canadian markets, having soared 70 percent in two months.

Nestled in an industrial area some 50 kilometers north of Toronto, the trucker is an early adopter of a new BlackBerry fleet-tracking service known as Radar, which uses $400 boxes to collect and transmit information on movement, temperature and physical contents of Titanium’s 1,300 truck trailers.

Efficiency gains tied to Radar should allow Titanium to get maximum utilization of its fleet, positioning it to cut the number of trailers by five percent and also reduce labor costs, company executive Marilyn Daniel told Reuters.

“Time is everything in our world,” she said. “Being able to tell a driver where exactly a trailer is as opposed to having a driver search through a yard for sometimes hours has been a definite improvement.”

Radar is emblematic of BlackBerry Chief Executive John Chen’s strategy for turning around the Canadian icon, by steering the company away from consumer electronics and back to its roots of selling products to businesses.

Beyond Radar, BlackBerry is also betting on other types of software for industrial customers. It is leveraging its QNX subsidiary’s software foothold deep inside car infotainment consoles to expand into self-driving technology, while promoting its cyber-security software and services to thwart increased threats from hacking.

BlackBerry’s stock rallied after it showed signs of progress in quarterly earnings results at the end of March, followed by news in April of a nearly $1 billion cash windfall from arbitration with Qualcomm expected to fund future investments in growth. That comes in the face of an expected revenue decline to below $1 billion this year for the first time since 2004. At its smartphone peak, BlackBerry had annual sales of $20 billion.

Among the recent BlackBerry bulls are institutional investors such as Nokota Management, which took a new position with almost 4.8 million shares in the first quarter, and Oppenheimer Funds, which added 3.3 million more shares to its existing 4 million share stake, according to U.S. securities filings.

Iridian Asset Management and Connor, Clark & Lunn Investment Management, two of BlackBerry’s biggest shareholders, each raised their stakes by around a quarter as of the end of March.

Nokota did not respond to requests for comment, while the others all declined to discuss their stakes in BlackBerry.

“HOPE AND PROMISE”

The strategy is not without risks. BlackBerry faces challenges entering the telematics market, where analysts say rivals include Omnitracs, Teletrac Navman [VCRCPM.UL], Tomtom NV, Trimble Inc and U.S. telecommunications giant Verizon Communications Inc. Verizon last year paid some $2.4 billion to buy GPS vehicle tracking firm Fleetmatics Group Plc.

Radar “is not a unique and earth-shattering product,” said Nicholas Farhi, a partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants who advises companies on optimizing logistics operations.

That’s why some investors advise caution, saying it is too soon to figure out how to properly value the new BlackBerry offerings.

“It’s not the type of situation you can justify from a valuation standpoint,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management, which manages more than $1.5 billion and exited the stock a decade ago, when BlackBerry phones were still dominant. “It is all about hope and promise.”

And yet hope and promise among BlackBerry investors were hard to come by in the aftermath of Apple and Samsung walking away with the consumer hand-held phone business.

Since taking the company’s helm in 2013 to attempt a turnaround, Chen has turned to technology products used inside automobiles and corporate cyber security services, in addition to targeting the gritty trucking industry with Radar.

He also bolstered the company’s ability to manage rival devices in the workforce - still the single largest contributor to sales - with the purchase of rival Good Technology in 2015. And he outsourced production of handsets last year, meaning the company receives a cut from any devices sold by its partners rather than carrying the risk and revenue on its own books.

With Radar, BlackBerry enables customers to track trailers across country, and drivers can quickly locate vacant trailers scattered across vast parking lots. Previously, where drivers had to walk around those lots, banging on trailers in search of a hollow sound indicating it was empty.

BlackBerry charges $10 to $20 per month for every trailer connected to Radar, a product that an analyst at investment bank Macquarie says could play a pivotal role in a more than doubling of BlackBerry’s sales by 2020.

Sandeep Chennakeshu, president of the BlackBerry Technology Solutions unit that oversees Radar, told Reuters that large package delivery firms and big carriers of lumber and home goods are among the more than 50 companies testing it.

“It really depends on us convincing our customers to try our solution,” he said. “Once they try it, we’re very confident they’ll see the benefit.”

BlackBerry says that it is targeting some 16 million to 20 million trailers, chassis, vans, refrigerated units and piece of construction equipment for the Radar service, with a new variant on the hardware due to launch later this year.

On its last earnings call, the company named Trailer Wizards, a Canadian trailer rental and storage company with 25,000 trailers, as its third Radar customer.

AT&T will supply needed cellular connections for Radar in North America, and a second carrier is lined up to provide such services when it expands to Europe and Asia, Chennakeshu said.

The company expands Radar’s functionality with quarterly updates. The next one will tell customers if a trailer is a quarter, half or three-quarters full and improve integration with warehouse inventory management systems, he said.

The Radar boxes can send alerts when a trailer door is opened, its internal temperature goes beyond a set range, has been emptied or travels through a specific geography, features which Chennakeshu said are attractive for tightly-regulated movers including pharmaceutical companies.

Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.

Macquarie analyst Gus Papageorgiou is even more bullish, saying combined hardware sales and subscription fees could hit $540 million in fiscal 2020.

“The best is yet to come for BlackBerry,” said Paul Rivett, president of Fairfax Financial, the company’s second largest shareholder and owner of BlackBerry debt that can be converted into shares at $10 a piece in late 2020.

“Its future earnings growth as a software company is only starting to be understood,” said Rivett.",Born-again BlackBerry: Canadian icon hopes to ride trucks to growth,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blackberry-recovery/born-again-blackberry-canadian-icon-hopes-to-ride-trucks-to-growth-idUSKBN1901P1

(This article has been corrected to remove a reference to Advent and Apax steering clear of Japan.","HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Japan is finally warming up to buyouts. The world’s third-biggest economy should be a prime hunting ground for private equity: Japanese firms make great products and are often parochial, poorly run, and undervalued, offering lots of room for improvement. Yet the country has long frustrated foreign PE shops. This year offers proof things are improving.

A few early triumphs, like the 2000 takeover of what became Shinsei Bank, sparked a backlash against “vultures”. And bosses have tended to mistrust leveraged buyout specialists. So some big private equity names, like Permira, have done just a few deals. Others, including Advent and TPG, have left or scaled back.

Now Bain Capital is leading an $18 billion takeover of Toshiba’s memory unit. That will be a record-breaking LBO for Japan, and an unorthodox one, given the involvement of Apple, Dell and others. Thanks largely to this single deal, buyout volumes have already topped $20 billion this year, Preqin data shows. That is a massive uptick on recent years.

Those statistics maybe skewed, but last year was also busy, and it is revealing that private equity’s involvement with Toshiba was not politically controversial. Meanwhile, Bain is simultaneously bidding for local advertising agency Asatsu-DK, and Blackstone is expanding in Tokyo.

Elsewhere, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s drive for better returns is weakening the corporate taboo against shedding non-core businesses. Buyers have also adapted, becoming better at convincing blue-chip sellers they will be responsible stewards of unwanted units, helping them grow rather than relying on cuts to generate profits. Hitachi, Nissan and Panasonic have all done deals with KKR, for example. These tie-ups can be a long process and favour the few firms with deep roots in Tokyo.

The next question for buyout firms is how to snag more deals. Shareholder pressure means there are likely to be many more corporate cast-offs. So buyout firms need to be better at spotting upfront how they can make businesses more valuable, says Jim Verbeeten of Bain & Co, the consulting firm, or they will be routinely outbid by corporate rivals. Still, all the signs suggest that private equity has broken through the ice in Japan.

The company expects approvals to be in place by the end of October, Sudhir Mathur told Reuters on the sidelines of the India Energy Forum in New Delhi, as Cairn undertakes a fresh investment plan after the extension of its production contract until 2030.

No debt will be raised for the investment, Mathur said, adding that the money will be spent over a period of three to four years.

Cairn Oil and Gas was formerly known as Cairn India before it merged with Anil Agarwal’s Indian mining major Vedanta Ltd. The business received got a shot in the arm in March when the government approved the extension of its production-sharing contract in the Barmer basin in Rajasthan.

The company had said earlier this year that it could invest more in further developing its four main Barmer fields on the condition its production-sharing contract was extended.

The fresh investments are part of the company’s plan to produce oil and gas in India beyond 2020, Mathur said.

Cairn will also start drilling for oil and gas in the Krishna-Godawari (KG) basin in the Bay of Bengal by the end of March.

“Difficult to say at this time but we believe it’s quite prospective ... We would say anywhere between 250 million to 500 mln barrels of reserves would make it very viable for us,” Mathur said.

“The investments include all projects and will start with the $1 billion dollars we have already announced.”

The projects, apart from KG basin, include its gas field in the Raageshwari field in Barmer and an enhanced oil recovery (EOR) programme in the Bhagyam and Aishwariya fields. EOR involves chemicals being pumped into ageing fields to help to recov crude oil.

The company is now planning to increase output from its Mangala field in Barmer under a second EOR phase, Mathur said.

Cairn will also announce within a month a technology partner for its Rajasthan block to help to expedite production.

Mathur said that Cairn is keen to partner state-owned explorers such as Oil and Natural Gas Corp or Oil India if the incentives are right.

India’s government is working on a proposal to bring private investment into ONGC and Oil India-owned blocks where production has been poor.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s prime minister sees scope for further reform of the country’s energy sector and has received “focused suggestions” from some of the world’s leading energy companies, the office of the premier said on Monday.

Executives from companies including Rosneft, BP, Exxon Mobil, Reliance Industries, Saudi Aramco, Royal Dutch Shell, Vedanta, Schlumberger and Halliburton met Modi as the industry gathered in New Delhi for the three-day India Energy Forum, which finishes on Tuesday.

“Participants appreciated the pace and drive with which Prime Minister Modi has brought about reform in the energy sector,” Modi’s office said in a statement after the meeting.

“Subjects such as the need for a unified energy policy, contract frameworks and arrangements, requirement of seismic data sets, encouragement for biofuels, improving gas supply, setting up of a gas hub and regulatory issues came up for discussion.”

The statement said that many suggestions at the last meeting in 2016 have helped guide Indian policy-making and that Modi said he appreciated the “focused suggestions” made this year and that “scope for reform in many areas still exists”.

Modi was quoted as saying he looked forward to “various opportunities” for cooperation between India and Saudi Arabia, the second biggest oil exporter to the country behind Iraq.

State-run Saudi Aramco, which on Sunday launched a new office near New Delhi, is in talks with several Indian refiners for a possible joint venture by next year.

Its Chief Executive Amin Nasser told the conference after the Modi meeting that India’s oil demand would double by 2040 to about 10 million barrels per day, making it the world’s largest market for the fuel and a priority for the company.

In the meeting, Modi thanked Russian President Vladimir Putin and Rosneft for their support to India’s energy sector. The two leaders were instrumental in helping to seal Rosneft’s $12.9 billion acquisition of India’s debt-laden Essar Oil, strengthening ties between the world’s largest oil producer and the fastest-growing fuel consumer.

In another vote of confidence for India’s energy sector, BP and Reliance have previously said they would jointly invest $6 billion to boost India’s gas output. A BP executive said on Monday that the company was “excited about gas, upstream and digital innovation in India”.

Alay Patel, a senior analyst with consultancy Wood Mackenzie, the global president of which also met Modi, said that India’s domestic energy production outlook was positive thanks to steps such as a simplified licensing regime and clarity on contracts.

“But more is needed,” said Patel. “Allowing marketing and pricing freedom for all gas production, regardless of shore status and contract vintage, would incentivize companies to develop gas in the less explored basins.”",Indian PM Modi targets more energy reforms after meeting oil chiefs,https://www.reuters.com/article/india-energy-modi/pm-modi-targets-more-energy-reforms-after-meeting-oil-chiefs-idINKBN1CE1B9

But an administrator is not among them - nobody has been nominated to the top job since President Donald Trump took office.

Also missing from the roughly 550 people on the payroll of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, or NHTSA, are a permanent chief counsel, director for government affairs, chief financial officer and enforcement chief.

While a deputy administrator was appointed last week, slow progress in bringing in senior politically appointed officials has nearly frozen key decision-making at the agency, according to five former NHTSA officials, consumer groups, lawmakers and some business leaders.

They said that without leadership in place NHTSA has either pushed back or failed to act on rules setting new standards for improving how buses fare in rollover crashes, a system to remind passengers in rear seats to wear seat belts, and new tire standards.

Eight months into Trump’s presidency, senior positions in many government agencies across Washington remain vacant, including roles at the State Department, the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency and throughout the Transportation Department that oversees NHTSA.

Some of the vacancies are the result of Trump’s efforts to slim down the federal bureaucracy. Others are simply waiting to be filled.

The White House blames Democrats for dragging out the confirmation process for its nominees, and says vetting picks has been more complicated than usual because many come from the business world rather than government.

While many companies applaud Trump’s moves to roll back federal bureaucracy, some also complain that delays in bringing aboard political appointees is hindering government decisions that could impact business.

The frustration extends to some U.S. diplomats, private-sector lawyers and others who regularly deal with government agencies, according to interviews.

‘IN A STALL’

In September, the U.S. Tire Manufacturers Association urged Trump in a letter to accelerate his efforts to nominate a NHTSA administrator so the agency can comply with a 2015 road safety law passed by Congress.

The law ordered NHTSA to write regulations setting minimum tire standards for fuel efficiency and traction in wet conditions and create an online database for consumers to check for tire recalls.

U.S. manufacturers and consumer groups support the regulations, drawn up in response to vehicle deaths linked to faulty tires, because they will raise standards and make the U.S. market less accessible to poorly made versions.

“We don’t want the U.S. to be kind of the dumping group for the really low technology because there isn’t a standard to meet,” said Dan Zielinski, the association’s senior vice president.

Two former NHTSA leaders and consumer groups say the agency is also moving slowly on other regulatory issues, such as improving side impact standards.

“This agency is in a stall ... They are not going to do very much without political leadership,” said Joan Claybrook, a former NHTSA administrator under President Jimmy Carter and a prominent consumer advocate.

NHTSA said in a statement Friday that safety is its top priority. The agency is “committed to meeting all obligations as required” by the 2015 law. NHTSA has an ongoing review of all regulatory actions as part of an administration-wide effort.

A White House spokeswoman declined to comment on NHTSA but said “capable and professional staff” are filling essential positions throughout the government on an acting basis until confirmations go through.

Leadership shortages extend beyond the NHTSA. The White House had by Oct. 4 nominated 387 political appointees for civilian positions in the executive branch and 160 have been confirmed by the U.S. Senate, according to the non-partisan Partnership for Public Service.

Both numbers were well below those in the first eight months under at least the last four presidents. In the same period of Barack Obama’s presidency, 497 candidates were nominated and 337 confirmed.

One senior administration official said it aims to have all top positions - those at the level of assistant secretary and above - nominated by year’s end.

Still, some political appointee jobs are expected to stay empty, the White House spokeswoman said. “The federal government has grown unrestrained for decades because politicians have been too afraid to ‘drain the swamp’,” she said.

‘BEHIND THE CURVE’

In many cases, dire warnings from opponents that Trump’s delays in putting forward political nominations for approval would cause chaos have proven overblown.

But there are examples of government slowing down because mid-level employees do not have the authority or are unwilling to make decisions.

At the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which analyzes proposed transactions to ensure they do not harm national security, private-sector lawyers complain of slow decisions on big deals.

“There is an unwillingness for the staff people to make a decision,” said Michael Gershberg, a trade and investment attorney with Fried Frank.

A lobbyist who works on CFIUS deals said some companies have had to refile proposals because CFIUS failed to reach a decision within 75 days. That drives up legal and financing fees and creates uncertainty about the deal. Deals that have been refiled include a bid by Jack Ma’s Ant Financial to buy MoneyGram (MGI.O) and Zhongwang USA’s $2.33 billion bid for Aleris Corp (ALSD.PK).

The Senate last week confirmed Heath Tarbert, who is expected to oversee CFIUS, as an assistant secretary of the Treasury.

At the State Department, only six of the top 40 jobs have been filled, and no confirmed officials are in place to run regional bureaus that handle foreign relations. Instead, they are in the hands of career diplomats with limited authority.

The United States does not have an ambassador in place in such key allied countries as South Korea, Jordan, Qatar and Saudi Arabia.

”We’re pretty much frozen in amber here,” one official said.

A congressional aide said it was hard to determine the precise impact of the vacancies.

But he added that U.S. policy in the North Korea missiles crisis would likely be helped by an ambassador in Seoul, a fully empowered assistant secretary of state for East Asia and an active special envoy for North Korea.

“That’s just one example in the region with the most prominent national security crisis, and really one of the most serious in a long time,” he said.

Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan, testifying in Congress on Sept. 26, addressed the slow pace of filling posts.

”We’re behind the curve. We should be ahead of the curve. And we’re doing all we can to catch up,” he said. “Our work is getting done. It would be better done if we had those positions filled.”",Help wanted: Staff shortages under Trump slow policy changes,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trump-effect-staff/help-wanted-staff-shortages-under-trump-slow-policy-changes-idUSKBN1CB1AL

The force will initially be built around a Romanian brigade of up to 4,000 soldiers, supported by troops from nine other NATO countries, and complementing a separate deployment of 900 U.S. troops who are already in place. The plans are to include additional air and sea assets to give the force greater capabilities.

“Our purpose is peace, not war,” Romanian President Klaus Iohannis told the NATO Parliamentary Assembly of alliance lawmakers, which is meeting this year in Bucharest.

“We are not a threat for Russia. But we need dialogue from a strong position of defense and discouragement,” he said, before flying to the Craiova military base in south-eastern Romania.

At the base, as military bands played, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg stood alongside Iohannis, addressed some of the troops in green face paint and inspected vehicles and weapons.

“We are sending a very clear message: NATO is here, NATO is strong and NATO is united,” Stoltenberg told assembled Polish, Romanian, Spanish and Portuguese soldiers.

Russia accuses NATO of trying to encircle it and threatening stability in Eastern Europe, which NATO denies. Around the Black Sea, Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey are NATO members while Georgia and Ukraine aspire to join.

The NATO force aims to develop its presence in the Black Sea region, rich in oil and gas, without escalating tensions as it seeks to counter Russia’s own plans to create what military analysts say is a “buffer zone”.

The 2008 Russian operation to put troops in Georgia’s South Ossetia region, its support for separatists in eastern Ukraine since 2014 and its annexation of Crimea have raised the stakes, with all sides warning of a new, Cold-War style scenario.

Apart from Romania, Poland is the biggest troop contributor. Bulgaria, Italy and Portugal will train regularly with the force in Craiova, and Germany is also expected to contribute.

In additional to existing NATO Black Sea naval patrols, a maritime presence will include more allied visits to Romanian and Bulgarian ports, training and exercises.

‘WEST BERLIN’ MODEL

Some Eastern Europeans want NATO’s new ballistic missile defense shield, which includes a site in Romania, to be part of NATO’s eastern posture vis-a-vis Russia.

“The Aegis Ashore system would add another level of deterrence,” said Maciej Kowalski, an analyst at the Polish Casimir Pulaski Foundation, referring to the U.S.-built system.

NATO says the system is to intercept any Iranian rockets.

As in the Baltics and Poland, where the U.S.-led alliance has some 4,000 troops, NATO says the relatively light multinational model recalls allied support for West Berlin in the 1950s, when the presence of British, French and U.S. forces ensured the Soviet Union could not control all of Berlin.

Under NATO’s founding treaty, an attack on one ally is an attack on all, meaning all 28 NATO nations would be required to respond in the case of any potential Russian aggression.

While months in planning, the establishment of the force comes as Russia winds down its biggest war games since 2013. The Zapad, or West, games showed off Moscow’s latest weaponry and its ability to quickly mass forces on NATO’s borders.

The enhanced NATO presence in Romania and Bulgaria marks a diplomatic success for Bucharest, which gained greater persuasive power because it is set to reach a NATO goal of spending 2 percent of economic output on defense this year, a priority for U.S. President Donald Trump.

Romania pushed for bigger NATO naval presence on the Black Sea for more than a year, but found its neighbor Bulgaria wary of provoking Russia.

(Reuters) - Ford Motor Co has begun to develop new transportation service applications using a software platform developed by Autonomic Inc, a small Silicon Valley startup.

One of the first such businesses is a “microtransit” service called Non-Emergency Medical Transport, launched this summer by Ford and Michigan-based Beaumont Hospital. Patients can schedule pickups and appointments from a mobile app that was built on the Autonomic software platform, said Sundeep Madra, Autonomic’s chief executive officer and co-founder.

Vehicle manufacturers are exploring a wide array of digital services to supplement their existing businesses, including ride-hailing, car-sharing and delivery of food and goods. However, when it comes to developing consumer-facing smartphone apps and the data systems behind them, automakers have lagged Silicon Valley rivals.

Ford in the past month has announced partnerships with Domino’s and Lyft, using self-driving vehicles developed by Ford and its Argo affiliate. The Dearborn, Michigan automaker is also experimenting with a service called Chariot that offers access to van rides.

Ford CEO Jim Hackett mentioned the automaker’s investment in Autonomic during a presentation to investors last week. The 15-month-old company is developing “an open platform for transportation” on which Ford plans to build new in-vehicle and mobility-related services with a variety of partners, Hackett said.

If Ford elects to build its own ride-hailing or fleet management businesses, the Autonomic software platform could enable digital payment processing and customer identification, as well as directing the flow of data between the vehicle and the customer, according to a source familiar with the automaker’s plans.

Using the Autonomic software platform as a base, along with data from the vehicles, Ford and its partners then could build and charge consumers for products and services, said Marcy Klevorn, Ford president of mobility.

Klevorn cited FordPass as an earlier example of a software platform that has enabled Ford to provide digital services to subscribers, from parking to payments.

In an investor briefing on Tuesday, Jim Farley, Ford president of global markets, said the most important part of the company’s strategy in self-driving vehicles “is a diverse group of revenue streams . . . not just one revenue stream like ride- hailing, but multiple revenue streams,” including providing digital content to vehicle occupants.",Ford taps Silicon Valley startup to build transportation software,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ford-motor-digital/ford-taps-silicon-valley-startup-to-build-transportation-software-idUKKBN1CE1S9

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices stabilized on Monday after one of the most bearish weeks in months, propped up by OPEC comments signaling the possibility of continued action to restore market balance in the long term.

Oil production platforms in the Gulf of Mexico started returning to service after Hurricane Nate forced the shutdown of more than 90 percent of crude output in the area. The prospective restarts kept price gains in check.

Former hurricane Nate has become a post-tropical cyclone that continues to pack heavy rain and gusty winds, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said on Monday.

“Quiet market overall this morning though (refined) products are weaker as it looks like Nate was a non-event for refining,” said Scott Shelton, broker at ICAP in Durham, North Carolina.

“I think that without the support of products and Brent, the market may get dragged lower in the near term as its apparent that the market doesn’t care much about OPEC already jawboning about an extension of the deal.”

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is due to meet in Vienna on Nov. 30, when it will discuss its pact to reduce output in order to prop up the market.

OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said on Sunday that consultations were under way for an extension of the agreement beyond March 2018 and that more oil-producing nations may join the pact, possibly at the November meeting.

He also said OPEC members and other producers may have to take some “extraordinary measures” to ensure the market is in balance in the long term.

In a speech to the Reuters Global Commodities Summit on Monday, Barkindo said he saw clear evidence the oil market was rebalancing.

Global benchmark Brent crude LCOc1 was down 2 cents at $55.60 a barrel at 11:31 a.m. EDT (1531 GMT). Earlier in the session it touched a three-week low of $55.06. It ended last week 3.3 percent lower, its biggest weekly loss since June 2017.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures CLc1 were trading at $49.46, up 17 cents. They came close to a four-week low when they fell to $49.13 earlier in the session. WTI’s losses last week came to 4.6 percent.

In further signs that OPEC members are sticking to agreed cuts, Saudi Arabia said it had curtailed crude allocations for November by 560,000 barrels per day and Iraq’s oil minister said the country was fully committed to its OPEC production target.

Among other bullish news for oil, Morgan Stanley cut its forecast for U.S. crude output growth, citing a range of operational headwinds including limited availability of fracking crews.

Money managers raised their bullish bets on U.S. crude futures for the third week in a row, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission reported on Friday.

However, data published by InterContinental Exchange showed investors had slightly reduced their bets on rising Brent prices in the week ending Oct. 3.",Oil prices steady after OPEC signals possible deal extension,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil/oil-prices-steady-after-opec-signals-possible-deal-extension-idUSKBN1CE011?il=0

UK-listed theme park operator Merlin Entertainments may be planning something similar with SeaWorld, by trying to dislodge its Busch Gardens division. Breaking up the operator famed for its orcas might create some value, but it still looks a slippery target.

Both companies were previously owned by Blackstone and listed in 2013. The private-equity firm run by Steve Schwarzman sold its last stake in Merlin in 2015 and offloaded its SeaWorld holding to Chinese group Zhonghong Zhuoye in March. Neither company has escaped controversy since going public, with Merlin marred by a rollercoaster crash at its Alton Towers theme park, and SeaWorld’s valuation yet to recover from the “Blackfish” documentary showing poor treatment of killer whales.

A bid makes sense for Merlin. It wants to diversify away from its UK home market, which still generates 30 percent of its profit. The company’s finance chief already identified SeaWorld’s two Busch Gardens parks as potential acquisitions. An all-cash deal might push its debt to a toppy four times EBITDA, Stifel analysts reckon, perhaps requiring some equity too. But investors like the idea: Merlin’s share price rose over 3 percent on news of an approach.

There might even be some financial benefits for SeaWorld. Say the parks could be offloaded at a conservative 11 times EBITDA multiple, a slight premium to the group’s current valuation. A sale could fetch $1.6 billion based on estimated EBITDA of $145 million for the parks this year, adding around 10 percent to its market capitalisation.

Yet SeaWorld shareholders seem glum, sending its shares down 2 percent. That may be because they were hoping for a full takeout. Merlin after all has sea-life parks too. But its policy of not keeping large mammals such as killer whales or dolphins in captivity rules that out. And what remains is likely to be subscale, and need investment. Its largest Chinese shareholder, who bought in when the stock was around a fifth higher, may not be ready to sell. Without a clear plan for the rest of the business, Merlin’s next meal is likely to remain elusive.",Breakingviews - SeaWorld a slimy meal for ex-Blackstone predator,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-seaworld-entrnmt-m-a-breakingviews/breakingviews-seaworld-a-slimy-meal-for-ex-blackstone-predator-idUSKBN1CA2FA

On Oct. 15, he will have to certify whether Tehran is observing the 2015 multinational agreement to forego nuclear weapons. Trump has reluctantly certified Iran’s compliance, which is due quarterly, twice since taking office. This time, his belligerent address to the United Nations suggests he may not.If the United States follows through on threats to stop fulfilling its commitments under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, as the Iran deal is formally known, its allies in Europe will be forced to choose between committing a crime and making a mistake. Whichever they decide, the strength of the transatlantic coalition – America’s most important and most reliable partnership – will be cast into doubt.

Iran is complying with the JCPOA. The U.S. intelligence community has repeatedly confirmed it, as have partner intelligence agencies and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). European leaders oppose refusing to certify Iranian compliance because it would make it likely that Congress will re-impose U.S. sanctions.

That would be only the first of two body blows to the agreement and to the alliance. The second would be an abuse of U.S. authority to re-impose United Nations sanctions.

The president has the power to force the United Nations to “snap back” the multilateral sanctions lifted under the deal – biting restrictions on Iranian banks and other businesses. If the United States re-imposes its own sanctions on Iran, it will inevitably avail itself of these UN sanctions, as well.

The Bush and Obama administrations persuaded Russia, China, and the UN Security Council to sanction Iran’s economy in order to limit its nuclear program. The JCPOA traded these sanctions for tight nuclear restrictions and inspections, but the United States and its partners worried that the Security Council might fail to re-impose the sanctions if Iran cheated, reducing Iran’s incentive for long-term compliance. A clever procedural solution was built into the JCPOA. Any participant in the deal can demand that the Security Council vote on a resolution to continue sanctions relief. The U.S. can veto that resolution, so even if the Security Council votes 14-1 all of the previous restrictions on Iran still snap back into place.

The JCPOA was built to respond to Iranian violations, even if Russia and China were no longer aligned with the United States and the EU. It was not designed to withstand a hawkish or isolationist America using its veto power outside of the terms of the deal or against the objections of its European partners.

Ironically, though, if the U.S. does choose to act alone, in the absence of Iranian violations and against the wishes of its allies, it might undermine the substantive goal of UN snapback, leaving empty sanctions on paper.

Once the UN applies – or in this case, re-applies – sanctions, the European Commission and European Union member countries are supposed to take a number of steps to make the UN sanctions part of EU law and regulation. This is serious business for Europe, which is strongly committed to the idea that, as a matter of international law, the UN can impose binding requirements on all members in the interest of international peace and security. The EU has occasionally faced legal challenges in applying UN sanctions, but it never has simply chosen to ignore a binding Security Council resolution as a matter of policy.

Europe would be sorely tempted to do exactly that on Iran. The snap back mechanism is designed for cases of Iranian non-compliance. Under the JCPOA, Washington does not need to prove that Iran has violated the deal, but Europe may decide that American bad faith justifies breaking from its own UN obligations. Certainly, Europe will categorically disagree with the U.S. policy. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, echoing the senior leadership of the UK, France, and Germany, said after Trump’s UN speech that the deal is working and must be preserved. If the U.S. withdraws, the EU has made clear it will do everything within its power to keep the agreement alive by sustaining newly established business ties with Iran.

Europe would thus be faced with a choice between a crime under international law and what it considers to be a policy mistake. In either case, Europe would be justifiably furious about being forced to choose between two important, deeply held policies – adherence to Security Council resolutions and implementation of the JCPOA.

Other countries, including Russia and China, may also prove lax in applying the restored sanctions, but this is both less uncommon and less important to Iran’s economic aspirations. U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA will hurt Iran’s economy badly, but will not achieve the kind of strangulating effect the broad international coalition had before the deal. A deep break between the United States, the UN and Europe will make it much less likely that the U.S. will ever be able to muster such powerful international economic pressure again.

At the UN last week, President Trump called the Iran deal “an embarrassment to the United States.” He teased that he has made a decision about whether to certify Iranian compliance to Congress but refused to tell anyone, including UK Prime Minister Theresa May, what he had decided. The weeks leading to the October 15 certification deadline may be Europe’s last, best chance to explain to President Trump and his advisors that undermining, let alone abrogating, the JCPOA would be a catastrophe not only for the goal of preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons, but also for the bond between the United States and Europe. The only winners would be Europe’s and America’s adversaries.",Commentary: Trump’s Iran threats risk a U.S. break with Europe,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blanc-iran-commentary/commentary-trumps-iran-threats-risk-a-u-s-break-with-europe-idUSKCN1C32E3

(Reuters) - Ford Motor Co has begun to develop new transportation service applications using a software platform developed by Autonomic Inc, a small Silicon Valley startup.

One of the first such businesses is a “microtransit” service called Non-Emergency Medical Transport, launched this summer by Ford and Michigan-based Beaumont Hospital. Patients can schedule pickups and appointments from a mobile app that was built on the Autonomic software platform, said Sundeep Madra, Autonomic’s chief executive officer and co-founder.

Vehicle manufacturers are exploring a wide array of digital services to supplement their existing businesses, including ride-hailing, car-sharing and delivery of food and goods. However, when it comes to developing consumer-facing smartphone apps and the data systems behind them, automakers have lagged Silicon Valley rivals.

Ford in the past month has announced partnerships with Domino’s and Lyft, using self-driving vehicles developed by Ford and its Argo affiliate. The Dearborn, Michigan automaker is also experimenting with a service called Chariot that offers access to van rides.

Ford CEO Jim Hackett mentioned the automaker’s investment in Autonomic during a presentation to investors last week. The 15-month-old company is developing “an open platform for transportation” on which Ford plans to build new in-vehicle and mobility-related services with a variety of partners, Hackett said.

If Ford elects to build its own ride-hailing or fleet management businesses, the Autonomic software platform could enable digital payment processing and customer identification, as well as directing the flow of data between the vehicle and the customer, according to a source familiar with the automaker’s plans.

Using the Autonomic software platform as a base, along with data from the vehicles, Ford and its partners then could build and charge consumers for products and services, said Marcy Klevorn, Ford president of mobility.

Klevorn cited FordPass as an earlier example of a software platform that has enabled Ford to provide digital services to subscribers, from parking to payments.

In an investor briefing on Tuesday, Jim Farley, Ford president of global markets, said the most important part of the company’s strategy in self-driving vehicles “is a diverse group of revenue streams . . . not just one revenue stream like ride- hailing, but multiple revenue streams,” including providing digital content to vehicle occupants.",Ford taps Silicon Valley startup to build transportation software,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ford-motor-digital/ford-taps-silicon-valley-startup-to-build-transportation-software-idUSKBN1CE1S9

Berlin (Reuters) - Die insolvente Air Berlin wird als eigenständige Fluggesellschaft Ende des Monats den Betrieb einstellen.

Ein Flugverkehr in eigener Regie mit dem Airline-Code AB sei nach der Eröffnung des Insolvenzverfahrens “nach gegenwärtigem Erkenntnisstand spätestens ab dem 28. Oktober nicht mehr möglich”, teilte das Unternehmen am Montag mit. Davon ausgenommen sind die rund 80 Maschinen, die voraussichtlich die Lufthansa übernehmen wird, darunter die österreichische Tochter Niki und die Regionaltochter LGW. Die Zukunft der übrigen gut 50 der mittlerweile nur noch 134 Flugzeuge der Air-Berlin-Flotte hängt davon ab, ob auch mit Easyjet noch ein Verkauf ausgehandelt werden kann. Der britische Billigflieger war ebenfalls an etlichen Jets interessiert, zögerte aber Insidern zufolge zuletzt.

Unterdessen werden Kündigungen und Job-Wechsel für Air-Berlin-Mitarbeiter vorbereitet, die voraussichtlich nicht alle bei den neuen Flugzeugeigentümern unterkommen werden. So seien die Gespräche mit den Arbeitnehmervertretern über Sozialpläne angelaufen, erklärte das Unternehmen. Damit bestätigte Air Berlin weitgehend Informationen des Betriebsrats, über die die Nachrichtenagentur Reuters am Freitag berichtet hatte. Die Betriebsräte hatten nach einem Gespräch mit der Geschäftsführung die Sorge geäußert, dass rund 1400 Beschäftigten des Verwaltungs- und Bodenpersonals die Kündigung droht. Wer für die Aufrechterhaltung des Flugbetriebs gebraucht werde, könne noch bis Ende Februar 2018 bleiben. Die anderen Mitarbeiter würden wohl freigestellt.

Das Unternehmen lehnte erneut einen Kommentar zu den befürchteten Massenentlassungen ab und verwies auf die Gespräche über einen Sozialplan. In dieser Woche soll es Job-Messen am Firmensitz in Berlin mit potenziellen künftigen Arbeitgebern geben - darunter der Chemiekonzern BASF und die Deutsche Bahn.

AIR BERLIN BEENDET EIGENE GESCHÄFTE “ZUG UM ZUG”

Einem Insider zufolge sollen die Kündigungen nach Eröffnung des Insolvenzverfahrens ausgesprochen werden. Das ist spätestens Anfang November zu erwarten. Von diesem Zeitpunkt an müsste Air Berlin die Löhne und Gehälter, die seit August von der Bundesagentur für Arbeit kommen, selbst stemmen. Damit drohen die Verluste weiter zu steigen - zu Lasten der Gläubiger. Air-Berlin-Chef Thomas Winkelmann und der Generalbevollmächtigte Frank Kebekus schrieben in einem Brief an die Belegschaft, nach Abschluss der Kaufverträge müsse Air Berlin daher “die eigene Geschäftstätigkeit Zug um Zug beenden”.

Air Berlin ist seit Mitte August pleite. Der Konzern verhandelt noch bis Donnerstag mit Lufthansa und dem britischen Billigflieger Easyjet exklusiv über den Kauf von Teilen der Fluggesellschaft. Der Staatssekretär im Bundeswirtschaftsministerium, Matthias Machnig, geht davon aus, dass die Gespräche und Verträge bis dahin unter Dach und Fach gebracht werden. Zuletzt gab es jedoch Medienberichte, dass die Verhandlungen mit Easyjet über den Kauf von 27 bis 30 Flugzeugen scheitern könnten. Die Briten hätten ihr ursprüngliches Angebot von rund 50 Millionen Euro reduziert, berichtete die Zeitung “B.Z.” unter Berufung auf Air-Berlin-Kreise. Außerdem gebe es Streit um Landerechte in Düsseldorf und Berlin-Tegel mit Lufthansa.

Air Berlin und Easyjet lehnten Stellungnahmen dazu ab. Analysten und Branchenexperten hatten jüngst die Erwartung geäußert, dass sich Easyjet auch für Start- und Landerechte der insolventen britischen Fluggesellschaft Monarch interessieren dürfte.

NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Everything old is new again in finance. Navient, which services debt, is buying startup student-loan refinancer Earnest for less than half its 2015 valuation. Even then, it’ll eat into the new owner’s earnings and share buybacks. Worse, Navient faces a fresh lawsuit over dodgy practices.

The Pennsylvania attorney general’s office filed charges on Thursday that follow ones from the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in January with Illinois and Washington. All allege that Navient in some way or other cheated borrowers paying for college, which the company denies.

Regardless of how the cases turn out, the $3.5 billion company spun out of giant lender Sallie Mae in 2014 makes a strange bedfellow for Earnest. Like other startups in the sector, its founder Louis Beryl aimed to take advantage of not just the technological and marketing shortcomings of older financial institutions but also the post-crisis reputational damage they suffered.

Instead, it’s like déjà vu all over again. Two of the bigger breakout fintech firms have been embroiled in scandals. A mis-selling fiasco cost Lending Club its founder and boss Renaud Laplanche last year, evoking the mortgage misdeeds of earlier this century. And over the summer SoFi parted ways with its top executive, Mike Cagney, after he was accused of the same sorts of sexual harassment allegations that have plagued Wall Street for decades.

What’s more, the business model for many of these entrepreneurial ventures has been challenged by interest-rate concerns and rising defaults. Some, like Avant, Prosper and Vouch had to close or significantly scale back operations.

Earnest was one of the few that powered through, thanks in part to its focus on borrowers with decent credit ratings and salaries. It had long-term funding from New York Life and got ever better rates on its asset-backed deals. Even so, Earnest’s $155 million price tag suggests most in the industry have downgraded their expectations about profitable growth.

The reaction of Navient shareholders is informative. A couple of years ago, buying a well-run fintech lender probably would have sent the stock soaring, perhaps even drowning out news of a regulatory probe. Instead, Navient shares tumbled 12 percent, erasing market value more than three times the value of the acquisition.

Turkey supports only limited NATO reinforcements, concerned about breaking international rules limiting the scale of patrols in the Black Sea.","CRAIOVA, Romania (Reuters) - NATO launched a new multinational force in Romania on Monday to counter Russia along its eastern flank and to check a growing Russian presence in the Black Sea following the Kremlin’s 2014 seizure of Crimea.

The force will initially be built around a Romanian brigade of up to 4,000 soldiers, supported by troops from nine other NATO countries, and complementing a separate deployment of 900 U.S. troops who are already in place. The plans are to include additional air and sea assets to give the force greater capabilities.

“Our purpose is peace, not war,” Romanian President Klaus Iohannis told the NATO Parliamentary Assembly of alliance lawmakers, which is meeting this year in Bucharest.

“We are not a threat for Russia. But we need dialogue from a strong position of defense and discouragement,” he said, before flying to the Craiova military base in south-eastern Romania.

At the base, as military bands played, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg stood alongside Iohannis, addressed some of the troops in green face paint and inspected vehicles and weapons.

“We are sending a very clear message: NATO is here, NATO is strong and NATO is united,” Stoltenberg told assembled Polish, Romanian, Spanish and Portuguese soldiers.

Russia accuses NATO of trying to encircle it and threatening stability in Eastern Europe, which NATO denies. Around the Black Sea, Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey are NATO members while Georgia and Ukraine aspire to join.

The NATO force aims to develop its presence in the Black Sea region, rich in oil and gas, without escalating tensions as it seeks to counter Russia’s own plans to create what military analysts say is a “buffer zone”.

The 2008 Russian operation to put troops in Georgia’s South Ossetia region, its support for separatists in eastern Ukraine since 2014 and its annexation of Crimea have raised the stakes, with all sides warning of a new, Cold-War style scenario.

Apart from Romania, Poland is the biggest troop contributor. Bulgaria, Italy and Portugal will train regularly with the force in Craiova, and Germany is also expected to contribute.

In additional to existing NATO Black Sea naval patrols, a maritime presence will include more allied visits to Romanian and Bulgarian ports, training and exercises.

‘WEST BERLIN’ MODEL

Some Eastern Europeans want NATO’s new ballistic missile defense shield, which includes a site in Romania, to be part of NATO’s eastern posture vis-a-vis Russia.

Slideshow (5 Images)

“The Aegis Ashore system would add another level of deterrence,” said Maciej Kowalski, an analyst at the Polish Casimir Pulaski Foundation, referring to the U.S.-built system.

NATO says the system is to intercept any Iranian rockets.

As in the Baltics and Poland, where the U.S.-led alliance has some 4,000 troops, NATO says the relatively light multinational model recalls allied support for West Berlin in the 1950s, when the presence of British, French and U.S. forces ensured the Soviet Union could not control all of Berlin.

Under NATO’s founding treaty, an attack on one ally is an attack on all, meaning all 28 NATO nations would be required to respond in the case of any potential Russian aggression.

While months in planning, the establishment of the force comes as Russia winds down its biggest war games since 2013. The Zapad, or West, games showed off Moscow’s latest weaponry and its ability to quickly mass forces on NATO’s borders.

The enhanced NATO presence in Romania and Bulgaria marks a diplomatic success for Bucharest, which gained greater persuasive power because it is set to reach a NATO goal of spending 2 percent of economic output on defense this year, a priority for U.S. President Donald Trump.

Romania pushed for bigger NATO naval presence on the Black Sea for more than a year, but found its neighbor Bulgaria wary of provoking Russia.

Turkey supports only limited NATO reinforcements, concerned about breaking international rules limiting the scale of patrols in the Black Sea. Turkey has played down the extent of Russia’s militarization of Crimea, which NATO says involves deploying surface-to-air missiles and communications jamming equipment.",NATO launches Black Sea force as latest counter to Russia,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-nato/nato-launches-black-sea-force-as-latest-counter-to-russia-idUSKBN1CE0MJ

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Fostering monetary conditions conducive to economic growth were a constant consideration for Indian policymakers, but would not take priority over achieving the central bank’s inflation target, Governor Urjit Patel told a newspaper on Monday.

Patel told the Mint newspaper that the economy was recovering, after growth slowed to a three-year low of 5.7 percent in the April-June quarter.

The slowdown had sparked some calls for lower interest rates, but with inflation rising the RBI left rates unchanged at a review by the monetary policy committee (MPC) last week.

“Growth is always there in the MPC’s scheme of things; we don’t lose sight of that, but not at the cost of inflation,” Patel was quoted as saying in the interview.

“However, we have to be careful — we should aim at achieving the inflation target without losing sight of supporting economic growth.”

Consumer inflation accelerated to 3.36 percent in August. India’s central bank has a medium-term target for annual inflation of 4 percent with the flexibility of plus/minus 2 percent on either side to make room for food price volatility.

The (MPC) will strive to achieve its 4 percent inflation target on a “durable basis”, Patel said.

Last week, the RBI kept its repo rate unchanged at 6.00 percent as expected last week, and raised inflation projections, cooling hopes for future rate cuts.

However, Patel said growth was already starting to recover. The RBI last week cut its projection for gross value added - an indicator of growth it prefers to 6.7 percent from 7.3 percent for the year ending in March - higher than some analyst forecasts.

“Our projections based on high frequency real economy indicators suggest that growth will pick up in the third and fourth quarters (of the current fiscal year) to above 7 percent,” he told Mint.

“We have started seeing the upturn.”

Patel has given only a handful of interviews since taking over as RBI Governor late last year.

Pence was attending a game in his home state of Indiana between the Indianapolis Colts and the San Francisco 49ers.

When the national anthem was played before the start of the game, some 49ers knelt while some Colts, their arms locked, wore black T-shirts with the words “We Will” on the front and “Stand for equality, justice, unity, respect, dialogue, opportunity” on the back.

“I left today’s Colts game because President Trump and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem,” Pence said in a statement issued by the White House.

Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said after his team’s game on Sunday that he would bench players who disrespect the U.S. flag.

“If there is anything that is disrespectful to the flag then we will not play,” Jones told reporters.

Asked about Pence’s departure, Jones said: ”We cannot in the NFL in any way give the implication that we tolerate disrespecting the flag.

“I know the vice president did leave, because in his opinion the teams were,” he said, adding: “There is no question in my mind that the National Football League and the Dallas Cowboys are going to stand up for the flag.”

But the NFL Players Association in a statement defended players’ right to protest.

“We should not stifle these discussions and cannot allow our rights to become subservient to the very opinions our Constitution protects,” the association said, adding, in words that borrowed from the national anthem, “that is what makes us the land of the free and the home of the brave.”

After Pence’s departure, critics began to question whether he had only attended the game in order to make a production of leaving, pointing out he flew from Las Vegas on Saturday and was then going to fly to California on Sunday evening.

Pence had planned for “several weeks” to attend Sunday’s Colts game, where former quarterback Peyton Manning was being honored, an official in his office said, asking not to be named. Additionally, he made a last-minute decision to travel to Las Vegas for a prayer service on Saturday, the official said.

“As he had discussed with the president, when several 49ers players disrespected the flag and the national anthem, the vice president decided to leave the game,” the official said.

President Donald Trump said in a tweet on Sunday that he had asked Pence to leave the stadium “if any player kneeled, disrespecting our country.”

NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy declined to comment.

The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution bars the government from limiting free speech, including prohibiting protests of the national anthem or punishing people who choose not to stand. The national anthem is played before every NFL football game and many other sporting events.

Less than an hour after issuing Pence’s statement, the White House released a picture of him and his wife at the stadium where the game took place, standing with hands over their hearts during the performance of the national anthem.

Trump’s criticism of the NFL players has played well with his conservative base while he grapples with controversies over Iran and North Korea, an investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 election and policy struggles in Congress.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia and China called for restraint on North Korea on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump warned over the weekend that “only one thing will work” in dealing with Pyongyang, hinting that military action was on his mind.

When asked what Russia made of Trump’s comments, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a reporters on a conference call:

“Moscow has called and continues to call on the parties involved in the conflict and on those who have anything to do with this issue to exercise restraint and to avoid any steps that would only worsen the situation.”

Commenting on a Trump statement that the United States might withdraw from a nuclear deal with Iran, Peskov said such a move would have “negative consequences.”

In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying repeated China’s position that all parties exercise restraint, describing the situation as extremely complex and serious.

China hopes all sides do nothing to irritate each other or worsen the problem and speak and act cautiously, she told a daily news briefing.

In recent weeks, North Korea has launched two missiles over Japan and conducted its sixth nuclear test, all in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions, and may be fast advancing toward its goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.

Trump repeatedly has made clear his distaste for dialogue with North Korea. Last week, he dismissed the idea of talks as a waste of time, a day after Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Washington was maintaining open lines of communication with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s government.

“Our country has been unsuccessfully dealing with North Korea for 25 years, giving billions of dollars & getting nothing. Policy didn’t work!” the U.S. president said in a Twitter post on Monday.

Trump’s comments seemed to further suggest that military action was on his mind.

On Saturday, Trump made a similar comment on Twitter about how negotiations have failed for 25 years and said “only one thing will work” with North Korea.

U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Monday told the U.S. Army to be ready with military options on North Korea, but emphasized that efforts to deal with Pyongyang were being led diplomatically.

“There is one thing the U.S. Army can do and that is you have got to be ready to ensure that we have military options that our President can employ if needed,” Mattis said in a speech at an annual U.S. Army conference.

“We currently are in a diplomatically led effort and how many times have you seen the U.N.

P&G shareholders are not being offered a choice between one chief executive or another.
Since P&G’s board before Peltz jolted it into action had no such representative, they consider his pitch favorably.
To beat back Peltz, P&G needs to make up the difference between the active and retail investors, of some 255 million shares.
To put it another way, Peltz just has to win one of the three.","NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Procter & Gamble is counting on a variation of America’s electoral arithmetic as its best hope for keeping Nelson Peltz off the board of directors. There’s no particularly good reason for shareholders to deny the pushy investor, whose hedge fund Trian Partners owns 1.5 percent of the $235 billion diapers-to-shampoo conglomerate, a seat at the table. Yet as at the ballot box, a combination of voter apathy and arcane rules is likely to leave three investors holding all the cards at next Tuesday’s annual meeting.

It is an irony of the way American public equity markets have developed that the most important deciders on the P&G saga – as in many other proxy battles involving the world’s most valuable companies – are so-called passive index-fund managers led by Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street. To further the imperfect political analogy, they play roles similar to the ones Ohio, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania did in helping put Donald Trump into the Oval Office, even though his rival Hillary Clinton achieved more of the popular vote last November.

There are differences, of course. P&G shareholders are not being offered a choice between one chief executive or another. The question of whether to give Peltz, who comes armed with ideas about how P&G can improve its performance and more experience in the sector than most if not all of the company’s sitting directors, is far from existential. He would be one of about a dozen people helping set strategy, compensation and the like. Handing him a board seat is pretty much a no-lose option on bettering the maker of Tide and Pampers.

The insular, Cincinnati-based company thinks differently. P&G’s notorious allegiance to internal candidates for nearly every high-level position makes it vulnerable to criticism that it does not like outsiders telling it what to do. That’s a central theme to Peltz’s charges of P&G’s underperformance. For its part, the giant led by David Taylor says it’s already on track to create a “profoundly different, much stronger, and more profitable company” than just a few years ago.

As in previous engagements, Peltz is apt to have won over most of those P&G investors who spend their days thinking about whether to keep the investment in their portfolio. These so-called active managers, a group that in P&G’s case includes hedge funds, mutual funds and some pension funds, tend to agree that corporate boards benefit from having a voice from the investor community in their midst. Since P&G’s board before Peltz jolted it into action had no such representative, they consider his pitch favorably.

”Peltz’s experience in the consumer product space will add value to P&G’s board and his significant stake in the company will bring an owner’s perspective inside the boardroom,“ said Anne Sheehan, the director of corporate governance at CalSTRS, on Thursday. ”The addition of Mr. Peltz to the board is best for P&G, the CalSTRS fund and ultimately, the teachers of California.”

It’s here where the electoral math starts to matter. P&G has about 2.6 billion shares outstanding. Proxy advisers working either side of the tussle roughly estimate that investors like CalSTRS, Fidelity and Capital Group own about 41 percent of those shares. Assume 90 percent of the active managers live up to their billing and vote. If 80 percent of them tilt in favor of Peltz, that would give Trian about 770 million votes.

Retail investors own about the same amount of P&G, however. They tend to go along with what management has told them to do in the proxy cards that arrive in the post, as Trian learned the hard way when it failed to garner enough support to win seats on the board of DuPont two years ago. Like the American electorate, this group doesn’t tend to vote the way Fidelity and other institutions do. P&G may have an extra edge, though, in that many of its former workers still hold the stock, or received it as part of their retirement.

Yet there may also be folks who own the stock because, say, they love Dawn dishwashing liquid or live in the Cincinnati area and worry that Peltz would move its headquarters to the Bronx. So for arithmetic purposes, assume a slightly higher 60 percent of retail shareholders vote, and 80 percent of them cast their ballot against Peltz. That would give P&G 515 million votes.

That’s obviously not enough, and explains the significance of Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street. They have been the biggest beneficiaries of a trend toward investing in funds that simply track benchmark indexes like the S&P 500 – and charge lower fees for doing so – at the expense of higher-cost managers. Together, the trio control more than 17 percent of P&G, according to Institutional Shareholder Services, a proxy advisory firm that favors Peltz’s proposal.

To beat back Peltz, P&G needs to make up the difference between the active and retail investors, of some 255 million shares. In this scenario, P&G can only make that happen by bringing all three to its side. Vanguard, with 181 million shares, is the largest. State Street and BlackRock own 115 million and 156 million, respectively, according to ISS. To put it another way, Peltz just has to win one of the three.

Though that sounds like a tall order for P&G, past voting records give it a chance. In votes for directors proposed by shareholders, BlackRock only cast its ballot against management’s wishes 17 percent of the time at U.S. companies in the year to June 30. Nearly half the time, Vanguard sided with board-related proposals put forward by shareholders at U.S. companies. State Street says it cast its ballot in favor of any shareholder proposal, in defiance of management, only about 7 percent of the time in the first half of this year on a global basis.

These are not perfectly comparable statistics. They nevertheless suggest that P&G has a chance, just as Trump clearly did, if it can woo the investment world’s version of Pennsylvania, Ohio and Wisconsin. That also means a weekend trip for Peltz to suburban Malvern in the Keystone State – where Vanguard calls home – is advisable.",Breakingviews - Cox: P&G counting on an investor electoral college,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-procter-gamble-trian-breakingviews/breakingviews-cox-pg-counting-on-an-investor-electoral-college-idUSKBN1CB25W

Trump had blamed his former political ally for the Iran nuclear deal in a series of derisive Twitter posts that drew a sharp riposte from Corker, who chairs the important Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

In a sweeping, 25-minute interview, Corker told the newspaper he was alarmed about a president who acts “like he’s doing ‘The Apprentice’ or something” - in a reference to the reality television show that Trump had once hosted.

“He concerns me. He would have to concern anyone who cares about our nation,” the senator, who announced his retirement last month, said.

Corker dismissed the idea that Trump may be using provocative comments about North Korea to advance U.S. negotiations being conducted by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson by playing “bad cop” to the top diplomat’s “good cop” effort to broker a deal with Pyongyang.

“I know he has hurt, in several instances. He’s hurt us as it relates to negotiations that were underway by tweeting things out,” Corker told the paper, which added that Corker did not provide details about negotiations. “A lot of people think that there is some kind of ‘good cop, bad cop’ act underway, but that’s just not true.”

Corker had been a national security adviser to Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign and on Trump’s short-list last year for both vice president and secretary of state.

But the relationship between the two men has greatly deteriorated.

More recently, Corker has criticized Trump, taking issue with the president’s response to a white supremacist demonstration in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August. Critics assailed Trump for saying rival protesters were also to blame for violence.

”Senator Bob Corker “begged” me to endorse him for re-election in Tennessee. I said “NO” and he dropped out (said he could not win without my endorsement),“ Trump wrote. ”He also wanted to be Secretary of State, I said “NO THANKS.” He is also largely responsible for the horrendous Iran Deal!

“Hence, I would fully expect Corker to be a negative voice and stand in the way of our great agenda. Didn’t have the guts to run!”

An hour later Corker tweeted back: “It’s a shame the White House has become an adult day care center. Someone obviously missed their shift this morning.”

Corker’s chief of staff, Todd Womack, said Trump called the senator last Monday, asked him to reconsider his decision not to seek re-election in 2018, “and reaffirmed that he would have endorsed him, as he has said many times.”

Trump’s dispute with Corker could also have implications for the president’s policy goals of repealing Obamacare and passing tax reform. Republicans control both houses of the U.S. Congress but hold only a narrow majority, 52-48, in the Senate, which means Trump has only a slim margin for potential defections from within his own party on legislation.

Even before Trump’s Twitter attacks on Corker, the senator has said he would have difficulty supporting any tax package that added to the federal deficit, posing a potential hurdle for the president’s tax plan.

“Bob Corker gave us the Iran Deal, & that’s about it,” Trump posted on Twitter later on Sunday. “We need HealthCare, we need Tax Cuts/Reform, we need people that can get the job done!”

KEY PLAYER ON IRAN

On Iran, Trump is expected to disclose within days a plan to decertify the 2015 international nuclear agreement with Tehran, putting the agreement’s future in the hands of Congress, where Corker would play a central role in determining its fate.

Trump has long criticized the pact, a signature foreign policy achievement of Democratic former President Barack Obama in which Iran agreed to reduce its nuclear program in exchange for easing of international sanctions.

During the U.S. political fight over the agreement, which was opposed by every Republican in Congress, Corker co-wrote the law that required congressional approval for the deal and required the president to certify that Iran was complying every 90 days.

Some critics on the far right have blamed Corker for that measure, which they say helped push the pact through Congress.

The two-term senator’s retirement is a blow to a Republican Party struggling to balance divisions between mainstream and more populist wings.

Asked last week about reported tensions between Trump and Tillerson, Corker responded with what was seen as a jab at Trump.

He described Tillerson, Secretary of Defense James Mattis, and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly as “those people that help separate our country from chaos.”

After Charlottesville, Corker said, “The president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability, nor some of the competence, that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful.”",Senator Corker says Trump risks putting U.S. on path to World War Three,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-corker/senator-corker-says-trump-risks-putting-u-s-on-path-to-world-war-three-idUSKBN1CD0OP

Thousands of the Rohingya fled for Myanmar to Bangladesh on Monday in a new surge of refugees driven by fears of starvation and violence which the United Nations denounced as ethnic cleansing.

The United States and the European Union have been considering targeted sanctions against Myanmar military leaders, though the European bloc sees its options as relatively limited, with no hard-hitting, direct leverage on the ground.

EU foreign ministers will discuss the situation in Myanmar on Oct.16, and their draft joint statement said the bloc “will suspend invitations to the commander-in-chief of the Myanmar/Burma armed forces and other senior military officers”.

The text, which will be discussed further by envoys from the 28 EU states on Tuesday and may be modified, said the EU may consider further measures depending on developments in Myanmar but would “respond accordingly to positive developments”.

The document confirmed support for an existing EU embargo on arms and equipment “that can be used for internal repression”.

It called on Myanmar to discuss repatriating refugees from neighboring Bangladesh and praised the latter for its role in the crisis, which started when attacks by Rohingya militants on security posts brought a ferocious military response.

Refugees and rights groups say the army and Buddhist vigilantes use killing and arson to drive the Rohingya out of Myanmar. Myanmar rejects accusations of ethnic cleansing.

The EU draft characterized the situation in the most-affected Rakhine State as “extremely serious” and said Kachin and Shan provinces were also “of great concern.”

It called on all sides to cease violence, told the military to “end its operations” and protect all civilians equally, as well as calling on Myanmar to allow humanitarian access to the affected regions.

The West has invested politically in Myanmar leader and Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, who has faced scathing international criticism for not doing more to stop the violence.

HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - China’s moves to slash reliance on the internal combustion engine signal tough times for the country’s oil majors. A push into new energy vehicles (NEVs) – including battery-powered and hybrid cars – could curb demand for black gold. Sinopec and PetroChina will be hardest hit. The policy will also add to downward pressure on global crude prices.

The People’s Republic is ultimately hoping to outlaw traditional gasoline-fueled cars entirely, cleaning up the air and relieving it of dependence on oil imports. There is no official deadline for the move, but Wang Chuanfu, founder of Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD, reckons the ban could come as early as 2030.

As a battery maker poised to profit from the shift, Wang’s guesstimate is certainly self-interested, and probably wishful thinking. Electric cars accounted for less than 2 percent of China’s market share in 2016, and a bottleneck in battery production will hamper the transition.

But there is no doubting China’s determination to push the pace. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology says NEVS should account for a fifth of auto sales by 2025. As soon as 2019, regulators want automakers to make NEVs at least 10 percent of total sales. That means China’s $440 billion retail fuel market is in for a bumpy ride.

GIANT PROBLEM

Sinopec will be hit hardest. Gasoline sales made up around a quarter of total revenue at the group’s listed unit China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation in 2016, and the energy giant runs almost a third of the country’s 100,000 or so service stations. These hubs boast more than 23,000 convenience stores, a valuable sideline. Non-fuel sales could grow by as much as 25.5 percent a year in the period 2016 to 2019, according to research by brokerage CLSA. There are plans to launch a Hong Kong IPO for the group’s marketing unit, but the outlook has clouded of late. There is no public prospectus, and the offering – expected to raise around $12 billion – now looks unlikely to materialize this year.

PetroChina will feel the pinch too. It controls some 20,000 petrol stations, and sold more than 62 million tonnes of gasoline last year, worth about 357 billion yuan at 2016 prices. PetroChina is slightly less dependent on refining than Sinopec – gasoline sales made up roughly a fifth of revenues. However, investors appreciate the higher margins the company earns from refining and other downstream operations when oil prices are subdued, as they are now.

If one fifth of auto sales are absorbed by the NEV market in 2025 as planned - assuming China hits its target of 35 million units sold that year - that would rob gas stations of 7 million automobiles, enough cars to support the equivalent of 3,500 gas stations, according to a conservative Breakingviews calculation.

When combined with new environmental and industrial policies, a successful EV push could make a real dent in long-term global oil demand. Absent government intervention, S&P projects China’s oil consumption would probably balloon to 41 million barrels of oil a day by 2050, compared to 10.9 million barrels a day in 2015. On the other hand, if Beijing manages to meet all its ambitious published targets for electric vehicles, emissions reductions and industrial efficiency upgrades, oil demand would attain barely half those levels, the study shows. Sinopec, PetroChina, and even upstream operator CNOOC could be vulnerable.

TRICKY MANEUVER

There is time to plan. It might be decades before the fleet of combustion engines actually shrinks. Even so the big Chinese players are already looking to diversify. Downstream operators might recalibrate refineries to focus on petrochemical products like plastics, while pushing further into natural gas. Sinopec says it is exploring geothermal energy and biomass, too. Offshore markets could help as well; exports of gasoline and diesel from Chinese refineries have been rising for the past few years.

Another strategy might be restructuring the retail business to accommodate electric vehicles. Perhaps the gigantic network of service stations could be converted into charging stations; drivers waiting for cars to charge, or swapping batteries, might shop at the convenience stores too. Sinopec is working with State Grid to offer charging services, state-backed China Daily reported earlier this year. Unfortunately in these areas the oil incumbents have little or no advantage over other competitors. Gas stations aren’t particularly convenient places to recharge compared to, say, parking lots.

Whichever route they take, energy conglomerates will still enjoy massive financial scale and unparalleled influence in the halls of government. It seems unlikely Beijing will stand aside and let them collapse. Even so, investors will watch closely to see if the oil majors can shift gears before it’s too late.",Breakingviews - China’s oil giants brace for electric car crash,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-oil-breakingviews/breakingviews-chinas-oil-giants-brace-for-electric-car-crash-idUSKBN1CE06W

The defeat of ultra-nationalist parties in the Netherlands and in France earlier this year gave European leaders the sense that fear of a far-right surge had, after all, been misplaced. As it turns out, it was the relief that was misplaced.

Europe remains a battleground between nationalist forces, conventional right or left governments and parties which cleave to broadly liberal positions. It is not alone. Across the world, the same impulses to define a state according to ethnic or historic criteria, or to put existing states “first,” grow in diverse forms.

Two referenda illuminate the trend. One, in the Kurdistan region of Iraq on Sept. 25, produced an almost 93 percent vote in favor of Kurdish independence, followed by an immediate demand from the Iraqi government to invalidate the vote and a threat to use the army to suppress any move to independence. On Sunday the citizens of the Catalonia region will vote on whether to secede from Spain – provided that the Spanish state, which has already arrested leaders of the referendum and confiscated voting materials, does not carry out threats to block all voting stations.

The tone in the democratic world is often set by the United States – no longer the champion of greater openness and cooperation, but now the promoter of America First. Work began earlier this week on prototypes for Donald Trump’s “beautiful” wall between Mexico and the United States; the president extended his travel ban to the citizens of three more states (Chad, North Korea and Venezuela) while dropping one, Somalia, from the list – this to align immigration “with his America First foreign policy vision.”

Europe, though, is the hub of nationalist struggles. In large part, this is because the nationalist politicians pit themselves against the continent’s large ambition to create a European Union which, in its enthusiasts’ view, should become a powerful, federal state through progressive integration – a perspective powerfully supported by the European Commission’s president, Jean-Claude Juncker in his “state of the Union” address earlier this month.

Immigration has been and remains the spur for the nationalists. Its growing unpopularity fills out their sails and brings them votes from all over the political compass, including a significant proportion from working class voters accustomed to voting left, even far left.

In Germany’s general election last weekend, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) soared to become the third-largest party in the Bundestag (parliament) behind the governing CDU/CSU center-right coalition and the center-left SPD, largely on strong opposition to immigration. One of the AfD leaders, Alexander Gauland, called Chancellor Angela Merkel’s opening of the borders to some one million migrants “a gift” to his party, which it gratefully accepted and used more successfully than even the party thought possible. Some commentators believe the shock to the German system – built for decades on a moderate consensus opposed to right-wing extremism of any kind – will “condemn Europe to permanent crisis.”

In Sweden, which has taken proportionately more migrants than any other European country over the past two years, crime, including shootings and riotous behavior, seems to have increased. The extent of that has been distorted by the right, but a careful analysis in the National Review does conclude that Sweden has “a growing problem with crime that is linked to immigration.”

The phenomenon was enough for the Migration Minister from neighboring Norway, Sylvi Listhaug – a member of the nationalist Progress Party, part of the governing coalition - to make a media-trailed visit to a Swedish “no-go area,” claiming during the visit that there are ""conditions of lawlessness and criminals in control"" in places with ""a large quantity of people with immigrant backgrounds."" The subtext was that this would not be permitted to happen in Norway. Her Swedish counterpart cancelled a scheduled meeting with her, saying her statement was “complete nonsense.""

In Central Europe, the Visegrad Group of states – the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia – have rejected requests from fellow members of the European Union to take in a quota of migrants. Earlier this week in Prague, I asked the leader of the ANO party, Andrej Babis, strongly favored to be prime minister after the October general election, what his policy toward the EU would be. He answered that he would demand a return of powers from Brussels to the national level, since the EU had no business dictating national policy – a popular view in the country. He has already made clear that he is wholly opposed to migrants being received in Europe.

In her speech on Brexit in Florence last week, UK Prime Minister Theresa May said that the British had “never felt entirely comfortable” in the EU. It’s probably a fair summation of a national mood; most British have always seen the EU as a transactional, rather than political, union. When a sizable part of the population came to believe that the EU is both incomprehensible and overbearing, Brexit resulted.

Across the English Channel, Emmanuel Macron has put himself at the head of a revived and fiercely proactive campaign to rouse the EU to continue its forward march. In a speech Tuesday, the French president proclaimed that “the only path that assures our future is the rebuilding of a Europe that is sovereign, united and democratic.” Integration – in defense, security and within the eurozone, had to be more profound, he said.

It was the vision in which one will not compromise with the nationalist forces – forces which will weaken Merkel, his strongest ally, as she tries to balance Germany’s contending forces rather than embrace his euro-optimism.

Brexit has had the headlines, and attracted the most derision from the EU enthusiasts.

VIELHA, Spain (Reuters) - If Catalonia declares independence from Spain this week, one community in the region’s mountainous north might declare independence from Catalonia.

Most people in the picturesque Aran Valley - a semi-autonomous community nestled among the Pyrenees - want to stay with Spain, and the area has the right to self-determination under a law passed in 2015 by the Catalan parliament.

“We’re a little spot on the map and often we’re not taken into account,” said Maria Verges Perez, the deputy mayor of Aran’s capital, Vielha, a cluster of stone-and-slate houses on the valley floor ringed by autumnal forests.

“But we will exercise our right to decide our future.”

Catalan President Carles Puigdemont is expected to declare independence on Tuesday in Spain’s worst constitutional crisis since the return of democracy in the 1970s.

The roughly 10,000 people of Aran, on the border with France, have a language and culture distinct from the rest of Catalonia, which itself differs from the rest of Spain. The valley’s economy is heavily dependent on winter sports tourists from Spain and the EU.

Their politicians say the 2015 law gives them the right to vote on whether they want to break away with Catalonia - something which Catalan officials do not dispute.

The Spanish government has vowed to prevent Catalonia seceding. Losing the region would deprive the country of 16 percent of its people and a fifth of its economic output.

But while Madrid insists Spain is indivisible under its constitution, the Aran Valley underlines the complex nature of nationhood in such a culturally diverse country.

Ever since Spain’s return to democracy in the 1970s, Madrid has struggled to balance the country’s patchwork of regional identities, including its decades-long fight to quell separatism in the northern Basque Country led by violent militants ETA.

Few in the medieval villages along the Aran Valley doubt the community would opt to stay with Spain if asked to vote.

“The people here feel very far away from what is going on in Barcelona,” said Carlos Barrera, head of the Aran government, at a rural festival in Salardu village where locals judged stocky Pyrenean horses and handed out racks of blood sausages.

CROWN OF ARAGON

The valley had the lowest voter turnout by far in Catalonia’s Oct. 1 independence referendum, which had been declared illegal by Spain’s constitutional court.

Across Catalonia there was a 43 percent turnout, with most people who wanted to remain in Spain staying home, and 90 percent of those who voted backed secession. In Aran, just 24 percent voted, with 84 percent of those backing independence.

The valley traces its political allegiances back to pacts drawn up in the 13th century with the Crown of Aragon, a monarchy that would join with the Crown of Castille two centuries later to form what became Spain. Many locals speak Aranese, a dialect of the Occitan language still spoken in pockets of the Pyrenees and southern France.

Two years ago, the Catalan parliament approved the “Law on Aran’s Special Status”, giving it control over its culture, language and administration and recognizing “the right of the Aranese people to decide their future”.

A Catalan government spokesman said Catalonia would respect the Aranese people’s decision in any future referendum.

A Spanish government spokesman declined to comment on whether Aran could remain part of Spain, saying Catalonia would never become independent.

Aran’s residents are some of the sternest critics of the Catalan government which they say is ignoring those people who want to stay in Spain and charging toward independence at any cost.

In Vielha, a lone red and yellow Catalan independence flag hanging from an apartment block was the only evidence last Saturday of the separatist fever sweeping many parts of the region, where cities convulse with protests triggered by Madrid’s violent crackdown on the referendum.

PRICE OF INDEPENDENCE

Many people in Aran fear Catalan independence would destroy its tourism economy which revolves around Baqueira-Beret, Spain’s most popular ski resort.

About two-thirds of the population in Aran depend on the ski resort for jobs. In the winter, the population triples with the influx of skiers drawn to the same slopes used by Spain’s royal family.

Since the referendum, Verges Perez, the Vielha deputy mayor, said potential visitors had canceled almost 30 percent of hotel reservations for next week’s local holidays. And if an independent Catalonia was no longer part of the European Union, Aran’s reliance on agreements to use French hospitals for medical emergencies would be jeopardized, she added.

“That’s the trap. Nobody has explained the price that independence like this would have,” she said.

Many of Catalonia’s largest businesses have already said they are transferring their headquarters out of the region due to the political turmoil. Insurance firm Catalana Occidente, owned by the same family that owns Baqueira-Beret, is reportedly considering doing the same, although it has not confirmed it.

The valley ranks as one of Catalonia’s wealthiest regions, thanks to a tunnel that opened it up to the rest of Spain in 1948. Before then, it was a poor area only accessible by an often snow-covered mountain pass.

The valley’s politicians say holding their own referendum could be the only way to defend the local economy.

But Jaime Geli, Salardu’s 72-year-old former mayor and one of the few independence supporters here, said locals shouldn’t be so quick to throw their lot in with Spain instead of sticking with Catalonia.

Catalan authorities had protected the Aranese culture and language from a central government hostile to the idea that Spain is made up of different “nations”, he said, sat by the valley’s river.

(Reuters) - Cash-strapped U.S. shale firms scaled back their hedging programs in the first quarter, leaving them more vulnerable to tumbling spot market prices just after OPEC reached a landmark deal to curb global supply.

The pullback in hedging was driven by rising service costs and expectations that prices would continue to rally after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended those cuts in May, analysts said.

However, rising U.S. production has stymied OPEC’s efforts to rebalance markets. Crude oil futures LCOc1 have lost 15 percent of their value since February, raising the risk that unhedged companies are more exposed to market weakness.

The market peaked at $55 a barrel in January as cuts got under way, but has struggled since, and closed Monday at $48.29 a barrel [O/R], barely changed from the end of November, when OPEC agreed with nonmembers to cut 1.8 million barrels a day in supply.

For oil traders, hedging data serves as a leading indicator of future supplies. With so little hedged, dealers say producers are now looking to hedge at the next chance possible, a move that will pressure prices in coming months.

Producers hedge by buying a variety of financial options to secure a minimum price for crude and safeguard future production.

According to a Reuters analysis of hedging disclosures by the 30 largest U.S. shale firms, most stayed on the sidelines in the first three months of 2017, a stark contrast from a year ago when firms rushed to lock in prices, even though oil was trading $15 a barrel lower.

In total, 18 companies reduced outstanding oil options, swaps or other derivatives positions by a total of 49 million barrels from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, the data shows. Another 10 companies increased their hedging positions by 91 million barrels; two others did not hedge at all.

Infographic ID: '2rolpok'

Compared with a year ago, the group is more exposed to falling oil prices, with one-fifth fewer barrels hedged, or the equivalent of 28 million barrels, and three times more barrels rolling off, or the equivalent of 38 million barrels.

“A lot of producers held back on locking in hedges in the first quarter because OPEC cut their historic deal and they thought there would be a linear shift higher in prices. But then, we saw several pullbacks,” said Michael Tran, director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets.

Prices are too low now for producers to lock in large volumes of future production, Tran said. In addition, pent-up demand for hedging will pressure any moves higher in the oil market, he said.

UNDERHEDGED ANXIETIES

Morgan Stanley said in a recent note that producers are hedged at around 12 percent of their 2018 output and 40 percent for their current 2017 output.

The increases were driven by Hess Corp (HES.N) and Apache Corp (APA.N), which had previously remained unhedged. They added a combined 54 million barrels.

Analysts expect U.S. oil drilling to taper off as old hedge positions wind down, leaving smaller producers exposed to market prices at below break-even levels.

“I think companies are a little bit nervous that they are underhedged right now and they will try to take advantage of any hedging opportunity they get at about $50 per barrel,” said Bill Costello, a portfolio manager at Westwood Holdings Group.

SOME NEW PLAYERS

In total, the 30 companies held hedged positions equivalent to about 483 million barrels at the end of March, compared with 441 million at the end of 2016. Excluding Hess and Apache, the two highest hedgers, the group held only 428 million barrels.

Some large players refrained from building a larger buffer. Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) - which held 33.2 million barrels hedged for 2017 in the fourth quarter - had 8 million barrels roll off through the first quarter. EOG Resources (EOG.N) had nearly 6 million barrels unwind after terminating its hedges.

Analysts said much of the hesitation has to do with rising service costs. Firms that supply rigs and crews are clamoring to take back discounts extended during the height of the slump early last year, in some cases boosting prices by 10 to 15 percent.

“Producers are working in an environment where they see service cost increases on the horizon. They see their expenses going up, but their revenues are not going up correspondingly, which is why they do not want to hedge and compress their margins,” said Rob Thummel, a portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors LLC.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Google has discovered Russian operatives spent tens of thousands of dollars on ads on its YouTube, Gmail and Google Search products in an effort to meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, a person briefed on the company’s probe told Reuters on Monday.

The ads do not appear to be from the same Kremlin-affiliated entity that bought ads on Facebook Inc, but may indicate a broader Russian online disinformation effort, according to the source, who was not authorized to discuss details of Google’s confidential investigation.

The revelation is likely to fuel further scrutiny of the role that Silicon Valley technology giants may have unwittingly played during last year’s election. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Moscow’s goal was to help elect Donald Trump.

Google has uncovered less than $100,000 in ad spending potentially linked to Russian actors, the source said.

Both Twitter Inc and Facebook recently detected and disclosed that suspected Russian operatives, working for a content farm known as the Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg, Russia, used their platforms to purchase ads and post content that was politically divisive in a bid to influence Americans before and after the November 2016 presidential election.

The Internet Research Agency employ hundreds of so-called “trolls” who post pro-Kremlin content, much of it fake or discredited, under the guise of phony social media accounts that posed as American or European, according to lawmakers and researchers.

Facebook announced last month it had unearthed $100,000 in spending by the Internet Research Agency and, under pressure from lawmakers, has pledged to be more transparent about how its ads are purchased and targeted.

Google’s review had been more robust than ones undertaken so far by Facebook or Twitter, the source said.

Russia’s ad purchases were first reported by the Washington Post.

Google, owned by Alphabet Inc, did not deny the story, and in a statement pointed to its existing ad policies that limit political ad targeting and prohibit targeting based on race or religion.

“We are taking a deeper look to investigate attempts to abuse our systems, working with researchers and other companies, and will provide assistance to ongoing inquiries,” a Google spokeswoman said on Monday.

Google runs the world’s largest online advertising business and YouTube is the world’s largest online video site.

Congressional committees have launched multiple investigations into the Russian interference. Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have said Russia intended to sow discord in the United States, spread propaganda and sway the election.

Google officials have been invited to testify publicly about Russian attempts to use their platforms to influence the election before both the House and Senate intelligence committees on Nov. 1 alongside Facebook and Twitter.

(Reuters) - Uber said on Monday it would suspend its unlicensed service UberPOP in Oslo until Norway introduces new rules, as the U.S. ride-hailing app adopts a more conciliatory tone with national authorities.

The move follows a similar one-year suspension in Finland in July to allow a new taxi law to come into effect, however there is no set date for when UberPOP will be reintroduced in Norway.

The U.S. ride-hailing company has come under fierce pressure from traditional taxi drivers and regulators across Europe who accuse it of unfair competition and skirting traditional licensing rules.

UberPOP has already been suspended in several European capitals, including Paris and Brussels, and Uber was recently humbled when it lost its license to operate in London.

“We’ve learned the hard way that we must change as a company in order to serve the millions of riders and drivers who rely on us. With our new CEO Dara Khosrowshahi onboard, it’s a new era for Uber,” the company said in a statement.

“That’s why it’s now time to pause UberPOP in Norway, in order to relaunch under new regulations.”

UberPOP will be suspended on Oct. 30, while Uber’s licensed services UberBLACK and UberXXL will continue to operate as normal.

The Norwegian transport minister said Uber was being treated as any other market participant would be. “All actors offering taxi services must conform to rules and regulation at any time,” Ketil Solvik-Olsen told Reuters.

The suspension of UberPOP in Norway comes as the non-EU country must answer by Oct. 27 a query on its transport regulations by the EFTA Surveillance Authority (ESA), the body that ensures EU regulations are enforced in countries that have access to the European common market.

Uber will suspend UberPOP three days after that deadline.

In February, ESA said Norway was setting “disproportionately high barriers to enter the taxi market” that led to inefficient use of resources and higher prices for consumers.

Khosrowshahi took the helm of Uber in August, replacing co-founder and former boss Travis Kalanick and has promised change at the $70 billion dollar firm.

The company said it was encouraged by developments in Norway such as the government’s sharing economy committee which recommended repealing certain provisions related to taxis and an opinion from the EFTA surveillance authority which said Norway’s restrictions on taxi licenses were illegal.

“Norway deserves modernized laws that encourage innovation and competition without sacrificing what makes the Norwegian model special,” Uber said. “We hope the government will implement these recommendations soon, so that we can relaunch a new and improved version of the product loved by so many.”

LONDON (Reuters) - Low on cash but high on hope, Iran’s technology entrepreneurs are learning to live with revived hostility in the United States and growing suspicion - or worse - from hardliners at home.

Their startups and e-commerce apps are flourishing, driven by government infrastructure support and young Iranians educated both in the country and abroad. Some are even drawing foreign investment in a way that Iran’s dominant oil industry has yet to achieve since most international sanctions were lifted early last year under a nuclear deal with world powers.

Life remains tough despite the easing of Iran’s international isolation. The atmosphere in Washington has soured again, with President Donald Trump signing legislation tightening domestic U.S. sanctions on Iran and threatening to pull out of the nuclear accord.

On top of this, Google and Apple have withdrawn some services temporarily or indefinitely for Iranian users in recent months for reasons including the U.S. sanctions.

Still, the absence of U.S. giants such as Amazon and Uber has allowed their Iranian equivalents Digikala and Snapp to grow rapidly. Many other local internet firms are following suit.

Ramin Rabii, chief executive of Turquoise Partners, which facilitates foreign investment in Iran, said Trump’s rhetoric could paradoxically help the tech sector.

“If he keeps talking about sanctions, that would increase the risk of investment in Iran, but at the same time it will keep a lot of competition out,” he told Reuters in a telephone interview from Tehran. “Major global players are not here.”

No figures are available on foreign investment in Iranian tech firms. Rabii, however, estimated it at hundreds of millions of dollars since the nuclear deal came into force.

By contrast, an expected rush into Iran’s huge energy reserves has yet to materialize. French group Total is investing in a gas project but Tehran has yet to seal any major oil deals with international partners.

Foreign investment in Iranian tech remains modest compared with regional mega-deals such as Amazon’s purchase in March of Dubai-based retailer souq.com. Amazon did not reveal the price but beat off a rival offer worth $800 million.

Still, Rabii sees a bright future. “Many foreign investors ask me what is the best performing sector in Iran for the next decade. I always name e-commerce and the tech sector,” he said.

LOCAL INCARNATIONS

After the relative isolation of the international sanctions era, the tech sector has attracted many young Iranians back from the United States, Canada and Europe. They hope to marry their experience of the startup scene with locally-educated talent.

Reza Arbabian left Canada, where he went as a teenager, to join his family textile business in Iran. But in 2012 he launched Sheypoor, the Iranian answer to Craigslist, a U.S. classified advertisements website.

Sheypoor now employs 200 and recently marked its fifth anniversary. Cash, however, remains tight.

“Many foreign companies are still hesitant and Iranian investors don’t understand the value in e-commerce. They cannot accept that they need to wait for five years for a startup to make profits,” said Arbabian.

Some outside Iran, especially in Europe where the sanctions net is not quite so tight, are nevertheless willing to take the plunge. Swedish-based Pomegranate Investment, for instance, has taken a 43 percent stake in Sheypoor.

On a larger scale, Sarava, Digikala’s main shareholder, is 45 percent-owned by foreign investors. These include Pomegranate, which raised its stake to 15 percent with a 41 million euro ($48 million) investment in 2016.

Following the Amazon model, Digikala has grown into Iran’s biggest internet company with a market share of 85-90 percent, according to Pomegranate. Staff numbers have leapt in the past two years from 800 to more than 2,000.

INFRASTRUCTURE

Iran came late to mass internet access but has invested heavily under President Hassan Rouhani, hoping to attract foreign cash and create more jobs.

According to the Measuring Information Society of Iran, a government-linked portal, more than 62 percent of households were connected to the internet by March 2017. This was up from only 21 percent in 2013, the year Rouhani took office.

Smartphone ownership has also rocketed. Iran, a country of 80 million people, had only two million smartphone users three years ago but the number hit 40 million in 2016.

Such developments encouraged Kamran Adle, an Iranian born and raised in London, to move to Tehran last year.

“Iranian infrastructure has dramatically improved in recent of years. 3G and 4G is much more commonplace than it was a couple of years ago,” said Adle, whose firm Ctrl+Tech invests in early stage startups and helps them to develop apps.

Some Iranian apps are copies of foreign equivalents, made out of the reach of international lawyers. But the years of isolation also forced domestic talent to be more innovative, and Adle says there is no shortage of app developers.

One such is Farshad Khodamoradi, who has designed the app for a job-hunting startup being launched this month. Unlike traditional sites, “3sootjobs” will use an algorithm-driven matching system to connect candidates with the right employers.

Khodamoradi complains about difficulties in accessing foreign tech services, many of which are U.S.-based. “The main problem is that the global services Iranian startups are using can be cut off overnight,” he told Reuters from Tehran.

He cited Google’s Firebase, a platform used to generate push notifications - such as messages to passengers that a taxi has arrived to pick them up - without their having to open the app.

This was unavailable in Iran on a number of occasions in June and July, disrupting startups including taxi hailing apps, he said. Google did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.

Although technology firms can gain exemptions from the sanctions, U.S. corporations appear unwilling to risk involvement in Iran. In August, Telecommunications Minister Mohammad Javad Azari Jahromi threatened to take legal action over Apple’s removal of Iranian apps from its app stores. Apple did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.

MESSAGE FROM OBAMA

All this seems in contrast to U.S. promises after the nuclear deal. In March 2016, in a message to the Iranian people, then President Barack Obama said ending international sanctions “would mean more access to cutting-edge technologies, including information technologies that can help Iranian startups”.

Since that message, anti-U.S. Iranian hardliners have followed the growth of startups suspiciously, branding them as vehicles of enemy infiltration. Two foreign-based tech investors have also ended up in prison.

Nizar Zakka, a Lebanese information technology expert with permanent U.S. residency, was jailed in 2016 for 10 years for collaborating against the state. He had attended a conference in Tehran the previous year at the invitation of one of Iran’s vice presidents, only to be arrested by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps as he was going to the airport to leave the country.

Iranian-American businessman Siamak Namazi also got 10 years in 2016 on charges of cooperating with the United States. While under arrest, Namazi appeared in an Iranian documentary seen by Reuters in which he said his mistake had been to accept money for his startup from an organization linked to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

The Revolutionary Guards, a military force that runs an industrial empire, largely control telecommunications in Iran.

However, tech entrepreneurs say the environment is generally supportive. “We haven’t come across any of those governmental push-backs,” Adle said.

In the longer term, the sanctions would make using the souq.com model to cash in on Iranian investments much harder.

But Eddie Kerman, of London-based Indigo Holdings which links retail investors to Iranian tech firms, is optimistic.

“American companies like Amazon might not be able to enter the Iranian market, but there is a significant possibility that European or Asian companies buy the larger Iranian players,” he said.",Keeping the competition out: Iran startups thrive despite sanctions,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-investment-tech/keeping-the-competition-out-iran-startups-thrive-despite-sanctions-idUSKBN1CB1BB
