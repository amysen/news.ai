The other day he called his team together and told the boys he would not tolerate anyone protesting the national anthem.

“As Americans we have one common thread and that is that men/women of all color have fought and died to give us the right to live free and get to play football on a Friday night and all the other liberties we have,” the coach wrote on Facebook. “To disrespect that is not right.”

So when cousins Larry McCullough and Cedric Ingram Lewis ignored the coach’s orders and decided to protest, the coach took immediate action. Click here to watch the video.

He made both players remove their uniforms on the field and dismissed them from the team.

“I want to be clear that I don’t have a problem with people protesting if it is done the right way,” the coach said. “But to disrespect the flag that gives us the right to protest is the wrong way to do it. I gave the two players other ways to protest that I felt was fair.”

But instead of following their coach’s instructions, the young men took matters into their own hands.

“I pretty much knew how he looked at us when I was holding my fist up and my cousin was kneeling,” Lewis told CBS in Houston.

His mother was furious with the coach’s actions – accusing him of humiliating the boys in front of the crowd.

“Him standing as a Christian and a pastor that was just not right at all on any level,” Rhonda Brady told the television station.

Coach Mitchem delivered a powerful retort – reminding us that America is not about skin color. It’s about freedom.

“Americans know and understand that if we lose that one common thread – the love of country and respect for what we have – then it won’t be long before we lose that freedom that we have,” he wrote on Facebook.

A few points to consider:

The boys were not kicked off the team for protesting the national anthem. They were kicked off the team for disobeying their coach.

“A man with integrity and morals and ethics and who truly believes by that would not have done anything like that,” parent Brady told the Houston Chronicle.

On the contrary, a football coach without integrity would’ve allowed the football team to do whatever they wanted – without consequences.

“Actions speak louder than words,” Brady told a local news reporter.

I believe it’s fair to say that Coach Mitchem’s actions could be heard across the football fields from coast to coast.

He demonstrated to those young boys what it means to take responsibility for their actions, that there are consequences to disobeying authority.

“Though many may disagree with me this is what I believe and as an American I have that right,” he said. “I pray these young men across American can come to understand there is a right and wrong way to do things.”

Unfortunately, we live in a society where personal responsibility is an archaic concept. Parents teach their children they are never to blame. It’s always someone else’s fault.

Ms. Brady told the newspaper she does not want her son or her nephew to be coached by Mitchem.

“I don’t want my kids or my nephew to be around a man with no integrity,” she said.

I was far more worried about my kids’ relationship with God and their mother than about their politics or the political fight of the day. American politics today is such small ball gutter politics. The stakes are so small that the fights are all that matter. And I want my kids to have no part of that. Sure, there are fights that matter. But there are many more fights you think matter than actually do.

In spite of the horror that we witness on news channels or hear on the radio or read on the internet, I am going bold. I am choosing to allow myself to believe that ultimately people are good.

Pollyanna? Not really. The idea that we live in a world with nothing but hurtful, selfish, attention-seeking criminals, is too much for me, and I am betting, too much for you, too. Who wants to live in a world where there is no love or trust or goodness?

After watching the news coverage of the Las Vegas massacre, or the collapse of the Twin Towers, or rampant school shootings, I could easily allow myself to change my tune on this. Madmen are everywhere, I could think. Let’s cancel every concert, football game, and summer fair. Let’s hide inside, where we all are safe from harm.

But that’s not the world I want. I want to teach my kids to fight for more. I want my friends to find ways to focus on the good. I want my colleagues to create beautiful works that can brighten some dark place. And I am not alone. Most of us believe that the goodness in the world far outweighs the bad. This is not to minimalize the severity of what we see in the news, it is unbelievable, unacceptable and despicable. But, in this world, we have to keep a true perspective that people wish for better. That they wish for goodness.

""I don't know who this man was but I do believe that God sends all kinds of people to our lives who have the ability to share something as simple as a smile.""

Let’s give ourselves permission to still see the good in others. Let’s focus on the simple acts that change our day or perspective. Let’s notice the gentleman holding the door while we struggle with our groceries. Or the bus driver who waits a few extra minutes for the mom who is running late to meet her kindergartener. Or the stranger who pulls onto the side of the road to help change a tire. Or the teenager who steps in to stop a bully. Or someone who offers a tiny gesture of encouragement.

A friend recently shared a story with me about a stranger who offered encouragement that changed everything. She said:

It was my first day back to work after a 12-week maternity leave. I was headed to drop off our baby girl for her first day of daycare. I was a wreck. My emotions were all over the place and I was questioning both our decision for me to return to work as well as the daycare we had chosen back when I found out I was pregnant.

It was early morning on a Monday in January, 2000. I remember it vividly. I was at a two-lane stoplight waiting for the light to turn red when a truck pulled up beside me on the passenger side of my car. The tears were running down my face and I remember praying that this would all be okay. As the truck stopped I glanced through the passenger side of the window and a kind man locked eyes with me and gave me a smile that still resonates in my memory. I don't know who this man was but I do believe that God sends all kinds of people to our lives who have the ability to share something as simple as a smile. Of course, I was still emotional and heartbroken to leave my baby, but I knew God would be with her just as He was with me.

By changing our perspective we have the power to change everything. I am allowing myself, and invite you to join me, as I search for ways to concentrate on the good. It won’t be easy--we are programmed to zero in on the negativity. It’s going to take work and discipline to walk away from conversations that bring us down. It’s going to require a new mindset.

""I was traumatized,"" Robert James Kuefler told The Associated Press on Saturday. ""What would you do?""

White Bear Police Capt. Dale Hager said Kuefler, 60, was charged this week with interference with a dead body or scene of death because Kuefler moved his brother's body. Hager said both the brother and the mother died of natural causes in 2015.

Several months after their deaths, Kuefler wrote to other family members in a Christmas card that both were in bad health and could not talk on the phone and did not want visitors. Police did not find the bodies until September 2016, when a neighbor reported that the Kueflers' lawn in the Minneapolis suburb of White Bear Lake was overgrown and that it had been a long time since she had seen activity at the house, the St. Paul Pioneer Press reported.

Kuefler told the AP that his mother, 94-year-old Evelyn Kuefler, died in August 2015 and his brother, Richard Kuefler, died several months before. Court records say the mother's body was decayed and skeletal and the brother's body was ""mummified.""

""I am not some nut ball,"" the maintenance worker said in a telephone interview. ""People think I am, but I'm not. I loved them.""

Hager said disability and Social Security checks for Krueger's mother and brother were sent to their accounts by direct deposit and that it did not appear that any money was withdrawn, though federal authorities are still investigating. Kuefler told the AP that he did not tap the accounts.

Hager said authorities decided to file the misdemeanor charge against Kuefler in part to help get him some psychological help through the court system.

""This is our way of introducing this case onto the court,"" Hager said. ""We do believe his actions violated the law. Moving the body of his brother disrupted the death scene.""

""We're depending on our partners in the court system to make a good decision,"" he said.

Kuefler, who has no criminal history, said he needs no counseling.

Bruce Hornsby could be heard at Key West’s Mallory Square as a “reclamation party” got underway, Thursday afternoon. The feeling was positive and the outlook was bright.

Hours later, Key West Mayor Craig Cates came in to Two Friends Patio Restaurant for dinner, as nearby Duval Street began to show signs of life.

“Key West is going to be open for business soon,” said Cates.

When asked about the higher volume of people out and about, the mayor replied, “Well, we’re taking visitors now. We haven’t advertised yet,” he said.

Cates, however, pointed out that the hardest hit parts of the Keys are still picking up the pieces from Irma’s devastation. “We understand our neighbors to the north in the Florida Keys got more damage than us,” he said.

In nearby Big Pine Key, the cleanup is still ongoing.

Among those cleaning up are 85-year-old Wes Harris and his wife. “We’ve been married 63 years,” he said.

The couple rode out the storm near their now beat-up home.

The wheelchair ramp into Harris’ home was just recently repaired by first responders, but there’s still so much more to do.

“See that rock? You see how big that rock is?” Harris said as he pointed to a large boulder in his yard. “That’s not my rock. I don’t know where the hell it came from.”

The legally blind U.S. Army veteran, who suffers from spinal stenosis, lost his orchid ranch, which he says had between 7,000 and 8,000 flowers.

Harris is so tough that the idea of getting a little emotional over the relief effort in the aftermath of the storm makes him annoyed.

“I just can’t believe how everybody has helped. It’s absolutely unbelievable,” Harris said.

Harris’ post-storm story isn’t necessarily unique. Residents told 7News about problems with their house, their boat, or in some cases, both.

Big names also came to help out the Keys, in the form of former football player Tim Tebow and U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.

“So many people are so tough, and what they’ve gone through,” said Tebow. “You know what’s even more special? So many people, who don’t know what’s even going on with their houses, but they’re still volunteering for other people that need help.”

Residents appreciated Tebow’s visit. “He’s such a huge model for me, so it’s a nice thing that he came down here to the Keys,” said one woman.

7News cameras captured Rubio posing for pictures, as food, ice and relief supplies got to those in need.

When asked what he would say to those residents who fear they may be forgotten, Rubio responded: “They won’t be forgotten by us — I don’t know if someone else will — primarily because we’ve spent a lot of time, personally, in the Keys, up and down this place. I mean my family, we’ve had so many incredible memories here. We want to see the Keys come back.”

Meanwhile, Harris indicated he will make it through that strong current called adversity, probably because of his big heart. “You’ve got to keep stroking, bud. That’s all you can do,” he said.

As the reclamation party begins in Key West, many residents feel that, because the cleanup is still underway, the party is happening too soon. however, others feel that it needs to happen to show that the Florida Keys are still alive.

Officials said tourism will return to Key West in a limited capacity on Sunday with the arrival of a cruise ship at the Margaritaville Pier. It is scheduled to arrive at noon.

The “hack,” demonstrated by food blogger Bev Weidner, is for peanut butter “slices” and it involves smooth peanut butter, parchment paper and a freezer – and a lot of confusion.

GLADWARE'S CONTAINER LIDS ARE BLOWING PEOPLE'S MINDS

For her tutorial, Weidner first takes a jar of peanut butter and spreads “globbies” onto a sheet of parchment paper with a wooden spoon. She then smooths out a hefty offering of the nutty spread before folding the parchment paper over the top of the butter and rolling it out a couple of times with a rolling pin. From there, she places the peanut butter in the freezer.

In the Facebook video, which had 8.6 million views as of Sunday, Weidner says the frozen peanut butter can be cut into slices and then placed on the bread easily.

“It comes to room temperature semi-quickly, but you have time to drizzle it with maybe some honey on top, some chocolate sprinkles. Kid's love it,” Weidner says.

This method, Weidner explains, prevents mess and “torn bread” from spreading the peanut butter right out of the jar.

Facebook is less convinced.

The video has received over 11,000 comments with most of them questioning the need to add steps in making a peanut butter sandwich.

“Because nothing is easier than spreading peanut butter on waxed paper, rolling it flat with a rolling pin, freezing it overnight, then cutting the frozen sheets of peanut butter into bread sized squares and using them to make your honey and peanut butter sandwiches.....” a user commented.

Another said, “I cant(sic) be the only one that doesn't have an issue spreading peanut butter.”

A few joked about the length freezing the peanut butter would take.

“The time it took to spread it on wax paper, smooth it with a rolling pin, freeze it and then cut it with scissors, I could have made you 308 peanut butter sandwiches.”

“Child-‘Mama? Can I have a peanut butter sandwich please?’

Just because someone experiments with opioids doesn't mean that he or he will become addicted. However, there's risk with any opioid use, even when it's medically warranted. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency classifies opioids as a Schedule II drug, a substance with medically accepted use but a high potential for abuse.

Many parents and guardians don't think their child is at risk for misusing opioids. While that may be true, consider this: In 2013, one in eight U.S. high school seniors reported using opioids for nonmedical reasons. In 2015, 122,000 teens under 17 and 427,000 adolescents between 18 and 25 had a pain reliever use disorder, meaning that they had a problem with the drug.

SOLVING THE OPIOID CRISIS MUST START IN THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE

I've studied substance use prevention for 15 years, including time in rehabilitation centers with teenagers addicted to heroin, so I understand how critical it is to prevent opioid use at a young age. Fortunately, there's a lot of research on this topic, as well as numerous resources to help parents figure out where to start.

What parents need to know

First, parents should educate themselves about opioids: what they are, how they work in the brain and body, risk factors for using them and how to spot signs of use.

Parents shouldn't convey misinformation about opioids to their children. If their children find out that what they've been told isn't accurate, they may turn instead to their peers for information.

There are excellent online resources available for parents and their children, such as the National Institute on Drug Abuse for Teens website and the Partnership for Drug-Free Kids' Parent Drug Guide.

It's particularly important to note the long-term effects that nonmedical use of opioids can have on adolescents. Around puberty, the brain starts a massive restructuring process. Neural connections get stronger and stronger, helping adolescents go from the emotional decision-making of youth to rational decision-making in early adulthood. This process continues until the mid- to late 20's.

During this time, what adolescents do can get ""hard-wired"" into the brain. So, for example, if a young person is engaged in academics, sports or learning a musical instrument, those connections get set in the brain. If they spend a lot of time using drugs, those could be the connections that stick. That means they'd have an increased chance of developing a substance use disorder later in life.

In adolescence, many people learn important life skills, including how to cope with adversity. However, long-term drug use that starts during adolescence can affect our memory and learning. Because drugs, particularly opioids, help alleviate both physical and emotional pain, adolescents may then continually turn to this drug as a way to cope, rather than using more adaptive coping skills that are usually learned during this time.

Starting the conversation

One of the most important tools that parents have is the ability to talk to their child about substance use. While talking about drugs with young people isn't always comfortable, research has shown that it's critical for prevention.

Chances are good that even young teenagers will have heard about opioids and overdose deaths at some point. Pretending that opioid use is not a problem – or thinking that a child is a ""good kid"" and therefore doesn't need to hear and talk about it – is a mistake. Being a ""good kid"" does not mean that an adolescent will not be curious or be tempted by peers.

Starting the conversation can be difficult. I advise parents to keep an eye out for a time when the topic can naturally come up. For example, if a celebrity is found to be using opioids or other drugs, or if the problem comes up in the child's school or neighborhood, or even on the child's social media account, this could provide the opening for a discussion.

DALLAS SEES 177 PERCENT SPIKE IN K2-RELATED 911 CALLS

Parents could ask their children if they have heard about opioids and, if so, what they know. That could be a good starting point and an opportunity to do the research together.

There are also helpful online resources that provide tips and advice on how to have these types of conversations, such as the Parent Talk Kit, which provides advice on what to say in specific scenarios with kids of different ages. For example, the beginning of high school is an incredibly important time for parents to bring up how some teens use opioids and to let their child know that, if she ever makes a mistake or gets stuck in a bad situation, she should come and talk to them.

These conversations aren't a one-shot deal. They should happen often, ideally repeating parents' expectations and adding new information when relevant.

Other tips

Parents should make an effort to get to know their children's friends. Having friends who use drugs is very strongly associated with adolescents' own drug use.

Additionally, children are less likely to use prescription drugs if their parents monitor where they are when they're not at home.

About two-thirds of teenagers who use prescription drugs for nonmedical reasons report getting the drugs from friends or family members, including taking them from medicine cabinets without people knowing. So, parents should properly and safely secure their prescription medication, especially opioids.

Finally, if parents suspect that their child is using or has a problem with opioids, it's imperative to get help as soon as possible. The best outcomes often come from intervening early.

For more information, the Partnership for Drug Free Kids has a resource hotline with advice on how to confront children about suspected drug use, as well as additional resources to help parents navigate getting children help with a substance use disorder.

The good news is that nonmedical opioid use among adolescents is on the decline. However, it's still a significant problem that needs attention. Parents have the power to help – and talking to their children is an important first step.

She barely even acknowledged me when I greeted her. Then one day, everything changed.

The coworker, whom I’ll call Carrie, dropped by my office and asked for advice about how to deal with her supervisor. I appreciated the fact that Carrie trusted my advice, but I was uncomfortable with the conversation. She seemed to be gossiping more than trying to fix the problem, so I tried to turn the conversation to a more positive direction.

“That sounds frustrating, but you can’t fix your supervisor,” I said. “The only person you can work on is you. If you spend your energy trying to fix someone you can’t control, you’re just going to feel frustrated and helpless.”

She laughed and said, “You remind me of Joel Osteen.”

As we fix our thoughts on the true, honorable, right, pure, lovely and admirable things in the people around us, we’ll find less pleasure in sharing their weaknesses with others. We'll also be less interested in hearing other people spew negativity about others.

I repeated my advice with my best twangy Osteen impression and wrapped up the conversation, sincerely hoping she might actually change her behavior. She didn’t.

When Carrie would see me, she always found a way to make the conversation about her supervisor. I would give a similar motivational talk and redirect the conversation, but it never seemed to work. It became apparent that gossiping about her supervisor was how Carrie connected to other people. And I decided I wasn’t going to be one of those people anymore.

The next time Carrie tried to strike up a gossipy conversation about her supervisor, I was more direct.

“I understand that you’re frustrated with your supervisor, but if you aren’t careful, it will be the only way you can connect with people at work,” I said. “You’ll basically be using people to listen to you vent about your supervisor.”

Carrie looked visibly uncomfortable, abruptly ended the conversation and totally avoided me after that. Even when I would speak in the hallway, she would mumble an unintelligible response and look past me.

We had no relationship unless I was willing to listen to her vent. We couldn’t be friends unless we shared a common enemy. In other words, we weren’t really friends.

My relationship with Carrie was based on emotional triangulation, something Edwin Friedman warns against in his book, “Failure of Nerve.” The common denominator in all triangulated relationships is that there’s some negative third pillar – some frustration or offense – that keeps the relationship together. And it happens more easily than we realize.

We find ourselves always venting about the same subject to a friend. We repeatedly share “prayer requests” that are really passive-aggressive ways of gossiping. It’s cowardly. We can’t deal with our own problems so we find other people who will take on our anxieties and offenses.

There’s nothing wrong with being transparent about our struggles when we talk with friends, but we just need to make sure it’s not the only thing we’re talking about. We’ve got to redirect ourselves and “[f]ix our thoughts on what is true, and honorable, and right, and pure, and lovely, and admirable. Think about things that are excellent and worthy of praise” (Philippians 4:8).

As we fix our thoughts on the true, honorable, right, pure, lovely and admirable things in the people around us, we’ll find less pleasure in sharing their weaknesses with others. We'll also be less interested in hearing other people spew negativity about others.

Breaking down triangulated relationships takes hard work. It requires us to find new ways to connect with others, and it might mean that we lose friendships that can't survive without the negativity to keep it going. Even so, we’ll gain the respect of real friends who will probably be grateful to have a relationship that’s based on something more than shared offenses.",The incredible reason my coworker stopped talking to me,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/08/for-human-connections-that-matter-focus-on-things-that-are-excellent-and-worthy-praise.html

It was her eyes, though, that truly terrified me. You could see the unrelenting, unshakable, unmovable fear they held.

In all fairness, nothing about fear should shock us. We’ve all been fearful at some point in our own lives.

But this was different.

This was a terrifying mix for when anger, shock and absolute horror all roll into one perilous package. It was as if you were about to tell someone they were going to...and then I knew what was about to happen.

And there is no preparation for it. None.

The doctor looked at me, looked at her patient, my wife Jennifer, and then looked down at the paperwork she had in front of her that contained Jen's test results. She repeated this over and over, as if she didn’t believe what her eyes were telling her.

When she finally stopped, the words for her were hard to find. But when she did speak, our world would be transformed forever.

The prognosis came in two parts. First, Jennifer’s thyroid had stopped working—certainly not good but something that happens to many people and was treatable. However, the second part was devastating: her kidneys were near total failure and her body was shutting down. If emergency measures weren’t enacted—and soon—she would be dead within six weeks.

Six weeks.

No one said anything at first. Then, after maybe ten seconds, we all looked at each other—no one really had a reaction. It felt like, for a moment, in that doctor’s office, time stopped.

For me, when I heard the news my reaction was paused for a simple reason: I wanted to cry, scream and yell—all at the same time.

I instantly blamed myself. I knew I should have pushed Jen to go to the doctor sooner. I should have been persistent, I should have seen the signs for what they were. But we kept making excuses for what was happening for months, and now we were paying the price—perhaps the ultimate price.

You see, starting in January 2015, Jennifer, the love of my life, my best friend—my everything—saw her health slowly start to slip away.

At first, we dismissed her symptoms as the result of her efforts to lose weight through diet and exercise. But as her health became gradually worse—her energy level deteriorated, she felt aches and pains throughout her body and felt awful all the time—we started to worry.

By the time the summer rolled around, things had gotten much worse. Jennifer was now losing weight dramatically. By July, she had lost almost seventy pounds in seven months. When we would go to the grocery store, separating into different aisles, there would be times I couldn’t find her as she looked like a completely different person.

Even at this point we dismissed the symptoms—now blaming Jennifer’s stressful job as a travelling psychologist, treating adolescent patients in some of the most poverty stricken and crime ridden neighborhoods of Washington, D.C.—as the culprit. It would take me comparing pictures of her from then to a few years prior to understand she needed medical treatment—or I might lose her.

When we walked out of the doctor’s office and went out onto the street we both grabbed for each other. Our heads nearly collided, each of us sobbing, shaking and crying uncontrollably, a reaction that words could never do justice to.

We both said at the same time: “What are we going to do?”

Once the shock washed away she did the only thing she could do, the only thing left to do: fight for her life.

And let there be no doubt, this was a battle that would test Jennifer’s will to live, test the strength of our marriage and make us rethink everything that was important to us.

Forever.

But just like every battle, there are some constants that aren’t changeable.

Ask anyone who has fought kidney disease and they will tell you a hard truth: you don’t ever beat it. You can become stable, even achieve some sort of remission from its unrelenting advance, but once your kidneys start to have problems they don’t ever heal themselves, they never return to their ‘normal’ state. So, the best result we could hope for in the war for Jennifer’s life was a draw, that no matter how hard she battled, no matter how much I supported her, no matter what sacrifice she was willing to make, all we could hope for is that it would not get any worse.

With this knowledge in hand, Jennifer’s struggle would begin.

The first order of battle began with constant visits to George Washington Hospital here in Washington, D.C. for battery after battery of tests. The constant blood work, doctor’s appointments and follow-up checkups were exhausting.

But none of that would compare to a kidney biopsy.

In what should be the latest Lannister torture method from ""Game of Thrones,"" Jennifer laid down on her stomach with her hands extended, holding onto what can only be described as grips. She was then given a small amount of numbing medication. After about a minute the doctor used a small device to remove a small 1cm piece of her kidney—while she was awake. When she came back to her hospital room she cried for hours as the pain was so intense.

Jennifer’s struggle, though, was just beginning.

Her kidney functioning levels were dropping fast and the amount of poison in her blood was increasing. If this could not be stopped, she would soon need dialysis or a kidney transplant. Her doctors recommended she be placed on steroids that could, emphasis on could, help stabilize her and maybe allow her kidneys to function slightly better. But there was a big downside to this treatment. Not only would Jennifer gain weight dramatically, but she would become temporarily—but horribly—disfigured as her whole body would swell uncontrollably.

She asked what other options she had. The doctor responded quite simply: “None.”

And with that, Jennifer’s descent into hell began.

If there was a dark time in this whole ordeal—or darker than any other—this was it. Jennifer was placed on the highest possible steroid dosage a person can take. From January 2016 to May of that year, Jen would be able to do very little as her arms and legs would begin to swell nonstop. When she did go outside, if she even had the energy to do so, people would shun her, as her face swelled to the point where she could no longer smile or make normal facial expressions. If she went to buy shoes, since all her pre-kidney disease shoes no longer fit, no one would wait on her. People would go to the other side of the street when they saw her, giving her dirty looks, time and time again.

Eventually, she stopped going outside—the physical and now emotional pain was too much to bear. The only thing that brought her joy was sitting by the window in our apartment, to feel a little bit a part of the outside world, looking down from six floors up as people walked to work or went about their lives. She would ask me constantly: “Am I going to die?” or “Is this my fate? To slowly rot away, just watching the world pass me by?”

Compounding all of this was the havoc this caused on her personally and professionally. She was fired from her job—they simply could not hold her position any longer after being out of the office for months. That meant she now had no health insurance—what could have been a death sentence, as the costs of treatment could easily bankrupt someone if they could not afford a private insurance plan that covered kidney disease. Thankfully my employer was able to add her to my plan quickly.

There was also the challenge of having to apply for Social Security Disability—a process so painful, so soul draining, so time consuming that it is hard for me to fathom how anyone can successfully navigate the process, especially if you’re sick. Despite countless forms that needed to be filled out repeatedly—with Jennifer’s hands so swollen at times it proved nearly impossible—hours and hours on the phone with lawyers and being sent for medical evaluations for the wrong things, Jennifer fought hard to get the assistance she needed. To this day, after one year of waiting and two denials in what should be a cut and dry case, Jennifer will now have to fight the federal government in court for the help she deserves. If we were not married and Jen needed Social Security and Medicare for survival she would already be dead.

Watching Jennifer go through all of this, knowing I could do almost nothing to help, took its toll on me as well.

This is where I started to break—and where our marriage was tested. How does one emotionally make peace with the fact that they are potentially watching their wife die?

At first, I became very quiet, withdrawn from the world. I then became very angry, feeling like we were robbed of the life we planned. Jennifer and I started to fight about anything—everything—as we did not know how to interact anymore. We did not know how to live in a world where she might not be part of it for much longer. And that scared me to my core.

Thankfully, our marriage would hold through this tough time—and get even stronger. We sat down one day and faced our fears together. Through hours of tough talk, laughter, heartache and sobbing, we admitted our greatest fear: not wanting to lose each other. We made a deal, right then and there: that no matter what, we would not take out our fears out on one another. That we would fight this no matter what, hand and hand, side by side, to the end—no matter where that brought us.

And then a small miracle happened. We made the decision to move out of the hustle and bustle of Washington, D.C. to the quiet suburbs of Rockville, 20 miles north. There, Jennifer and I spent the summer of 2016 laughing, swimming and learning to live with our fears—and we made a sort of peace with them. Once we let go of worrying about what we could not control, Jennifer starting getting some good news: the amount of poisons in her blood started to decrease. Month after month the functioning of her kidneys were improving ever-so-slightly. Her energy started to improve and her appearance started to return to normal, as the doctor started weaning her off the steroids.

Today, Jennifer is a as close to ‘normal’ as she will likely ever be. We know her battle with kidney disease will be one she wages for the rest of her days, but she has begun to reclaim the life she knew, piece by piece. She won’t ever be able to work again, as the daily stresses of any sort of employment could push her kidneys back toward failure. Her energy level can change hour by hour, many days she simply can’t leave the house.

But most importantly and positively, her spirit held strong and never broke. We moved back to Washington, D.C. in July, as she felt she needed to be close to the nation’s capital. She is back to being the happy, uplifting and inspirational person I love more than anything—someone who helped me in my darkest hours. In some small part, I was able to do the same for her.

We know the road in this struggle will be long and challenging, with many ups and downs along the way, but I know we can face it together, whatever comes. And for that, we are most grateful.",The doctor told my wife she had six weeks to live -- two years ago,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/09/22/doctor-told-my-wife-had-six-weeks-to-live-two-years-ago.html

It was 1977 when Johnny brought his whole family to Russian-controlled Czechoslovakia as part of his European tour John recalled during an interview for the ""Children of Song"" podcast. John, whose mother was fellow singer June Carter Cash, was just 7-years-old when the unforgettable incident occurred.

“He took us in the Eastern Bloc,” the now 47-year-old artist said. “We got up and did a big show… the KGB had been guiding us the whole time. They were very nice, very kind.”

However, that would all change when the traveling family arrived at the border, ready to leave.

“The border guards brought us all into a room together,” recalled John. “The doors were locked and this was a really empty room. And about 10 minutes, we were all in there, just quiet. Uncomfortable.”

The border guards would eventually enter the room and confront Johnny.

“[They] all came in and one at a time, like in a row, and they said, ‘Where are your instruments?’” said John. “Well, in the bus. And they said, ‘Go get your instruments.'”

The border guards patiently waited for Johnny and his band to retrieve their instruments. Then something unexpected happened and the mood suddenly lightened up.

“We put on a show for the guards!” said John, laughing. “They hardly cracked a smile until the songs were finished and then they were all smiling.”

The impromptu performance would have shaken any musician on the road, but the Man in Black didn’t seem to mind one bit.

In their years on HGTV’s show, ""Fixer Upper,"" hosts Chip and Joanna Gaines achieved far more than merely getting Americans to embrace open floor plans and shiplap; they made marriage look fun again.

The Texas couple’s decision to end the show after soon-to-be-aired Season Five ensures it won’t devolve into them simply playing certain roles, trying to recapture the magic of earlier seasons.

Along the way, thanks to the pairing of Joanna’s gift for interior design and Chip’s skilled construction craftsmanship, they made a lot of beautiful homes—showing concretely how the teamwork of marriage could create something bigger.

“This is just us recognizing that we need to catch our breath for a moment,” the Gaineses wrote on their blog. “Our plan is to take this time to shore up and strengthen the spots that are weak, rest the places that are tired and give lots of love and attention to both our family and our businesses.” In a video accompanying their blog post, Joanna spoke specifically about how quickly the couple’s four children were growing, noting that their eldest was almost a teenager and expressing how they were ready to “hunker down with our kiddos” for a time.

This is exactly what made the Gaineses so appealing. They do care about time with their family—and they’re not the kind of reality TV professionals who want to turn their family into a permanent fixture on the screen by being “on” all the time. Part of the couple’s appeal has always been their family-friendliness, their down-to-earth qualities, and the clear priority they give to living in accordance with their values.

But their decision to end the show is also appealing because the Gaineses themselves have changed: in the years since ""Fixer Upper"" began, they’ve become involved in multiple home goods lines, launched a magazine, written a book, and even opened a bakery in their hometown of Waco, Texas. While I’m happy for the Gaines’ success, the fact is they’re not the same couple facing regular problems that they were when the show launched—and frankly, yes, a reality show true to their own current reality (exploring questions like what mega chain is worth trusting for a home goods line partnership, for example) would simply not be as relatable or enjoyable to watch.

But I’m grateful for the years they gave us on ""Fixer Upper.""

There’s a real dearth of shows or, frankly, any entertainment that depicts marriage as fun. And while no doubt the Gaineses amped it up a little for the camera, the dynamics under-girding the show—the push and pull between the goofy Chip and the more serious Joanna—certainly seemed authentic, as did the joy they had in just hanging out with each other, occasionally trying to get a rise out of one another.

Along the way, thanks to the pairing of Joanna’s gift for interior design and Chip’s skilled construction craftsmanship, they made a lot of beautiful homes—showing concretely how the teamwork of marriage could create something bigger.

In her 2011 book, ""Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?"" TV writer and actress Mindy Kaling included a section, “C’mon, Married People,” in which she wrote:

""I don’t want to hear about the endless struggles to keep sex exciting, or the work it takes to plan a date night. I want to hear that you guys watch every episode of The Bachelorettetogether in secret shame, or that one got the other hooked on Breaking Bad and if either watches it without the other, they’re dead meat. I want to see you guys high-five each other like teammates on a recreational softball team you both do for fun. I’m not saying that marriage should always be easy. But we seem to get so gloomily worked up about it these days.""

Kaling, whose own show ""The Mindy Project"" unfortunately devolved into a gloomy look at the hardships of relationships these days, concluded with the following plea:

“Married people, it’s up to you. It’s entirely on your shoulders to keep this sinking institution afloat. It’s a stately old ship, and a lot of people, like me, want to get on board. Please be psyched, and convey that psychedness to us.”

And that’s exactly what the Gaineses have done on ""Fixer Upper."" In an era when marriage rates are down, people flirt with notions of open marriages and polygamy, and singles scour Tinder for one-night-stands, a show about home renovation unexpectedly became a celebration of how a husband and wife could be friends and partners, could complement each other and have a genuinely good time just hanging out with each other. In their interactions with each other and their four children, the Gaineses proved happiness isn’t impossible for an old-fashioned family in our modern era.",What Chip and Joanna Gaines teach us about marriage,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/05/what-chip-and-joanna-gaines-teach-us-about-marriage.html

Allawi, in an interview with The Associated Press, urged Kurdish leader Masoud Barzani, as well as Iraq's central government and its Iranian-backed militia forces, to show restraint and resolve their disputes over the oil-rich city.

The head of the Asaib al-Haq militia Qais Khazali warned worshippers in a sermon Sunday that Iraq's Kurds were planning to claim much of north Iraq, including Kirkuk, for an independent state, after Iraq's Kurds voted for independence in a controversial but non-binding referendum two weeks ago.

He said it would be tantamount to a ""foreign occupation,"" according to remarks reported by the Afaq TV channel, which is close to the state-sanctioned militia.

Allawi, a former prime minister, said any move by the country's Popular Mobilization Front militias, which include the Asaib al-Haq, to enter Kirkuk would ""damage all possibilities for unifying Iraq"" and open the door to ""violent conflict.""

""The government claims they control the Popular Mobilization Forces. If they do they should restrain them, rather than go into a kind of civil war. And there should be a restraint on Masoud Barzani and the Peshmerga not to take aggressive measures to control these lands,"" said Allawi.

Kirkuk was included in the September referendum even though it falls outside the autonomous Kurdish region in the country's northeast. The ethnically-mixed city has been administered by Kurdish forces since 2014, when government forces fled from the advancing Islamic State group.

Barzani held the referendum over the strong objections of Baghdad, Ankara, and Tehran, enraging leaders in the regional capitals.

Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi demanded the Kurdish self-government annul the results and called for joint administration over Kirkuk. Baghdad closed the airspace over the Kurdish region to international flights.

Turkey and Iran also threatened punitive measures against the Kurdish region, fearing Kurds in their own countries would renew their campaigns for self-rule.

Waste pullouts are a secret weapon of the well-oiled kitchen machine. They do the dirty job of handling your garbage, recycling and more. In fact, among surveyed homeowners who are remodeling a kitchen and upgrading cabinets, the No. 1 storage addition is a pullout waste or recycling cabinet, according to the latest Houzz kitchen trends study. But what makes them better than a regular garbage can? Actually, a pullout bin can have quite a few advantages, both in style and function. Here are some reasons why a humble pullout cabinet for waste deserves a little consideration and a space in your kitchen.

Out of sight, out of mind. When you think about your dream kitchen, what do you imagine? I’ll bet the garbage bin is not the first thing that comes to mind. But then, this is the whole point of a waste pullout: It tucks the garbage, recycling and other waste bins out of sight but within easy access. That way you don’t have to look at a messy freestanding bin or struggle with a tiny, seemingly always full can tucked under the sink.

Seamless integration. Because a waste pullout is essentially just a very deep drawer, it can easily be integrated into the look of your cabinetry, bringing some great contemporary functionality to very traditional or transitional style.

In fact, it’s quite common for a pullout drawer to be faced out with multiple false fronts to help it blend more seamlessly into a cabinet scheme.

RELATED: Pick Out the Perfect Drawer Pulls

Ease of use. If you cook often, one of the trickiest and yet most common tasks is sweeping away the remnants from chopping. You can carefully carry a chopping board to the bin, or you can bring the bin to the chopping board. Locating your garbage or compost pullout below a chopping zone means you can sweep waste directly into the bin with ease.

Here’s another smart take on this idea: a pullout chopping block (in place of a typical drawer) positioned above a waste pullout, with a simple hole to allow for trimmings to be swept directly into the bin. A great option for small kitchens, as the whole chopping station can be closed away when not in use, and the main counter can still be used for other things.

Waste sorting. Pullout cabinets aren’t just useful for holding your garbage bins. More and more cities today not only facilitate recycling or composting, they also require some level of waste sorting, and this requires managing multiple bins.

Depending on the system you use, you can easily have space for two sizable bins, or many smaller ones, configured with one tucked behind the other in a full-depth cabinet, or side by side, or many other configurations to suit your typical needs.

Odor control. One major concern that people often have with waste bins is the odors that can linger in the kitchen. There are several possible ways to combat this issue, and one is by using compartments with individual lids for organic waste.

Some waste pullout systems even integrate a special bin with a securely sealing lid specifically to hold compost, so you don’t have to change it with excessive frequency just to keep odors in check. Keep in mind how quickly it will fill; you’ll want to plan ahead so that organic waste isn’t left sitting exposed to air for too long.

Another option is to put different types of waste into their own cabinets with appropriately sized bins so that you only have to open the relevant compartment at any particular time. You can devote more space for plastics and less for compost, or vice versa, depending on your needs.

All-in-one storage. If you want to make sure nobody has an excuse for not changing the bin when it’s full, try a drawer that includes a small storage drawer inside, and you can keep garbage bags and related products right by the bins themselves.

You can also use interior drawers to split compartments into smaller subcompartments or to keep cleaning products or deodorizers on hand.

A fit for any budget. Want a fully luxe look? For just a little extra investment, a system with side panels (which can be custom fitted by your cabinetmaker) will more fully cover the bins for a discreet look even while the cabinet is pulled open.

Meanwhile, at the other end of the budget spectrum, pullout systems integrated into a standard door cabinet can turn any underused space into a garbage pullout with room for multiple bins without a total renovation. Plus, for dexterous chefs, they can be pulled and pushed by foot to facilitate disposal even when hands are full.",7 reasons to consider pullout waste and recycling cabinets,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/08/03/7-reasons-to-consider-pullout-waste-and-recycling-cabinets.html

And it will be done, if necessary, believe me.”The President had been discussing Iran and North Korea with US military leaders and posed for a photo with them before declaring the moment “the calm before the storm”.","One single reliable warhead fired by North Korea could destroy densely populated cities, killing millions.

Those who aren’t killed in a nuclear blast would be left with devastating injuries while their cities would be flattened with vital infrastructure destroyed.

A detailed analysis by 38 North, at the US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, has revealed what would happen if Kim Jong-un did the unthinkable and actually fired a nuclear weapon.

In A Hypothetical Nuclear Attack on Seoul and Tokyo: The Human Cost of War on the Korean Peninsula, Michael J Zagurek paints a terrifying picture of the damage it could cause.

Assuming North Korea has 25 operational nuclear weapons with warhead yield ranges from 15 to 250 kilotons timed for airburst at optimal altitude, Zagurek runs through seven different scenarios.

The warhead yield ranges are based on current and possible future capabilities and the estimates of casualties were also based on the size of the city and population density.

In the most extreme estimate of a 250kt weapon being used, Seoul and Incheon which has a combined population of 24,105,000 would have 783,197 fatalities, and 2,778,009 injuries.

Tokyo and Yokohama with a combined population of 37,900,000 would have 697,665 fatalities and 2,474,627 injuries.

Maps showing four blast areas from a 250 kt airburst detonation also show how far the fallout and blast would reach.

North Korea has launched 98 ballistic missiles since 2011, including 19 this year.

However it remains unclear exactly how many warheads it possesses and how advanced they are.

Nuclear disarmament campaigner John Hallam said the analysis was fairly authoritative.

Mr Hallam speculated the DPRK (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) had between 40 and 60 warheads.

He also said he believed it will be a while before North Korea hit its nuclear goals.

“I’m also inclined to think that it will be a while before they fit a 250Kt warhead to more than one or two rockets,” he said.

“So 38 North analysis being based to a large extent on smaller warheads is not unreasonable — but the number of larger warheads will clearly rise over time.”

Mr Hallam said it was reasonable to assume Seoul and Tokyo were obvious targets but the analysis didn’t include an ability to strike US west coast cities.

“If that ability does exist, then it’s also possible for them to strike Sydney, which doesn’t mean they necessarily will — the highest priority target in Australia, indeed almost in the world — is Pine Gap, critical for US command and control,” he said.

“If US cities become part of the equation which they will in a year or two if they are not now, then that body count will be higher.”

He also pointed out the analysis didn’t take into account US President Donald Trump’s threat to wipe out the DPRK, which would increase the body count even further.

Mr Hallam said there would also be fallout which would also add to the huge casualty toll.

“It would be necessary to take into account the effects of fallout drifting in one direction all over South Korea, and in the other direction, into Manchuria,” he said.

“Maybe once Seoul has been leveled, which can be done without use of nukes at all, a little fallout from the rubble bouncing in the DPRK is of lesser consequence, but it needs to be taken into account somehow.”

Meanwhile Mr Trump said his administration’s goal was for North Korea to denuclearise.

“We cannot allow this dictatorship to threaten our nation or our allies with unimaginable loss of life,” he said.

“We will do what we must do to prevent that from happening. And it will be done, if necessary, believe me.”

The President had been discussing Iran and North Korea with US military leaders and posed for a photo with them before declaring the moment “the calm before the storm”.

“You guys know what this represents?” Mr Trump said after journalists gathered in the White House state dining room to photograph him and First Lady Melania Trump with the uniformed military leaders and their spouses.

“Maybe it’s the calm before the storm,” he said.

When asked what storm, Mr Trump replied: “You’ll find out.”

Weinstein has been accused in a lengthy New York Times story of doing some truly horrendous things to women, totally unsolicited − also known as sexual harassment − over a period of nearly three decades. His alleged victims were talented young actresses and other women who had the potential to build successful careers on their own without some ugly, creepy man coercing them into giving him a massage or worse.

Gross.

But this is Hollywood, and the feminists are the women who defend creeps like Weinstein.

Anita Dunn, a close associate of President Obama who became his communications director for a time at the White House, has been reported to have counseled Weinstein after the allegations broke in the media.

Even more troubling is that celebrity women’s advocate attorney Lisa Bloom is representing Weinstein. This is a woman who has represented victims in high-profile sexual harassment cases. Throwing that legacy away, she agreed to represent Weinstein, whom she said she has counseled that “times have changed” and he “needs to evolve into a higher standard.” Really?

Bloom’s reasoning regarding Weinstein gets better, though: “He has acknowledged mistakes he has made. He is reading books and going to therapy. He is an old dinosaur learning new ways. He wants to reach out to any of the women who may have issues with him to talk to them in a respectful, peaceful way, with me present if that is acceptable to them.”

I hope Bloom has a better answer for the women who Weinstein is accused of sexually harassing and forcing to look at him half-clothed or with no clothes at all, with tears in their eyes, as he emotionally blackmailed them for sex.

But this is Hollywood. This is Hugh Hefner’s world. This is the liberal paradise of promoting equal rights and justice for women, yet defending the men who use them for their own satisfaction, discarding them for younger versions every year, and then complaining about it years later when the women finally have the courage to say “enough!”

This is not true feminism. Supporting men who tear down women for their own use, supporting free access to taxpayer-funded abortion so men can cover up their own conduct, and mistreating women for decades is nothing for women to get behind.

By Ruben Diaz Jr. , The New York Post

On Monday, I will march in the annual Columbus Day Parade up Fifth Avenue. I will join thousands of revelers in celebrating their Italian heritage, their culture and the contributions Italian-Americans have made to this city and this nation.

And I will join their calls to keep the statue of Christopher Columbus in Columbus Circle right where it is.

This summer, I joined in the national outcry to excise from the public square statues and monuments that celebrated the leadership of the Confederacy. This included two statues of Confederate generals in my borough — Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson — that made their home in the historic Hall of Fame for Great Americans on the campus of Bronx Community College.

Statues are about more than just the person they depict. They are symbolic. The intent behind the installation of such monuments cannot be ignored.

The Confederacy was an inherently evil entity that split our country in two in a futile effort to maintain slavery as an institution.

Many of the statues constructed to honor the so-called “heroes” of the Confederate states were erected during the periods of post-Reconstruction in the South and the Civil Rights movement, and served as not-so-thinly veiled threats to the African-American populations in the communities where they were installed.

Jim Crow-era monuments to white supremacy and the leadership of seditious insurrection should not be tolerated, except for where they belong: in cemeteries.

However, the statue of Christopher Columbus in Columbus Circle was not built to herald the explorer’s subjugation of native people. If it had been, I would be the first to demand that it be torn down.

No, the Columbus Circle statue was erected in 1892 following a massive fundraising campaign by the nation’s Italian-American community in recognition of the 400th anniversary of Columbus’ landing in the Americas.

Hard-working men, women and families of Italian descent, along with businesses and various institutions with Italian or Italian-American ties, pooled their money to pay for the statue as a way to give something of value back to the city that had given so much to them. They were acting in the spirit of community and with a love of this nation and the dream it represents.",Don't Mess with Christopher Columbus,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/10/09/dont-mess-christopher-columbus

However, McDonald’s failed to mention in any of their widespread promos that only 20 packets of the highly anticipated sauce would be available at the stores. The Huffington Post reported that some locations listed online as participating stores didn’t actually have the sauce packets at all or some had sold out before the authorized selling time.

At another McDonald’s, a mob chanting, “we want sauce,” formed, and the police had to push them back.

Other locations, adults left angry and kids left crying.

Fans weren’t buying it, and accused the hamburger joint of just wanting the publicity.

The fast-food giant later released a second apology on Facebook, and promised that there would be more sauce on the horizon.

That is how friends and family recalled 38-year-old Nicol Kimura at a vigil on Sunday evening, a week after she and 57 others were killed in the Las Vegas concert massacre.

Carrying cream-colored candles, at least 200 people gathered outside an elementary school that Kimura attended when she was a child in the community of Placentia.

They smiled at the shining photos of Kimura and shared stories of trips to baseball games and shopping sprees. And they sobbed recalling the senseless loss of the fun-loving, affectionate woman known as an ""auntie"" to her friends' children and for her generous heart and free spirit.

""She touched so many lives and obviously made a huge impact on each one of us, whether you knew her a day or 30 years,"" said Courtney Calderon, Kimura's friend since the fourth grade. ""Her heart was huge. And everyone that met her knew it.""

Kimura, who worked at a California tax agency, had gone to the Route 91 Harvest country music festival in Las Vegas with a group of friends so close they call themselves ""framily.""

They had looked forward to the weekend and were standing by the stage listening to the music when a gunman began firing on the crowd from the 32nd floor of the hotel across the street.

Kimura was among those killed in the onslaught. Nearly 500 were wounded in the crowd of 22,000 people.

Now, her friends are trying to mourn the loss of Kimura and cope with memories of the horror of that night. They remembered her as the craftsy one who made all their events sparkle and brought them closer together.

""She never turned the awesome off,"" one friend wrote in comments read at the vigil by Pastor Kent Kraning.

Kimura — who loved hiking and her dog, Sadie — is survived by her parents and a sister, as well as her friends.

Uncle Roger Kimura recalled how she made a spreadsheet listing the vitamins her father had to take after he underwent double bypass surgery — a testament to her penchant for precision —and how she showed concern for others. He asked the group ""that in honor of Nicol, you live each and every day to the fullest — just like she did.""

Calderon, who attended high school and college with Kimura, shared stories about her friend's passion for art and for fashion and how she lit up the room whenever she walked in. Calderon's three children adored Kimura and she made an impact on everyone who knew her.

""Until we meet again, I love you,"" Calderon said.

There’s a man with a machine gun who’s killing people at a concert!”

As I rushed to put on some clothes I caught myself whispering, “No, no, not another tragedy.”

I ran downstairs and flipped on the TV, where coverage had started only moments earlier. The first thing I saw was a reporter stopping wandering people and asking what they saw. Their zombie-like responses showed they were still in shock.

One shirtless guy in a cowboy hat had been splashed with blood, which prompted the reporter to ask if he had been injured. Unaware of the crimson stains, he semi-stuttered that the blood wasn’t his own but came from a victim he had helped to carry to safety.

Another guy who looked to be in his mid-20s, when asked where his shirt was, stumbled and stammered out the reply that he took off his shirt to cover the faces of the dead.

Neither seemed to comprehend nor consider the paradox: the worst of men and the best of men … utter grace amidst utter evil. I glanced at my daughter who just sat there clutching a pillow to her chest and cried.

Our nation has been repeatedly ravaged by numerous shootings of individuals, police officers and mass groups of people. On top of that, we are plagued with natural disasters, racial division, political upheaval and even nuclear missile threats from abroad.

We are a nation filled with unrest, a people who have been saturated by every tragedy as it has been plastered across our televisions, newspapers, internet and social media. We grieve for those brothers and sisters who suffer, we are repulsed and sickened by the depraved perpetrators, and we are inspired by the gallant saviors who courageously disregard their own safety at the expense of complete strangers.

Lights shine brightest on the darkest of nights and unknown heroes arise in the days of adversity.

Television networks have given airtime to those champions who scampered through gunfire in Las Vegas to help, just as they did to those who waded through floods and storm damage recently in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico. But we long for more; we desire to be quenched from their personal wells that drip with honor and valor.

In those heroes who willingly trod at death’s door, we see what is good in America and a portrait of who we can and should be. It’s why, now more than ever, we need less blame, politicizing and villains. We need more exposure to the common people who epitomize courage in the midst of cowardice – those who give us hope when all hope seems to be lost.

As I watched the news coverage in the hours after the carnage in Las Vegas, I couldn’t peel my eyes from the television. By the time my TV screen went dark after 4 a.m., the details were slim but there was less focus on the murderer and more on his victims.

Those in Las Vegas were exhibiting a new kind of protest, the kind everybody watching was uniting around: a protest against death, terrorism, evil and division. They were physically, verbally and morally objecting to the mayhem that sought to instill fear, hate and darkness. Their resistance converted into shielding others from bullets, calming the wounded as they were in the throes of death and carrying victims to safety.

And let’s never forget our brave law enforcement officers – the lately vilified men and women in blue who didn’t hesitate or vacillate when called upon to apprehend a demonic madman who was mowing down the innocent.

The book of John in the Bible states that there is a type of love that is greater than any other: it is the kind that embraces death so that others might have life. It is the rare, unconventional love that is dispensed independent of merit, worth or obligation but is gifted willingly because it comes from the purest of place … self-sacrifice.

This example has been written about for over 2,000 years and contains our greatest hope and purpose for eternal peace, purpose and brotherhood.","Las Vegas shooting: America, we've witnessed a new kind of protest -- against death, terror and hate",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/07/las-vegas-shooting-america-weve-witnessed-new-kind-protest-against-death-terror-and-hate.html

Mandatory evacuations were ordered in the wine country north of San Francisco Bay and elsewhere after blazes broke out late Sunday.

""It was an inferno like you've never seen before,"" said Marian Williams, who caravanned with neighbors through flames before dawn as one of the wildfires reached the vineyards and ridges at her small Sonoma County town of Kenwood.

Williams could feel the heat of her fire through the car as she fled.

""Trees were on fire like torches,"" she said.

With so many fires, residents of Sonoma County struggled to figure out what roads to take, finding downed trees or flames blocking some routes.

Fires also burned just to the east in the Napa County wine country as well as in Yuba, Butte and Nevada counties — all north of the state capital. Cal Fire tweeted that as many as 8,000 homes were threatened in Nevada County, which lies on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada.

Smoke was thick in San Francisco, 60 miles (96 kilometers) south of the Sonoma County fire.

Sonoma County resident John Dean was driving home early Monday when ""I looked over and saw a house on fire"" along the road. Soon he saw more houses engulfed in flames.

""I mean blazing, falling down on fire,"" he said.

Dean sped to his Kenwood home, alerted neighbors, and fled to the town of Sonoma. He was one of hundreds of evacuees who streamed into a 24-hour Safeway market overnight, while authorities set up an official evacuation center.

Maureen McGowan was house-sitting for a brother near Kenwood, and said both of the homes on his property were on fire when she left. At the Safeway, she pointed to her feet, still in slippers. She had fled so fast that she hadn't put on her shoes.

Belia Ramos, chairwoman of the Napa County Board of Supervisors, said officials did not yet have a count on how many properties were affected, either by the fire directly or by evacuations.

""We're focusing on making evacuations and trying to keep people safe. We are not prepared to start counting. Certainly with day just breaking now, we are starting to see the structures that are affected,"" she said shortly after sunrise.

""The gusts are very, very — they're tremendous and it's what makes this fire unpredictable. It's something that we're having to be very cautious about,"" she said.

Emergency lines were inundated with callers reporting smoke in the area, prompting officials to ask that the public ""only use 911 if they see actual unattended flames, or are having another emergency.""

The National Weather Service said widespread wind gusts between 35 mph and 50 mph were observed in the north San Francisco Bay region and isolated spots hit 70 mph. The winds were expected to subside at midday.

Community centers, the Sonoma County Fairgrounds and other local centers were opened for evacuees.

Mandatory evacuations were ordered near Calistoga in Sonoma County, located about 75 miles north of San Francisco, KTVU reported.

The Sonoma County Sheriff's Office said there were multiple fires reported around the county, including a ""very large fire"" that jumped a freeway and spread into the east side of Santa Rosa.

Multiple fires broke out Sunday night as strong winds buffeted the area. Emergency lines were inundated with callers reporting smoke in the area, prompting officials to ask that the public ""only use 911 if they see actual unattended flames, or are having another emergency.""

The Tubbs Fire between Santa Rosa and Calistoga alone grew from 200 acres to 20,000 acres by Monday morning, CalFire Battalion Chief Jonathan Cox told KTVU.

""This fire is explosive,"" he said, adding that hundreds, if not thousands of structures were impacted.

Cox said he heard of some people injured while trying to evacuate, but could not be specific.

""It's a scary time,"" Dodds said. ""It looks like Armageddon.""

Patients from Kaiser Permanente and Sutter Health hospitals on were evacuated early Monday from Santa Rosa and taken to other nearby hospitals or make-shift hospitals, according to KTVU.

In neighboring Napa County, officials were battling a 200 acre fire south of Lake Berryessa, located about 65 miles west of Sacramento.

Fire officials said the Atlas Fire broke out at 9:50 p.m. local time and was zero percent contained.

Cal Fire Deputy Chief Scott McLean called the conditions ""very volatile.""

""People need to be careful,"" McLean said.

Downed trees were blocking parts of one rural road and fires were burning on both sides of Highway 12 as gusts reached up to 60 mph.

“The winds picked up to 40-plus miles per hour probably, very windy, and it changed direction and it headed straight down the valley floor,” Napa resident and Ranch Markets owner Arik Housley told “FOX & Friends.”

Windsor Fire Chief Jack Piccinini told the Associated Press that nearly every one of Sonoma County's fire resources is being used, but it is not enough.

""Everyone in Sonoma County is spread out fighting these fires, but they don't have enough resources to handle something like this. The only thing we can do is hope the wind will come down,"" he said.

There is no immediate information on injuries or fatalities. Community centers, the Sonoma County Fairgrounds and other local centers have been opened for evacuees.

""It was an inferno like you've never seen before,"" said Marian Williams, who caravanned with neighbors through flames before dawn as one of the wildfires reached the vineyards and ridges at her small Sonoma County town of Kenwood.

Williams told the AP she could feel the heat of her fire through the car as she fled.

“Our country has been unsuccessfully dealing with North Korea for 25 years, giving billions of dollars [and] getting nothing. Policy didn’t work!” Trump tweeted Monday morning.

The president also addressed North Korea in tweets over the weekend.

“Presidents and their administrations have been talking to North Korea for 25 years, agreements made and massive amounts of money paid,” Trump tweeted. “[H]asn’t worked, agreements violated before the ink was dry, making fools of U.S. negotiators. Sorry, but only one thing will work!”

Trump caused an international snafu last month when he tweeted what North Korea took as a “declaration of war” and Twitter issued a statement regarding why Trump’s tweet wasn’t removed for violating the site’s policies.

“Just heard Foreign Minister of North Korea speak at U.N. If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man, they won’t be around much longer!” Trump tweeted on Sept. 23.

North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said the tweet was a “declaration of war” which gave his country “every right” to take countermeasures.

Here’s a look at what Trump has said about North Korea over time.

The U.S. is ‘locked and loaded’

Trump took to social media on August 11 to proclaim that the U.S. military is “locked and loaded” in case “North Korea act[s] unwisely.”

‘Fire [and] fury’ isn’t ‘tough enough’

With the threat of nuclear violence growing, Trump warned North Korea on August 8 that he would unleash “fire, fury and frankly power, the likes of which this world has never seen before.”

SEOUL TO RESUME HUMANITARIAN AID TO NORTH KOREA

But when tensions continued to rise and North Korea threatened to attack Guam, Trump said maybe that comment wasn’t “tough enough.""

""Let’s see what [Kim Jong Un] does with Guam. He does something in Guam, it will be an event the likes of which nobody has seen before – what will happen in North Korea,"" Trump said on August. 10.

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Trump is ""sending a strong message to North Korea in language that Kim Jong Un can understand, because he doesn’t seem to understand diplomatic language.""

Kim Jong Un is ‘not getting away with it’

Trump also said this week that Kim Jong Un has “disrespected our country greatly.”

“He has said things that are horrific. And with me, he’s not getting away with it,” Trump said. “He got away with it for a long time, between him and his family. He’s not getting away with it. It’s a whole new ball game.”

‘Strategic patience … is over’

After meeting with the South Korean president in Washington, D.C., in June, Trump said that the “era of strategic patience with the North Korean regime has failed.”

WHAT THE US IS CAPABLE OF IF NORTH KOREA TARGETS ITS ALLIES

“Frankly, that patience is over,” he said.

As Trump made these comments, the U.S. was rocked with the death of Otto Warmbier, the 22-year-old American college student who suffered extensive brain damage while being held captive for more than a year.

There are ‘worse things’ than assassinating Kim Jong Un

In an interview with CBS News during the presidential campaign, Trump said he could “get China to make [Kim Jong Un] disappear in one form or another very quickly.”

When asked if he was talking about assassinating the North Korean dictator, Trump shrugged.

“Well, you know, I’ve heard of worse things, frankly. I mean, this guy’s a bad dude – and don’t underestimate him,” Trump said. “Any young guy that can take over from his father with all those generals and everybody else that probably wants the position, this is not somebody to be underestimated.”

‘What the hell is wrong with speaking?’

Trump told supporters at a campaign rally in Atlanta that should Kim Jong Un want to come to the U.S., he would be “accept[ed].”

TRUMP'S NICKNAMES FOR RIVALS, FROM 'ROCKET MAN' TO 'CROOKED HILLARY'

“I wouldn’t go there, that I can tell you. If he came here, I’d accept him, but I wouldn’t give him a state dinner like we do for China and all these other people that rip us off when we give them these big state dinners,” Trump said in June 2016.

“What the hell is wrong with speaking?” Trump said, referencing the criticism he received for being willing to talk with North Korea. “It’s called opening a dialogue.”

‘Maniac’

During a GOP presidential debate in September 2015, Trump railed on the “maniac” in North Korea while answering a question about Planned Parenthood and women’s health issues.

“Nobody ever mentions North Korea, where you have this maniac sitting there, and he actually has nuclear weapons and somebody better start thinking about North Korea and perhaps a couple of other places. But certainly North Korea,” Trump said.

“You have somebody right now in North Korea who has got nuclear weapons and who is saying almost every other week, ‘I’m ready to use them,’ and we don’t even mention it,” he continued.

China needs to solve the problem

Even before he was president, Trump urged China to step in and help alleviate problems with North Korea.

“North Korea is reliant on China. China could solve this problem easily if they wanted to but they have no respect for our leaders,” Trump tweeted in March 2013.

WHERE IS GUAM AND WHY WOULD NORTH KOREA ATTACK IT?

In April 2013, Trump continued that line of thinking, adding that “North Korea can’t survive, or even eat, without the help of China.” He then accused China of “taunting” the U.S.

‘Wack job’

In April 2013, Trump urged then-President Barack Obama to “be very careful” with the “28-year-old wack job in North Korea.”

“At some point we may have to get very tough,” he tweeted.

‘Negotiate like crazy’

Trump warned that the U.S. needed to “do something to stop” North Korea in 1999 during an interview with the late Tim Russert on “Meet the Press.”

""Do you want to do it in five years when they have warheads all over the place, every one of them pointing to New York City, to Washington and every one of us, is that when you want to do it, or do you want to do something now?” Trump said. “You'd better do it now. And if they think you're serious … they'll negotiate and it'll never come to that.”

NORTH KOREA'S NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM HAS GROWN WITH EACH KIM REGIME

He said then that if he ever became president, the first step he would take would be to “negotiate like crazy” to make sure that the country would “get the best deal possible.” Trump also predicted then that in “three or four years,” North Korea would have weapons aimed all over the world, including at the U.S.

No more talking

After North Korea said it successfully launched a missile over Japan, a U.S. ally, and into the Pacific Ocean, Trump initially had a surprisingly subdued response.

""Threatening and destabilizing actions only increase the North Korean regime's isolation in the region and among all nations of the world,"" Trump said in a written statement after North Korea’s missile soared almost 1,700 miles into the Pacific Ocean, triggering alert warnings in northern Japan and shudders throughout Northeast Asia. ""All options are on the table.""

The missile launch was said to be a “precursor” to North Korea’s containment of the U.S. territory of Guam by leader Kim Jong Un, according to state-run media.

But in a tweet Wednesday morning, the president suggested the U.S. is finished “talking” to North Korea.

“The U.S. has been talking to North Korea, and paying them extortion money, for 25 years. Talking is not the answer,” Trump tweeted.

‘Rocket Man’ is on a ‘suicide mission’

After dubbing him “Rocket Man” in a tweet, Trump eventually tried out the new nickname for Kim Jong Un during his inaugural address to the U.N. General Assembly.

During his speech, Trump vowed to “totally destroy North Korea” if the country so provokes him. He also said Kim was “on a suicide mission.”

The North Korean ambassador to the U.N. left the room ahead of Trump’s speech in a boycott.

SNL creator Lorne Michaels said they decided not to go after Weinstein because he’s from New York.

‘It’s a New York thing,” he told The Daily Mail about Weinstein, who was born in Queens.

Gal Gadot, the star of “Wonder Woman,” hosted the show – which has unmercifully mocked Trump, who is also a Queens guy – by remembering the 58 people killed and hundreds wounded in the mass shooting in Las Vegas.

Later, country singer Jason Aldean, who was on stage during the open-air concert when the long gunman opened fire on the crowd, sang “Won’t Back Down” in tribute to Petty who died last Monday.

“For the rest of the year, anyone foolish enough to enter the waters would be instantly swept to their deaths,” the tourism site explained. “But when levels drop, the natural rock walls of the Devil’s Pool come close enough to the surface to form a barrier and stop swimmers [from] being carried away.”

The Times fired back at Waxman, noting that her 2004 story may not have met the paper’s standards for publication.
""The Times newsroom has a long history of exposing corruption and abuse by powerful people and institutions.
“Our former colleague Sharon Waxman wrote about a story that was published in The Times in 2004.","The New York Times shocked Hollywood last week with the explosive story of sexual harassment accusations against Harvey Weinstein, which resulted in the mogul being fired from his own company. Now a former Times reporter claims the paper could have exposed Weinstein over a decade ago but the story was watered down by editors after a visit from Weinstein, and calls from two of Hollywood's biggest names.

TheWrap CEO and Editor-in-Chief Sharon Waxman published a story on Sunday night detailing a 2004 incident in which she was given “the green light to look into oft-repeated allegations of sexual misconduct by Weinstein,” when she was a “fairly new reporter at The New York Times” but the story was never published.

Waxman said it was “believed that many” of the allegations against Weinstein occurred overseas, so she traveled to Rome and tracked down Fabrizio Lombardo, the person who ran Miramax Italy. Citing “multiple accounts,” Lombardo “had no film experience and his real job was to take care of Weinstein’s women needs,” she wrote.

TheWrap founder claimed she also “tracked down a woman in London who had been paid off after an unwanted sexual encounter with Weinstein” but was called directly by Weinstein associates such as Matt Damon and Russell Crowe to vouch for Lombardo. In addition, Waxman reported that Weinstein even visited the Times’ newsroom personally to express displeasure at the story she was working on and the story was gutted after he spoke with people above her head at the paper.

Damon's and Crowe's reps did not immediately reply to requests for comment.

“The story was stripped of any reference to sexual favors or coercion and buried on the inside of the Culture section, an obscure story about Miramax firing an Italian executive,"" Waxman wrote. ""Who cared?”

Current Bloomberg editor Jon Landman was the paper’s culture editor at the time and told Waxman that the story wasn’t interesting, according to her report. She said that the Times enabled Weinstein before it eventually exposed him.

“So pardon me for having a deeply ambivalent response about the current heroism of the Times,” Waxman wrote.

Waxman said she “simply gagged” when she read a follow-up Times piece about media enablers who “kept this story from the public” for decades because the paper is one of the news organizations who covered up Weinstein’s history.

Landman declined Fox News’ request for comment. The Times fired back at Waxman, noting that her 2004 story may not have met the paper’s standards for publication.

""The Times newsroom has a long history of exposing corruption and abuse by powerful people and institutions. Our newsroom was the first to publish a meticulously reported investigation of Mr. Weinstein revealing numerous settlements for sexual harassment,” a Times spokesperson told Fox news. “Our former colleague Sharon Waxman wrote about a story that was published in The Times in 2004. No one currently at The Times has knowledge of editorial decisions made on that story. But in general the only reason a story or specific information would be held is if it did not meet our standards for publication.""

Some media industry insiders have asked why Waxman, who runs an outlet that covers the entertainment industry, didn’t publish an updated version of the “gutted” 2004 story detailing the woman in London who had been paid off when she founded TheWrap.

Waxman added an update to her report to address why she didn’t report the story at TheWrap: “Fair question. Five years later, 2009, the moment had passed to go back and write the missing piece about Lombardo, who was no longer on the scene and whose story had been half-published in the Times. Miramax was no longer part of the Walt Disney Company. And I did not have sufficient evidence to write about a pay-off, even though I knew one existed. My focus was on raising money, building a website and starting a media company. In the subsequent years since then I did not hear about further pay-offs or harassment and thought the issue was in the past. Weinstein had made a big effort, supposedly, to curb his temper and behavior, which was reflected in other areas of his public life.”

What is the DACA program?
Why did the Trump administration dismantle it?
Do any DACA recipients serve in the military?","President Trump has a litany of demands in order for his administration to extend a program that protects certain young undocumented immigrats from deportation – known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA.

The president’s requests include stronger crackdowns on so-called sanctuary cities, building his oft-promised border wall and overhauling the country’s green card system.

“This plan will work. If followed it will produce an immigration system with integrity and one in which we can take pride,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement. “Perhaps the best result will be that unlawful attempts to enter will continue their dramatic decline.”

But the administration’s proposals have already angered key Democrats who met with Trump last month.

“This proposal fails to represent any attempt at compromise,” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a joint statement Sunday night.

“We told the president at our meeting that we were open to reasonable border security measures … but this list goes so far beyond what is reasonable,” Pelosi added.

The Trump administration officially announced its plan to end the DACA program – which provides a level of amnesty to certain illegal immigrants, many of whom came to the U.S. as children – with a six-month delay for current recipients earlier this year.

With the delay, the solution for protecting young immigrants from deportation is punted to Congress, with only a few months to pass immigration reform legislation.

Read on for a look at how the DACA program works and why the administration disbanded it.

What is the DACA program?

The DACA program was formed through executive order by former President Barack Obama in 2012 and allows certain people, called Dreamers, who come to the U.S. illegally as minors to be protected from immediate deportation. Recipients are able to request “consideration of deferred action” for a period of two years which is subject to renewal.

“Deferred action is a use of prosecutorial discretion to defer removal action against an individual for a certain period of time,” U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services states. “Deferred action does not provide lawful status.”

TRUMP EXPECTED TO DECIDE SOON ON FATE OF DREAMERS

Individuals are able to request DACA status if they were under the age of 31 on June 15, 2012, came to the U.S. before turning 16 and have continuously lived in the country since June 15, 2007.

Individuals must also have a high school diploma, GED certification, been honorably discharged from the military or still be in school. Recipients cannot have a criminal record.

It does not provide “legal status.”

How many people are affected by DACA?

Nearly 800,000 undocumented youth are under the program's umbrella.

Thousands of people could lose their jobs should Trump decide to phase out the DACA program, according to a recent study by the left-leaning think tank, the Center for American Progress.

""As leaders of communities across the country – individuals and institutions that have seen these young people grow up in our communities – we recognize how they have enriched and strengthened our cities, states, schools, businesses, congregations and families.""

Nearly 2,000 leaders have signed a letter asking Trump to protect the Dreamers, including eight governors.

“As leaders of communities across the country – individuals and institutions that have seen these young people grow up in our communities – we recognize how they have enriched and strengthened our cities, states, schools, businesses, congregations and families,” the letter said.

Why did the Trump administration dismantle it?

During the presidential campaign, Trump referred to DACA as “illegal amnesty.” However, he seemingly signaled that he had softened his stance on the program in April when he told the Associated Press that DACA recipients could “rest easy.”

Yet the administration announced its plan to dismantle the program in September.

MOTHER OF TWO AT CENTER OF DACA DEBATE IN KENTUCKY

Acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke said that while DACA will be phased out for current recipients, “no new initial requests or associated applications filed after today will be acted on.”

Republicans – and some Democrats – opposed Obama’s order from the start as a perceived overreach of executive power.

“The point here is … the president does not have the authority to waive immigration law, nor does he have the authority to create it out of thin air,” Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, said at the time.

King has remained a stalwart Republican against the program; he suggested in August that DACA recipients should turn their parents in to federal immigration authorities.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions blasted the Obama administration’s “disrespect for the legislative process” in enacting the 2012 policy as he revealed the Trump administration’s decision. He also argued that the “unilateral executive amnesty” could have been struck down by courts had it remained in place.

“Such an open-ended circumvention of immigration laws was an unconstitutional exercise of authority by the executive branch,” Sessions said.

Obama spoke out on social media after the Trump administration's announcement, stating that it's ""self-defeating ... and it is cruel"" to end the DACA program, and questioned the motive behind the decision.

Ahead of the decision, some Republicans stressed the need for protections offered from DACA and urged lawmakers to quickly pass immigration legislation.

TRUMP WILL ALLOW IMMIGRANTS TO OBTAIN CITIZENSHIP THROUGH MILITARY SERVICE

Daniel Garza, president of the conservative immigration nonprofit Libre Initiative, told Fox News that DACA offers a “reprieve from a life of uncertainty for innocent kids who didn’t break the law.”

“It’s rather disappointing to think they could return to a state of anxiety and fear,” he said.

House Speaker Paul Ryan and a handful of other Republicans had urged Trump to hold off on scrapping DACA to give lawmakers more time to come up with a legislative fix. But after the decision was announced, Ryan, too, blamed the Obama administration for a “clear abuse of executive authority, an attempt to create law out of thin air.”

“It is my hope that the House and Senate, with the president’s leadership, will be able to find consensus on a permanent legislative solution that includes ensuring that those who have done nothing wrong can still contribute as a valued part of this great country,” Ryan said.

Congress has repeatedly tried – and failed – to come together on immigration overhaul legislation, and it remains uncertain whether the House would be able to pass anything on the divisive issue.

After the announcement, Trump said people should not worry about the decision.

""For all of those (DACA) that are concerned about your status during the 6 month period, you have nothing to worry about,"" Trump tweeted. ""No action!""

One thing to consider – the decision to end DACA could toss a wrench into Trump's other immigration plans, including securing the border wall, Capitol Hill aides told the Washington Examiner.

Do any DACA recipients serve in the military?

Dreamers were eligible to serve in the U.S. military since 2014 when the Pentagon adopted a policy to allow a certain amount of undocumented immigrants to join.

In the fiscal year 2016, 359 DACA recipients had enlisted in the Army – which is the only branch to accept immigrants of this category.

A Department of Defense official said in April that the military would continue to accept noncitizen recruits, but it is unclear if that will continue to be the case now.

As reported by sources for the New York Post, the Obamas are apparently waiting for 10 Gracie Square’s housing board to approve the purchase of a unit in the building, which has been home to such famous folks as Gloria Vanderbilt, Anderson Cooper, and former first lady of China Madame Chiang Kai-shek — but it’s also got quite a tragic past, the Post reports.

SEE THE NYC TOWNHOUSE WHERE OBAMA LIVED AFTER COLLEGE

The building has been the site of two very high-profile suicides in the last 30 years, which is enough to make even a New York City real-estate agent think twice about living there.

“I don’t know of any buildings with two suicides,” said Dolly Lenz, CEO of Dolly Lenz Real Estate, in a statement to the New York Post. “It almost says that there is a cloud on the building.”

The first victim of these tragedies was Carter Cooper, the 23-year-old son of Gloria Vanderbilt and the older brother of CNN anchor Anderson Cooper. According to reports, Carter was acting strangely in the months leading up to his suicide, but had been in therapy. Then, on July 22, 1988, during a visit to his mother’s home, he abruptly ran out onto the terrace of his Vanderbilt’s two-story penthouse apartment, hopped over the ledge, and dangled there before letting himself drop from the 14th floor — all while Vanderbilt watched from feet away.

MORE ABOUT BARACK AND MICHELLE'S PROSPECTIVE NYC APARTMENT

""He let go, and there was a moment when I thought I was going to jump over after him,” Vanderbilt remembered during a 2011 appearance of Anderson Cooper’s talk series.

In Vanderbilt’s 1997 book, “A Mother’s Story,” she also alleged that Carter’s suicide may have triggered by an allergy to medication.

The second, much more recent suicide at 10 Grace Square took place in April 2017, and claimed the life of author, heiress and socialite Jean Stein. Stein, whose works include “Edie: An American Girl” and “West of Eden,” had reportedly been suffering from depression, according to her daughter Katrina vanden Heuvel, and jumped from the 15th floor of the building on April 30, the New York Times reported in its obituary.

A fellow resident who witnessed the suicide has said it was a messy one, as Stein “miscalculated” the jump and landed an eighth-floor terrace. She had also severed her leg in the fall, according to reports.

10 Gracie Square, however, is also infamous for more than these two suicides: In 1982, it was also where sixth-floor resident Frances Schreuder was arrested for conspiring with her son Marco to kill Schreuder’s father, wealthy Utah businessman Franklin Bradshaw.

Schreuder had reportedly been unhappy with the amount of money Bradshaw was allotting her, and persuaded her then-17-year-old son to shoot his grandfather dead in 1978. He was eventually caught, and Schreuder was nabbed while trying to escape out the window of her 10 Gracie Square abode.

“These aren’t intelligence documents,” she said. “It’s historical data.”

She went on, ""There's nothing sensitive in there, there's no troop movements,"" she added. ""It was a historical record of everything that had happened in Iraq and Afghanistan.""

Manning, who was released in May after seven years in military prison, was by turns impassioned, defensive, humorous and occasionally tearful in a panel discussion with New Yorker writer Larissa MacFarquhar.

She became emotional when asked what she thought the best result had been from her leaking of hundreds of thousands of classified documents to WikiLeaks. ""Look, I haven't had time to deal with these questions,"" she said. ""All I've been doing is fighting for my life for the last seven years.""

The 29-year-old transgender woman was known as Bradley Manning when she was convicted and sentenced to 35 years in prison. In his last days in office, President Barack Obama commuted the rest of her sentence.

Manning has made only a few appearances since her release. Last month, Harvard University reversed a decision to name her a visiting fellow after CIA director Mike Pompeo scrapped a planned appearance over the designation, calling Manning an ""American traitor.""

And Manning tweeted two weeks later that she'd been denied entry into Canada because of her U.S. criminal record.

While some see her as a traitor, others see her as a hero for exposing truths of war. One audience questioner cried as she mentioned the ordeal Manning had been through.

At times, Manning told MacFarquhar she was legally unable to get into certain details. And when asked how she would advise other aspiring leakers to proceed, she said simply that everyone needed to make their own decisions.

Manning spoke of her childhood in small-town Oklahoma -- ""a typical generic town in the middle of the country"" -- her turbulent family life, and a short time living homeless on the streets of Chicago.

She said she'd learned to program computers by age 8 or 9, and eventually joined the military because she thought ""I could use my skills and make a difference."" Once she got to Iraq, she said, she was overwhelmed by the death and destruction she saw.

On a 10-day leave back home in Washington, she said, she first tried to leak the documents to the Washington Post or The New York Times -- simply because she had seen the movie ""All the President's Men."" Unwilling to trust email, she called the newspapers from public phones at various Starbucks locations.

But the newspapers were unable to establish encrypted communications channels, so she went to WikiLeaks, because, she said, ""I was running out of time.""

Manning spoke in detail of her time in prison, especially in solitary confinement. ""Humans are a social creature,"" she said, fighting tears. ""We need connections. We need to be with each other.""

She said she got through much of the seven years by setting small, incremental goals, like getting ""from breakfast to lunch to dinner to sleep."" When the rules forbid her to exercise, she said, she started to dance, and her guards didn't stop her. So she thought, she said, ""OK, that's how I'll exercise, like Zumba.""

Manning has now become an activist -- for LGBT rights, for transparency in government, and also against what she called an alarming level of surveillance in society. ""I feel like prison has encroached into the outside world,"" she said. ""You've got militarized forces walking around on American streets. It's quite frightening.""

She also had a message for engineers and software designers: Pay attention to the potential uses of what you're designing, because it can be used for different purposes than intended.

Manning was asked by one tearful audience questioner whether her experience had made her ""more cynical about fairness.""

""I do have cynical moments,"" she said, tearing up again. ""But then I get past them, you know? I turn to my friends, and I turn to my family ... and then they cheer me up.""

Upon seeing this, Puerto Rico's governor Ricardo Rossello‏ tweeted back at Musk, writing ""Let's talk."" Musk responded, saying he would be happy to talk and is hopeful Tesla can help.

According to several media reports, 95 percent of the U.S. territory is still without power after the category 4 hurricane battered the island weeks ago. Some estimates have said that a full restoration of power may not return to Puerto Rico for as long as six months.

Tesla has not responded to a request for comment from Fox News.

Big opportunity for Tesla

In addition to selling electric cars, including the recently introduced Model 3, Tesla has an energy storage business, selling battery packs to commercial utilities, as well as home residences. It also has a solar panel business, after it acquired Solar City, co-founded by Musk's cousin Lyndon Rive, for $2.6 billion in November 2016.

Tesla has powered such smaller islands as Kauai in Hawaii and Ta'u in American Samoa, according to the company's website. The populations of those islands is far less than the 3.4 million people living in Puerto Rico.

James Murdoch, the CEO of 21st Century Fox, parent of Fox News, is a member of Tesla's board of directors.

Tesla has already sent a number of its battery packs to Puerto Rico to help the island store energy in an effort to offset the shortage. Musk has also personally donated $250,000 in an effort to rebuild the island.

Other case studies

The conversation between Rossello and Musk is similar to one that took place several months ago, between Musk and billionaire entrepreneur Mike Cannon-Brookes, who asked if Musk was serious about ending South Australia's rolling blackouts.

Musk responded by saying the company could do it in 100 days from the time the contract was signed or it would be free.

It has since won a contract to help fix the issues in South Australia.

While a quarterback for the 49ers last year, Colin Kaepernick sat or kneeled during the national anthem last season to bring more attention to the killings of black men by police officers. The protests have grown this season.

Meanwhile, CBS Sports' Jason La Canfora corrected his report that had claimed Kaepernick would stand during the national anthem if given a chance to play football in the NFL again.

""Wanted to clarify one thing regarding @Kaepernick7. When I was asked about his whether or not he would sit or stand for anthem ..."" La Canfora tweeted after the report came out earlier Sunday.

""Standing for Anthem wasn't something that I spoke to Colin about,"" the reporter added. ""I relayed what had been reported about him standing in the future...""

""Reports about @Kaepernick7 standing for anthem had not been refuted,"" La Canfora wrote. ""However, I cant say if they are true or not. Colin and I didn't discuss.""

In another message, La Canfora said, ""Colin would have to address any future demonstrations. I didn't ask him if he would sit or stand. Our chat primarily about his will to play.""

""I know @Kaepernick7 is fully committed to playing football and helping those in need. What he would do during the Anthem I do not know,"" he wrote.

The reporter added that Kaepernick has been living in New York and working out privately in New Jersey with the hope of signing with a team this season.

""After sitting down with Colin Kaepernick for several hours, @JasonLaCanfora says the QB is still actively trying to play in the NFL,"" NFLonCBS tweeted Sunday, including a video.

""He's not planning on kneeling, he's going to donate all his jersey sales, and he's planning on standing for the anthem, if given the opportunity,"" La Canfora initially said in the video segment.

On Sunday, Kaepernick's girlfriend, radio personality Nessa Diab, took to Twitter.

""The reports that Colin will stand for the anthem are completely false! He has never discussed this with anyone,"" she posted.

Kaepernick retweeted Diab's message.

The New York Times, citing an unnamed source at NBC, reported that there were jokes about Weinstein, but they were cut out before airtime. There were some jokes for the “Weekend Update” segment — but those jokes reportedly fell flat with the studio audience.

Lorne Michaels, SNL's legendary creator, told The Daily Mail that the show did not go after Weinstein because he is from New York.

“It’s a New York thing,” he said. Weinstein was born in Queens.

The show is famous for its relentless satire of President Trump. Donald Trump, Jr., tweeted Sunday, “Out of curiosity where is @realdonaldtrump from??? Seems like there could be more to that pass than this nonsense.”

The show featured a performance from Jason Aldean, who was on the stage during last week’s mass killing in Las Vegas. He paid tribute to the victims of the massacre and to the late rocker Tom Petty.

Aldean performed Petty’s “I Won’t Back Down” during the live opening Saturday night and then introduced the show.

“This week we witnessed one of the worst tragedies in American history,” he said. “So many people are hurting. You can be sure that we are going to walk through these tough times together every step of the way.”

Social media took notice on how Weinstein was left out of the show.

“Why didn’t big mouth Michael Che say anything about Harvey Weinstein on SNL 'Weekend Update'? He’s got so much opinion about everything else,” Pastor Darrell Scott, a Trump supporter, posted on Twitter.

ESPN columnist Buster Olney called the show “gutless.”

“SNL with nothing on Weinstein? Gutless,” he posted early Saturday.

Jones’ comments, the strongest made on the anthem controversy, came after he was asked about Vice President Mike Pence leaving the game in Indianapolis early after several San Francisco 49ers players took a knee during the national anthem.

""I know this, we cannot ... in the NFL in any way give the implication that we tolerate disrespecting the flag,"" he said following the Cowboys’ 35-31 loss to the Green Bay Packers. ""We know that there is a serious debate in this country about those issues, but there is no question in my mind that the National Football League and the Dallas Cowboys are going to stand up for the flag. So we're clear.""

Jones and the rest of the team kneeled arm-in-arm before the national anthem before a game against the Arizona Cardinals two weeks ago, days after President Trump reignited the anthem-protest controversy.

Dallas players have stood on the sideline, many with hands over their hearts, during the anthem ever since former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick started kneeling last season in protest of what he believed were instances of racial injustice in the U.S.

Jones said showing respect for the flag and the anthem is more important to him than any potential issues of team unity.

""There is no room here if it comes between looking non-supportive of our players and of each other or creating the impression that you're disrespecting the flag, we will be non-supportive of each other,"" Jones said. ""We will not disrespect the flag.""

Jones said he wasn't aware of whether any of his players had raised a fist at the end of the anthem before the Green Bay game.

""I don't know about that,"" Jones said. ""But if there's anything that is disrespectful to the flag, then we will not play. OK? Understand? If we are disrespecting the flag, then we won't play. Period.""

Additionally, Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross said he changed his view on how his team should handle the national anthem. Ross said because Trump made standing for the national anthem about “patriotism,” he evolved the way he looks at the protest, according to the Miami Herald.

Ross now wants all of the Dolphins players to stand for the anthem. Three Dolphins players – Kenny Stills, Julian Thomas and Michael Thomas – remained off to the sideline during the anthem Sunday.

The NFL has said the game operations manual distributed to teams includes a reference to players standing for the anthem, but that it's a policy and not a rule. The league has said it doesn't plan to punish players over anthem protests.

""The league in mind should absolutely take the rules we've got on the books and make sure that we do not give the perception that we're disrespecting the flag,"" Jones said.

The requests included additional crackdowns on “sanctuary cities” that protect illegal immigrants; reducing the number of incoming refugees; 10,000 more Customs and Border Patrol agents; and new initiatives curbing the number of unaccompanied immigrants who come to the U.S. illegally as children. Democrats already have said many of the White House's terms are off the table.

“Unfortunately, over the last several decades respect for the rule of law has broken down and immigration enforcement has been sacrificed for the sake of political expediency. This has made us less secure and it cannot stand,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement. “Now President Trump has put forth a series of proposals that will restore the rule of law to our immigration system, prioritize America’s safety and security, and end the lawlessness. These are reasonable proposals that will build on the early success of President Trump’s leadership. This plan will work. If followed it will produce an immigration system with integrity and one in which we can take pride. Perhaps the best result will be that unlawful attempts to enter will continue their dramatic decline.”

DACA essentially allows law-abiding illegal immigrants brought into the U.S. by their parents to live and work in the country without fear of deportation.

The Trump administration argued earlier this year that federal courts were ready to strike down DACA as unconstitutional, which would put the future of so-called “Dreamers” in jeopardy.

Trump gave Congress six months to find a legislative alternative, then struck a framework deal last month with House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York, leaving the door open for extending DACA.

In a joint statement, Pelosi and Schumer said the White House's new list of requests “goes so far beyond what is reasonable” and “fails to represent any attempt at compromise.

“The Administration can’t be serious about compromise or helping the Dreamers if they begin with a list that is anathema to the Dreamers, to the immigrant community and to the vast majority of Americans,” they wrote.

“If the President was serious about protecting the Dreamers, his staff has not made a good faith effort to do so,” they said.

The White House also asked to limit family-based green cards to spouses and the minor children of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents, in addition to creating a point-based system. And, it called for boosting fees at border crossings, making it easier to deport gang members and unaccompanied children, and overhauling the asylum system.

“When crafting the Administration’s immigration principles, the President asked us to focus on measures that will assist the Department of Homeland Security’s law enforcement personnel with what they need to enforce our immigration laws, secure our border, and protect American communities across this country,” Department of Homeland Security Acting Secretary Elaine Duke said in a statement.

Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chairwoman Michelle Lujan Grisham, D-N.M., fired back: “The President’s draconian and anti-immigrant principles jeopardize the bi-partisan, bi-cameral progress that has been made to pass a legislative solution that will protect nearly 800,000 Dreamers. It is immoral for the President to use the lives of these young people as bargaining chips in his quest to impose his cruel, anti-immigrant and un-American agenda on our nation.”

House Speaker Paul Ryan’s spokesman Doug Andres said the House immigration working group would review the list and consult with Republican members and the administration.

General Motors is developing a self-driving pack animal. Correction: self-driving pachyderm.

The SURUS borrows its name from a legendary elephant that helped Hannibal cross the Alps and turns it into an acronym that stands for Silent Utility Rover Universal Superstructure.

It’s a flatbed truck without a cab that’s equipped with a hydrogen fuel cell powertrain and fully autonomous driving capability.

GM is pitching the zero-emissions vehicle as both a commercial cargo carrier and military supply truck that can stealthily operate in warzones without putting troops at risk.

The platform features an electric powertrain at each end of the vehicle that gives it four-wheel-drive for off-road capabilities and four-wheel-steering to improve its maneuverability in tight spaces.

A cab for a human driver and passengers can be attached to help lead several of the vehicles wirelessly linked in a virtual train.

Instead of loading it with gear or containers, modules outfitted as mobile hospitals or for other functions can potentially be attached.

GM says SURUS has a range of 400 miles per fill up of the hydrogen tanks built into the chassis, and can be used to generate power and produce water from its exhaust in remote locations.

The project follows the creation of a fuel cell-powered Colorado pickup called the ZH2 that is currently being tested by the U.S. Army’ Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC.)

Fuel cell powertrains are nothing new to General Motors. It's spent billions on them since it unveiled the Autonomy concept in 2002, which was a hydrogen-powered chassis that was envisioned to work with different bodies, much like a passenger car-size version of SURUS.

The vehicle also brings to mind the ‘Autotrucks’ conceptual designer Nick Pugh created for the film ‘Logan’ starring Hugh Jackman.

Pugh’s idea was to separate the drivetrain into independent twin-axle pods that could travel in tandem to a loading area and pick up a shipping container at either end. They were a menacing and memorable element of the blockbuster, which was set in the year 2029.

SURUS could be on the road, or at least lugging stuff around battlefields and worksites sooner than that. General Motors is in talks to provide TARDEC with a SURUS for an evaluation, and is working toward putting autonomous vehicles into production within a couple of years.

In the United Kingdom's socialized health care system, the answer appears to be ""no."" And if Democrats get their way, the same could be true in the United States.

To save money, the U.K. National Health Service recently announced it will ban obese patients from many surgeries for up to a year. Such rationing is standard in single-payer health care systems. Americans will face the same fate if Democrats can enact Medicare for All here.

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., recently introduced his Medicare for All bill backed by 15 other Democratic senators. His call to create such a single-payer health care system was a major part of his failed campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination last year.

Known as ""lifestyle rationing,"" the new British policy debunks the myth that single-payer systems deliver truly universal health care.

In addition, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., is urging Democrats to make single-payer a centerpiece of their upcoming campaigns.

Known as ""lifestyle rationing,"" the new British policy debunks the myth that single-payer systems deliver truly universal health care.

The rule applies to patients with a body mass index of 30 or higher. It would hit a 5-foot-10 man who weighs more than 209 pounds, or a 5-foot-4 woman who weighs more than 174 pounds. These patients will have to wait a year, or lose 10 percent of their weight, before they can receive elective surgeries like hip or knee replacements.

The National Health Service in Britain believes such discriminatory rationing is the ""best way of achieving maximum value from the limited resources available.""

Of course, overweight people aren't the only ones denied care in single-payer systems. The bureaucrats who run them have little choice but to ration care for everyone.

When patients pay virtually nothing for health care, they have little incentive to limit their consumption. If someone feels even slightly under the weather, he or she can immediately go to the doctor and demand medicine, rather than simply rest up and hydrate. So patients flood doctor's offices and hospitals.

With no market forces at work to regulate demand, the only way for the government to keep costs under control is to forcibly limit the supply of medical services.

Single-payer systems do so by offering doctors and hospitals relatively paltry sums for their services. The average general practitioner in the United Kingdom earns about $130,000 per year. By contrast, a general practitioner in America earns over $200,000 annually, on average.

This combination of lower pay and seemingly limitless demand for care is causing many British doctors to leave the medical field – or go elsewhere to practice. There are 7,000 fewer doctors in the United Kingdom today than in 2005. In just the first month of this year, nearly 300 doctors applied for certificates to work overseas.

In addition, fewer medical students are completing their educations. In 2016, half of junior doctors left the National Health Service after their first two years of training. That is an abrupt increase from 2011, when less than three in ten junior doctors exited.

As a result, the National Health Service is in the midst of an unprecedented staffing shortage. More than 30,600 positions are currently vacant. Almost 40 percent of those openings are for nurses and midwives.

So patients wait. More than 4 million are standing by for surgery – the highest figure in a decade.

The single-payer system in Canada is hardly better, particularly for patients seeking specialist care. According to the Fraser Institute, the median wait time between referral from a general practitioner and treatment by a specialist in 2016 was 20 weeks – the longest on record.

America's own experiment with single-payer – the Veterans Health Administration in the Department of Veterans Affairs – is a national embarrassment. A federal investigation found that more than 200 veterans died while waiting for care at a Phoenix VA facility in 2015. The same is true of almost 100 veterans at a Los Angeles VA hospital between October 2014 and August 2015.

These horror stories are worth remembering now that the apparent failure of the GOP's health care reform effort has revived calls for single-payer in the United States.

Some U.S. doctors appear to be falling in line behind liberal icons Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. According to a new survey from Merritt Hawkins, a physician recruiting firm, 42 percent of doctors strongly support single-payer. Fourteen percent are somewhat supportive.

Supporters of single-payer health care should realize the error of their ways, because single-payer isn't a shortcut to universal health care. As the experiences of other countries prove, it's a pathway to grotesque rationing, long waiting lines and needless suffering.","Single-payer health care means you might be denied surgery for being too fat -- no, really",http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/08/single-payer-health-care-means-might-be-denied-surgery-for-being-too-fat-no-really.html

And there’s no better dragstrip than Atco Dragway in the Pine Barrens of New Jersey, a muscle car hotbed and home to the legendary Jersey Devil.

That’s where I had the chance to strap into the driver’s seat and take a Demon for a dozen runs. I should say “the seat,” because it comes with only one, making it the world’s most awesome pizza delivery vehicle.

And it can haul.

The Demon is the most powerful American car ever made. It has a 6.2-liter supercharged V8 that puts out 808 hp and still gets 22 mph on the highway. It’s an update of the Challenger SRT Hellcat’s 707 hp motor, which now seems quaint — even more so if you fit the Demon with the special engine control module, included in a tool-and-parts kit called the Demon Crate, that allows it to run on 100 octane race gas and bumps the power up to 840 hp to go with its 770 lb-ft of torque.

Over half of the Hellcat engine’s components were modified in the, including the block, and a monstrous 2.7-liter supercharger strapped on to the top of it. The Demon’s 8-speed automatic transmission, driveshaft, differential and half shafts are appropriately beefed-up, as well.

There is no manual transmission available, but the automatic is one of the coolest ever made. It’s equipped with a feature called a TransBrake. It’s a drag racing technology that, in this case, engages first and second gears simultaneously to bind the transmission, so you can step on the gas to build up torque in the engine and drivetrain without having to use the brakes, which wouldn’t be able to hold back much of what the Demon dishes out before the tires started spinning. Meanwhile, a torque converter with a high stall speed lets you rev engine even higher than you normally could without moving as you await the green light.

Before we get to that, a few other notes on the Challenger’s transformation from Hellcat to Demon. With the project’s goals being a sub-10-second quarter-mile and the ability to lift the front wheels on launch, the SRT team knew it had to trim a few pounds — 232 pounds, it turns out — from the coupe’s over 2-ton weight.

Eliminating the passenger seat and rear bench (both can be added back in for $1 each) along with the trunk carpet and spare tire was the easy part. Swapping in some lightweight suspension parts and smaller brakes is indicative of the Demon’s drag racing focus — although it retains its computer-controlled shock absorber system and still handles pretty well for a behemoth.

The suspension plays an important role in the Demon’s straight-line speed, too. When you set the car to Drag Mode, it stiffens the rear shocks and softens the fronts to help transfer the weight to the meaty, 12.4-inch wide Nitto drag radials at launch. The result is a car that can cover a quarter mile in 9.96 seconds on premium fuel and 9.65 seconds on race gas in ideal conditions with a set of skinny “front-runner” tires installed. The Demon Crate comes with a set of rims for a pair.

The first time I gave it a shot, I skipped the TransBrake and used the traditional launch control system to get a feel for things. And oh, how it felt.

You simply press the brake pedal hard, floor the gas, release the brake and become one with the deep bucket seat. I’ve been in quick production cars before, but none prepared me for the violence the Demon took off with. The thunder coming out of the exhaust mixed with the screeching supercharger enhanced the experience in a way the silent electric motors of a ‘Ludicrous’ Tesla never could.

And it pulled all the way down the strip, which I covered in 10.2 seconds at 134 mph. And to think that launch control neuters the car. Using the TransBrake is the way to unleash its full abilities, but you’ll need plenty of your own to go with it.

To engage it, you pull both paddles behind the steering wheel, give it some gas (but not too much) and then, when the screen on the instrument cluster tells you it’s OK, you let one paddle go and take your foot off the brake.

It’ll let you sit there like that for about 15 seconds. You release the other paddle to get moving, and then it’s all you. There’s no traction control in this mode, so you need to modulate the throttle to keep from smoking the tires. It’s easier said than done with all that power, even on a strip prepped with sticky traction compound and rubbered-in. On my first three tries, I botched it pretty good.

I eventually managed to get away cleanly a couple of times, but never did better than the launch control. I’m sure a drag racing regular could.

Jim Wilder, the Demon’s development manager, is one of those. He took me for a run in a two-seat car with front-runners on it and pretty much all I can remember is getting walloped in the back and looking at the sky as we left the line. He may have overseen its development, but the launch control has nothing on him. I was so taken aback by the ride that I spaced out and forgot to check his time. Pride wouldn’t allow me to tell you what it was, anyway.

Dodge isn’t the first to hop up a Hellcat, of course. Plenty of shops have figured out how to get this much power and more out of it. The difference is that the Demon comes with a warranty. Wilder said his team did over 500 quarter-mile runs on a single axle, and more than 900 with the same transmission, and both looked like new when they pulled them out to inspect them. It’s doubtful any Demons will see that much action in the real world.

The Demon starts at $86,090. That’s a lot for a toy, and that’s exactly what it is. But it’s likely a steal at that price.

Dodge is building only 3,300 of them for the U.S. and Canada, and they’ve all been allocated. It did its best to keep dealers from marking them up, but some people are already trying to flip cars they don’t have yet for double what they’re paying, and a few probably will. If not now, then in a few years at one of those collector car auctions on TV.

That is, unless Dodge manages to outdo itself. When the Hellcat came out a few years ago, everyone thought it marked the end of days for the muscle car, and then they went and made the Demon and turned the Hellcat into a commodity. While it is a one-year-and-done model, the Challenger is going to be around at least until 2020, so there’s time for an even more evil encore.

But what the devil would they call it?

The most serious threat to Spain's national unity in decades is likely to come to a head in the coming days with attention focused on whether Catalonia will make good on its promise to declare independence — and what form that declaration may take if it comes to pass.

Eyes will be focused on the regional Catalan parliament Tuesday when the region's president, Carles Puigdemont, speaks about the current political impasse. It is not yet clear if he will declare the restive region's independence from Spain, and whether such a declaration would be purely symbolic.

It is clear, however, that such a move would meet vehement opposition from Spanish authorities.

Here is the status of the standoff between the affluent, industrial region of Catalonia and the central Spanish government in Madrid.

____

A REFERENDUM MARRED BY VIOLENT CLASHES

The conflict over a self-determination vote has been dragging on for six years but Catalan separatists staged an independence referendum on Oct. 1 despite Spain's insistence it was illegal. Spanish police, ordered to prevent the referendum, clashed with voters and supporters, and Catalan officials said over 900 people were injured. Videos of police pulling voters out by their hair and kicking them on stairs flashed around the world. An Interior Ministry official later apologized for the injuries but laid the blame on the Catalan government for having encouraged people to vote.

____

A QUESTIONABLE RESULT

Catalonian officials claim the referendum results give them a mandate to create a new country. But less than half of the region's electorate voted, and the way the referendum was held has raised a host of complaints about its legality and validity. As Spanish police started seizing ballot boxes, Catalan officials allowed voters to cast ballots wherever they liked. Catalan officials say the final numbers show 90 percent of votes in favor of independence and regional President Carles Puigdemont proclaimed a victory. Spain cried foul and most governments backed Madrid. No one seems eager to recognize Catalonia, including the European Union.

____

BIG BUSINESS EXODUS

The influential business community has indicated its unhappiness with the prospect of independence under current circumstances, Catalonia's two major banks, CaixaBank and Banco Sabadell, energy giant Gas Natural and the company that provides Barcelona's water have all decided in recent days to move their headquarters to other parts of Spain because of a desire to stay within the EU. Some believe this will lead Catalan political leaders to be more cautious about declaring independence.

___

WHY DOES CATALONIA WANT INDEPENDENCE NOW?

Many Catalans have long highlighted the region's differences from the rest of Spain but the latest surge for independence began in 2010, when Spain's top court struck down key parts of a charter that would have granted Catalonia greater autonomy and recognized it as a nation within Spain.

Since then, hundreds of thousands of residents have thronged onto the streets every Sept. 11, a Catalan holiday, to demand independence. Spain's recent financial crisis and the harsh austerity measures that followed generated more support for secession. Catalans frequently complain they contribute more in taxes to the Spanish treasury than they get back.

___

WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?

It's not clear what might happen if Catalonia does actually try to secede. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has vowed that Spain will not be divided and says he will use any lawful measure to stop the separatists. He said this includes the use of Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution, which would allow the central government to take control of the governance of a region ""if the regional government does not comply with the obligations of the Constitution.""

A split raises dozens of questions with no answers yet. Key issues include national boundaries with the rest of Spain and France, as well as its relationship with the EU. It's unclear how Catalonia can gain control of its defense and foreign affairs, tax collection and management of airports, ports, rail transport and nuclear stations, most of which are currently managed by Spain.

The European Union has already said Catalonia would be expelled from the bloc and its shared currency, the euro, if it declares independence.

Weinstein's alleged inappropriate behavior with women in the last 30 years was detailed in the bombshell Times report published Thursday. In it, actress Ashley Judd described being lured to Weinstein's hotel room, only to find him wearing a bathrobe and requesting sexual favors.

The report also detailed encounters Weinstein allegedly had with other women working for the Weinstein Company, as well as official settlements from people associated with him, including actress Rose McGowan, who was issued a $100,000 settlement that Weinstein specifically said was not an admission of guilt.

In the days since the allegations first surfaced, several key allies of Weinstein have backed off the mogul. His lawyer Lisa Bloom and advisor Lanny Davis resigned on Saturday and nearly one-third of the Weinstein Company’s board resigned on Friday, according to Variety. The report also alleged that his brother, Bob Weinstein and chief operating officer David Glasser, were pushing for his firing. Both men are now in control of the company.

In wake of the report, many congressional Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, have given money they'd received as a donation from Weinstein to charity.

Weinstein and his family have given more than $1.4 million in political contributions since the 1992 election cycle, nearly all of it to Democratic lawmakers, candidates and their allies, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.

Harvey Weinstein on Thursday issued a lengthy statement that acknowledged that, ""a lot of pain,"" was caused.

“I came of age in the 60’s and 70’s, when all the rules about behavior and workplaces were different. That was the culture then. I have since learned it’s not an excuse, in the office – or out of it. To anyone. I realized some time ago that I needed to be a better person and my interactions with the people I work with have changed. I appreciate the way I’ve behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologize for it…”

But Weinstein and his legal team have also have criticized the New York Times' report in statements and interviews. They also announced in the days after that he was intending to file a lawsuit against the newspaper for $50 million in damages.

""This event underscores the turbulent times we're living in when senseless killings are taken to such an extreme level,"" radio music exec Mike McVay told Fox News. ""You'd find many in the country music community supportive of the right to bear arms.

""There will be a debate,"" added McVay, EVP of content and Programming for Cumulus Media and Westwood One. ""We'll know more in a couple of weeks how it's going to change.""

The debate has already started; Caleb Keefer, the guitarist for the Josh Abbott Band, who performed at the Route 91 Harvest Festival hours before the shooting occurred, spoke out in favor of gun control on Monday.

""I've been a proponent of the 2nd amendment my entire life,"" Keefer wrote on Twitter. ""Until the events of last night. I cannot express how wrong I was...We need gun control RIGHT. NOW.""

Echoing Keefer's statements is the daughter of country music legend Johnny Cash, Rosanne Cash, a longtime advocate for gun control, who penned an op-ed urging her fellow musicians to take action.

Cash said the National Rifle Association (NRA) ""funds domestic terrorism"" and country music artists associated with its group ""NRA Country"" must speak up against it.

""For the past few decades, the National Rifle Association has increasingly nurtured an alliance with country music artists and their fans. You can see it in 'N.R.A. Country,' which promotes the artists who support the philosophical, and perhaps economic, thrall of the N.R.A., with the pernicious tag line 'Celebrate the Lifestyle,'"" Cash wrote in the New York Times.

""That wholesome public relations veneer masks something deeply sinister and profoundly destructive.""

Country star Luke Bryan seemed to want to keep the focus on the victims. When asked about the tragedy on ""Good Morning America"" Wednesday alongside his fellow ""American Idol"" judges, Bryan steered clear of politics.

The requests included additional crackdowns on “sanctuary cities” that protect illegal immigrants; reducing the number of incoming refugees; 10,000 more Customs and Border Patrol agents; and new initiatives curbing the number of unaccompanied immigrants who come to the U.S. illegally as children. Democrats already have said many of the White House's terms are off the table.

“Unfortunately, over the last several decades respect for the rule of law has broken down and immigration enforcement has been sacrificed for the sake of political expediency. This has made us less secure and it cannot stand,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement. “Now President Trump has put forth a series of proposals that will restore the rule of law to our immigration system, prioritize America’s safety and security, and end the lawlessness.

In the meantime, here are some other things California has banned or might soon.

Plastic bags

California became the first state in the U.S. to ban single-use plastic bags in 2015, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune. Businesses that continue to offer the bags have to charge customers a fee.

Travel

California blocked state-funded travel to multiple states in June that had what the state attorney general considered anti-LGBT policies. Those states were: Alabama, Kentucky, South Dakota and Texas.

Non-essential state-funded travel was already banned from Kansas, Mississippi, North Carolina and Tennessee.

Certain pets

California bars the possession of certain “restricted animals” without a specific permit, including hamsters, ferrets and gerbils.

Hedgehogs, certain parakeets and piranhas are also banned from being kept as pets.

Cars with internal combustion engines

Cars with internal combustion engines could soon be banned in California.

Mary Nichols, the California Air Resources Board chair, told Bloomberg that Gov. Jerry Brown is interested in a potential ban. However, she said banning cars with internal combustion engines wouldn’t happen in the next 10 years.

Foie gras

California’s foie gras ban was reinstated this month by a federal appeals court. It found that a state law preventing sales of the food product made by force-feeding ducks and geese was not preempted by federal authority to regulate poultry products.

The ban was signed into law in 2004 after proponents said the process of fattening the birds’ livers was cruel and inhumane. The law took effect in 2012, but was blocked by a court in 2015, delighting chefs who wanted to serve it.

The sister reportedly replaces Kim Jong Un's aunt, Kim Kyong Hee, who was a key decision maker when Kim’s father – the late Kim Jong Il – ruled the country, Reuters reported.

The promotion was announced Saturday, at a meeting in which Kim also described North Korea’s nuclear weapons program as a “powerful deterrent” that guaranteed the nation’s sovereignty, Reuters reported, citing the state media report.

Kim Yo Jong, a vice director of propaganda for North Korea’s ruling Workers Party, was sanctioned in January -- along with six other North Korean officials -- by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control for “human rights abuses and censorship activities,” Bloomberg reported.

But the sister has appeared more prominently in public in recent months, Bloomberg reported.

“She’s been recognized for the work she’s done in the past year to idolize Kim Jong Un,” said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at South Korea’s University of North Korean Studies, the news agency reported. “Kim Jong Un is extending his father and grandfather’s practice of empowering family members.”

The report of Kim’s remarks came hours after U.S. President Donald Trump asserted that “only one thing will work” in negotiations with the Hermit Kingdom, Reuters reported.

Weinstein has been accused in a lengthy New York Times story of doing some truly horrendous things to women, totally unsolicited − also known as sexual harassment − over a period of nearly three decades. His alleged victims were talented young actresses and other women who had the potential to build successful careers on their own without some ugly, creepy man coercing them into giving him a massage or worse.

Even more troubling is that celebrity women’s advocate attorney Lisa Bloom is representing Weinstein. This is a woman who has represented victims in high-profile sexual harassment cases. Throwing that legacy away, she agreed to represent Weinstein, whom she said she has counseled that “times have changed” and he “needs to evolve into a higher standard.” Really?

Bloom’s reasoning regarding Weinstein gets better, though: “He has acknowledged mistakes he has made. He is reading books and going to therapy. He is an old dinosaur learning new ways.

Waxman said it was “believed that many” of the allegations against Weinstein occurred overseas, so she traveled to Rome and tracked down Fabrizio Lombardo, the person who ran Miramax Italy. Citing “multiple accounts,” Lombardo “had no film experience and his real job was to take care of Weinstein’s women needs,” she wrote.

TheWrap founder claimed she also “tracked down a woman in London who had been paid off after an unwanted sexual encounter with Weinstein” but was called directly by Weinstein associates such as Matt Damon and Russell Crowe to vouch for Lombardo.

Current Bloomberg editor Jon Landman was the paper’s culture editor at the time and told Waxman that the story wasn’t interesting, according to her report. She said that the Times enabled Weinstein before it eventually exposed him.

“So pardon me for having a deeply ambivalent response about the current heroism of the Times,” Waxman wrote.

Waxman said she “simply gagged” when she read a follow-up Times piece about media enablers who “kept this story from the public” for decades because the paper is one of the news organizations who covered up Weinstein’s history.

Landman declined Fox News’ request for comment. The Times fired back at Waxman, noting that her 2004 story may not have met the paper’s standards for publication.

""The Times newsroom has a long history of exposing corruption and abuse by powerful people and institutions. Our newsroom was the first to publish a meticulously reported investigation of Mr. Weinstein revealing numerous settlements for sexual harassment,” a Times spokesperson told Fox news. “Our former colleague Sharon Waxman wrote about a story that was published in The Times in 2004. No one currently at The Times has knowledge of editorial decisions made on that story. But in general the only reason a story or specific information would be held is if it did not meet our standards for publication.""

Some media industry insiders have asked why Waxman, who runs an outlet that covers the entertainment industry, didn’t publish an updated version of the “gutted” 2004 story detailing the woman in London who had been paid off when she founded TheWrap.

Waxman added an update to her report to address why she didn’t report the story at TheWrap: “Fair question. Five years later, 2009, the moment had passed to go back and write the missing piece about Lombardo, who was no longer on the scene and whose story had been half-published in the Times. Miramax was no longer part of the Walt Disney Company. And I did not have sufficient evidence to write about a pay-off, even though I knew one existed. My focus was on raising money, building a website and starting a media company. In the subsequent years since then I did not hear about further pay-offs or harassment and thought the issue was in the past. Weinstein had made a big effort, supposedly, to curb his temper and behavior, which was reflected in other areas of his public life.”

Earl Melchert, 65, of Barrett, turned the reward money over to the girl Friday at police headquarters.

“Today we witnessed an incredible example of kindness,” Alexandria Police Chief Rick Wyffels said on Facebook.

The 15-year-old girl was abducted from her home on Aug. 8 in Alexandria, Minn., and taken to an abandoned house where she was physically and sexually assaulted.

Fox News does not name alleged victims of sexual assault without their consent.

Fox 9 Minneapolis reported that the girl escaped Sept. 5 by swimming across a lake. Melchert found her when she came running toward him.

Her family posted the reward money seeking information about her whereabouts along with an anonymous donor.

“What no one expected was the kindness and generosity that came straight from Earl’s heart today,” Wylie said on Facebook. “He believes that young lady that came running towards him that September day is the real hero, and without hesitation, Earl handed the reward over to her, followed by a big hug.”

“Thank you Earl, it is people like you that make this world a better place,” the chief said.

Melchert told the Twin Cities Pioneer Press that he was in the right place at the right time.

“I did what I had to do,” he said.

The girl’s mother said she had been waiting to meet Melchert.

“He’s really a hero for us,” the woman said, according to the paper. “We wanted to thank him. ... He didn’t have to help her and he did. He risked a lot of things and put himself in danger.”

The three suspects include a friend of the girl’s family who lured her from her home.

They each have been charged with kidnapping, criminal sexual conduct, assault and false imprisonment.

The flu vaccine “may not be perfect but it’s the best prevention that we have,” Dr. Daniel Jernigan, the director of the influenza unit at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said.
It’s not recommended for people with “severe, life-threatening” egg allergies or those who have previously had a severe reaction to the flu vaccine, Jernigan said.
“While vaccine effectiveness may vary, recent studies show that flu vaccination reduces the risk of flu illness by between 40 percent and 60 percent among the overall population during seasons when most circulating flu viruses are well-matched to the flu vaccine,” the CDC says online.
The agency collects viruses in the world “and determines how close they are to a virus that goes into the vaccine,” Jernigan explained.","Muscle aches, fevers, chills: the flu can be an unpleasant experience during chilly weather.

The respiratory illness can also be deadly -- 43,000 people in the United States die from it each year, Dr. Neil Fishman, an infectious disease specialist and associate professor of medicine at the Hospital for the University of Pennsylvania, told Fox News.

Understanding what the flu is -- and how to avoid getting it -- may be helpful to your health.

Here's what you need to know.

What is the flu?

The flu “is a very specific disease caused by the influenza virus,” Dr. Lisa Maragakis, the senior director of infection prevention for the Johns Hopkins Health System, said, adding that there can be mild or serious cases.

FLORIDA STUDENT DIES HOURS AFTER VISITING SCHOOL HEALTH CLINIC

For one type of the virus, called Influenza A, the “classic” presentation is a sudden onset, Fishman said. People may first have a headache “more in the front of your head or behind your eyes,” with other symptoms being a fever of at least 103 degrees, chills, sweats and body aches.

Influenza B often is less severe and resembles the common cold, but there can be more serious cases, he noted.

What should I know about flu prevention?

The flu vaccine “may not be perfect but it’s the best prevention that we have,” Dr. Daniel Jernigan, the director of the influenza unit at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said.

Anyone at least 6 months old should get vaccinated yearly, the agency advises.

It’s not recommended for people with “severe, life-threatening” egg allergies or those who have previously had a severe reaction to the flu vaccine, Jernigan said.

As for timing? If you can, get vaccinated by the end of October, the CDC says.

“It takes about two weeks after you get your vaccine to get protected,” Jernigan explained, noting that most flu seasons typically start in November.

""Generally people should start getting vaccinated now,"" Fishman said, and that they should do so by Halloween to Thanksgiving.

There are other “more general prevention strategies” people can follow, according to Maragakis. These include frequently washing your hands, coughing and sneezing into the crook of your elbow and avoiding people who appear to be sick.

I have the flu -- now what?

“If it’s a mild illness, it’s generally self-limited,” Maragakis said. If you’re sick, stay home and avoid others, especially babies, pregnant women and the elderly, she advised.

Jernigan encouraged people with the flu to get lots of fluids and nutrients. Antiviral drugs are used when people are hospitalized or have certain underlying medical conditions, he said.

These types of drugs can also be used in less serious cases, according to Fishman. Other flu remedies include getting lots of rest, following a healthy diet and taking Tylenol or Advil, he said.

“None of the homeopathic drugs have really been shown to help influenza,” he said, noting that you should check with a doctor or a pharmacist to see if “natural” products interfere with other medications.

How effective is the vaccine?

During my years of painting people’s homes, I’ve learned that small spaces don’t have to be boring or go unnoticed. All it takes is a little paint. By adding paint in strategic places around the home, you can easily and inexpensively transform a space. Plus, there is a good chance you could accomplish at least one of these eight painting projects during the course of one weekend.

Here are eight spaces to consider painting and my tips and tricks on making even the smallest places have a big impact.

1. Entryway. When a guest arrives, their first impression is based on your home’s exterior and the front door. Realtors call this curb appeal. But the very next thing guests will notice is the area right inside your front door, so you should use it to make a statement.

If your home has a formal entry, choose a paint color that is one to two shades darker than the next room. A darker paint color in the entryway can make the space feel more inviting, like a warm hug.

If your home has an open floor plan without a defined entryway, use paint to create one. Try a bold color on the wall surrounding the front door and an adjacent wall as visual borders for the entry.

2. Hall bath. Small bathrooms might appear to be limited when it comes to design, but they can easily be transformed with a quick paint color update.

How do you pick a color for this small bathroom? Look around your home for spots of color that crop up in your art or drapes. For example, a living room that is mostly beige with blue accent pieces would coordinate well with a bathroom painted in that same shade of blue.

RELATED: What Color Works Best in a Traditional-Style Bathroom?

Dark colors also have been trending with homeowners I’ve worked with lately. To offset the dark nature of the paint, we typically recommend keeping the other design details, such as the floors and sink, light to make sure the room still feels open and bright.

Worried one color will overwhelm the small space? Consider installing a chair rail as a natural divider. Then paint the lower portion of the wall in a statement color while leaving the wall area above a neutral tone.

3. Bookshelf. Whether the bookshelves in your home are built-in or freestanding, you can easily create style with paint. Remove the shelves from the surround and paint the back wall of the case. Don’t be afraid to go bold with your paint color, because once the shelves and objects on the shelves are in place, your color choice will seem more subtle. You will get an instant pop of color without being too in-your-face.

4. Closet. This space is often overlooked when it comes to paint, but a fresh coat of paint on the walls and shelving in your closet can go a long way. With a small- or medium-sized closet, keep your paint color choice bright and light.

With a large walk-in closet, consider using a paint color that complements the attached room.

For shelving, use an oil-based paint for durability against scratches and scuffs.

5. Hallway. Hallways are typically long and narrow and, depending on the lighting, can also be dark. When choosing a paint color for the hallway, consider the paint colors in connecting rooms and then go one to two shades lighter. The colors will complement each other and coordinate the home’s overall design. Plus, a lighter shade will brighten up the passageway.

6. Accent wall. If you have a small amount of paint and want to make the biggest impact on your home’s design, then an accent wall is your best bet. Choose a wall in your living room or master bedroom that you want to highlight, such as the area behind the sofa or bed.

Once it is painted, hang coordinating artwork on the accent wall to finish the design.

7. Kitchen nooks and crannies. Typically, I find there isn’t too much paintable space in the kitchen. But when I do find it, it’s between the cabinets, appliances and backsplash.

When space is limited, I always encourage owners to go bold and use colors that offset the room’s features. For example, in a kitchen with white cabinets and natural stone countertops, pick a hunter green or dark blue. In large quantities, these dark shades might feel overwhelming, but in small quantities, they give the room a strong dimension.

8. Laundry room. You can’t avoid the task of laundry, so at least make it a room that is easy on the eyes and generates positivity. Think of a paint color you would never dream of using in the social areas of your home but would make you happy, such as a playful orange, a bold purple or a sunshine yellow. Who knows, being around your favorite color might even make the chore a little more enjoyable.",Transform a whole house by painting these 8 small spaces,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/09/22/transform-whole-house-by-painting-these-8-small-spaces.html

Linnea Olson, a stage 4 lung cancer patient, artist, blogger, cancer activist, and mother of three, told Healthline that the relationship between cancer patients and pharmaceutical companies is complicated.
Olson said cancer patients sometimes don’t trust drug companies because “we don't feel they necessarily have our best interests at heart.","Corporations have a responsibility to their customers and the public to be ethical, honest, and forthright.

But that obligation is heightened to a degree for pharmaceutical firms, especially the ones whose customers are dealing with serious illness or acute, chronic pain.

Insys Therapeutics deals with both types of patients.

The Arizona-based drug company got approval five years ago from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to sell Subsys, an under-the-tongue spray for cancer patients dealing with chronic pain.

Subsys contains fentanyl, the highly addictive synthetic opioid that is 100 times more powerful that morphine and 50 times more powerful than heroin, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.

Fentanyl has been in the news for the past few years.

SURGEONS REMOVE RECORD-BREAKING TUMOR FROM PATIENT'S KIDNEY

It’s been the cause of many deaths by those who mix it with street heroin.

An accidental overdose of fentanyl was the cause of rock star Prince’s death.

Despite the dangers and all the controversy surrounding this drug, Insys thought it had a winner on its hands with its sublingual version.

But apparently not as many cancer patients were using the drug as the company had hoped.

So, executives concocted an elaborate scheme in which they created “fake” cancer patients to improve sales, according to a Senate investigation whose findings were released last week.

The report from the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs was released just days after Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich filed a consumer fraud lawsuit against Insys and three doctors over a “marketing scheme” to increase sales of the drug.

Brnovich called the action part of a fight against “the unethical and greedy behavior in the pharmaceutical industry that is fueling the opioid crisis in our state.”

Senator doesn’t mince words

Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Missouri), who is steering the Insys investigation, said last week in a press conference that the company aggressively pressured its employees and many in the medical industry to increase the use of the drug.

And, she noted, it was done during a national opioid epidemic that is taking the lives of tens of thousands of people in the United States a year.

“It’s hard to imagine anything more despicable,” said McCaskill.

The senator said Insys executives misled insurance companies, provided kickbacks to doctors who went along with the scam, and falsified medical records, all just to make money.

According to the Senate report, insurance companies would only pay for the drug for a patient who “had an active cancer diagnosis, was being treated by an opioid (and, thus, was opioid tolerant) and was being prescribed Subsys to treat breakthrough pain that the other opioid could not eliminate.”

Federal prosecutors in Boston announced in December that six former Insys executives and managers, including former Chief Executive Officer Michael Babich, had been indicted.

HERE'S HOW TO TALK TO YOUR KIDS ABOUT OPIOIDS

Prosecutors said Babich and others led the conspiracy to bribe medical practitioners to unnecessarily prescribe Subsys to non-cancer patients, for which the drug is not designed, through payments disguised as marketing events and speaker fees.

Reuters reported in July that while Insys ostensibly designed the speaker program to educate healthcare professionals about Subsys, its primary purpose was to reward healthcare providers who prescribed the drug.

Prosecutors said the medical providers earned thousands of dollars in kickbacks through the speaker events, which were usually just a gathering of friends and co-workers at high-end restaurants.

In July, two former Insys sales representatives, including the wife of the company’s former chief executive officer, pleaded guilty to engaging in schemes to pay kickbacks to medical practitioners to prescribe the drug.

Pharma’s image damaged

Pharmaceutical companies in the United States are closely monitored by the federal government and intensely scrutinized in their clinical trials and marketing practices.

However, when a drug company does something as egregious as Insys is accused of, the industry’s image is damaged.

The image wasn’t helped last year by Martin Shkreli, the former chief executive officer of Turing Pharmaceuticals who raised the price of a medication for AIDS patients from $13.50 to $750.

Last month, Shkreli was convicted of two counts of fraud and one count of conspiracy for misleading investors in hedge funds he ran. He’s now doing time at a federal jail in Brooklyn.

The details of the Insys story are another public relations headache for the industry.

A recent national survey by Kantar Media, a healthcare industry research firm, showed that only 22 percent of consumers who were surveyed trust the drug companies that advertise the medications they take.

Kantar’s 2017 MARS Consumer Health Study also showed that only 28 percent believe pharmaceutical ads make them more knowledgeable.

Only 44 percent agreed that prescription drugs are a more effective treatment than over-the-counter drugs.

Patients respond to scandals

Meanwhile, the response to the Insys scandal among cancer patients has been one of outrage.

In interviews with Healthline, a half-dozen cancer patients and cancer patient advocates had harsh words for Insys as well as stern advice for the industry at large.

“When you violate the trust of someone in the cancer community, it’s almost impossible to gain it back,” said Dan Duffy, a stage 3 testicular cancer survivor, author, and advocate for cancer patients.

“Insys violated the trust a company needs to have on so many levels that it defies comprehension,” Duffy added. “I’ve never been someone to call for the public shaming or firing of anyone, because I know just how important it is to have the ability to take care of yourself, as well as your family if you have one. But whoever thought this was a good idea needs to find a new line of work. Stat.”

Duffy said what Insys has allegedly done is especially appalling because it involved faking cancer for financial gain.

“I can’t say that I haven’t thought, ‘There’s a special place in hell for this person,’” he said.

Linnea Olson, a stage 4 lung cancer patient, artist, blogger, cancer activist, and mother of three, told Healthline that the relationship between cancer patients and pharmaceutical companies is complicated.

“It is a relationship fraught with tension, as they are profit-driven, which is a different onus than patients, oncologists, researchers, and advocacy organizations,” said Olson, who is currently enrolled in her third clinical trial.

Olson said cancer patients sometimes don’t trust drug companies because “we don't feel they necessarily have our best interests at heart. There is a lot of talk about patients as partners right now, and I regard most of it as rhetoric. You can’t be a true partner in a relationship if you are not an equal.”

Olson added that the one thing patients trust drug companies to do is deliver a product that is safe and appropriate.

“When we hear of a fraudulent situation such as this one — pretending that people had cancer in order to get prior approval for a powerful pain killer — it erodes that very slim sliver of trust and enhances our perception that they are in it for the money and only the money,” she said.

Casey Quinlan, a breast cancer survivor, cancer patient advocate, healthcare policy wonk, and comedy writer, is dedicated to creating a healthcare system that serves people, not profits.

She told Healthline that the issue of trust is central to cancer patients who are in treatment.

“Trust in the clinicians making the diagnosis, trust in the treatment plan proposed, trust in the science and statistical modeling that predicts outcome,” she said.

“Good science can save lives. Fakery ruins them,” she added. “To earn back trust, pharma will have to do some very public penance. I suggest they start with full transparency on all trials, and also clean house of all sales-driven decision making.”

Insys responds

It’s hard to imagine how Insys will survive as a company at this point.

But its product can and does help some people with cancer, so there could be efforts in the future to save the product, if not the company.

Insys isn’t speaking to individual media outlets.

NEW DRUG TO PROTECT INFANTS FROM WHOOPING COUGH SHOWS PROMISE

But in a statement released earlier this month, the company said it disagreed with “certain characterizations” in McCaskill’s report but agreed the “opioid epidemic must be addressed.”

In the Senate report, Insys Chief Executive Officer Saeed Motahari said the company is working to prevent the “mistakes and unacceptable actions” of the past by establishing protocols that hold employees to ethical standards.

“Insys has completely transformed its employee base over the last several years,” said Motahari, one of many new leaders at the company, which has seen more than 90 percent of its sales staff exit since 2014.

Motahari also said in the statement that the company’s former employees’ “mistakes and unacceptable actions” were not indicative of the company’s current employees.

“Over the past several years, Insys has actively taken the appropriate steps to place ethical standards of conduct and patient interests at the heart of our business decisions,” Motahari said.

She claims Madonna’s assistants owned all of the superstar’s fan mail by default as their employer “did not save, archive or store” the missives.
Instead she gave her assistants “total discretion in deciding how to dispose of the mail,” Lutz said.
“How did you … come into possession of the Tupac letter?” Madonna’s attorney, Brendan O’Rourke, asked Lutz at the deposition.
“Is it your testimony that the Tupac letter was in some pile of fan mail?” O’Rourke asked.","The Queen of Pop doesn’t care about her fans, a former pal reveals in a startling, sworn deposition.

“Madonna didn’t handle her fan mail. She didn’t care,” the ex-friend, Darlene Lutz, said in a Sept. 27 legal grilling about her attempt to auction off the Material Girl’s memorabilia.

Lutz and Madonna had “a longstanding and extremely close personal and professional relationship,” the singer’s lawyer writes in a new Manhattan Supreme Court filing.

“I trusted her not only as a friend but also as someone who assisted me with private matters, including packing up my personal belongings in my residences,” Madonna says in an accompanying affidavit filed in the case late Friday.

The two had a falling out over a decade ago after 20 years of friendship. Now Madonna is suing Lutz for trying to sell off her “highly personal items” including a pair of worn satin panties and a love letter from the late rapper Tupac Shakur.

Lutz has suggested that Madonna never opened the letter her then boyfriend sent her from jail in 1995, less than a year before he was gunned down in a drive-by shooting.

She claims Madonna’s assistants owned all of the superstar’s fan mail by default as their employer “did not save, archive or store” the missives.

Instead she gave her assistants “total discretion in deciding how to dispose of the mail,” Lutz said.

“How did you … come into possession of the Tupac letter?” Madonna’s attorney, Brendan O’Rourke, asked Lutz at the deposition.

“You’re trying to distinguish between a personal letter or fan mail. And if you put two envelopes in front of you, one from a fan and one personal, and they looked exactly the same, what distinguishes that from fan mail,” Lutz said.

“The point is that Madonna didn’t handle her fan mail. She didn’t care,” she said.

“Is it your testimony that the Tupac letter was in some pile of fan mail?” O’Rourke asked.

“Yes,” Lutz answered.

The Manhattan resident didn’t realize she had the letter until 2008, when she started archiving materials in a bunch of boxes in her Manhattan loft.

“When you finally read the Tupac letter in 2008 or 2009, did it not ring any alarm bells in your head that maybe it was not intended to be given to you?” O’Rourke asked.

“I didn’t consider that,” Lutz replied.

Madonna first learned Lutz had the letter when she consigned it to the online auctioneer Gotta Have it! Collectibles last summer.

She insists she opened it when the rapper sent it to her in 1995.

“I have a specific memory of receiving that letter because I had a close personal relationship with Tupac Shakur and I specifically remember receiving a phone call from him while he was in jail,” Madonna said in the affidavit.

“I also have a specific memory of reading the letter. In particular, I remember that he apologized to me. I never gave this letter away,” she said.

“It is intensely personal,” she added.

The note is a breakup letter that begins, “First and foremost, I must apologize to you because like you said, I haven’t been the kind of friend I know I am capable of being.”

Shakur then explains that he’s ending their relationship because of race.

“For you to be seen with a Black man wouldn’t in any way jeopardize your career, if anything it would make you seem that much more open and exciting. But for me, at least in my previous perception, I felt due to my ‘image’ i would be letting down half of the people who made me what I was.”

The minimum bid for the letter was $100,000. It was yanked from the July auction after a judge put the sale on hold following the end of the case.

""I felt like death,"" Kaheel said, her voice strained. ""Thank god I survived the (delivery), but my diarrhea hasn't stopped.""

The Red Cross has warned that cholera, a diarrheal disease that has been eradicated in most developed countries, could infect a million people in Yemen by the end of the year.

Two and a half years of war have sapped Yemen of the money and medical facilities it needs to battle the contagion, to which aid agencies and medics say the poor, the starving, the pregnant and the young are most vulnerable.

The cholera ward is full of children - some writhing in agony, others eerily still. The blanket over one boy too weak to move rises and falls with his shallow breathing.

Save the Children said in August that children under 15 represent nearly half of new cases and a third of deaths, with malnourished children more than six times more likely to die of cholera than well-fed ones.

Millions of Yemenis are struggling to find food and the baking desert plains around Hodeidah are hotspots both of hunger and sickness.

Yemen's war pits the armed Houthi movement against the internationally recognized government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, which is backed by a Saudi-led coalition that has launched thousands of air strikes to restore him to power.

At least 10,000 people have been killed in the conflict.

The country's health sector has been badly battered while a struggle over the central bank has left public sector salaries for doctors and sanitation workers unpaid.

Soumaya Beltifa, spokesperson for the Red Cross in Sanaa, warned that a lack of funds and health personnel were blunting efforts to eradicate the disease, making it unlikely Yemen would be healthy again soon.

In the subsequent photos of the First Couple that emerged, one detail stood out to many Twitter users: the Manolo Blahnik stilettos Melania wore. People started criticizing the First Lady for her footwear choice, calling it insensitive and accusing her of caring more about her public image than actually helping the people affected by the hurricane. Now, in a clip from an interview with former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee airing on Saturday, Trump is defending the First Lady's footwear choice.

A few weeks after the photos of Melania in her very high heels circulated the Internet, Blahnik himself spoke up in favor of the First Lady. ""I don't think she's insensitive,"" he told Harper's Bazaar. ""I think she's working nonstop to make it work—possibly she was just wearing the shoes she left New York in. Yes, I think probably she could have worn Hunter boots, but she was wearing what she was wearing.""

Back to Friday: when Huckabee asked Trump about Melania's high approval ratings, the president went on to brag about his wife and how much she loves to help other people. He also pointed out that she's taken on a lot of criticism. ""She goes and wants to look—out of respect for the White House—wants to look good leaving the front entrance to the White House. So she dresses up, she puts on formal shoes—high heels—and she leaves the White House going to Texas,"" he explained. Apparently, at the time she had sneakers with her so she could change into safer footwear when it was time to walk through the aftermath of the hurricane.

Trump goes on to mention that despite the flak his wife received, many of his supporters brought signs to a speech he gave that said they love Melania's stilettos.

This isn't the first time the First Lady has been dragged because of her fashion choices. Recently she wore a $2,950 Delpozo dress when giving a speech addressing child hunger. Days after, she wore a somewhat impractical $1,380 Balmain shirt while gardening with the Boys and Girls Club of Greater Washington. And of course there was the time Donald Trump tweeted about the importance of American labor with a photo of his wife wearing an Italian-made dress.

Feinstein, the oldest U.S. senator, was first elected to the chamber in 1992, in a special election. She would be 91 if she was re-elected in November 2018 and served the full six-year term.

Feinstein was mayor of San Francisco in the late 1970s after the assassination of Mayor George Moscone and Councilman Harvey Milk.

Progressives are purportedly frustrated enough about her views on President Trump, DACA and single-payer health care to mount a challenge for her seat.

She upset them last month when the Trump administration announced the dismantling of DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era executive order that protects young illegal immigrants from deportation.

Feinstein said she supports DACA, but acknowledged the administration’s argument that the order is on shaky legal ground.

Her analysis came several days after being criticized at a town hall meeting in San Francisco for expressing optimism about Trump becoming ""a good president.” The remark resulted in so much Democratic backlash that she issued a clarification about being “under no illusion” about Trump.

California Democrats until recently appeared on a nearly endless wait to rise in political circles -- with Feinstein and fellow Democrat Barbara Boxer as the state’s long-standing U.S. senators and fellow party member Jerry Brown serving four straight terms as governor.

However, Boxer’s retirement allowed former state Attorney General Kamala Harris last year to win that Senate seat. And Brown leaves in January after his fourth, and final, term.

Feinstein also has continuously expressed reservations about the so-called single-payer health care plan championed by many progressives, including Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, a 2016 Democratic presidential candidate and a potential 2020 challenger.

As bullets began flying into a crowd of country music fans, a pack of 300-plus people ran about a mile to the Las Vegas airport, where they kicked down chain-link fences, hobbled over razor wire and were briefly mistaken by security officials for being attackers instead of shooting victims.

Once they pushed past the fence at McCarran International Airport, some of them ran onto the tarmac as helicopters beamed searchlights toward people they assumed were intruders.

Airport authorities found people who were shot, bloodied and hysterical. Officials immediately halted air traffic, diverted two dozen flights to Phoenix and other cities and shut off some runway lights.

""I'm thinking to myself, I don't know if the airport police know what's going on yet,"" said Mark Gay, who was near the front of the crowd as it ran to the airport. ""We were running, running out of the dark. If the cops were on that side, they don't know who we are. So it was: 'Put your arms out when you're coming in.'""

The large-scale airport breach highlighted the chaos that ensued after gunman Stephen Paddock opened fire on Oct. 1 from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay casino-hotel on a country music festival down below, killing 58 people and wounding hundreds. The breach also raised questions about the security of the McCarran International's perimeter as people were able to barge their way through the fences of one of the nation's busiest airports.

""I don't know that we ran across any breach that was comparable to this,"" said Jenny Grover of the Government Accountability Office, which audits the Transportation Security Administration and reviews the agency's security data. ""Because of the uniqueness of the situation, I'm not really sure when it changed from a breach to a relief effort.""

McCarran has had a large number of perimeter breaches in recent years. An Associated Press investigation found that McCarran had 30 known perimeter security breaches between 2004 and 2016, making it the second-most breached major airport in the country by AP's count.

Unlike other cities where the airport is on the outskirts, McCarran is located in the heart of Las Vegas. It's only a few hundred feet from Las Vegas Strip properties like the Mandalay Bay and Luxor.

In the chaos of the massacre, some panicked concert-goers headed to the airport in the belief that it provided the best opportunity for safety, even if they had to force their way through the perimeter. At the time of the shooting, rumors were flying around about active shooters and bomb threats at a number of Las Vegas casinos, so they chose to get to the airport.

""We were making the decision — we're headed to the airport. The airport seems like the most secure, safe place,"" said Fred Rowbotham, an off-duty police officer from the San Diego area who was in the crowd that went to McCarran.

As it became clear that the crowd on the McCarran tarmac was fleeing gunfire, the airport repositioned workers to help with the evacuation and shepherded hundreds of the victims into secure facilities. For hours, they tended to the wounded and offered food, water, blankets, phone chargers and reassurance. Airport shuttle buses later took them to a central evacuation center.

Allegiant Airlines said it sheltered more than 30 people who found themselves at the airline's 24-hour maintenance facility.

""A lot of them had torn clothing, cuts and bruises,"" airline spokeswoman Hilarie Grey said. ""We were able to provide plug-ins to charge their phones, help them contact their families and just provide a safe space for a group of people who were really frightened.""

Signature Flight Support, which caters to private planes, sheltered more than 130 people that night, some of them with gunshot wounds.

""A lot of them didn't know if they were still safe. They didn't know where they were going to go, and a lot of them were visitors who didn't know how to get to their hotels,"" said Rita Carrillo, the company's area general manager.

As concert-goers fled to McCarran and other locations on the Las Vegas Strip, controllers continued to warn pilots that the confusion on the runways caused by the shooting may affect arriving and departing flights.

""There is some personnel on one of the upper levels of the Mandalay Bay, so departing might be a bit dangerous,"" a controller told pilots, according to a recording posted by LiveATC.net. ""We may not be landing any more here for the next few hours.""

Reflecting how quickly the situation was changing, a WestJet flight that had been given permission to land was later ordered not to touch down.

""Actually, you know what? Continue the approach, but I don't want you landing. There's a situation on the runway,"" the controller said.

McCarran officials insist there wasn't a problem with security on Oct. 1 because in the end, the fleeing concert-goers were helped and the airport was never in danger.

""At the end of it, the security plan worked. Security is multiple layers, with one layer being breached, the next layers kicked in. For our purposes, the airport was secure,"" said Christine Crews, an airport spokeswoman.

As for Gay, the 53-year-old Anaheim, California, man somehow managed to keep his cowboy hat and flip-flops on during the race to the airport with the others, including his girlfriend and a pregnant woman.

""We're still trying to remember how many fences we actually knocked down,"" he said.

In a note obtained by MacRumors, Kuo relays that the vaunted iPhone ""supercycle"" won't happen in 2017 as it will take Apple some time to really ramp up production to meet what will likely be staggering demand.

The good news, though, is that Apple has reportedly addressed any lingering production issues relating to the iPhone X's TrueDepth camera system. Recall, Apple reportedly encountered some speed bumps with the TrueDepth camera due to the complexity of the components involved. With that issue seemingly resolved, Kuo anticipates that Apple in 2018 will ship anywhere from 245 -- 250 million iPhone units, a marked increase from the approximately 220 million iPhone units Kuo believes Apple will sell this year.

In the interim, iPhone sales are still going strong, relatively speaking. Though a dip in iPhone sales is to be expected given the mass of users who are holding out for the iPhone X, Kuo writes that demand for the iPhone 8 Plus has been higher than anticipated. So while some analysts have pointed to weak iPhone 8 sales as a sign of weakness, Kuo maintains that overall iPhone 8 demand is where it should be given the looming launch of the iPhone X.

Kuo's note reads in part:

The market generally refers to 2017 as the super cycle of the iPhone, but we think the real super cycle will be in 2018 for the following reasons: (1) TrueDepth Camera's production issues will be significantly addressed in 2018F; (2) new models launched in 2018F will enjoy a longer sales period than those unveiled in 2017; and (3) the product mix, specifications and designs of new iPhone models from 2018F will be more competitive.

Once mass production begins and Apple starts getting the iPhone X into hands of customers, it will be interesting to see if the controversy surrounding Face ID and the device's controversial notch design will wither away. Arguably, the iPhone X is Apple's riskiest iPhone design to date because it remains to be seen if Face ID is actually as seamless a replacement for Touch ID as Apple claims. Additionally, the 'embrace the notch' philosophy advocated by Apple has, understandably, rubbed some people the wrong way, with some folks going so far as to categorize the device as a huge missed opportunity for Apple.

The company is considering the possibility of testing the drug for prevention or treatment of whooping cough.","A potential new drug might protect infants from whooping cough in their first few months of life, before they can be vaccinated, early research suggests.

In a new study, researchers gave this drug to baboons just after they were born, and found that the drug protected the animals when they were subsequently infected with the bacteria that cause whooping cough.

The study was presented here Thursday (Oct. 5) at an infectious disease conference called IDWeek 2017.

SURGEONS REMOVE RECORD-BREAKING TUMOR FROM PATIENT'S KIDNEY

Human infants are most vulnerable to whooping cough during their first two months of life — when they are too young to get the whooping cough vaccine. (Babies' immune systems are not mature enough to respond to the whooping cough vaccine until they are 2 months old.) For this reason, women are advised to get the whooping cough vaccine, called Tdap, during pregnancy, so that they can pass protective antibodies to the fetus before birth, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

But not all pregnant mothers get the whooping cough vaccine — among U.S. women who gave birth between fall 2015 and spring 2016, less than half (49 percent) received the recommended vaccine, according to the CDC.

""It's hard to get 100 percent of all mothers vaccinated,"" said Jennifer Maynard, an associate professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin, and lead author of the new study.

A potential solution to this problem would be to give infants a drug as soon as they are born that would protect them against whooping cough.

HERE'S HOW TO TALK TO YOUR KIDS ABOUT OPIOIDS

Maynard and her colleagues investigated such a drug in their study. The drug contains an antibody — an immune system protein that binds to harmful pathogens to stop infection. In this case, the antibody, called hu1B7, binds to the toxin produced by whooping cough bacteria and renders the toxin harmless.

""It's essentially giving you instant immunity, as if the baby has been fully vaccinated,"" Maynard told Live Science.

In the new study, the researchers gave hu1B7 to seven baboons a few days after they were born, and compared them with another seven baboons who did not receive hu1B7. When the animals were later infected with whooping cough bacteria, called Bordetella pertussis, all of the baboons that received hu1B7 appeared normal, and didn't develop any symptoms of whooping cough. In contrast, the baboons that did not receive hu1B7 got sick, and four had to be euthanized, Maynard said.

The study was funded in part by Synthetic Biologics, a biotechnology company that is developing the drug with hu1B7. The study was also funded by The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the U.S. National Institutes of Health.

Unlike a vaccine, hu1B7 antibodies don't provide long-term protection — the antibodies are degraded and cleared from the body after a limited amount of time, Maynard said. The hu1B7 drug has a ""half life"" of about 25 days in people, meaning that about half of the drug is cleared from the body in that time. But Maynard and colleagues have engineered a slightly different version of hu1B7 that doesn't degrade as quickly. Based on their animal studies, the researchers hypothesize that this altered version of hu1B7 would have a half life in people of 80 to 100 days.

If this turns out to be true, ""then you could give one dose and it could really protect [infants] for that whole period during which babies are most susceptible,"" Maynard said.

The next step is to conduct a trial in humans to see if the findings from the animal studies hold true in people. Synthetic Biologics has an ""orphan drug"" designation for its drug, which allows the company to move forward more quickly with a human trial, Maynard said.

An earlier study by Synthetic Biologics also found that hu1B7, combined with a second antibody called hu11E6, was effective at treating Bordetella pertussis infection in baboons. The company is considering the possibility of testing the drug for prevention or treatment of whooping cough.

She barely even acknowledged me when I greeted her. Then one day, everything changed.

The coworker, whom I’ll call Carrie, dropped by my office and asked for advice about how to deal with her supervisor. I appreciated the fact that Carrie trusted my advice, but I was uncomfortable with the conversation. She seemed to be gossiping more than trying to fix the problem, so I tried to turn the conversation to a more positive direction.

“That sounds frustrating, but you can’t fix your supervisor,” I said. “The only person you can work on is you. If you spend your energy trying to fix someone you can’t control, you’re just going to feel frustrated and helpless.”

She laughed and said, “You remind me of Joel Osteen.”

As we fix our thoughts on the true, honorable, right, pure, lovely and admirable things in the people around us, we’ll find less pleasure in sharing their weaknesses with others. We'll also be less interested in hearing other people spew negativity about others.

I repeated my advice with my best twangy Osteen impression and wrapped up the conversation, sincerely hoping she might actually change her behavior. She didn’t.

When Carrie would see me, she always found a way to make the conversation about her supervisor. I would give a similar motivational talk and redirect the conversation, but it never seemed to work. It became apparent that gossiping about her supervisor was how Carrie connected to other people. And I decided I wasn’t going to be one of those people anymore.

The next time Carrie tried to strike up a gossipy conversation about her supervisor, I was more direct.

“I understand that you’re frustrated with your supervisor, but if you aren’t careful, it will be the only way you can connect with people at work,” I said. “You’ll basically be using people to listen to you vent about your supervisor.”

Carrie looked visibly uncomfortable, abruptly ended the conversation and totally avoided me after that. Even when I would speak in the hallway, she would mumble an unintelligible response and look past me.

We had no relationship unless I was willing to listen to her vent. We couldn’t be friends unless we shared a common enemy. In other words, we weren’t really friends.

My relationship with Carrie was based on emotional triangulation, something Edwin Friedman warns against in his book, “Failure of Nerve.” The common denominator in all triangulated relationships is that there’s some negative third pillar – some frustration or offense – that keeps the relationship together. And it happens more easily than we realize.

We find ourselves always venting about the same subject to a friend. We repeatedly share “prayer requests” that are really passive-aggressive ways of gossiping. It’s cowardly. We can’t deal with our own problems so we find other people who will take on our anxieties and offenses.

There’s nothing wrong with being transparent about our struggles when we talk with friends, but we just need to make sure it’s not the only thing we’re talking about. We’ve got to redirect ourselves and “[f]ix our thoughts on what is true, and honorable, and right, and pure, and lovely, and admirable. Think about things that are excellent and worthy of praise” (Philippians 4:8).

As we fix our thoughts on the true, honorable, right, pure, lovely and admirable things in the people around us, we’ll find less pleasure in sharing their weaknesses with others. We'll also be less interested in hearing other people spew negativity about others.

Breaking down triangulated relationships takes hard work. It requires us to find new ways to connect with others, and it might mean that we lose friendships that can't survive without the negativity to keep it going. Even so, we’ll gain the respect of real friends who will probably be grateful to have a relationship that’s based on something more than shared offenses.",The incredible reason my coworker stopped talking to me,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/08/incredible-reason-my-coworker-stopped-talking-to-me.html

Converting VHS tapes

Q: My son is getting married, and I’d like to make a video using his childhood VHS tapes. Help! The wedding is in two months!

A: If you have a massive library of VHS tapes, you can buy a converter. But if you're looking to transfer a few tapes, the most cost-effective solution is to use a service. The process can be pricy; each DVD can hold up to two hours, so you want to make sure you're watching the length of your home movies.

Cut prescription costs

Q: My prescription drug costs are so high. Do the websites that promise you lower costs deliver?

A: This is such a vital question, and it’s likely to become even more pressing in the coming years.

Android Oreo vs. iOS 11

Q: How does the new Android operating system compare with Apple iOS 11? Are they just the same pig with different lipstick?

A: Wouldn't it be great if you could open two applications at the same time on your smartphone? Until now, this hasn't been very practical. But larger screens and increased reliance on our pocket-sized gadgets have made this kind of multitasking more attractive. For the most part, these two operating systems are very similar to each other, and each is very much in keeping with the traditions of its brand. But this new feature, known as “Picture-in-Picture,” is a pretty significant leap, and only one of these two operating systems has it. Can you guess which? Click here for a comparison of Android Oreo and iOS 11.

Buying used smartphones

Q: I’d like to save money and buy a used smartphone. I’m afraid of getting a bad phone. Any pointers?

A: You are wise to be cautious, and for two big reasons. First, there might be damage that isn’t obvious when you pick it up, or the software might not run as smoothly as you’d hoped. I have a friend who bought a used iPhone that worked great, except for a fuzzy camera lens that made it unusable for taking photos. Second, buying a used phone can be a security risk, especially if the vendor is crooked and has installed spyware. Certain phones are extremely susceptible to this, especially when they change hands. I recommend refurbished phones, which are usually less expensive and work great, but if you’re dead set on buying a secondhand phone, there are ways to avoid getting swindled.

""I know this, we cannot ... in the NFL in any way give the implication that we tolerate disrespecting the flag,"" he said following the Cowboys’ 35-31 loss to the Green Bay Packers.

Identifying quality wood furniture can be difficult these days. Many pieces look great in the store, only to prove flimsy once you get them home and start to use them. Here’s what to look for, and what to avoid, when shopping for your next piece of wood furniture.

When made with high-quality materials and solid construction, wood furniture can last for decades and sometimes even centuries. But not everything you see in stores is built to last. Buy something that’s made poorly and you’ll start to see wear and tear way too soon. How can you tell the difference? It’s harder than you might think. The first thing to pay attention to is the wood itself.

Solid wood. The highest-quality material for wood furniture is solid wood. This type of furniture will be made from single pieces of wood or wood boards that are glued together to make panels — trees are only so wide, after all. If something is described as being made with solid wood, find out if that describes the entire piece or just certain parts.

Hardwood. Solid wood can be categorized as either hardwood or softwood. Hardwood comes from slower-growing trees and the wood is denser and more resistant to dings. Common hardwoods include oak, ash, walnut, cherry and maple.

Softwood. Softwood comes from faster-growing trees and the wood is less dense. Some common softwoods are pine, fir and poplar. Since these trees grow faster, furniture made using their wood tends to be less expensive than pieces made from hardwood.

Domestic wood. Domestic wood comes from trees that are grown and processed in the United States. Common domestic wood species include oak, maple, cherry, walnut, ash, poplar and pine.

A quick note about how wood is described: The species can describe either the material or the stain color. So something described as walnut might be stained that color but actually be made from pine. This isn’t necessarily bad — just make sure you know what you’re getting. You shouldn’t be paying walnut prices for a piece of furniture made from less-expensive wood.

Imported wood. A lot of imported furniture is made from tropical wood species such as rubberwood (sometimes known as plantation hardwood), mango, acacia or sheesham (a type of rosewood). These species can produce a sturdy piece of furniture, but they may be susceptible to cracking if they’re coming from a humid environment to a drier one.

Benefits of solid wood. Ensuring that your furniture is 100 percent solid wood is a pretty fail-safe way to know that you’re purchasing something high-quality. Solid wood construction is extremely long-lasting and can be easily refinished and repaired down the road.

Cons of solid wood. Solid wood is definitely the best choice for furniture but, as with any natural material, there can be downsides. Solid wood is more susceptible to changes in climate, which may cause it to crack or warp. It’s also more expensive than furniture made from engineered wood products.

Plywood. Plywood (sometimes called engineered hardwood) is made by gluing together thin layers of solid wood. When used in furniture construction, plywood is covered with a thin layer of stained and finished wood — a veneer.

Pros of plywood. The main benefit of plywood is that it’s stable when the climate changes and is less likely to warp or crack in dry climates. It can also give you a sturdy piece of furniture at a lower cost than solid wood.

Cons of plywood. Sometimes the quality of plywood comes down to the quality of the veneer. Poor-quality veneers can chip, revealing the lower-quality wood underneath. Damage may also be difficult to repair since the bulk of the furniture is made using a different wood species than the veneer. Also, some plywood is made using chemicals with formaldehyde, which can affect indoor air quality, although formaldehyde-free plywood is available.

MDF. Medium-density fiberboard is made from wood waste products (basically sawdust) that have been mixed with resins. The mixture is compressed to create large, flat boards. For furniture, MDF is finished with a layer of real-wood veneer or non-wood laminate.

Pros and cons of MDF. There are more cons than pros when you’re talking about MDF furniture. Pieces made from it are less expensive than those made of solid wood or plywood, which makes them budget-friendly. However, MDF requires a lot of chemicals to make and is the highest-formaldehyde-emitting wood product out there. Other downsides: It can easily be damaged by water, it’s difficult to repair, it doesn’t hold screws very well and it’s heavy.

Particle board. Made similarly to MDF, particle board uses larger wood scraps to create boards. You can differentiate particle board from MDF by spotting the pockets of air when looking at it from the side.

Pros and cons of particle board. The one thing particle board has going for it is that it’s inexpensive. And then there are the downsides: It emits formaldehyde, requires a lot of chemicals to produce, is susceptible to moisture damage and really doesn’t hold screws well. Particle board furniture tends to loosen up quickly, resulting in wobbles.

Veneers. A veneer is a thin sheet of real wood that is applied to the outside of a piece of wood furniture. It can be added to any of the wood products mentioned above. Veneers are used when you want to match up wood grain to create a design, or to cover a lower-cost piece of furniture.

Selecting veneered furniture. Veneer quality varies widely. Look for those that are thicker, have good adhesion and are glued to solid wood or plywood as opposed to MDF or particle board. Poorly done veneers can peel and chip.

A crazed gunman took the lives of at least 59 people and injured more than 500 innocent country music fans at the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas on Sunday night.

The tight-knit country music community immediately came together to commemorate those who were murdered and to stand behind the victims and their families.

Some of the industry's biggest stars like Keith Urban and Vince Gill performed at a vigil hosted by the Nashville Convention & Visitors Corp and the Country Music Association drawing a reported crowd of 600 people on Monday night.

Urban serenaded the audience with Simon & Garfunkel's ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" after recalling his 9-year-old daughter asking him if he knew any of the victims.

""[Fans are] like family,"" Urban said at the vigil. ""It's the one thing about country music. It is a community. I do know those people. It just hit me.""

Nashville Mayor Megan Barry said at the emotional event, ""Love is the answer and the only thing we know.""

Country singer Lee Brice, who performed at the Route 91 Harvest Festival two nights before the deadly shooting, told Fox News he feels ""attacked by an enemy.""

""I feel like the fans are probably reacting for the most part like I’m reacting,"" Brice told us. ""They feel the same way – they feel like they’re being attacked by an enemy but they’re not going to let that enemy win. The enemy is hate.""

Pruitt made the announcement at an event in Hazard, Ky., casting the previous policy as unfair.

“That rule really was about picking winners and losers,” Pruitt said. “The past administration was unapologetic, they were using every bit of power, authority to use the EPA to pick winners and losers on how we pick electricity in this country. That is wrong.”

He said that on Tuesday, he will sign a proposed rule to formally withdraw from the plan.

“It is right for this administration to say the war is over,"" Pruitt said.

The decision comes after President Trump in late March ordered a review of the controversial program, which was put on hold more than a year ago by the Supreme Court amid legal challenges from, among others, Pruitt himself.

The Clean Power Plan aimed to reduce carbon emissions from coal-burning power plants by having states meet certain targets. Supporters see the plan as a critical plank in efforts to curb global warming, but critics contend it would kill thousands of jobs and take direct aim at the struggling coal sector.

The move to officially nix the program was expected, following Trump's vow to end what he calls the ""war on coal."" Pruitt, however, can likely expect a new wave of litigation from the other side of the debate, as environmentalist groups and allied Democrats are sure to challenge the rollback.

The Clean Power Plan is hardly the only Obama policy being challenged or reversed by Trump. Just last Friday, the Department of Health and Human Services rolled back much of the ObamaCare requirement that employers provide contraceptive coverage.

With all that, there are reasons to celebrate Columbus Day.
And, while we celebrate Columbus Day, we can learn from history and also take time to honor Native Americans.
Once we do this, Columbus Day can be a truly inclusive holiday.","Columbus Day, the second Monday in October, is a nationally recognized holiday.

But it’s not recognized in Los Angeles, where I live. The City Council recently voted to get rid of Columbus Day and replace it with Indigenous Peoples’ Day, commemorating “indigenous, aboriginal and native people.”

This movement sees Columbus as a symbol of destruction, and thus not to be celebrated.

This new day was first adopted in Berkeley, California in 1992. Since then, it’s spread across the nation with increasing speed, as more than 60 cities from Maine to Washington have supported the idea.

While there is plenty to criticize about Columbus, and what followed his arrival, I think this movement is missing the point.

History, in fact, is the story of conquest. We may not like it, but it’s our shared heritage. Not just Europeans, but everyone. The point is not to excuse the worst that happened, but to understand it.

It is true that the conquest of the Americas by Europeans, which starts with Columbus, was very ugly, and involved a lot of violence. But that, for better or worse, is how history worked pretty much everywhere for thousands of years. (Though it should be noted a large portion of the deaths of Native Americans was due to disease, not violence--an inevitable consequence of Old World illness in New World soil. Europe, Asia and Africa, of course, suffered through numerous plagues of their own.).

History, in fact, is the story of conquest. We may not like it, but it’s our shared heritage. Not just Europeans, but everyone. While there is only limited knowledge of what pre-Columbus America was like, it did feature war, slavery, torture and plenty of brutality.

The point is not to excuse the worst that happened, but to understand it. And to see that it is not the essence of Columbus, but rather part of the times. With all that, there are reasons to celebrate Columbus Day.

-- Celebrate Italians (though there is some question as to whether Columbus would have considered himself an Italian -- he was long thought to have been born in Genoa, then an independent city-state in what is now Italy, though everyone from Greece to Portugal to Poland have claimed him as their own). Nevertheless, Italians claim him today and Columbus Day is a good chance to recognize what Italians have contributed to America, and the world.

-- Celebrate the spirit of exploration. It took tremendous bravery to sail off into the unknown. One of the best parts of our humanity is that sense of discovery.

-- Celebrate the spread of Western civilization. Lately a lot of people have been putting down Western civilization, but its spread is one of the greatest things that’s ever happened to humanity.

The West has its good and bad points, but its best ideas—equal rights, freedom of religion, free speech, due process, open scientific inquiry, property rights and so on—have helped all people who adopt them. (Not that the West solely had these ideas, but it put them in a package that wasn’t generally available elsewhere.)

Indeed, the promise of the West has delivered freedom and bounty such as humanity has never known.

And, while we celebrate Columbus Day, we can learn from history and also take time to honor Native Americans. They were the original immigrants to the New World, and deserve their remembrance.

Once we do this, Columbus Day can be a truly inclusive holiday. It needn’t be a battleground, but a chance to celebrate the best within us.",Why celebrate Columbus Day? Here are a few reasons,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/09/why-celebrate-columbus-day-here-are-few-reasons.html

After contacting the Lions, Morse purchased the season tickets and decided to donate them to a different charity each week. He also wanted to let Graham know his plan to help.

“I wanted to reach out to Stacey and tell her what we were doing,” Morse said. “Let her know the tickets would go to a good cause and that out of all this bad stuff, some good can come out as well.”

Stacey Graham was overwhelmed by his act of kindness.

“Tears of joy, tears of joy when I found out he purchased the tickets, and is giving them away to charity,” Graham said.

Graham contacted Morse to thank him for his kind actions and invite him to her tailgate. The two fans connected before the game to share team spirit and positivity. They were thrilled to see something so hurtful and negative become something so good.

“This is incredible,” Graham said. “You can give back love, and tolerance is really what it is really all about. So I probably will never get an apology, but this is awesome.”

A night shift manager at a Bronx McDonald’s was dishing up more than ​burgers and ​fries — he was busted for ​offering a side of cocaine in his Happy Meals.​

Authorities caught Frank Guerrero, 26, red-handed during a three-month undercover investigation dubbed “Operation Off the Menu,” according to the city’s Special Narcotics Prosecutor Bridget G. Brennan.

“The conduct was so blatant it would be comical if he weren’t committing a serious narcotics crime,” Brennan said. “Ordering coke took on an entirely different meaning on the night shift at this McDonald’s.”

Guerrero allegedly sold cops $10,900 worth of cocaine in eight separate sales out of the franchise at 1600 Bruckner Boulevard in the Soundview section of the Bronx.

Although the eatery only took late-night orders through the drive-through window, Guerrero allowed his drug customers to enter the main restaurant, officials said.

In one sale to an undercover at the counter, he allegedly concealed cocaine in a cookie bag, which he placed inside a larger McDonald’s order of two cheeseburgers, a soda and fries, authorities said. Other employees were milling about nearby.

On another occasion, Guerrero allegedly took a break from flipping burgers to sell $6,250 worth of cocaine to an undercover inside the fast-food chain’s public bathroom.

He had allegedly stashed the drugs inside the restroom’s soap dispenser earlier that day, officials said. The undercover then sat at a booth and ate a McDonald’s meal personally delivered by Guerrero.

Five other sales were conducted in the McDonald’s parking lot. Police surveillance allegedly revealed that Guerrero regularly sold cocaine to buyers during his shift.

Authorities executed a search warrant on his home in the Pelham section of the Bronx, where they allegedly seized 200 grams of cocaine and $5,300 in cash. Leidy Cabral Castillo and her 2-year-old child were inside the apartment at the time.

Guerrero, who had worked at McDonald’s for eight years, was arrested Wednesday at 5 a.m. while wrapping up his shift.

Guerrero and Cabral Castillo are expected to be arraigned tonight in Manhattan Criminal Court on multiple counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance and unlawfully dealing with a child. He also faces numerous counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance.

The change announced Thursday affects most of Netflix's 53 million U.S. subscribers.

WHAT GOES UP

Netflix will now charge $11 per month instead of $10 for a plan that includes HD and allows up people to simultaneously watch programs on two different internet-connected devices.

The price for another plan that includes ultra-high definition, or 4K, video, is going up by 17 percent, to $14 from $12 a month. A plan that limits subscribers to one screen at a time without high-definition will remain at $8 a month.

The increase would be the first in two years for Netflix, although it won't seem that way for millions of subscribers. That's because Netflix temporarily froze its rates for long-time subscribers the last two times it raised its prices, delaying the most recent increases until the second half of last year for them.

Netflix isn't giving anyone a break this time around. It will start emailing notifications about the new prices to affected subscribers Oct. 19, giving them 30 days to accept the higher rates, switch to a cheaper plan or cancel the service.

WHY PRICES ARE RISING

The price increase are being driven by Netflix's desire to fatten its profit margins as it spends more money to finance a critically acclaimed slate of original programming that includes shows such as ""House of Cards,"" ''Orange Is The New Black,"" ''Stranger Things,"" and ""The Crown.""

Those series' success helped Netflix land more Emmy award nominations than any TV network besides HBO this year. It's also the main reason Netflix's U.S. audience has nearly doubled since the February 2013 debut of ""House of Cards"" kicked off its expansion into original programming.

But paying for exclusive TV series and films hasn't been cheap. Netflix expects to spend $6 billion a year alone on programming this year, and the expenses are likely to rise as it competes against streaming rivals such as Amazon, Hulu, YouTube and, potentially, Apple for the rights to future shows and movies.

Both Amazon (at $99 per year, or about $8.25 per month) and Hulu ($10 per month) now offer lower prices than Netflix.

POSSIBILITY OF BACKLASH

Netflix believes its price rate is justified by recent service improvements, such as a feature that allows people to download shows onto phones or other devices to watch them offline.

But Netflix subscribers have rebelled against price increases in the past, most notably in 2011 when the company stopped bundling its streaming service with its DVD-by-mail service, resulting in price increases of as much as 60 percent for customers who wanted both plans. Netflix lost 600,000 subscribers and its stock price plummeted by 80 percent in the subsequent backlash. The company rebounded strongly, though, propelling its stock from a split-adjusted low of $7.54 in 2012 to about $184 now.

And Netflix blamed a temporary slowdown in subscriber growth last year on the lifting of its price freeze on long-time customers who decided to drop the service rather than pay slightly more money.

Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Wedbush believes less than 10 percent of current subscribers will cancel Netflix as price rise again, but he predicts it will be tougher to attract new customers who will choose cheaper alternatives from Amazon or Hulu.",Netflix raising prices in the U.S. for the first time in two years,http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/05/netflix-raising-prices-in-u-s-for-first-time-in-two-years.html

Baltimore County Police told FOX 45 Baltimore that Leverne Doran, 68, was arrested Thursday after the attempt to stop the bus.

After a student reportedly threw the bottle, police said Doran banged on the doors, and attempted to get inside the bus. The driver would not open the door, he said, because he was in fear for the safety of the students on the bus.

After Doran was unable to get into the bus, police said he then went to the front of the bus and jumped on the hood as it moved forward -- an act captured on video by someone inside the bus.

The bus driver proceeded slowly towards a nearby police precinct, officials said.

""We happened to have an off-duty officer who was present in the area who assisted and intervened quickly. He came over, separated all of the parties, and at that time, the suspect was arrested on scene without incident,"" Baltimore County police Sgt. Andrea Bylen told WBAL-TV.

Police said at no time were children on the bus in danger, and officials are investigating to determine whether any objects were thrown out of the bus.

Doran is facing charges that include destruction of property and disturbing the peace.","Maryland man clings to school bus hood, arrested after student allegedly throws bottle",https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/09/maryland-man-clings-to-school-bus-hood-arrested-after-student-allegedly-throws-bottle.html

On a cool and rainy afternoon during the first week of classes at Centennial High School in this well-to-do Baltimore suburb, about 50 members of the boys' cross-country team sauntered across the parking lot for their after-school run.

Meanwhile, about 30 kids in helmets and pads were going through drills on the pristine artificial turf field at the school's hillside football stadium.

""It used to be the other way around,"" said Al Dodds, Centennial's cross-country coach, who has 64 boys on his team this year. ""Now, there's a small turnout in football and cross-country is huge.""

Across the athletic complex, a practice football field sat empty, even though it was recently mown and painted with yardage lines and hash marks. In years past, the junior-varsity team would have been relegated to that grass field. But on this day they had the stadium to themselves, as they will for every practice this fall. Centennial isn't fielding a varsity football team because not enough kids signed up to play.

The situation at Centennial — where a long history of losing has dampened students' enthusiasm for football — is unique to this part of central Maryland, but there are plenty of similar examples around the U.S. Participation in high school football is down 3.5 percent over the past five years, according to the annual survey by the National Association of State High School Federations, or NFHS.

The decline would be much steeper if not for a handful of states in the South and the West. Throughout the Northeast, the Midwest and the West Coast, in communities urban and rural, wealthy and working-class, fewer kids are playing football.

""I've never been interested in football,"" said 16-year-old Zach Deming, a cross-country runner at Centennial with the solid build of a defensive back. ""I'm afraid of getting hurt badly, like getting a serious concussion .""

The risks of football have never been more apparent. This summer, researchers at Boston University said they'd found evidence of a brain disease linked to repeated head blows in nearly all of the 202 former football players they studied. The athletes whose brains were donated to the study had played football in the National Football League, college and even high school.

The report doesn't confirm chronic traumatic encephalopathy, known as CTE, is common in all football players, because many donors or their families participated in the study because of the players' troubling symptoms.

After years of denials, the NFL acknowledged a link between head blows and brain disease and agreed in 2015 to a $1 billion settlement to compensate former players who had accused the league of hiding the risks.

""There's no question about it. The amount of publicity, beginning with the NFL and what you see on national news, has caused concern among parents,"" said Bob Gardner, the NFHS executive director. ""Probably some who would have been more inclined to let their young men play, maybe are making different decisions now.""

A study published last month in the medical journal Translational Psychiatry showed that kids who played football before age 12 were more than twice as likely to have mood and behavior problems.

The news hasn't escaped the parents at Centennial, one of the top-rated public high schools in Maryland, where 97 percent of students go on to college after they graduate. Just 10 percent of students qualify for free or reduced-price meals, an indicator of poverty.

""Families around here are more into academics,"" Zach said.

Maryland is one of 14 states where participation in football was down 10 percent or more over the past five years, according to NFHS data. In all, 41 states saw a decline between the 2011-12 and 2016-17 school years, and just nine states and the District of Columbia saw increases.

In West Windsor Township, New Jersey, which borders Princeton University and has a median household income of $137,000, one of the two public high schools dropped varsity football this year, and the other might have to do the same next year.

Trinity High School in Manchester, New Hampshire, also disbanded its varsity team, with hopes that it could return in a lower division next year.

At the first practice, the team ""had three seniors, one junior, 12 sophomores and one freshman,"" athletic director Chip Polak told the New Hampshire Union Leader in August. ""Two of the seniors have never played any kind of organized football and the other senior is dealing with concussion symptoms.""

In Ventura County, California, northeast of Los Angeles, Thousand Oaks High School disbanded its junior-varsity team this season because it needed sophomores and juniors to fill out the varsity roster. In Marin County, north of San Francisco, Novato High School announced that it wouldn't field a varsity team this year, but the program got a last-minute reprieve when more athletes than expected showed up for practice.

The decline in participation isn't just limited to wealthy, coastal communities. Among the states where participation is down more than 10 percent are Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Wisconsin and Illinois. Population in Illinois has also declined over that period, while in Michigan and Wisconsin it has only grown slightly.

Researchers at the University of Colorado, who studied data from the NFHS and the Census, said in an analysis published Sept. 26 that high school football participation peaked in 2009 before beginning a decline that is likely to continue.

The NFL is paying attention to the numbers and trying to find ways to get kids playing the sport.

""It is important for kids to play sports because it's healthy, it's fun, and they learn important values,"" NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said. ""Of course, we think football is the best team sport and we aim to ensure there are a range options for young players today — both tackle and flag.""

While participation in tackle football is down, flag football is becoming more popular. Participation in the NFL Flag program run by USA Football for kids ages 6-17 increased by 66 percent from 2013 to 2016, with 385,000 kids playing last year.

In high schools, the expense of the sport and increasing specialization by young athletes are also factors. And while football is declining, other sports are growing, among them soccer and lacrosse. But football is different because it remains the nation's most popular spectator sport, and schools expect to sell tickets on Friday nights.

""The key thing about football is that it's such an important part of the financial picture of schools. Some of these schools rely on the attendance in high school football to pay for these other sports,"" Gardner said. ""While we certainly applaud the growth of all sports, we remain vigilant about what's going on in football because of the economic impact.""

Around the Centennial football program, there is optimism that varsity football could return next year if the JV team can put together a reasonably competitive season. The team has a strong freshman class, some of whom have never played organized football before.

Toward the end of the 2-hour practice, coaches wanted the first-team defense to get some full-speed reps. That required some creativity.

""If you're not on first-team defense, I need 11 of you to make an offense,"" an assistant coach barked. ""I need a running back, I need a fullback, I need five linemen, I need a tight end, I need two wide receivers.

Excess space is a luxury that most of us do not enjoy while our kids are living at home. But many of my clients find that once their grown children have moved out of the house and established their own households, they suddenly have extra unused spaces. At some point, those childhood bedrooms get cleaned out and stand waiting for a fresh coat of paint and a new purpose.

If you’re lucky enough to have extra square footage in your nest, here are eight ideas for turning that space into something fit for your current lifestyle.

1. A walk-in closet and dressing room. I love the idea of transforming an extra bedroom into a beautiful walk-in closet and dressing room. Several of my clients have done this, gaining both functionality and luxury. One client was even able to connect her new dressing room to her master bath — a nice perk if your floor plan allows. Many companies specialize in custom cabinetry and closets and can help you add this extra bit of comfort to your home.

2. A home office. Some people telecommute, others finish work projects or emails after hours at home, while still others simply enjoy having a dedicated home office for paying bills and taking care of other personal business. An extra bedroom is a perfect option for a home office because the door can be closed for solitude and focus or to hide clutter. You might line closets in the room with custom shelving and cabinets. Or, if this level of construction is not in your budget, you might purchase some beautiful storage solutions at furniture stores that can help you create a good-looking and organized home office.

3. A guest bedroom. Perhaps your adult children live out of town and stay for several nights when they visit. Or maybe other friends or family members often bunk in your home. A dedicated guest room might be just what you need. To make this a relatively inexpensive project, you might repurpose some furniture from a child’s former bedroom. A fresh coat of paint, new bedding, and updated accessories may be all you need to complete its new look.

4. A craft room. If you are someone who enjoys scrapbooking, jewelry making, sewing or similar hobbies, a dedicated craft room may be exactly what you crave. Frequently, craft projects span days or even weeks, and putting supplies away in the middle of a project can be cumbersome. Even if your funds do not allow for built-ins, a large table and wall shelving can work wonders for storing and organizing craft materials.

5. A reading nook. Maybe you have been longing for a quiet, comfortable place to relax with a good book — a small spare bedroom easily could be outfitted for this purpose. You may be able to relocate a comfortable chair from elsewhere in your home. Add a good reading lamp and a small book shelf and, if you want to go further, paint the walls a new color and add accessories, artwork and throw pillows. A cozy blanket in a bright color is another inexpensive way to add style to your reading spot.

6. An exercise gym. Outfit a small extra bedroom with exercise equipment and a wall-mounted television. Watching your favorite show while working out can make the time much more pleasant — I’m speaking from experience here. Also, large wall mirrors not only make a small bedroom appear larger but can help you ensure correct form and prevent injuries.

7. A yoga or pilates studio. With an available bedroom, a quiet dedicated space for yoga or pilates may be an attainable luxury. If your space and budget allow, enhancing a new studio by adding sliding doors out to a private garden is a wonderful way to create a special place with plenty of light and fresh air. A bubbling fountain augments the mood. Painting the walls a cool, calming color such as blue or gray can also boost the tranquility.

8. A multifunctional space. If you have only one spare bedroom but a variety of needs, a Murphy bed or wall bed may be the solution for you. Multiple companies specialize in beds that fold effortlessly into an attractive wall cabinet when not needed. That way, you can use your spare room as a home office, craft space or exercise studio without a bed taking up floor space — at least not until just before your visiting children arrive.",How to make use and better your life with a spare bedroom,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/09/28/how-to-make-use-and-better-your-life-with-spare-bedroom.html

Supporters of single-payer health care should realize the error of their ways, because single-payer isn't a shortcut to universal health care.","Do people who are overweight or obese deserve health care? In the United Kingdom's socialized health care system, the answer appears to be ""no."" And if Democrats get their way, the same could be true in the United States.

To save money, the U.K. National Health Service recently announced it will ban obese patients from many surgeries for up to a year. Such rationing is standard in single-payer health care systems. Americans will face the same fate if Democrats can enact Medicare for All here.

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., recently introduced his Medicare for All bill backed by 15 other Democratic senators. His call to create such a single-payer health care system was a major part of his failed campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination last year.

Known as ""lifestyle rationing,"" the new British policy debunks the myth that single-payer systems deliver truly universal health care.

In addition, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., is urging Democrats to make single-payer a centerpiece of their upcoming campaigns.

Known as ""lifestyle rationing,"" the new British policy debunks the myth that single-payer systems deliver truly universal health care.

The rule applies to patients with a body mass index of 30 or higher. It would hit a 5-foot-10 man who weighs more than 209 pounds, or a 5-foot-4 woman who weighs more than 174 pounds. These patients will have to wait a year, or lose 10 percent of their weight, before they can receive elective surgeries like hip or knee replacements.

The National Health Service in Britain believes such discriminatory rationing is the ""best way of achieving maximum value from the limited resources available.""

Of course, overweight people aren't the only ones denied care in single-payer systems. The bureaucrats who run them have little choice but to ration care for everyone.

When patients pay virtually nothing for health care, they have little incentive to limit their consumption. If someone feels even slightly under the weather, he or she can immediately go to the doctor and demand medicine, rather than simply rest up and hydrate. So patients flood doctor's offices and hospitals.

With no market forces at work to regulate demand, the only way for the government to keep costs under control is to forcibly limit the supply of medical services.

Single-payer systems do so by offering doctors and hospitals relatively paltry sums for their services. The average general practitioner in the United Kingdom earns about $130,000 per year. By contrast, a general practitioner in America earns over $200,000 annually, on average.

This combination of lower pay and seemingly limitless demand for care is causing many British doctors to leave the medical field – or go elsewhere to practice. There are 7,000 fewer doctors in the United Kingdom today than in 2005. In just the first month of this year, nearly 300 doctors applied for certificates to work overseas.

In addition, fewer medical students are completing their educations. In 2016, half of junior doctors left the National Health Service after their first two years of training. That is an abrupt increase from 2011, when less than three in ten junior doctors exited.

As a result, the National Health Service is in the midst of an unprecedented staffing shortage. More than 30,600 positions are currently vacant. Almost 40 percent of those openings are for nurses and midwives.

So patients wait. More than 4 million are standing by for surgery – the highest figure in a decade.

The single-payer system in Canada is hardly better, particularly for patients seeking specialist care. According to the Fraser Institute, the median wait time between referral from a general practitioner and treatment by a specialist in 2016 was 20 weeks – the longest on record.

America's own experiment with single-payer – the Veterans Health Administration in the Department of Veterans Affairs – is a national embarrassment. A federal investigation found that more than 200 veterans died while waiting for care at a Phoenix VA facility in 2015. The same is true of almost 100 veterans at a Los Angeles VA hospital between October 2014 and August 2015.

These horror stories are worth remembering now that the apparent failure of the GOP's health care reform effort has revived calls for single-payer in the United States.

Some U.S. doctors appear to be falling in line behind liberal icons Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. According to a new survey from Merritt Hawkins, a physician recruiting firm, 42 percent of doctors strongly support single-payer. Fourteen percent are somewhat supportive.

Supporters of single-payer health care should realize the error of their ways, because single-payer isn't a shortcut to universal health care. As the experiences of other countries prove, it's a pathway to grotesque rationing, long waiting lines and needless suffering.","Single-payer health care means you might be denied surgery for being too fat -- no, really",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/08/single-payer-health-care-means-might-be-denied-surgery-for-being-too-fat-no-really.html

FNC Leads Cable News Industry with More Women in Anchor/Host Roles Across Daytime and Primetime Programming

NEW YORK — OCTOBER 4, 2017 — FOX News Channel (FNC) is expanding the FOX & Friends franchise by one hour, announced Suzanne Scott, president of programming for FNC. Beginning October 9th, FOX & Friends FIRST will be presented from 4-6AM/ET and FOX & Friends will continue in the 6-9AM/ET timeslot. The 4AM hour of FOX & Friends First will be solo-hosted by Heather Childers, while the 5AM hour will be co-anchored by Jillian Mele and Rob Schmitt.

With the expansion of the franchise, FNC now has more women anchoring and hosting programs than any other cable news network on weekdays from 4AM-12AM/ET. Additionally, upon the debut of Fox News @ Night on October 30th, FNC will have live weekday programming for 20 hours a day.

In making the announcement, Scott said, “As FOX & Friends continues to mark its most-watched year in network history, we are thrilled to give our viewers more of the morning franchise they love.”

FOX & Friends FIRST is presented prior to the network’s signature morning show, previewing the day ahead by covering the latest news headlines in politics, business, entertainment and health. The early morning program is the number one cable news program in its timeslot, dominating CNN and MSNBC in both total viewers and the 25-54 demographic.

On pace to have its highest-rated year in network history, FOX & Friends has been FNC’s signature morning program for more than 19 years. Co-hosted by Steve Doocy, Ainsley Earhardt and Brian Kilmeade, the show has eclipsed the competition for 190 consecutive months. Featuring interviews with numerous celebrities, authors, athletes and political heavyweights, the program also includes regular stunts and musical performances both on set and outside before gathering crowds. Additionally, each hour of the show offers reports on general news, sports, weather, politics, business and entertainment provided by FOX & Friends FIRST co-host Jillian Mele.

Heather Childers joined FNC in 2010 as a general assignment reporter based in New York. During her tenure, she served as an anchor of America’s News HQ from 2011 to 2013, as well as helped launch FOX & Friends FIRST, where she has been a co-host for nearly five years. Prior to joining FNC, Childers served as a weekday evening anchor for News 14 Carolina (YNN 14) in Charlotte, NC. She was also a weekend evening anchor and weekday reporter for WLOS-TV (ABC 13) in Asheville, NC and a weekday anchor for WFLX-TV (FOX 29) in Albany, GA. Childers began her career as a producer at WCNC-TV (NBC 22) in Charlotte, NC. She graduated from the University of North Carolina with a B.A. in English.

Jillian Mele joined FNC from Comcast SportsNet Philadelphia (CSN Philly) in March 2017. While with CSN Philly, she earned an Emmy Award for her co-host role on the local morning news program, Breakfast on Broad. Earlier in her career, Mele spent seven years with WCAU-TV (NBC 10) in Philadelphia, PA and reported in various capacities, including as a news, sports and traffic reporter. She got her on-air start as a local news anchor for stations in Presque Isle, Maine, and Binghamton, NY. Mele received a B.A. in arts and communication from La Salle University.

Rob Schmitt was named a weekend news anchor and general assignment reporter at FNC in June 2016 and has served as a substitute anchor for various programs including FOX & Friends First, and FOX Report. Prior to joining FNC, he was an anchor for WNBC-TV (NBC 4) in New York, helming the 12 Noon News while also contributing reports to the 5PM/ET and 6PM/ET news programs. Before joining WNBC-TV, Schmitt worked as an anchor and reporter for CBS2/KCAL9 (CBS) in Los Angeles, CA, and began his career at WPLG-TV (ABC) in Miami, FL. A native of Indiana, Schmitt received a B.A. from the Ernie Pyle School of Journalism at Indiana University.

FOX News Channel (FNC) is a 24-hour all-encompassing news service dedicated to delivering breaking news as well as political and business news. The number one network in cable, FNC has been the most-watched television news channel for more than 15 years and according to a Suffolk University/USA Today poll, is the most-trusted television news source in the country.

While the vast majority of 3,000 ads didn’t reference the election, voting, or a particular candidate, they did focus on amplifying divisive social and political messages such as LGBT matters, race, immigration and gun rights, according to Facebook.

The ads were turned over to the House and Senate intelligence committees and the Senate Judiciary Committee on Oct. 2. Facebook already has given similar material to Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into the Russian meddling.

During a Facebook Live Chat last month, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that the company would strengthen its ad review process for political ads.

Facebook’s battle with fake political ads comes amid investigations into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election, which Russia denies.

Twitter recently announced it has uncovered several accounts linked to the same alleged Russian activity on Facebook, as well as $274,000 spent on ads by state-owned TV network Russia Today in the 2016 U.S. Presidential election. Twitter’s move prompted a scathing response from Russia Today.

The Senate intelligence committee, along with the House intelligence committee, has invited Facebook, Twitter and Google to testify at a public hearing next month. Facebook said last week that it had accepted invitations from both committees, and Twitter confirmed it would testify before the Senate panel on Nov. 1.

The TJ Cruiser is a subcompact-crossover with the functionality of a minivan and the looks of a tough off-road SUV. The TJ roughly stands for ‘Toolbox of Joy.’

About the same length as a CH-R, it features sliding rear doors like a Sienna. Aside from the driver’s, all of the seats fold down to create a hard and flat floor that can fit items up to three meters long and is equipped with multiple tie-down points to secure gear.

The overall vibe is reminiscent of the discontinued Honda Element, but with an even more utilitarian feel.

While a quarterback for the 49ers last year, Colin Kaepernick sat or kneeled during the national anthem last season to bring more attention to the killings of black men by police officers. The protests have grown this season.

Meanwhile, CBS Sports' Jason La Canfora corrected his report that had claimed Kaepernick would stand during the national anthem if given a chance to play football in the NFL again.

""Wanted to clarify one thing regarding @Kaepernick7. When I was asked about his whether or not he would sit or stand for anthem ..."" La Canfora tweeted after the report came out earlier Sunday.

The requests included additional crackdowns on “sanctuary cities” that protect illegal immigrants; reducing the number of incoming refugees; 10,000 more Customs and Border Patrol agents; and new initiatives curbing the number of unaccompanied immigrants who come to the U.S. illegally as children. Democrats already have said many of the White House's terms are off the table.

“Unfortunately, over the last several decades respect for the rule of law has broken down and immigration enforcement has been sacrificed for the sake of political expediency. This has made us less secure and it cannot stand,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement. “Now President Trump has put forth a series of proposals that will restore the rule of law to our immigration system, prioritize America’s safety and security, and end the lawlessness. These are reasonable proposals that will build on the early success of President Trump’s leadership. This plan will work. If followed it will produce an immigration system with integrity and one in which we can take pride. Perhaps the best result will be that unlawful attempts to enter will continue their dramatic decline.”

DACA essentially allows law-abiding illegal immigrants brought into the U.S. by their parents to live and work in the country without fear of deportation.","Trump Seeks Sanctuary-City Crackdown, Curb on Unaccompanied Minors for 'Dreamer' Deal",http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/10/09/trump-seeks-sanctuary-city-crackdown-curb-unaccompanied-minors-dreamer-deal#commenting

Not long ago, “interest-based advertising” creeped out a lot of people who couldn’t understand why Facebook, for example, knew what they had just shopped for on Amazon. The truth is that personalized ads are the result of a very impersonal process.

Interest-based advertising crunches bits of data gathered from your browser to make marketing more efficient. Special algorithms analyze your visits over time and across different websites, making it possible to predict your preferences and show ads that are likely to interest you.

But sometimes, all this tracking can be overwhelming. While the process is basically automatic and unmanned, interest-based ads can feel like an invasion of privacy. That’s why many people look for ways to throw the trackers off their scent.

Here are three simple ways to do just that.

1. Wipe out history, turn off cookies

To start, you’ll want a clean slate. You should eliminate any trace of your past searches by clearing all the browsing data, history, cache and cookies from your web browsers.

Next, disable or limit tracking on your gadget, including on favorite services like Facebook. If you’re not sure how how to do this, click here for the steps to wipe out where you’ve been and what you’ve done. Next, make sure to delete third-party advertising cookies. Click here to learn how to remove them and prevent them from coming back.

When you’re finished, take a moment to test your browser with an online security and privacy checker. I like the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s tool that shows you the information about the browser you’re using and your risk level. Click here for the free download and more details.

2. Opt out of ads

You may notice only a handful of culprits, but many companies use algorithms to track your behavior and send you targeted ads.

Thankfully, there’s a way for you to opt out of interest-based, or “behavioral,” ads. The Digital Advertising Alliance lets you review its participating partners. When you first visit the DAA, the websites will scan your computer. Once the scan is complete, you’ll be shown a list of partners advertising directly to you.

From there, you can learn more about the practices these companies use for interest-based ads. You can opt out using “opt-out cookies” that are stored in your browser with your preferences.

Click here for the steps to opt-out of this form of online targeted advertising.

3. Go incognito

Every major web browser — Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari and Opera — has private, or incognito, browsing. Turning this feature on means your browser will ignore cookies, including ad-tracking cookies, and your computer won’t record your browsing history. It’s almost like you were never online.

When your browser is in private browsing mode, it will show a special icon. In Firefox, it’s a mask; in Chrome, it’s a little spy; in Edge, it’s “InPrivate.” These all indicate that you’re in incognito or private mode.

Private browsing will keep your computer safe from casual snoopers. Someone who jumps on your computer won’t see where you’ve been.

Keep in mind that online ads aren’t necessarily a bad thing. Yes, they can annoy us, but they’re also the reason most online content is free. Without them, media outlets and content creators would have to find a different source of revenue. For most of us, seeing a few presumptuous ads is a tiny price to pay.

Often they’re women you’ve heard of—say, Beyonce or Madonna—and just as often, they’re not. But regardless of who’s in this NYC salon owner’s chair, conversation almost always turns to hair product. And while the topic has long inflamed passions, there’s a definite desire of the moment: “Women want more natural ingredients,” says Hazan, whose product formulators have started using corn, for example, to help create gentle shampoo suds—and protect hair color in the process.

“Patients have shown a greater interest in natural skin care, too,” says Doris Day, M.D., clinical associate professor of dermatology at the New York University Langone Medical Center. The reason? It’s no longer simply the perception that naturals are better for you and the environment, but the realization that they can be highly effective, too: “Some of the most potent antioxidants are produce-derived,” she notes.

GET BRIGHTER, GLOWING SKIN WITH THESE TIPS

So where does this growing appetite leave the beauty industry? In search of a broade array of ingredients, says veteran cosmetic chemist Ni’Kita Wilson: “There’s such a huge interest that companies are taking a closer look at all kinds of different foods to see what can be used in products.” Indeed, R&D teams are going well beyond the rosemary that zings up your bath and the honey that soothes your skin to hit every last corner of the grocery store.

Read on for five of their most surprising beauty finds.

Corn

A multitasking beautifier, corn is an effective alternative to increasingly unpopular synthetic exfoliants (those tiny plastic spheres that turn out to be big water pollutants)—and to synthetic lathering agents. You’ll find it in such products as Rita Hazan True Color Shampoo and Caudalie Deep Cleansing Exfoliator. One important note: These products smell nothing like corn. The shampoo is actually a cult favorite for, among other things, its gorgeous blend of white flower scents. Meanwhile, the exfoliating cleanser smells only faintly of mint, if anything. In fact, rest assured: Not one of the products to follow smells like a surprising grocery find.

Beans

“There is a navy bean extract that has been shown to reduce melanogenisis,” says Wilson. Read: Diminished pigment production and dark spots. Thus the navy bean extract in Mary Kay’s beauty editor-beloved TimeWise Tone-Correcting Serum and ClearProof Deep-Cleansing Charcoal Mask. But beans of all kinds, including those on offer at global grocers, are turning up in beauty products as well. One of the best examples: mung beans, long used in Chinese medicine as a detoxing and cooling agent, and now the star of Wei Mung Bean Sprout Stress-Relieving Soothing Mask.

Peas

Little did you know during your childhood protests against those bright green piles on your plate that you’d someday be seeking peas for your skin and hair. “Pea extract is a great ingredient,” says Wilson. “In hair, it strengthens and pumps up strands by forming an imperceptible film.” (Thus such launches as Honest Beauty Honestly Uplifted Volumizing Spray.) “In skin, that same film helps retain moisture,” Wilson explains. One great example? Ole Henriksen Sheer Transormation Perfecting Moisturizer.

Beets

Beets are known as super-moisturizers, so they’re turning up in all kinds of formulations. In Tula's Pro-Gycolic 10% pH Resurfacing Gel, for example, a hydrating beet derivative helps defend against external forces (pollution, UV radiation). Meanwhile, the beetroot extract in Pili Ani Intense Hydrating Facial Cream helps boost the concentration of NMF (natural moisturizing factor) in your skin.

In it, he mused that he was using the comments section of Johnson’s Instagram because the star wouldn’t answer his calls.

Tyrese Gibson, who has played Roman Pearce in the second, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth films in the franchise, hasn’t been shy about blaming fellow costar Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson for being the reason that the yet untitled “F9” will be late. Soon after the news broke that the release date had been pushed from April 19, 2019 to April 10, 2020, he took to Instagram where he sounded off on Johnson saying that his desire to be a solo act is to blame, and took a shot at his newest box-office flub, “Baywatch.”

Later the same day, he posted another photo of the cast of the original “The Fast and the Furious” film - which included neither him nor Johnson - with more harsh words for The Rock.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, Gibson may be upset that the rumored spinoff movie, that will reportedly star Johnson’s Lucas Hobbs character and Jason Statham’s Deckard Shaw, is getting fast-tracked ahead of the ninth movie. However, the outlet also notes that the film may have been pushed back in an effort to court director Justin Lin, who may be returning to the franchise. Sadly, it’s unclear at this time as Universal Pictures has not made a statement on the matter other than to push the release date of “F9.”

As US Weekly notes, Gibson previously talked about the project in a comment on the former WWE star’s Instagram, which has since been deleted. In it, he mused that he was using the comments section of Johnson’s Instagram because the star wouldn’t answer his calls.

Programming a destination into in-vehicle GPS navigation systems was the most distracting activity, taking drivers an average of 40 seconds to complete the task.
The guidelines recommend that automakers lock out the ability to program navigation systems while a car is moving.
It also urged automakers to block the ability to program navigation systems or send texts while driving.
Automakers should also design infotainment systems so that they require no more attention to use than listening to the radio or an audiobook, it said.","The infotainment technology that automakers are cramming into the dashboard of new vehicles is making drivers take their eyes off the road and hands off the wheel for dangerously long periods of time, an AAA study says.

The study released Thursday is the latest by University of Utah professor David Strayer, who has been examining the impact of infotainment systems on safety for AAA's Foundation for Traffic Safety since 2013. Past studies also identified problems, but Strayer said the ""explosion of technology"" has made things worse.

Automakers now include more options to allow drivers to use social media, email and text. The technology is also becoming more complicated to use. Cars used to have a few buttons and knobs. Some vehicles now have as many as 50 buttons on the steering wheel and dashboard that are multi-functional. There are touch screens, voice commands, writing pads, heads-up displays on windshields and mirrors and 3-D computer-generated images.

""It's adding more and more layers of complexity and information at drivers' fingertips without often considering whether it's a good idea to put it at their fingertips,"" Strayer said. That complexity increases the overall amount of time drivers spend trying to use the systems.

The auto industry says the new systems are better alternatives for drivers than mobile phones and navigation devices that were not designed to be used while driving.

The vehicle-integrated systems ""are designed to be used in the driving environment and require driver attention that is comparable to tuning the radio or adjusting climate controls, which have always been considered baseline acceptable behaviors while driving,"" said Wade Newton, a spokesman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers.

But Jake Nelson, AAA's director for traffic safety advocacy and research, said drivers took their eyes off the road and hands off the wheel while using infotainment systems in each of the 30 cars and light trucks, all 2017 models, that were tested in the study. The drivers used voice commands, touch screens and other interactive technologies to make calls, send texts, tune the radio or program navigation all while driving.

Clearly automakers haven't worked hard enough to make the systems quick and easy to use, Nelson said. Researchers rated 23 of the 30 vehicles ""very high"" or ""high"" in terms of the attention they demanded from drivers. Seven were rated ""moderate."" None required a low amount of attention to use.

Programming a destination into in-vehicle GPS navigation systems was the most distracting activity, taking drivers an average of 40 seconds to complete the task. At 25 mph (40 kph), a car can travel the length of four football fields during the time it takes to enter a destination. Previous research has shown that drivers who remove their eyes from the road for just two seconds double their risk for a crash.

Under pressure from the industry, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in 2012 issued voluntary safety guidelines to automakers for dashboard technology instead of enforceable safety standards. The guidelines recommend that automakers lock out the ability to program navigation systems while a car is moving. However, the ability to program navigation while driving was available in 12 vehicles in the study.

The guidelines also recommend automakers prevent drivers from texting while driving, but three-quarters of the vehicles tested permit drivers to text while the car is moving. Texting was the second-most distracting task performed by test drivers.

Drivers looked away from the road less when using voice commands, but that safety benefit was offset by the increased amount of time drivers spent interacting with the systems.

AAA said drivers should use infotainment technologies ""only for legitimate emergencies or urgent, driving-related purposes."" It also urged automakers to block the ability to program navigation systems or send texts while driving. Automakers should also design infotainment systems so that they require no more attention to use than listening to the radio or an audiobook, it said.

Nearly 70 percent of U.S. adults say they want the new technologies in their vehicles, but only 24 percent feel that the technology already works perfectly, according to an opinion survey conducted for AAA.

""Drivers want technology that is safe and easy to use,"" said Marshall Doney, AAA's president and CEO, ""but many of the features added to infotainment systems today have resulted in overly complex and sometimes frustrating user experiences for drivers.""",Technology crammed into cars worsens driver distraction,https://www.foxnews.com/auto/2017/10/06/technology-crammed-into-cars-worsens-driver-distraction.html

Trump's company has faced several setbacks since it ventured into Scotland a dozen years ago.
Just how much these setbacks have hurt Trump's business is unclear, however.
The report and Milne's math aside, some residents think Trump's resorts are attracting plenty of golfers and doing just fine.
Whether any of this will hurt profits at Trump's Scottish business in the long run is another matter.","David Milne loves the view of the North Sea from his home high above the roiling surf, but he finds his eye often falling onto the golf course next door and, when it does, on the tiny figures below.

He counts the people coming off the buses in the parking lot and the people swinging at the 1st tee and the 10th tee and he counts the people walking the fairways and after all this counting he's convinced of something that must be satisfying given his tussles with the owner, Donald Trump.

There aren't enough people.

""The carpark is rarely even half full,"" said Milne, 53, looking out again on Friday under clear blue skies. ""For what was supposedly the best golf course in the world, I don't really think this is a resounding success.""

A few hours after Milne spoke, he got some confirmation. A financial report that Trump's company filed with the British government shows he has lost millions of dollars at the resort, called the Trump International Golf Links, as well as at a second one on the other side of Scotland overlooking the Irish Sea.

The report from Britain's Companies House released late Friday showed losses last year more than doubled to 17.6 million pounds ($23 million). It was the third year in a row of losses. Revenue also fell sharply.

Trump's company has faced several setbacks since it ventured into Scotland a dozen years ago.

The company has angered Milne and other neighbors for what they say are its bullying tactics to get them to sell land. A local fisherman became a national hero of sorts when he, like Milne, refused to sell to Trump, despite a $690,000 offer.

Then the company got some unwelcome publicity. Two documentaries about the fights with residents were shot, ""Tripping Up Trump"" and ""You've Been Trumped,"" the latter shown on the BBC despite threats from one of Trump's lawyers to sue the broadcaster.

Troubles have only mounted since then.

A few months before Trump clinched the Republican nomination last year, he lost a court fight to stop an offshore windmill farm near the North Sea resort. He has been repeatedly stymied in his plans to build a luxury hotel there and a second course because of, among other things, strong objections from environmental regulators that his plans will threaten the sand dunes for which the area is famous. And there also are signs that he is at risk of losing a bid to host the coveted Scottish Open.

Just how much these setbacks have hurt Trump's business is unclear, however. Other factors appear to have played a big role in the latest financial results.

In Friday's report, Trump's company noted it had to shut down its Turnberry resort on the Irish Sea for half the year while building a new course there and fixing up an old one. It also blamed losses on a hit from fluctuations in the value of the British pound.

The report and Milne's math aside, some residents think Trump's resorts are attracting plenty of golfers and doing just fine. In fact, whatever troubles Trump has encountered appear to only have helped business in the North Sea area.

He has only 16 rooms for overnight guests at his resort there, leaving other hotels to pick up the slack.

""I've gone from doing an average of 400 room nights for golfers per year to 1,400 room nights in six months,"" said Stewart Spence, 70, owner of the Marcliffe Hotel and Spa in nearby Aberdeen. ""There can hardly be a golfer in the world who doesn't know about this area because of what Trump has done.""?

Rival courses have seen a bump in business, too.

""We've gone from about 4,000 golfers per annum to almost 5,500 a year,"" said Les Durno, 54, general manager at the Cruden Bay Golf Club about 20 miles from Trump's course.

Then there is the sheer spectacle itself, a chance to gawk at a U.S. president's property and maybe spend 19.95 pounds ($26.07) for a cap embroidered with Trump's family crest.

""When we drive past Trump International, I often get people, Americans mostly, asking to stop so they can go into the golf shop and buy something,"" said a bus driver waiting in the parking lot Friday who didn't want to give his name. ""They don't play golf but they want a Trump Scotland souvenir.""

Or as Hector Emslie, 58, the golf project manager for the local tourism organization, VisitAberdeenshire, put it: it's like having the ""Disney World for golfers"" on our doorstep.

Others are less enthusiastic, including the leader of the Scottish government, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.

Shortly before Trump visited his North Sea resort in June last year, and Milne ran a Mexican flag up a pole in protest against his immigration policies, Sturgeon stripped Trump of his title as business ambassador for Scotland. She cited his comments about Muslims during the campaign.

Aberdeen's Robert Gordon University also revoked Trump of his honorary degree for the same reason.

Trump's incendiary comments while president have only added to his woes.

A corporate watchdog group started an online petition to stop Trump's development plan at his resort. The group, SumOfUs, seized on Trump's reaction to the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, arguing that his rhetoric has ""bolstered white supremacists"" across the globe.

""Now we have a chance to reject Trump's hatred,"" it said in its online appeal, ""and protect our environment in one fell swoop.""

As of Sunday, the group had collected 94,888 signatures.

In July, the CEO of a major sponsor of the Scottish Open was quoted in a local newspaper casting doubt on Trump's chances of hosting the event.

""There's no decision made but, look, there are clear issues,"" Aberdeen Asset Management CEO Martin Gilbert was quoted saying. He added, ""Politics aside, Trump would be an ideal venue — but you can't put politics aside.""

Whether any of this will hurt profits at Trump's Scottish business in the long run is another matter.

In Friday's report, Eric Trump, the president's son and a director of the British subsidiary that owns the two resorts, included a letter expressing confidence that the resorts will attract plenty of golfers.

Amanda Miller, a spokeswoman for the Trump Organization, declined to comment. She also said that Eric Trump was not available to talk.

Trump handed over management of his company to Eric and his other adult son, Donald Jr., before becoming president, but he still retains a financial interest in it.

For his part, Milne is convinced the course will continue to suffer. He thinks Trump's election as president has hurt the business.

""It has hindered the success of the club,"" said Milne as his Mexican flag flapped in the wind. ""Some people come because it is the president's golf club, but others avoid it for the same reason.""

My guess is that if this had taken place under former President Obama’s watch, Mr. Greenhouse would have refrained from said tweet.
I also have no idea if Mr. Greenhouse has boys of his own.
And I have no idea if he owns a lawn mower.","My pop, a WWII veteran, devoted husband and the sort of father I aspire to be, didn’t raise no fools. Except me.

I know I’m a fool because back when I was 9 years old and sporting a flat top and a pair of black Converse All-Stars, my pop advised me that I was now taking over the lawn mower duties from one of my older brothers. That brother was being promoted to the job of painting the house for the summer. So, head room being what it is, Pop handed the keys to the mower to his youngest boy.

Actually, no keys were involved. The mower was an old Sears model. For those of you too young to know your American history, Sears was the Amazon of the 20th century. Anytime between 1893 and ’round about 1985, if you wanted pants, a dishwasher, football pads, a lava lamp or a reciprocating sprocket wrench with detachable sprockets, then by damn you got it at Sears.

The lawn mower I inherited as a 9-year-old that early summer afternoon was a late-’60s gas-powered Sears model my brothers called “Chopper.” Chopper ate anything that got too close to its massive rotating semi-sharp blades. It belched smoke as clumps of grass, rocks and half-chewed army men flew out from all sides. As a 9-year-old, I calculated Chopper’s weight to be somewhere between 160 pounds and a two-door Buick. It took all 85 pounds of me, and about three hours, to push that beast around our yard.

Now I know Pop raised a fool, because when he announced solemnly that Chopper was my responsibility, I looked him in the eye and said what I typically said back then: “Yes sir… you bet.” What I should have said was, “Pop, I don’t mean to tell you your business, but do you have any idea how dangerous lawn mowers are to kids?” And then I would have handed him a couple of articles detailing those dangers, and for good measure recited current regulations related to child labor laws and how he just might be in violation of said laws.

Yes sir, that’s what I should have done. I know that now because that’s what former New York Times labor reporter Steven Greenhouse recently suggested following the curious case of Frank the Amazing Mowing Boy.

By now you’ve likely heard the heartwarming tale of Frank Giaccio, the 11-year-old kid from Virginia. Frank has himself a lawn mowing business. According to reliable sources, he charges $8 a lawn. I’m not that good at math, but I believe that’s approximately 8 clams more per yard than I made during my mowing career, so I think it’s safe to say that Frank is some kind of business genius.

Anyway, one day Frank reached out to the White House Office of Lawns and Shrubbery, which is overseen by the Department of Landscaping over at the Ministry of the Interior I believe, and said it would be his honor to mow the White House lawn. Apparently realizing the lawn in fact did need mowing, they reached out to Frank and Bob’s your uncle. I do not know if Frank was also tasked with picking up dog poop prior to mowing. That may well fall under a different department.

Bottom line, Frank got his wish, and by all accounts he did a very fine job mowing the White House lawn. President Trump came out to greet and thank him. In the video of the encounter, Frank almost looks too busy to stop and shake hands. Clearly he’s worried about keeping the mowing line straight. And to be honest, he probably had a couple more lawns to get to that day. And as if this story needed any more of a kick in the pants, Frank apparently told the president that when he grows up, he wants to be a Navy Seal.

I don’t know about you, but after my experience as a kid, and now as a father raising three young boys, I wanted to shake Frank’s hand and tell him well done, keep it up.

But then, Steven Greenhouse came along and rained on my freshly cut lawn. He sent out a tweet that read, in part: “Not sending a great signal on child labor, minimum wage & occupational safety.” Now there’s a good chance that all Mr. Greenhouse was doing was pointing out that children and lawn mowers can be a dangerous combination. He is, after all, a writer on a wide variety of labor topics.

I don’t believe he was making any statement about the need to teach kids responsibility and the value of hard work. I personally think he was sincere in thinking Frank needed to back away from the lawn mower. But, frankly, children and anything else can be a potentially dangerous combination. My boys Scooter, Sluggo and Muggsy could take a cantaloupe, two mini marshmallows and a feather duster and turn it into a deadly weapon. Just the other day, Muggsy broke his nose while using a cardboard tube as a pirate sword.

Given that I’m a bit of a cynical sort, there is also the chance that Mr. Greenhouse didn’t vote for the current president and saw this as an opportunity to creatively take a dig at him. My guess is that if this had taken place under former President Obama’s watch, Mr. Greenhouse would have refrained from said tweet. That’s just speculation, folks.

I also have no idea if Mr. Greenhouse has boys of his own. My research staff is off on another team-building exercise at an all-inclusive resort, and I can’t remember the Wi-Fi password in the office. And I have no idea if he owns a lawn mower. If he resides in New York City, another fact I can’t be bothered to check, there’s a good chance that he has limited experience with yard implements.

What’s my point? When I started writing, I was going to take an easy potshot at Mr. Greenhouse and talk about how we all spend way too much time coddling our kids and trying to reduce life’s risks down to zero, and how mowing lawns teaches kids responsibility and the value of hard work. But Mr. Greenhouse has already been lambasted for his tweet in social media circles … and I don’t have the energy to leap on that dog pile.

Speaking of dog piles, I can look out my kitchen window and see my boy Scooter picking up after our dog Hendricks in the back yard. Scoot’s only 10, but sitting inside the garage is a gas-powered mower with fairly dull blades, and it’s now become his responsibility.

Not to worry, Mr. Greenhouse, I gave him a safety briefing… told him to watch out for flying rocks and chewed-up action figures, advised him not to stick his fingers where they don’t belong and, when pushing it up hill, don’t let it roll back on you. It was the same briefing I got from my pop. Scooter listened attentively, and I’m proud to say his response was, “You bet.” He’ll be just fine.","Frank, the lawnmower boy, still has liberals all worked up.

“So today I went into work at Banana Republic at the Westchester Mall and after the district manager (a white woman) popped in for a visit, I was told to go to the office to speak with my manager,” wrote Tompkins in a Facebook post on Wednesday evening.

She then explained that she expected her store manager, a white man named Michael, to tell her something was wrong with her outfit. But instead, he began questioning her about her box-braid hairstyle, she says.

“He told me that my braids were not Banana Republic appropriate and that they were too ‘urban’ and ‘unkempt’ for their image,” wrote Tompkins, adding that Michael told her he couldn’t allow her to work until she changed her hairstyle.

Tompkins tried to explain how the braids keep her hair from drying out, but she alleges that Michael simply recommended she start using shea butter, and sent her back out to the floor.

“I have never been so humiliated and degraded in my life by a white person,” Tompkins wrote. “In that moment, I felt so uncomfortable and overwhelmed that I didn’t even finish my work shift and ended up leaving.”

By Ruben Diaz Jr. , The New York Post

On Monday, I will march in the annual Columbus Day Parade up Fifth Avenue. I will join thousands of revelers in celebrating their Italian heritage, their culture and the contributions Italian-Americans have made to this city and this nation.

And I will join their calls to keep the statue of Christopher Columbus in Columbus Circle right where it is.

This summer, I joined in the national outcry to excise from the public square statues and monuments that celebrated the leadership of the Confederacy. This included two statues of Confederate generals in my borough — Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson — that made their home in the historic Hall of Fame for Great Americans on the campus of Bronx Community College.

Statues are about more than just the person they depict. They are symbolic. The intent behind the installation of such monuments cannot be ignored.

The Confederacy was an inherently evil entity that split our country in two in a futile effort to maintain slavery as an institution.

Many of the statues constructed to honor the so-called “heroes” of the Confederate states were erected during the periods of post-Reconstruction in the South and the Civil Rights movement, and served as not-so-thinly veiled threats to the African-American populations in the communities where they were installed.

Jim Crow-era monuments to white supremacy and the leadership of seditious insurrection should not be tolerated, except for where they belong: in cemeteries.

However, the statue of Christopher Columbus in Columbus Circle was not built to herald the explorer’s subjugation of native people. If it had been, I would be the first to demand that it be torn down.

No, the Columbus Circle statue was erected in 1892 following a massive fundraising campaign by the nation’s Italian-American community in recognition of the 400th anniversary of Columbus’ landing in the Americas.

Hard-working men, women and families of Italian descent, along with businesses and various institutions with Italian or Italian-American ties, pooled their money to pay for the statue as a way to give something of value back to the city that had given so much to them. They were acting in the spirit of community and with a love of this nation and the dream it represents.",Don't Mess with Christopher Columbus,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/10/09/dont-mess-christopher-columbus#commenting

He recalls the first day he stepped on American soil:“It was a very beautiful day,” he says.
Instead, he started working for the Minneapolis School District and then the city’s housing authority.
Along the way, Tufaa maried and he and his wife have five children ranging in age from eight to 21.
“I believe in the American dream because I appreciate what this country can provide to people like me,” Tufaa says.","When Minneapolis entrepreneur Tashitaa Tufaa came to the United States from his native Ethiopia he quickly embodied the American spirit.

The political refugee, now in his late 40s, came to this country in 1992 with nothing to his name and worked his way up from washing dishes to running his own transportation company that still continues to grow.

Tufaa says that his drive was inspired by his adopted home.

“I had read a lot about America,” he said in a recent interview with Fox News. “Even though I had never been, I have always been a fan of the American way.”

Tuftaa was born in the Ethiopian village of Aloo and grew up working on his family’s farm with his 13 siblings until he attended an American college in Zimbabwe. He eventually returned to Ethiopia, where he was a history and English teacher until the early 90s when he decided to leave due to his native country’s changing political climate.

“I wasn’t forced to leave my country,” he says. “I just knew that it was time to leave when I saw politicians fleeing. I knew it wasn’t safe. I came here and decided not to go back.”

“Even though I had never been, I have always been a fan of the American way...” - Tashitaa Tufaa

He was granted political asylum and wound up in the city of Minneapolis, where he stayed in low-income housing with old college friends who had emigrated from Zimbabwe. He recalls the first day he stepped on American soil:

“It was a very beautiful day,” he says. “I was in downtown Minneapolis. I was amazed by the tall buildings and how clean it was compared to where I came from.”

Tufaa says that during those initial days in the U.S. it was difficult to find a job, but he never once thought about wavering.

“It was definitely hard. If you wanted a white-collar job, there were not many available,” he says. “My first job was as a dishwasher at the Minneapolis Hilton for $5.60 an hour and I thought at the time that it was great.”

Tufaa washed dishes for about ten months before moving on to a manufacturing job and a security position before enrolling in graduate school at the University of Minnesota. He continued working security jobs as he went through school.

“I would work until midnight and during the day in between my morning and afternoon classes,” he recalled. “I had few hours to sleep, but the biggest thing was these opportunities for work. We were not able to get this back home. You were lucky if you were able to get one job, here, I could get three jobs.”

Tufaa eventually graduated from school and wanted to pursue a career as a diplomat but quickly found out that he would have to be a U.S. citizen to do so (he became a citizen in 2000). Instead, he started working for the Minneapolis School District and then the city’s housing authority. He also worked extra jobs as a taxi and bus driver.

“I would leave work at 4:30 and then go drive a bus,” he says.

In 2003, he was laid off from his job with the city.

“That’s when I decided to form my own company.”

The determined Tufaa set out to market himself to school districts in the area, looking to provide transportation services for students.

“It was rough building it up,” the entrepreneur said. “On paper, my company was incorporated, but technically, I had no experience. People generally don’t trust you if you can’t show them your experience.”

In September of that year, Tufaa finally started gaining that experience when he started providing bus services to a handful of special needs students. School administrators took notice of the stellar job he did and he started receiving more and more work from the district, putting nearly all of his profits back into the business.

Eventually, Tufaa was able to establish his company, Metropolitan Transportation Network (MetroTN) and soon after he received his first large contract with the Beacon Academy School after their original bus provider went out of business mid-year. About 300 of the school’s 400 plus students ride MetroTN buses to this day.

Business continued to grow for Tufaa and MetroTN now boasts three facilities in the state, with a fourth on the way in October. The company currently includes 300 employees, including several family members who also emigrated from Ethiopia.

“They had to apply like everyone else,” he says, half-joking.

Along the way, Tufaa maried and he and his wife have five children ranging in age from eight to 21.

He looks to continue the expansion of MetroTN and serve other facets of public transportation in the city he has called home for nearly 25 years.

“I believe in the American dream because I appreciate what this country can provide to people like me,” Tufaa says.

“If you are free, you can exercise your talents in many different ways. I am free as long as I don’t do anything illegal. I can do anything.""",American Dream is alive and well for African immigrant entrepreneur,https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/09/28/american-dream-is-alive-and-well-for-african-immigrant-entrepreneur.html

Dean sped to his Kenwood home, alerted neighbors, and fled to the town of Sonoma. He was one of hundreds of evacuees who streamed into a 24-hour Safeway market overnight, while authorities set up an official evacuation center.

Maureen McGowan was house-sitting for a brother near Kenwood, and said both of the homes on his property were on fire when she left. At the Safeway, she pointed to her feet, still in slippers. She had fled so fast that she hadn't put on her shoes.

Belia Ramos, chairwoman of the Napa County Board of Supervisors, said officials did not yet have a count on how many properties were affected, either by the fire directly or by evacuations.

""We're focusing on making evacuations and trying to keep people safe. We are not prepared to start counting. Certainly with day just breaking now, we are starting to see the structures that are affected,"" she said shortly after sunrise.

""The gusts are very, very — they're tremendous and it's what makes this fire unpredictable. It's something that we're having to be very cautious about,"" she said.

Emergency lines were inundated with callers reporting smoke in the area, prompting officials to ask that the public ""only use 911 if they see actual unattended flames, or are having another emergency.""

The National Weather Service said widespread wind gusts between 35 mph and 50 mph were observed in the north San Francisco Bay region and isolated spots hit 70 mph. The winds were expected to subside at midday.

Community centers, the Sonoma County Fairgrounds and other local centers were opened for evacuees.

The “hack,” demonstrated by food blogger Bev Weidner, is for peanut butter “slices” and it involves smooth peanut butter, parchment paper and a freezer – and a lot of confusion.

GLADWARE'S CONTAINER LIDS ARE BLOWING PEOPLE'S MINDS

For her tutorial, Weidner first takes a jar of peanut butter and spreads “globbies” onto a sheet of parchment paper with a wooden spoon. She then smooths out a hefty offering of the nutty spread before folding the parchment paper over the top of the butter and rolling it out a couple of times with a rolling pin. From there, she places the peanut butter in the freezer.

In the Facebook video, which had 8.6 million views as of Sunday, Weidner says the frozen peanut butter can be cut into slices and then placed on the bread easily.

“It comes to room temperature semi-quickly, but you have time to drizzle it with maybe some honey on top, some chocolate sprinkles. Kid's love it,” Weidner says.

This method, Weidner explains, prevents mess and “torn bread” from spreading the peanut butter right out of the jar.

Facebook is less convinced.

The video has received over 11,000 comments with most of them questioning the need to add steps in making a peanut butter sandwich.

“Because nothing is easier than spreading peanut butter on waxed paper, rolling it flat with a rolling pin, freezing it overnight, then cutting the frozen sheets of peanut butter into bread sized squares and using them to make your honey and peanut butter sandwiches.....” a user commented.

Another said, “I cant(sic) be the only one that doesn't have an issue spreading peanut butter.”

A few joked about the length freezing the peanut butter would take.

“The time it took to spread it on wax paper, smooth it with a rolling pin, freeze it and then cut it with scissors, I could have made you 308 peanut butter sandwiches.”

“Child-‘Mama? Can I have a peanut butter sandwich please?’

Every year, millions of Americans go after this same goal, some successful and others not so much. To attain their goals, they may choose from the over-abundance of diets and exercise programs available, and some turn to weight loss supplements as well.

While you shouldn’t rely on supplements to do all the work for you, there are a few that can be used safely to boost your weight loss efforts.

Before you decide on weight loss supplements, though, you should consider the health effects carefully. Always check with your doctor first to be sure about safety, and remember that these pills are supplements. They’re meant to be used alongside healthy eating habits and proper exercise.

DO YOU HAVE LIVER DAMAGE?

Again, never use supplements by themselves to lose weight. Some people turn to weight loss pills so that they can continue an unhealthy lifestyle while staying thin.

This dangerous mentality could lead to frightening situations like addiction, overdose or death. Also, brands that claim to shed weight without any effort may contain ingredients that will do you more harm than good. If you have any doubt about a supplement, stay away.

Weight Loss Supplements that Work

Just like any other medication, weight loss supplements have both benefits and side effects. When choosing a supplement, you should know all the possible effects and consider them in light of your own health history. Especially if you have other health issues, you should check carefully for ingredients that may trigger or worsen your symptoms.

Let’s look at 3 supplements that you could consider adding to your weight loss program:

1. Green Tea Extract

Green tea has long been known for its health benefits, mainly because the drink is high in antioxidants. In particular, green tea contains large amounts of polyphenol antioxidants called catechins, which may help reduce oxidative stress.

For weight loss, studies have shown that green tea extract can help boost the metabolism. Researchers think that the combination of antioxidants and caffeine work together to accomplish this goal.

MOM LOSES FINGER IN FREAK ACCIDENT AT SON'S BASEBALL GAME

For example, in one study, researchers gave participants green tea and guarana extract 30 minutes before each meal. Researchers then analyzed how much energy the participants were burning.

After testing multiple times, researchers found that participants burned an extra 180 calories per day with just this supplement. In addition, green tea extract enhances norepinephrine, a hormone that tells the body to break down stored fat for energy.

Side Effects: Nausea, diarrhea, upset stomach or headaches may occur due to the dietary change or caffeine content. Rare side effects include tremors, seizures or irregular heartbeat. Because of the caffeine content, you should consult with your doctor about using green tea extract if you have a heart condition.

2. Berberine

Another lesser known supplement that provides powerful help is berberine. This supplement is derived from plants and actually enters the body’s cells through the bloodstream, changing the function of the cell. One major benefit that berberine has is its ability to regulate and reduce blood sugar content.

In addition, studies suggest that berberine does boost weight loss directly. In one study, researchers tested 37 participants who suffered from metabolic syndrome.

During testing, the participants took berberine three times per day for three months, and in turn reduced their BMI from 31.5 to 27.4. Also, the researchers noticed that many participants lost abdominal weight and improved other areas of their health.

Side Effects: Common problems with berberine include cramping, diarrhea, flatulence, constipation and stomach pain. Also, you’ll want to discuss whether or not to take berberine if you are already on medication to lower your blood sugar.

3. Meratrim

One relatively new but promising supplement is Meratrim, a blend of two plant extracts. In one study of the supplement, researchers tested over 50 overweight individuals. Participants were told to take the supplement or a placebo twice a day in addition to eating a 2000-calorie diet and walking for 30 minutes, five times per week.

At the end of 16 weeks, researchers found that participants had decreased their weight, triglycerides and total cholesterol. In addition, no participants reported side effects. Because Meratrim is new, you should consider a more well-tested supplement if you have any major health issues.

As popular as it is to use fad diets and supplements to lose weight, your main program should focus on exercise and healthy eating.

However, if you choose to boost your efforts with a weight loss supplement, choose one that fits your lifestyle and keeps you safe. Most supplements do have side effects and risks and should never be taken to lose weight alone. In the end, remember that your improved health is the main goal and that healthy weight loss happens gradually for lasting results.

And there’s no better dragstrip than Atco Dragway in the Pine Barrens of New Jersey, a muscle car hotbed and home to the legendary Jersey Devil.

That’s where I had the chance to strap into the driver’s seat and take a Demon for a dozen runs. I should say “the seat,” because it comes with only one, making it the world’s most awesome pizza delivery vehicle.

And it can haul.

The Demon is the most powerful American car ever made. It has a 6.2-liter supercharged V8 that puts out 808 hp and still gets 22 mph on the highway. It’s an update of the Challenger SRT Hellcat’s 707 hp motor, which now seems quaint — even more so if you fit the Demon with the special engine control module, included in a tool-and-parts kit called the Demon Crate, that allows it to run on 100 octane race gas and bumps the power up to 840 hp to go with its 770 lb-ft of torque.

Over half of the Hellcat engine’s components were modified in the, including the block, and a monstrous 2.7-liter supercharger strapped on to the top of it. The Demon’s 8-speed automatic transmission, driveshaft, differential and half shafts are appropriately beefed-up, as well.

There is no manual transmission available, but the automatic is one of the coolest ever made. It’s equipped with a feature called a TransBrake. It’s a drag racing technology that, in this case, engages first and second gears simultaneously to bind the transmission, so you can step on the gas to build up torque in the engine and drivetrain without having to use the brakes, which wouldn’t be able to hold back much of what the Demon dishes out before the tires started spinning. Meanwhile, a torque converter with a high stall speed lets you rev engine even higher than you normally could without moving as you await the green light.

Before we get to that, a few other notes on the Challenger’s transformation from Hellcat to Demon. With the project’s goals being a sub-10-second quarter-mile and the ability to lift the front wheels on launch, the SRT team knew it had to trim a few pounds — 232 pounds, it turns out — from the coupe’s over 2-ton weight.

Eliminating the passenger seat and rear bench (both can be added back in for $1 each) along with the trunk carpet and spare tire was the easy part. Swapping in some lightweight suspension parts and smaller brakes is indicative of the Demon’s drag racing focus — although it retains its computer-controlled shock absorber system and still handles pretty well for a behemoth.

The suspension plays an important role in the Demon’s straight-line speed, too. When you set the car to Drag Mode, it stiffens the rear shocks and softens the fronts to help transfer the weight to the meaty, 12.4-inch wide Nitto drag radials at launch. The result is a car that can cover a quarter mile in 9.96 seconds on premium fuel and 9.65 seconds on race gas in ideal conditions with a set of skinny “front-runner” tires installed. The Demon Crate comes with a set of rims for a pair.

The first time I gave it a shot, I skipped the TransBrake and used the traditional launch control system to get a feel for things. And oh, how it felt.

You simply press the brake pedal hard, floor the gas, release the brake and become one with the deep bucket seat. I’ve been in quick production cars before, but none prepared me for the violence the Demon took off with. The thunder coming out of the exhaust mixed with the screeching supercharger enhanced the experience in a way the silent electric motors of a ‘Ludicrous’ Tesla never could.

And it pulled all the way down the strip, which I covered in 10.2 seconds at 134 mph. And to think that launch control neuters the car. Using the TransBrake is the way to unleash its full abilities, but you’ll need plenty of your own to go with it.

To engage it, you pull both paddles behind the steering wheel, give it some gas (but not too much) and then, when the screen on the instrument cluster tells you it’s OK, you let one paddle go and take your foot off the brake.

It’ll let you sit there like that for about 15 seconds. You release the other paddle to get moving, and then it’s all you. There’s no traction control in this mode, so you need to modulate the throttle to keep from smoking the tires. It’s easier said than done with all that power, even on a strip prepped with sticky traction compound and rubbered-in. On my first three tries, I botched it pretty good.

I eventually managed to get away cleanly a couple of times, but never did better than the launch control. I’m sure a drag racing regular could.

Jim Wilder, the Demon’s development manager, is one of those. He took me for a run in a two-seat car with front-runners on it and pretty much all I can remember is getting walloped in the back and looking at the sky as we left the line. He may have overseen its development, but the launch control has nothing on him. I was so taken aback by the ride that I spaced out and forgot to check his time. Pride wouldn’t allow me to tell you what it was, anyway.

Dodge isn’t the first to hop up a Hellcat, of course. Plenty of shops have figured out how to get this much power and more out of it. The difference is that the Demon comes with a warranty. Wilder said his team did over 500 quarter-mile runs on a single axle, and more than 900 with the same transmission, and both looked like new when they pulled them out to inspect them. It’s doubtful any Demons will see that much action in the real world.

The Demon starts at $86,090. That’s a lot for a toy, and that’s exactly what it is. But it’s likely a steal at that price.

Dodge is building only 3,300 of them for the U.S. and Canada, and they’ve all been allocated. It did its best to keep dealers from marking them up, but some people are already trying to flip cars they don’t have yet for double what they’re paying, and a few probably will. If not now, then in a few years at one of those collector car auctions on TV.

That is, unless Dodge manages to outdo itself. When the Hellcat came out a few years ago, everyone thought it marked the end of days for the muscle car, and then they went and made the Demon and turned the Hellcat into a commodity. While it is a one-year-and-done model, the Challenger is going to be around at least until 2020, so there’s time for an even more evil encore.

But what the devil would they call it?

We can’t spend our lives locked behind closed doors and afraid to go to concerts, sporting events or other large gatherings.
Lessons learned by providing medical treatment in wars over the past 100 years have improved health care for everyone.
And helicopters played a key role in quickly evacuating the wounded to medical treatment.","For centuries, medical professionals have learned lessons from the casualties of war. In the wake of the horrendous shooting spree that left 58 people dead and sent nearly 500 to hospitals in Las Vegas last Sunday, the medical community – and ordinary citizens as well – should learn lessons about how to respond when an American city is turned into a war zone.

Learning these lessons is critically important to save lives, because the sad truth is that it is just a matter of time before guns, bombs, cars, trucks, planes or something else is used by mentally disturbed people or terrorists to attack innocent people again somewhere in our country.

When people are seriously injured, a rapid response can be the difference between life and death. But we can’t always count on trained medical professionals to be nearby when we need them.

Here are some ideas that can help us all deal with the possibility of violence or another medical emergency suddenly engulfing us:

First, as terrible as the attack in Las Vegas was, we shouldn’t panic. We can be sure that some people will be in the wrong place at the wrong time and fall victim to a violent attack, but the overwhelming majority of us never will. So while we need to be better prepared for an attack, we must not be paralyzed by fear. That in itself is harmful to our health. We can’t spend our lives locked behind closed doors and afraid to go to concerts, sporting events or other large gatherings.

Second, as many of us as possible should get some basic first-aid training. Learn how to administer CPR. How to tie a tourniquet to stop bleeding from a wound. What you can do if someone is burned. How to immobilize a broken arm or leg. You don’t have to be a doctor or nurse to learn the basics of dealing with a medical emergency until the person you are helping can get treatment from a medical professional. Schools should provide this training to children and community groups should make it available to adults.

As a practicing physician I taught my children at home how to administer CPR, how to apply a proper tourniquet and how to deal with penetrating injuries. I remember some of my friends telling me: “Manny, if you want your kids to be doctors that’s fine, otherwise, you’ll be traumatizing them!” No, I don’t necessarily want my kids to be doctors, but rather be involved in our society. We all need to be part of the solution.

Third, know your blood type and have a card in your wallet listing it. Should you ever need a transfusion in an emergency, this information will be important for those treating you.

Fourth, donate blood to a blood bank. Having a plentiful blood supply on hand in an emergency can help medical professional save lives. The American Red Cross website makes it easy to find a blood drive near you by typing in your ZIP code.

In addition to these steps that everyone can take, emergency medical responders should learn lessons from what went right and what might have gone better following the Las Vegas attack and other mass casualty incidents, such as natural disasters. Studies of the emergency response should be shared widely in the medical community and among government officials.

Lessons learned by providing medical treatment in wars over the past 100 years have improved health care for everyone. New lessons learned in domestic attacks can do the same.

For example, the horror of World War I accelerated the learning and technical proliferation of surgery in the field of wound management. We began to learn about what unsanitary conditions could do not only in the battlefield, but in the cities to where the wounded would be transported.

In addition, the development of wound drainage techniques and surface wound antiseptics became the standards in many military hospitals in World War I, minimizing complications from infection. Civilian hospitals then made these improvements.

World War I also brought us the first concept of a blood bank and how the utilization of blood products would potentially save lives. Specific typing of blood became available and preservation of blood products was discovered in order to maintain the freshness of blood.

Surgeons and scientists during World War I became aware of the treatment of shock. Many scientists began to publish in the field of physiology, which led to discoveries for the treatment of hypothermia, fluid resuscitation and oxygen delivery.

World War II gave us the analysis of medical triaging and how important survival is from the time of injury to treatment. This discovery is the hallmark of trauma victim treatment to this day.

In addition, during WWII surgical techniques were improved and subspecialties in surgical training became the norm. The war taught us about the importance of medical teams of nurses, technicians, anesthesiologists and surgeons. More antibiotics were developed beyond penicillin. The treatment of trauma became more sophisticated.

From the end of the Korean War through the Vietnam War and up until 2006, Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH) units were set up in a matter of hours, providing medical treatment near the front lines to wounded soldiers. A book, film and hit TV show made millions of Americans aware of the MASH units.

The Vietnam War gave us not only more sophistication in vascular surgery but also the framework of what it is today to have a trauma center. And helicopters played a key role in quickly evacuating the wounded to medical treatment. Now helicopters are used for the same purpose in this country.

In the long run, I know things will get better. Things will change. Because Good will prevail against Evil. In the meantime, we are in the middle of a war between Good and Evil and we need to minimize the casualties of war.",Dr. Manny Alvarez: The Las Vegas Massacre can teach us important lessons about saving lives,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/07/dr-manny-alvarez-las-vegas-massacre-can-teach-us-important-lessons-about-saving-lives.html

As previously reported, McDonald’s had agreed to bring back the discontinued Szechuan sauce following pleas from Cartoon Network’s adult cartoon, “Rick and Morty.”

McDonald’s announced last week that for one-day only, the fast food restaurant would carry the Szechuan sauce for customers at participating locations.

BURGER KING ITEM HITS GROCERY STORES

That one day – Saturday, October 7 – “Rick and Morty” and Szechuan sauce fans gathered outside McDonald’s restaurants nationwide. Thousands lined up hours before the packets were allowed to be sold, all clamoring for the sweet plum sauce.

However, McDonald’s failed to mention in any of their widespread promos that only 20 packets of the highly anticipated sauce would be available at the stores. The Huffington Post reported that some locations listed online as participating stores didn’t actually have the sauce packets at all or some had sold out before the authorized selling time.

Once the fans realized that the sauce had been sold out after waiting in line for hours, they were outraged. So much so that the police had to be called to disband an angry crowd surrounding a McDonald's in Wellington, Fla.

At another McDonald’s, a mob chanting, “we want sauce,” formed, and the police had to push them back.

Other locations, adults left angry and kids left crying.

The disgruntled customers took to Twitter to vent their frustrations at the chain, claiming false advertising and calling for both a “class action lawsuit” and a “boycott.” The latter became a trending hashtag for the day, #boycottMcDonalds.

McDonald’s responded to the outrage, issuing a public apology on their Twitter account.

“The best fans in the multiverse showed us what they got today,” McDonald’s tweeted. “We hear you & we’re sorry not everyone could get some super-limited Szechuan.”

Fans weren’t buying it, and accused the hamburger joint of just wanting the publicity.

The fast-food giant later released a second apology on Facebook, and promised that there would be more sauce on the horizon.

In a note obtained by MacRumors, Kuo relays that the vaunted iPhone ""supercycle"" won't happen in 2017 as it will take Apple some time to really ramp up production to meet what will likely be staggering demand.

The good news, though, is that Apple has reportedly addressed any lingering production issues relating to the iPhone X's TrueDepth camera system. Recall, Apple reportedly encountered some speed bumps with the TrueDepth camera due to the complexity of the components involved. With that issue seemingly resolved, Kuo anticipates that Apple in 2018 will ship anywhere from 245 -- 250 million iPhone units, a marked increase from the approximately 220 million iPhone units Kuo believes Apple will sell this year.

In the interim, iPhone sales are still going strong, relatively speaking. Though a dip in iPhone sales is to be expected given the mass of users who are holding out for the iPhone X, Kuo writes that demand for the iPhone 8 Plus has been higher than anticipated. So while some analysts have pointed to weak iPhone 8 sales as a sign of weakness, Kuo maintains that overall iPhone 8 demand is where it should be given the looming launch of the iPhone X.

Kuo's note reads in part:

The market generally refers to 2017 as the super cycle of the iPhone, but we think the real super cycle will be in 2018 for the following reasons: (1) TrueDepth Camera's production issues will be significantly addressed in 2018F; (2) new models launched in 2018F will enjoy a longer sales period than those unveiled in 2017; and (3) the product mix, specifications and designs of new iPhone models from 2018F will be more competitive.

Once mass production begins and Apple starts getting the iPhone X into hands of customers, it will be interesting to see if the controversy surrounding Face ID and the device's controversial notch design will wither away. Arguably, the iPhone X is Apple's riskiest iPhone design to date because it remains to be seen if Face ID is actually as seamless a replacement for Touch ID as Apple claims. Additionally, the 'embrace the notch' philosophy advocated by Apple has, understandably, rubbed some people the wrong way, with some folks going so far as to categorize the device as a huge missed opportunity for Apple.

But the truth is, assisted suicide affects everyone.","I’m thankful I don’t live in a state like Oregon, where assisted suicide is legal. When I was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer and told I would probably be dead in four months, I went in an instant from living the American Dream with my wife and son to living a nightmare. In that moment of depression, I might have chosen to end my life.

After a seizure sent me to the hospital, the neurosurgeon told me I had a brain tumor known as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and that the tumor was inoperable. In fact, three different doctors told me there was nothing that they could do.

The news was overwhelmingly depressing. As a United States Marine Corps veteran of the Iraq War, I could have lost my life on a faraway battlefield serving my country. Thankfully I survived, but I had now received a death sentence at home.

With the support of my family, I chose to fight the cancer. I have had some great success with an experimental, cutting-edge treatment and am still alive three years after I was told I had only a few months to live.

Not everyone is so lucky to have the support I do. Since my diagnosis of terminal brain cancer my wife and I welcomed our second son into the world. I would have missed out on so much if I had been given – and had accepted – the option of assisted suicide.

Assisted suicide laws require a prognosis of six months or less to live, but how can we let our life-and-death decisions rest on these prognoses, when even the most experienced doctors are often wrong? My own experience reveals how tragic that could turn out to be.

We also know from the 2016 Oregon Health Report that in Oregon, which 20 years ago became the first state to make assisted suicide legal, only 4 percent of patients considering ending their lives were referred for psychological evaluation.

Yet a 2008 study, published in the peer-reviewed medical journal The BMJ, revealed that 25 percent of patients requesting assisted suicide suffered from major depressive disorder. These numbers suggest that people with mental illness could well be prescribed a death-too-soon, instead of the treatment they deserve.

On top of that, the legalization of assisted suicide injects government and profit-driven insurance companies into everyone’s end-of-life decisions. Just in the last year, more cases have surfaced of patients being denied coverage for care, showing how legalizing assisted suicide results in more abuse and less choice.

Take, for example, Stephanie Packer, a California mother of four suffering from a serious case of scleroderma, a chronic connective tissue disease. She reported that her insurance company denied her coverage for chemotherapy treatment but would pay for her to kill herself.

Then there is Dr. Brian Callister, a Nevada physician who asked insurance medical directors to approve lifesaving, curative treatments for a patient in California and another in Oregon – two states that have legalized assisted suicide. Callister’s requests were denied, and the patients were offered coverage for suicide drugs instead.

People are starting to realize the threat that assisted suicide poses. Though an onslaught of new bills has been introduced, 23 states have rejected laws designed to legalize assisted suicide this year.

And states like Alabama and Ohio recently enacted laws to strengthen the prohibition of assisted suicide. Legislators across the nation of all political persuasions are recognizing that assisted suicide is bad policy and puts people like me at risk.

Some vulnerable populations, like people with disabilities and terminal illness, are at more immediate risk to be adversely affected by the legalization of assisted suicide. But the truth is, assisted suicide affects everyone.

The kitchen has more places for cooties than anywhere else in your home – even more than your bathroom, on average. We are going to look at those spots where bacteria love to hide and give you some tips and tools to keep them clean and sanitary.

1. Sinks. You might be surprised to learn that there are more germs in your kitchen sink than are in your toilet. From raw meat juices, dirty dishes and leftover food particles, the kitchen sink is a hotbed for bacteria. Therefore, any day that you use your sink for preparing food or soaking dishes, pots and pans, it should be washed down with hot soapy water and a sponge.

2. Sponges. Speaking of sponges, there have been many discussions online about the germs found in sponges and what will work to clean them. Recently, The New York Times ran an article that quoted a study from Germany claiming that cleaning a sponge only makes the bacteria on them worse. But after further research, the author wrote another article that said cleaning your sponge is still important to do. So the debate seems to remain up in the air.

However, if you still want to clean your sponge, you can either put it in the microwave on high for a minute or try a new tool called a SpongeBath that uses citric acid to keep the sponge clean and disinfected.

3. Hand towels. Hand towels are magnets for nasty germs. More often than not, we mindlessly wipe our hands on our towels, without thinking what we’re leaving behind. Raw meat juices, raw eggs from batter or even rotting food can often be found on a kitchen towel.

The trick is to change them at least once a week — more often if the towels get a lot of use — and wash dirty ones in hot water. You can also add a teaspoon of bleach to the wash to kill bacteria.

4. Knobs and handles. Every kitchen has more than a few door knobs and handles. Between everyday germs that are on your hands and the food germs you find in the kitchen, those cabinet knobs and handles can be full of bacteria.

You can use a simple solution of distilled white vinegar and some rubbing alcohol in a spray bottle and wipe with a microfiber cloth. The vinegar alone kills 98% of the bacteria, and the alcohol should kill the rest.

5. Salt and pepper shakers. Bet you never thought of your salt or pepper shakers as a place where germs are being transferred, but when was the last time you wiped them down with something other than a wet cloth (if that). These items are being handled by everyone in your family, and therefore germs are being spread to everyone.

6. Refrigerator handles. The handles of your refrigerator are touched countless times a day. Add in the fact that you are opening the fridge with hands that are preparing a meal and you can imagine all the germs and bacteria that are on those handles.

Get into the habit of wiping them down daily if possible. Use the same white vinegar and rubbing alcohol solution previously mentioned.

7. Cutting boards. Wooden cutting boards have proved to be full of more bacteria than a toilet seat. If used for cutting raw meat, they can also contain salmonella, which can lead to cross contamination.

To clean a cutting board, submerge it in hot soapy water after each use. You can also disinfect it with a mix of distilled white vinegar, lemon juice and salt. Consider plastic cutting boards that can go in the dishwasher.

8. Remote controls. TV remotes in any room of the house are apt to hold a variety of germs. But the remote in the kitchen is the worst of all. Food bacteria from meal prepping might be all over it.

Consider keeping the remote inside a ziplock bag and operating it through the bag. That way the germs are on the bag and not in all the cracks and crevices of the remote.

A Russian mechanics expert has restored a Soviet-era military vehicle that moves without the use of wheels or tracks - but is entirely screw-propelled.

Originally built in the 1970s, the vehicle uses giant metal screws which move it forward by twisting across the ground.

Formerly used by the Russian military, the truck was purchased by Alexei Anikin, who is the Director at JSC Plant of All-terrain Vehicles.

His team restored the motor back to working order, recently testing it swampland near the Nizhniy Novgorod Region in Russia.

Alexei Anikin said: “We’re proud that we’re the first in the country who started producing this vehicles after a roughly 30-year break, because, starting from the 1970s such automobiles hadn’t been produced in our country.”

The unique truck can move across most difficult terrains, including water, swampland and snow.

Fitted with a 159bhp engine, it is capable of carrying diggers, cranes and rescue equipment to areas that were previously inaccessible by land.

Umar Vakhidov, Deputy Head of the Construction at Novgorod State Technical University said: “We think, that it will be actively used, at first, by the army, at second, by geologists, by oil and gas producers.

""We got used to solid surfaces, but regions of Siberia and the Far North mostly have creeping soil. This car is vital for oil and gas producers.”

Screw-propelled machines were first used by the military during the Second World War, after a German soldier came up with a design for a snow machine using the mechanism.

The USA used similar vehicles to transport supplies across swamp lands during the Vietnam War, but they have remained largely disused since the mid-1970s.

SAN JUAN MAYOR DONS 'NASTY' SHIRT FOR INTERVIEW ON TRUMP'S PUERTO RICO RESPONSE

Cruz and President Trump have traded shots in the weeks after the monster storm made landfall. Late last month, the mayor appeared on television in a black shirt with white letters that read, ""HELP US, WE ARE DYING."" Cruz argued that federal aid had been slow to reach Puerto Rico following Maria, which knocked out power to the entire island.

Trump tweeted the following day: ""Such poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help."" He added that Cruz was ""very complimentary only a few days ago,"" but ""has now been told by the Democrats that you must be nasty to Trump.""

Later, Cruz wore a short emblazoned with the word ""NASTY"" for an interview with Univision.

Trump visited the island last Tuesday. Afterwards, while Cruz said she hoped new channels of communication with the White House would ""put in motion what is needed"" to save lives, she also said Trump sometimes was more a ""miscommunicator in chief"" than a commander in chief.

""In regards to the power failure, we are restringing a very fragile system everyday,"" Long explained. ""As we make progress, simple thunderstorms pass through, knock the progress out.""

Rebuilding the island, he said, ""is going to be a greater conversation for the Congress in conjunction with the governor.""

When hospitals have power failures, intensive care unit patients are being flown to the USNS Comfort, according to Long.

Columbus Day, the second Monday in October, is a nationally recognized holiday.

Another employee came to the window and attempted to calm the situation. Rios asked for the employee’s name before the second worker asked Rios politely to move out of the drive-thru line.

But we had a pretty good working relationship, all of us on the show.
Eden: No, I didn’t, I really didn’t.","Barbara Eden enchanted audiences across the country with a nod and a blink in the beloved ‘60s sitcom “I Dream of Jeannie” — and 47 years later, she’s still celebrated as a beloved TV icon.

The 86-year-old was recently honored by the Library of American Broadcasting Foundation at the Giants of Broadcasting Luncheon for her decades-long career in film and television. But don’t expect Eden to sit back and enjoy her success.

She has never stopped working and still headlines shows both in the United States and abroad. Simply put, this genie has been long out of the bottle and doesn’t have any plans to vanish in a cloud of smoke.

Eden spoke with Fox News about her favorite memories on set, what her life is like these days and why her belly button was such a hot topic:

Fox News: How does it feel to still be recognized as an icon in American TV?

Barbara Eden: It feels really good! I like it. I’m still active, I’m still working. It’s always good to be recognized for hard work you’ve done in the years past. While you’re doing it, you don’t think of it so much. You’re just working. It’s a wonderful thing for someone to acknowledge it.

Fox News: What’s keeping you motivated these days?

Eden: I just like my work. I think I’m very, very lucky to have found a profession that I fit in. So many people have to make their living doing things they don’t really enjoy, but are necessary for their family. I’m just lucky, very lucky.

Fox News: What is it about ‘I Dream of Jeannie’ that continues to entertain audiences?

Eden: I think it’s a happy show. Of course, the genie and the fantasy is a classic story. So I think people will always be entranced by that magic. But we had a pretty good working relationship, all of us on the show. It made a difference. Larry [Hagman] was so good. And our Dr. Bellows (Hayden Rorke) was wonderful. It just made everything click.

Fox News: What’s one memory you have of Larry Hagman that still makes you smile?

Eden: Oh, there’s so many! We seemed to have the same rhythm in our comedic timing, which was fortunate for both of us. We enjoyed working together… The most outstanding story with Larry was the one when we had a lion as a guest. I had done two feature films with lions and I’ve been told how to treat them. They’re male lions, they’re lazy. If they’re well fed, they don’t really want to eat you. But they do want to play with you if you run around! You have to be very quiet with them. So I went over and I told Larry, ‘We have to go make friends with the lion.’ He goes, ‘I’m not going to make any friends with any bleep lion!’ And walks off!

And so, I walked over and I did the usual things I’ve been trained to do. I scratched him behind the ears. Never the ears, just behind the ears. And I rehearsed with the cat. He was 600 pounds, a big male lion. They put a little bowl of raw meat beside me. He put his head down and nom, nom, nom. Oh boy, that was good. He looks around and he’s very happy. Very, very happy. And then Larry came in. They started the scene.

They put the meat down and he ate his meat. He turned around, looked at Larry, and let out a huge roar! It was the loudest roar you have ever heard in your life. Larry was on the next set. He was gone! But not only was he gone, every single man on that set ran. They broke the camera, one of the pieces fell over and I had a 600 pound lion on my lap purring. He put his head in my lap and started to lick my arm, like a great, big pussycat.

Fox News: Was there a moment from your time on ‘I Dream of Jeannie’ that still sticks out to you?

Eden: Oh my goodness, so many things happened on set. One of them was [when] my mother came to visit the set for the first time. And it was a show in which the genie was trapped in a safe. And inside that safe, don’t ask me why, there was a huge lipstick and a bottle of aspirin. I don’t know why that was in the safe, but it was! And of course, they would jiggle the set whenever someone would pick up this safe. Well, they jiggled it a little too hard and the lipstick fell over and hit me on the head. I was out for a couple of minutes. My mother was having a fit! Just having a fit.

Fox News: What’s the story behind the belly button controversy?

Eden: I have a big 'thank-you' to the media for that. I was on the set one day and [a writer] for The Hollywood Reporter walked on the set and right over to me. He said, ‘I don’t believe you have one.’ I said, ‘A what?’ And he goes, ‘A belly button!’ And then he poked me in the middle! He started writing about my belly button... The next thing I knew, the 'Laugh-In' wanted to premiere my navel on NBC. I know a lot of women are known for very glamorous body parts, but my navel? Ha!

Fox News: You previously starred in the 1960 film ‘Flaming Star’ alongside Elvis Presley. What was your impression of Elvis?

Eden: He was a lovely man. Well brought up. Was a hard worker. A very good actor and wanted to be. This was the only film that he really had a chance of showing he could act. He got excellent reviews on the film. And, of course, it didn’t make a penny because... he didn’t sing a song. That wasn’t what his fans wanted. But he was excellent.

Fox News: How was it working alongside Lucille Ball in “I Love Lucy”?

Eden: Oh my, that was mind-boggling for me. It was the third job I had in Los Angeles and she was so good to me. I can’t tell you how sweet she was. I had a dress on that she didn’t think was outstanding enough. She asked me to take it off and the next thing I knew, she was sitting there putting sparkling things all over it, just to make it look better.

Here’s the star of the show making this young woman look better. She was just so wonderful and so talented. Of course, I couldn’t believe I was there. She wanted to sign me to a contract because she believed in comedy and thought I had a great bent for that. But at the time I had already tested at Fox, and I received the phone call while I was on the set. They picked up my option and so, instead of ""Lucy"" I went to Fox.

Fox News: At any point in your career, did you ever feel typecast because of your success in ‘I Dream of Jeannie’?

Eden: No, I didn’t, I really didn’t. Because after I did ‘I Dream of Jeannie,' I did at least two other television shows. And I don’t know how many television movies playing entirely different kinds of people. I was so busy… So, I didn’t feel that I was ever typecast. In fact, I wasn’t. ‘Jeannie’ just so happens to be the one people remember and that’s all right with me. She’s easy to live with. I really like her.","'I Dream of Jeannie' star Barbara Eden describes working with Larry Hagman, Elvis and Lucille Ball",http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/06/dream-jeannie-star-barbara-eden-describes-working-with-larry-hagman-elvis-and-lucille-ball.html

Harvey Weinstein should go sign up for the dating website OkCupid and make sure he gets that pink ribbon on his profile, branding him a feminist and supporter of Planned Parenthood. The media mogul is the ultimate bro-choicer, an adoring donor to the Democratic Party, defended by some of the left’s most powerful women.

Weinstein has been accused in a lengthy New York Times story of doing some truly horrendous things to women, totally unsolicited − also known as sexual harassment − over a period of nearly three decades. His alleged victims were talented young actresses and other women who had the potential to build successful careers on their own without some ugly, creepy man coercing them into giving him a massage or worse.

But this is Hollywood, and the feminists are the women who defend creeps like Weinstein.

Anita Dunn, a close associate of President Obama who became his communications director for a time at the White House, has been reported to have counseled Weinstein after the allegations broke in the media.

Even more troubling is that celebrity women’s advocate attorney Lisa Bloom is representing Weinstein. This is a woman who has represented victims in high-profile sexual harassment cases. Throwing that legacy away, she agreed to represent Weinstein, whom she said she has counseled that “times have changed” and he “needs to evolve into a higher standard.” Really?

Bloom’s reasoning regarding Weinstein gets better, though: “He has acknowledged mistakes he has made. He is reading books and going to therapy. He is an old dinosaur learning new ways. He wants to reach out to any of the women who may have issues with him to talk to them in a respectful, peaceful way, with me present if that is acceptable to them.”",The Harvey Weinstein Scandal: Why Are So-Called Feminists Defending This Creep?,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/10/09/harvey-weinstein-scandal-why-are-so-called-feminists-defending-creep#commenting

In spite of the horror that we witness on news channels or hear on the radio or read on the internet, I am going bold. I am choosing to allow myself to believe that ultimately people are good.

Pollyanna? Not really. The idea that we live in a world with nothing but hurtful, selfish, attention-seeking criminals, is too much for me, and I am betting, too much for you, too. Who wants to live in a world where there is no love or trust or goodness?

After watching the news coverage of the Las Vegas massacre, or the collapse of the Twin Towers, or rampant school shootings, I could easily allow myself to change my tune on this. Madmen are everywhere, I could think. Let’s cancel every concert, football game, and summer fair. Let’s hide inside, where we all are safe from harm.

But that’s not the world I want. I want to teach my kids to fight for more. I want my friends to find ways to focus on the good. I want my colleagues to create beautiful works that can brighten some dark place. And I am not alone. Most of us believe that the goodness in the world far outweighs the bad. This is not to minimalize the severity of what we see in the news, it is unbelievable, unacceptable and despicable. But, in this world, we have to keep a true perspective that people wish for better. That they wish for goodness.

""I don't know who this man was but I do believe that God sends all kinds of people to our lives who have the ability to share something as simple as a smile.""

Let’s give ourselves permission to still see the good in others. Let’s focus on the simple acts that change our day or perspective. Let’s notice the gentleman holding the door while we struggle with our groceries. Or the bus driver who waits a few extra minutes for the mom who is running late to meet her kindergartener. Or the stranger who pulls onto the side of the road to help change a tire. Or the teenager who steps in to stop a bully. Or someone who offers a tiny gesture of encouragement.

A friend recently shared a story with me about a stranger who offered encouragement that changed everything. She said:

It was my first day back to work after a 12-week maternity leave. I was headed to drop off our baby girl for her first day of daycare. I was a wreck. My emotions were all over the place and I was questioning both our decision for me to return to work as well as the daycare we had chosen back when I found out I was pregnant.

It was early morning on a Monday in January, 2000. I remember it vividly. I was at a two-lane stoplight waiting for the light to turn red when a truck pulled up beside me on the passenger side of my car. The tears were running down my face and I remember praying that this would all be okay. As the truck stopped I glanced through the passenger side of the window and a kind man locked eyes with me and gave me a smile that still resonates in my memory. I don't know who this man was but I do believe that God sends all kinds of people to our lives who have the ability to share something as simple as a smile.

Pruitt made the announcement at an event in Hazard, Ky., casting the previous policy as unfair.

“That rule really was about picking winners and losers,” Pruitt said. “The past administration was unapologetic, they were using every bit of power, authority to use the EPA to pick winners and losers on how we pick electricity in this country. That is wrong.”

He said that on Tuesday, he will sign a proposed rule to formally withdraw from the plan.

“It is right for this administration to say the war is over,"" Pruitt said.

The decision comes after President Trump in late March ordered a review of the controversial program, which was put on hold more than a year ago by the Supreme Court amid legal challenges from, among others, Pruitt himself.

The Clean Power Plan aimed to reduce carbon emissions from coal-burning power plants by having states meet certain targets. Supporters see the plan as a critical plank in efforts to curb global warming, but critics contend it would kill thousands of jobs and take direct aim at the struggling coal sector.

The move to officially nix the program was expected, following Trump's vow to end what he calls the ""war on coal."" Pruitt, however, can likely expect a new wave of litigation from the other side of the debate, as environmentalist groups and allied Democrats are sure to challenge the rollback.

The Clean Power Plan is hardly the only Obama policy being challenged or reversed by Trump. Just last Friday, the Department of Health and Human Services rolled back much of the ObamaCare requirement that employers provide contraceptive coverage.

“This proposal fails to represent any attempt at compromise,” House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said in a joint statement, after the administration announced the demands Sunday night.

The friction comes roughly three weeks after Pelosi and Schumer left a White House dinner with Trump saying they’d agreed to a framework deal to help the young illegal immigrants, as Trump moves to end their protections under the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA).

The Trump administration outlined an extensive list of conditions late Sunday.

“The administration can't be serious about compromise,” Pelosi, of California, and Schumer, of New York, also said in their Sunday night statement. “We told the president at our meeting that we were open to reasonable border security measures … but this list goes so far beyond what is reasonable.”

Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, on Monday questioned what Schumer thinks is “reasonable.”

“You have people who are losing loved ones because they are killed by an illegal immigrant,” Conway said on “Fox & Friends.” “What's reasonable is to stop the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs over the border. I'd like to know what Chuck Schumer thinks is reasonable.”

Trump in recent weeks has turned to Schumer and Pelosi amid frustration with Senate Republicans, after they repeatedly failed to repeal and replace ObamaCare, denying him a major legislative victory and the ability to fulfill a top campaign promise.

Trump left the earlier meeting touting his efforts with “Chuck and Nancy” but was not specific about whether wall funding was a necessity.

The administration's requirements announced Sunday include additional crackdowns on “sanctuary cities” that protect illegal immigrants; reducing the number of incoming refugees; 10,000 more Customs and Border Patrol agents; and new initiatives curbing the number of unaccompanied immigrants who come to the U.S. illegally as children.

“Over the last several decades, respect for the rule of law has broken down and immigration enforcement has been sacrificed for the sake of political expediency,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said after the announcement. “This plan will work.”

House Speaker Paul Ryan’s spokesman Doug Andres said the GOP-controlled chamber’s immigration working group would review the roughly 70-point White House list, then consult with the entire Republican caucus and the administration.

The White House plan is considered a starting point for congressional negotiations.

While the plan is already being embraced by Capitol Hill’s most conservative members, including a number of immigration hawks, backlash is growing among Democrats.

“It is immoral for the president to use the lives of these young people as bargaining chips in his quest to impose his cruel, anti-immigrant and un-American agenda on our nation,” said New Mexico Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham, chairwoman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.

The House Freedom Caucus, the chamber’s most conservative wing, is backing the plan.

“We applaud the administration's leadership on principles that will be critical to any immigration policy changes,” said caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, R-N.C. “We look forward to the administration's insistence on these principles in any deal that is signed into law.""

In dismantling DACA, the administration has argued it was forced to act because federal courts were ready to rule the program was unconstitutional, which would have put the Dreamers’ future in jeopardy.

Trump, in announcing the end of DACA, gave Congress six months to find a legislative alternative.

The White House on Sunday night also asked to limit family-based green cards to spouses and the minor children of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents, in addition to creating a point-based system.

And it called for boosting fees at border crossings, making it easier to deport gang members and unaccompanied children, and overhauling the asylum system.

By Robert Knight, The Washington Times

ANALYSIS/OPINION:

At a forum at the College of William & Mary on Sept. 27, the ACLU got a sample of what conservatives have been experiencing on campuses for years.

As Claire Gastanaga, executive director of the ACLU of Virginia, began speaking to a small audience, a group of demonstrators marched in with a large banner that said, “Blood on Your Hands.” They lined up in front of the stage, holding placards.

Apparently clueless about what was about to transpire, Ms. Gastaaga said, “Good. I like this. Good.”

She went on to say that she was going to inform the students about their right of protest, “which this illustrates very well.”

No, it didn’t. The students shut her down. They began loudly chanting inane slogans, including “ACLU, you protect Hitler, too!” and “ACLU, free speech for who?” and “The oppressed are not impressed!” The ACLU is also apparently guilty of perpetuating a system of “white supremacy” for not defending jackboot tactics like those seen at Berkeley and Middlebury College against conservative speakers.

Not long ago, “interest-based advertising” creeped out a lot of people who couldn’t understand why Facebook, for example, knew what they had just shopped for on Amazon. The truth is that personalized ads are the result of a very impersonal process.

Interest-based advertising crunches bits of data gathered from your browser to make marketing more efficient. Special algorithms analyze your visits over time and across different websites, making it possible to predict your preferences and show ads that are likely to interest you.

But sometimes, all this tracking can be overwhelming. While the process is basically automatic and unmanned, interest-based ads can feel like an invasion of privacy. That’s why many people look for ways to throw the trackers off their scent.

Here are three simple ways to do just that.

1. Wipe out history, turn off cookies

To start, you’ll want a clean slate. You should eliminate any trace of your past searches by clearing all the browsing data, history, cache and cookies from your web browsers.

Next, disable or limit tracking on your gadget, including on favorite services like Facebook. If you’re not sure how how to do this, click here for the steps to wipe out where you’ve been and what you’ve done. Next, make sure to delete third-party advertising cookies. Click here to learn how to remove them and prevent them from coming back.

When you’re finished, take a moment to test your browser with an online security and privacy checker. I like the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s tool that shows you the information about the browser you’re using and your risk level. Click here for the free download and more details.

2. Opt out of ads

You may notice only a handful of culprits, but many companies use algorithms to track your behavior and send you targeted ads.

Thankfully, there’s a way for you to opt out of interest-based, or “behavioral,” ads. The Digital Advertising Alliance lets you review its participating partners. When you first visit the DAA, the websites will scan your computer. Once the scan is complete, you’ll be shown a list of partners advertising directly to you.

From there, you can learn more about the practices these companies use for interest-based ads. You can opt out using “opt-out cookies” that are stored in your browser with your preferences.

Click here for the steps to opt-out of this form of online targeted advertising.

3. Go incognito

Every major web browser — Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari and Opera — has private, or incognito, browsing. Turning this feature on means your browser will ignore cookies, including ad-tracking cookies, and your computer won’t record your browsing history. It’s almost like you were never online.

When your browser is in private browsing mode, it will show a special icon. In Firefox, it’s a mask; in Chrome, it’s a little spy; in Edge, it’s “InPrivate.” These all indicate that you’re in incognito or private mode.

Private browsing will keep your computer safe from casual snoopers. Someone who jumps on your computer won’t see where you’ve been.

Keep in mind that online ads aren’t necessarily a bad thing. Yes, they can annoy us, but they’re also the reason most online content is free. Without them, media outlets and content creators would have to find a different source of revenue. For most of us, seeing a few presumptuous ads is a tiny price to pay.

As reported by sources for the New York Post, the Obamas are apparently waiting for 10 Gracie Square’s housing board to approve the purchase of a unit in the building, which has been home to such famous folks as Gloria Vanderbilt, Anderson Cooper, and former first lady of China Madame Chiang Kai-shek — but it’s also got quite a tragic past, the Post reports.

SEE THE NYC TOWNHOUSE WHERE OBAMA LIVED AFTER COLLEGE

The building has been the site of two very high-profile suicides in the last 30 years, which is enough to make even a New York City real-estate agent think twice about living there.

“I don’t know of any buildings with two suicides,” said Dolly Lenz, CEO of Dolly Lenz Real Estate, in a statement to the New York Post. “It almost says that there is a cloud on the building.”

The first victim of these tragedies was Carter Cooper, the 23-year-old son of Gloria Vanderbilt and the older brother of CNN anchor Anderson Cooper. According to reports, Carter was acting strangely in the months leading up to his suicide, but had been in therapy. Then, on July 22, 1988, during a visit to his mother’s home, he abruptly ran out onto the terrace of his Vanderbilt’s two-story penthouse apartment, hopped over the ledge, and dangled there before letting himself drop from the 14th floor — all while Vanderbilt watched from feet away.

""He let go, and there was a moment when I thought I was going to jump over after him,” Vanderbilt remembered during a 2011 appearance of Anderson Cooper’s talk series.

In Vanderbilt’s 1997 book, “A Mother’s Story,” she also alleged that Carter’s suicide may have triggered by an allergy to medication.

The second, much more recent suicide at 10 Grace Square took place in April 2017, and claimed the life of author, heiress and socialite Jean Stein. Stein, whose works include “Edie: An American Girl” and “West of Eden,” had reportedly been suffering from depression, according to her daughter Katrina vanden Heuvel, and jumped from the 15th floor of the building on April 30, the New York Times reported in its obituary.

A fellow resident who witnessed the suicide has said it was a messy one, as Stein “miscalculated” the jump and landed an eighth-floor terrace. She had also severed her leg in the fall, according to reports.

10 Gracie Square, however, is also infamous for more than these two suicides: In 1982, it was also where sixth-floor resident Frances Schreuder was arrested for conspiring with her son Marco to kill Schreuder’s father, wealthy Utah businessman Franklin Bradshaw.

Schreuder had reportedly been unhappy with the amount of money Bradshaw was allotting her, and persuaded her then-17-year-old son to shoot his grandfather dead in 1978. He was eventually caught, and Schreuder was nabbed while trying to escape out the window of her 10 Gracie Square abode.

As Claire Gastanaga, executive director of the ACLU of Virginia, began speaking to a small audience, a group of demonstrators marched in with a large banner that said, “Blood on Your Hands.” They lined up in front of the stage, holding placards.

Apparently clueless about what was about to transpire, Ms. Gastaaga said, “Good. I like this. Good.”

She went on to say that she was going to inform the students about their right of protest, “which this illustrates very well.”

No, it didn’t. The students shut her down. They began loudly chanting inane slogans, including “ACLU, you protect Hitler, too!” and “ACLU, free speech for who?” and “The oppressed are not impressed!” The ACLU is also apparently guilty of perpetuating a system of “white supremacy” for not defending jackboot tactics like those seen at Berkeley and Middlebury College against conservative speakers.

What was supposed to be a #blacklivesmatter event was populated almost entirely by white students, presumably many from the W&M’s tony Williamsburg campus. Oppressed, they are not, unless you count the unbearable minutes when they can’t find a parking space for their Audis or Beamers.",How the 'Revolution' Is Eating Its Own,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/10/09/how-revolution-eating-its-own#commenting

In the wake of the Las Vegas massacre, some pundits are calling for the shredding of the Constitution and the eradication of our right to keep and bear arms.

Leading the charge is so-called conservative New York Times writer Bret Stephens, who is also a contributor over at conspiracy factory MSNBC.

“Repealing the [Second] amendment may seem like political mission impossible today, but in the era of same-sex marriage, it's worth recalling that most great causes began as improbable ones,” Stephens wrote. “Gun ownership should never be outlawed, just as it isn't outlawed in Britain and Australia. But it doesn't need a blanket constitutional protection, either.”

Good luck to any law-abiding citizen of those countries who wants a gun for protection. And anyway, it has been demonstrated over and over that banning guns does not prevent crime.

The first sight of a daffodil, whether in your garden or in a store, is proof that spring is here. Even better, they’re practically foolproof to grow. They’re perennial bulbs, coming back year after year. They’re cold hardy and don’t need summer water to thrive. They’re also not a target for deer or gophers. If you want to enjoy these bulbs come spring, though, fall is the time to plant.

Caution: Keep daffodil bulbs away from pets, as they are toxic.

Botanical name: Narcissus spp.

Common names: Daffodil, jonquil, narcissus

Origin: Native to Europe and North Africa

Bloom season: Late winter and spring; rebloom every year

Where they grow: Hardy to minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 40 degrees Celsius (USDA zones 3 to 9)

Light requirements: Full sun

Water requirements: Regular water when growing and blooming

Benefits and tolerances: Easy to grow; tolerate most soils and prefer dry conditions in summer; deer, rabbits, gophers, squirrels and chipmunks all avoid them.

When to plant: Begin planting bulbs when the soil begins to cool, approximately two to four weeks before you expect the ground to freeze in colder climates. That might be as early as September in the coldest climates but is more likely October in most locations.

If you live in a warm-winter climate where freezes are late or unlikely, buy the bulbs early when you have the best selection; then store them in a cool, dry spot out of sunlight until your soil temperature has reached about 60 degrees Fahrenheit, or 15.6 degrees Celsius, usually around mid-November.

Daffodil basics. Daffodil lovers and experts categorize the Narcissus genus into 13 divisions. If that is overwhelming, take the easier approach and use familiar common names. Daffodil is used for those with larger blooms, while narcissus refers to those with smaller flowers, which usually bloom early. The paperwhite narcissus, a favorite for forcing, falls into this latter category. Jonquil denotes the N. jonquilla species and its hybrids.

Choosing bulbs. Look for bulbs that feel firm and heavy and don’t show any signs of injury. Store in a cool, dry, airy spot out of direct sunlight before planting.

You might also find other daffodil species and hybrids. ‘Tête-à-Tête’ and fragrant ‘Tiny Bubbles’ are only about 6 inches tall and work well in rock gardens.

If your local selection is limited or you want something unusual, order bulbs online. They will be shipped to you when it’s the right time to plant in your climate zone. Some good sources for bulbs include Brent and Becky’s Bulbs, John Scheepers and White Flower Farm.

Where to plant. Choose a spot in full sun, although in the hottest climates they will prefer partial shade once they finish blooming. Daffodils will tolerate most soils as long as they drain well, though they prefer acidic to neutral soil. Amend your soil before planting if it doesn’t drain well.

RELATED: Grow Them Under a Canopy for Shade

How to use it. Plant en masse or set them among other plants in a garden bed or border. Daffodils also are good choices for containers.

Daffodils can be used to create a woodland or meadow effect. Simply toss a handful of bulbs into a prepared planting area in order to create a more naturalistic design. Adjust the bulbs as needed so the center and one end of the bed are more densely planted, giving the effect that the bulbs have gradually spread from a single spot.

Daffodils are popular cut flowers as well. They’re fine when used alone in an arrangement, but they emit a fluid that will cause other flowers to wilt. If you’re using them in a mixed arrangement, soak them overnight in a separate vase or container before adding them in with the other flowers.

How to plant. Set bulbs, pointed ends up, into the soil two to three times as deep as they are tall, between 3 and 5 inches deep for smaller bulbs and up to 6 inches deep for larger ones. Be sure there will be at least 3 inches of soil over the bulbs in colder climates. Space smaller bulbs about three times their width when planting and larger ones at least 6 to 8 inches apart. If you want, you can add a small amount of bulb fertilizer around the bulbs at this time. Cover with soil, and water thoroughly.

Growing notes. Daffodils are easy to care for once they’re in the ground. Provide additional water in fall if it is dry and through the winter in drought-prone areas. Provide regular water if Mother Nature doesn’t while they are growing and when they’re in bloom. Keep watering until the leaves start to turn yellow; then stop.

Daffodils don’t need summer water. If they get much rain, be sure the soil drains well to prevent bulb rot and other problems.

You don’t need to fertilize bulbs. If you do want to give the blooms some extra help, top-dress the area around the bulbs with a 5-10-10 granular fertilizer when the leaves begin to emerge.

Deadhead the blooms once they’ve faded if you want, but keep the leaves in place. Remove the leaves once they’re completely yellow, lightly work the soil around the plants and then add mulch. You can also add a small amount of 5-10-10 fertilizer around the bulbs at this time if flower production is fading.

Divide only when flower production begins to falter. The best time to do this is right before the foliage completely yellows. Simply dig up the clumps and divide into smaller sections. Replant immediately, or store them in paper bags or ventilated sacks (nylons work well) in a cool, dry, airy spot out of the sun.

Pests are rare, but the narcissus bulb fly can be a problem. Don’t plant any bulbs that are soft or damaged, and cultivate and mulch after foliage dies down to prevent them from finding their way to the bulbs.

Container culture. Daffodils are standouts in containers. You can plant a single daffodil in a 1-gallon container, three to four in a 2-gallon container or masses of them in larger containers. Add potting soil to your container so the bulbs will sit at the same depth as they would in the garden. Rather than spacing them out, crowd the bulbs together to get a massed effect when they’re in bloom. Water thoroughly, and provide water throughout the fall and winter and into the growing season if you don’t get regular rain or snow cover.

In warmer-winter climates, keep the container outdoors and provide additional water if you don’t have enough rainfall. In cold-winter climates where containers are vulnerable, bring into a greenhouse or unheated garage or shed. Water regularly if they won’t receive regular moisture. Bring the containers to the foreground of your garden when they’re in bloom. (You can even sink them into the ground.)

For larger bulbs, one season in a container is all you can expect. Smaller ones, however, can last several years. If you want to keep them going, move containers to an out-of-the-way, sunny spot after the blooms fade. Once the leaves are yellowed, cut them off and add a 5-10-10 fertilizer around the bulbs. Cover with mulch. Begin watering again in fall as needed.",Your planting guide for beautiful yellow daffodils,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/04/your-planting-guide-for-beautiful-yellow-daffodils.html

But it’s not recognized in Los Angeles, where I live. The City Council recently voted to get rid of Columbus Day and replace it with Indigenous Peoples’ Day, commemorating “indigenous, aboriginal and native people.”

This movement sees Columbus as a symbol of destruction, and thus not to be celebrated.

This new day was first adopted in Berkeley, California in 1992. Since then, it’s spread across the nation with increasing speed, as more than 60 cities from Maine to Washington have supported the idea.

While there is plenty to criticize about Columbus, and what followed his arrival, I think this movement is missing the point.

History, in fact, is the story of conquest. We may not like it, but it’s our shared heritage. Not just Europeans, but everyone. The point is not to excuse the worst that happened, but to understand it.

It is true that the conquest of the Americas by Europeans, which starts with Columbus, was very ugly, and involved a lot of violence. But that, for better or worse, is how history worked pretty much everywhere for thousands of years. (Though it should be noted a large portion of the deaths of Native Americans was due to disease, not violence--an inevitable consequence of Old World illness in New World soil. Europe, Asia and Africa, of course, suffered through numerous plagues of their own.).

History, in fact, is the story of conquest. We may not like it, but it’s our shared heritage. Not just Europeans, but everyone. While there is only limited knowledge of what pre-Columbus America was like, it did feature war, slavery, torture and plenty of brutality.

The point is not to excuse the worst that happened, but to understand it. And to see that it is not the essence of Columbus, but rather part of the times. With all that, there are reasons to celebrate Columbus Day.

-- Celebrate Italians (though there is some question as to whether Columbus would have considered himself an Italian -- he was long thought to have been born in Genoa, then an independent city-state in what is now Italy, though everyone from Greece to Portugal to Poland have claimed him as their own). Nevertheless, Italians claim him today and Columbus Day is a good chance to recognize what Italians have contributed to America, and the world.

-- Celebrate the spirit of exploration. It took tremendous bravery to sail off into the unknown. One of the best parts of our humanity is that sense of discovery.

-- Celebrate the spread of Western civilization. Lately a lot of people have been putting down Western civilization, but its spread is one of the greatest things that’s ever happened to humanity.

The West has its good and bad points, but its best ideas—equal rights, freedom of religion, free speech, due process, open scientific inquiry, property rights and so on—have helped all people who adopt them. (Not that the West solely had these ideas, but it put them in a package that wasn’t generally available elsewhere.)

Indeed, the promise of the West has delivered freedom and bounty such as humanity has never known.

And, while we celebrate Columbus Day, we can learn from history and also take time to honor Native Americans. They were the original immigrants to the New World, and deserve their remembrance.

Once we do this, Columbus Day can be a truly inclusive holiday. It needn’t be a battleground, but a chance to celebrate the best within us.",Why celebrate Columbus Day? Here are a few reasons,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/09/why-celebrate-columbus-day-here-are-few-reasons.html

But in America – known the world over as the Land of Opportunity – upward mobility is the national ideal. It doesn’t always happen, of course. But just the possibility draws immigrants from the world over to our shores – my own parents included. For most, education is the key that enables them or their children to break out of poverty and enter the middle class or go higher, as I and millions of others have been able to do.

For this reason, providing equal educational opportunity for all is vitally important – not just for students who can get college degrees that transform their lives, but for America. We need an educated workforce to keep our economy and our nation strong. We need to keep the American Dream alive.

A stereotype persists that – to put it crudely – poor kids are dumb. Cooke Scholars prove every day that this is nonsense. They are some of the smartest and most capable people on our planet. All they needed was a helping hand and financial aid to succeed.

One immigrant who achieved the American Dream and helped thousands more young people do so as well was Jack Kent Cooke. Born in Canada in 1912, he never had the chance to go to college, leaving high school during the Great Depression to help support his struggling family. He went from selling encyclopedias door to door, to leading a band, to being a runner on the floor of the Toronto Stock Exchange, to working as a salesman, to managing radio stations.

Cooke kept working his way up, becoming a part-owner of radio stations, newspapers and a magazine, and then buying a minor league baseball team in Toronto and other businesses. He immigrated to the United States in 1960 and became an even more successful businessman and owner of sports teams, including the Los Angeles Lakers, the Los Angeles Kings and the Washington Redskins.

The Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, which I now head as executive director, has awarded $175 million in scholarships to more than 2,300 high-achieving, low-income students from 8th grade through graduate school, along with comprehensive counseling and other support services. The foundation has also provided over $97 million in grants to organizations that serve such students.

Every year, the Cooke Foundation finds absolutely brilliant students who have overcome incredible obstacles and gives them scholarships. Some of our Cooke Scholars have been homeless, have gone hungry, have been undocumented, have suffered from serious illnesses, have been kicked out of their homes after announcing they were LGBT, have been teenage parents, and have faced other big challenges.

Yet Cooke Scholars have graduated with distinction from some of the top colleges and universities in the world. Some have become physicians, created nonprofit organizations to help others in need, become medical researchers working to prevent and cure diseases, launched successful businesses, become professors, started charter schools, written books, and taken on many other important rules. How sad it would have been if they never had the chance to get a college education and instead spent their lives in dead-end jobs.

Yet a stereotype persists that – to put it crudely – poor kids are dumb. Our Cooke Scholars prove every day that this is nonsense. They are some of the smartest and most capable people on our planet. All they needed was a helping hand and financial aid to succeed.

What’s lacking isn’t brainpower among those with low incomes. What’s lacking is the opportunity to get a higher education and the money to pay for it.

But we should be embarrassed that millions of low-income young people who do these things and are enormously talented hit a cash ceiling when they try to better themselves with a college degree. They should not be denied equal educational opportunity simply because they were born into families of modest means. If given the chance, they can make our nation proud.","America is the land of opportunity, and should be proud of it",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/08/america-is-land-opportunity-and-should-be-proud-it.html

The flying museum, better known as the “Madras Maiden” touched down in Columbia, S.C. Sunday, where volunteers give 30-minute tours to veterans, visitors or families of those who served in the military.

“They do fine…I’m proud of them. [They’re] down in that plane like they were born in it,” WWII Army veteran William Pate said about the volunteers.

From 1944 to 1947, Pate jumped out of C-47’s and C-82’s as an 82nd Airborne paratrooper.

“I enjoyed what I was doing. If I could, I would do it again. But I have a lot of age on me now. I ain’t no spring chicken,” he told Fox News.

Pate and other veterans in attendance swapped war stories with each other and the crew after taking one of the flights over the city.

“It’s just an honor to be able to hear their stories, talk to their families and just keep their memories alive for generations,” Rodney Schneider said.

An aircraft maintainer by trade, Schneider explained his love for planes stretched back to his childhood. This motivated him to reach out to the Liberty Foundation, which organizes the event.

“I’ve been with the airplane now seven-days straight. Sometimes its weeks between when I’m needed,"" Schneider said.

Robert “Max” Maiden, 21, is a co-pilot for the bomber. He flies to different cities every weekend for six months.

“I’ve always loved flying old airplanes…They have a cool story to tell and they are an important part of history,” Maiden said. “You really see people get really emotional and they sit there and they go, 'Aww man this is what my dad did,' or ‘my dad built them’ or 'my dad flew them or is a gunner.' It’s really cool to share that with people.”

Erin Creed traveled to Columbia from Virginia with her father and husband to honor her grandfather, who fought the Nazis in Europe.

“I just could not believe I was on a World War Two plane,” she said. “I had his picture and his favorite hat and I just couldn’t believe [I] was flying in memory of him.”

One of only 12 B-17’s still flying the “Madras Maiden” was built toward the end of the war but never saw combat. In 2016, The Liberty Foundation began operating the aircraft and spends over a million dollars every year for upkeep. The money that is generated from ticket sales or donations helps to cover the costs.

“If that goes away, it goes back into a museum and starts collecting dust and you don’t get to hear it or smell it,” Schneider explained.

The crew’s age and skills may vary, but one thing remains the same -- the love for planes and veterans.

“We get to ride on a WWII airplane that not everybody can do and just the satisfaction of just doing it,” Schneider said.

As a part of its tour across the U.S. the plane is scheduled to make stops in Tennessee and Kentucky.",B-17 bomber flies cross country to honor World War Two veterans,https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/09/29/b-17-bomber-flies-cross-country-to-honor-world-war-two-veterans.html

In the wake of the Las Vegas massacre, some pundits are calling for the shredding of the Constitution and the eradication of our right to keep and bear arms.

Leading the charge is so-called conservative New York Times writer Bret Stephens, who is also a contributor over at conspiracy factory MSNBC.

“Repealing the [Second] amendment may seem like political mission impossible today, but in the era of same-sex marriage, it's worth recalling that most great causes began as improbable ones,” Stephens wrote. “Gun ownership should never be outlawed, just as it isn't outlawed in Britain and Australia. But it doesn't need a blanket constitutional protection, either.”

Good luck to any law-abiding citizen of those countries who wants a gun for protection. And anyway, it has been demonstrated over and over that banning guns does not prevent crime. In fact, it is just the opposite. More guns prevent crime.

Escudero, a 53-year-old woman from Alcala de Guadaira, a town outside of Seville in southern Spain, has been unable to renew her driver’s license or go to the doctor since 2010 because various government officers believe she’s dead -- the result of a seven-year-old clerical error.

“[I have] suffered for more than six years,” she told EFE, according to El Diario de Sevilla.

Escudero said she first learned of the error when she visited the emergency room and her primary care physician checked her out.

“He looked at her, not knowing how to break it to her, and told her that according to Social Security records she was deceased,” her daughter, Marta, told the newspaper, adding “the family has not found the funny side of this story for a long time now.”

The doctor still treated Escudero “because she knew me and knew my situation was urgent,” but that the error needed to be fixed sooner rather than later.

At first, Escudero thought it was just a computer error that could be fixed quickly at the Social Security offices. That wasn’t the case.

“They explained to me that someone probably made a typo or maybe it was a computer error. But we went to the treasury, to the courts…and everywhere I appeared as deceased,” she told the newspaper.

When her husband passed away in 2011, she needed a certification of life to receive widow benefits, but instead was told she could be charged with identify fraud.

“On top of killing me, they find me, without hearing my story,” Escudero said, joking that she is dead to everyone but the banks, to whom she pays loans and mortgage on a regular basis. “On the government’s computers I am dead, but for the banks I am alive and kicking.”

In April 2016, she found out that a woman with her name and data had been buried six years prior in Malaga – about 127 miles away.

She said her daughter called the cemetery and confirmed the burial date and that the remains has been transferred to an ossuary because maintenance fees had not been paid. She also confirmed her mother’s social security and date of birth.

“'Look,' my daughter told them, 'that person is my mother and she is here right next to me,'” Escudero said. “Imagine the woman’s face at the cemetery.”

Earlier this month she filed a petition with Malaga courts to have the grave opened and has offered to do a DNA test – anything – to prove that the woman buried is not her.

Escudero says no one has explained to her how the woman has died, but believes that she has been confused with a sister with whom she has no contact and whose whereabouts are unknown.

She claims Madonna’s assistants owned all of the superstar’s fan mail by default as their employer “did not save, archive or store” the missives.
Instead she gave her assistants “total discretion in deciding how to dispose of the mail,” Lutz said.
“How did you … come into possession of the Tupac letter?” Madonna’s attorney, Brendan O’Rourke, asked Lutz at the deposition.
“Is it your testimony that the Tupac letter was in some pile of fan mail?” O’Rourke asked.","The Queen of Pop doesn’t care about her fans, a former pal reveals in a startling, sworn deposition.

“Madonna didn’t handle her fan mail. She didn’t care,” the ex-friend, Darlene Lutz, said in a Sept. 27 legal grilling about her attempt to auction off the Material Girl’s memorabilia.

Lutz and Madonna had “a longstanding and extremely close personal and professional relationship,” the singer’s lawyer writes in a new Manhattan Supreme Court filing.

“I trusted her not only as a friend but also as someone who assisted me with private matters, including packing up my personal belongings in my residences,” Madonna says in an accompanying affidavit filed in the case late Friday.

The two had a falling out over a decade ago after 20 years of friendship. Now Madonna is suing Lutz for trying to sell off her “highly personal items” including a pair of worn satin panties and a love letter from the late rapper Tupac Shakur.

Lutz has suggested that Madonna never opened the letter her then boyfriend sent her from jail in 1995, less than a year before he was gunned down in a drive-by shooting.

She claims Madonna’s assistants owned all of the superstar’s fan mail by default as their employer “did not save, archive or store” the missives.

Instead she gave her assistants “total discretion in deciding how to dispose of the mail,” Lutz said.

“How did you … come into possession of the Tupac letter?” Madonna’s attorney, Brendan O’Rourke, asked Lutz at the deposition.

“You’re trying to distinguish between a personal letter or fan mail. And if you put two envelopes in front of you, one from a fan and one personal, and they looked exactly the same, what distinguishes that from fan mail,” Lutz said.

“The point is that Madonna didn’t handle her fan mail. She didn’t care,” she said.

“Is it your testimony that the Tupac letter was in some pile of fan mail?” O’Rourke asked.

“Yes,” Lutz answered.

The Manhattan resident didn’t realize she had the letter until 2008, when she started archiving materials in a bunch of boxes in her Manhattan loft.

“When you finally read the Tupac letter in 2008 or 2009, did it not ring any alarm bells in your head that maybe it was not intended to be given to you?” O’Rourke asked.

“I didn’t consider that,” Lutz replied.

Madonna first learned Lutz had the letter when she consigned it to the online auctioneer Gotta Have it! Collectibles last summer.

She insists she opened it when the rapper sent it to her in 1995.

“I have a specific memory of receiving that letter because I had a close personal relationship with Tupac Shakur and I specifically remember receiving a phone call from him while he was in jail,” Madonna said in the affidavit.

“I also have a specific memory of reading the letter. In particular, I remember that he apologized to me. I never gave this letter away,” she said.

“It is intensely personal,” she added.

The note is a breakup letter that begins, “First and foremost, I must apologize to you because like you said, I haven’t been the kind of friend I know I am capable of being.”

Shakur then explains that he’s ending their relationship because of race.

“For you to be seen with a Black man wouldn’t in any way jeopardize your career, if anything it would make you seem that much more open and exciting. But for me, at least in my previous perception, I felt due to my ‘image’ i would be letting down half of the people who made me what I was.”

The minimum bid for the letter was $100,000. It was yanked from the July auction after a judge put the sale on hold following the end of the case.

The 354-foot-high falls, which are one of the seven natural wonders of the world, are a truly stunning sight to see. As HuffPost reports, the mighty river above pours 250,000 gallons of water per second off the cliff and into the waters below.

But while the power, beauty, and sheer force of the falls leaves most people with a sense of respectful fear, for others, it simply makes them want to dive right in. And luckily for them, for a few short months a year you can.

Atop the falls, tucked away in a small sliver of space next to Livingstone Island, sits a teeny, tiny pocket of water known as the Devil’s Swimming Pool. It is there that adventure-seekers can dive in, be pushed to the brink of disaster, and hang over the top to check out the death-defying view.

If you’re interested in experiencing this thrill, you need to plan your travels very carefully. According to Zambia Tourism, the pool is only accessible during the dry months from mid-August to mid-January, as the river’s levels drop substantially to reveal the pool below.

“For the rest of the year, anyone foolish enough to enter the waters would be instantly swept to their deaths,” the tourism site explained. “But when levels drop, the natural rock walls of the Devil’s Pool come close enough to the surface to form a barrier and stop swimmers [from] being carried away.”

So if you’re highly adventurous and just a little bit crazy, head out for the thrill of a lifetime.

President Trump set his sights on the National Football League when he lashed out at athletes who protest the national anthem before games.

The response from the NFL and its players was swift and unavoidable as games have brought opposing teams together, united against a common enemy: the president.

Read on for a look at Trump's gripes with the sport.

Pence out of the game

Vice President Mike Pence attended the Indianapolis Colts game in his home state Sunday – but not for very long.

Pence and his wife walked out of the game after players from the San Francisco 49ers kneeled during the national anthem.

“I left today’s Colts game because [Trump] and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag or our National Anthem,” Pence said in a tweet.

“While everyone is entitled to their own opinions, I don’t think it’s too much to ask NFL players to respect the Flag and our National Anthem,” he said in another tweet.

Trump later tweeted that he was “proud” of Pence and his wife, Karen, for leaving the stadium.

Jerry Jones’ play call

Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said his players must stand for the national anthem – if they don’t want to remain seated on the bench for the game.

""I know this, we cannot ... in the NFL in any way give the implication that we tolerate disrespecting the flag,"" Jones said Sunday after his team’s loss. “We know that there is a serious debate in this country about those issues, but there is no question in my mind that the National Football League and the Dallas Cowboys are going to stand up for the flag. So we're clear.""

When pressed on other signs of protest, such as players holding up a fist at the end of the song, Jones reiterated that “if there’s anything that is disrespectful to the flag, then [they] will not play.”

Cowboys gain ground with Trump

After the Dallas Cowboy’s Monday night game earlier in September, Trump tweeted that “big progress” was made.

Along with team owner Jerry Jones, the Cowboys briefly knelt together before the national anthem. But when the “Star-Spangled Banner” played, the Cowboys stood with locked arms. The Arizona Cardinals did the same.

“The booing at the NFL football game last night, when the entire Dallas team dropped to its knees, was the loudest I have ever heard. Great anger,” Trump tweeted.

“But will Dallas dropped to its knees as a team, they all stood up for our National Anthem,” he continued. “Big progress being made – we all love our country.”

Trump has said that he had spoken to Jones, calling him a “winner who knows how to get things done.” He also said athletes “will stand for our Country!”

Sarah Sanders takes a shot

White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said that it is “always appropriate for the President of the United States to defend our flag, to defend the national anthem and to defend the men and women who fought and died to defend it.”

Sanders was asked multiple times about Trump’s attack on the NFL during a press briefing and suggested that athletes should protest “the [police] officers on the field who are protecting them instead of the American flag.”

Race versus respect

Trump said that his issue with athletes’ protests was about “respect” for the U.S. and not race.

“The issue of kneeling has nothing to do with race. It is about respect for our country, flag and national anthem. NFL must respect this!” he said.

Brady breaks Trump’s tackle

Despite his friendship with Trump, New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady said he disagreed with the president’s remarks.

“I certainly disagree with what he said. I thought it was just divisive,” Brady said.

Game time decisions

After the president’s speech and tweets, multiple NFL teams and players decided to take a stand – by taking a knee or remaining in the locker room during Sunday's games on Sept. 24.

The Pittsburgh Steelers, Seattle Seahawks and Tennessee Titans all remained in their locker rooms while “The Star-Spangled Banner” played.

Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin said the decision was made by the team “not to be disrespectful to the anthem, but to remove ourselves from this circumstance.” Alejandro Villanueva, an offensive tackle and former Army Ranger, came out alone and stood while the anthem played.

NFL Sunday kicked off with players for the Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonville Jaguars taking a knee or locking arms during the national anthem. Other teams followed suit.

While the locked arms was meant to be a display of unity among NFL players, Trump tweeted his support for the gesture.

""Standing with locked arms is good, kneeling is not acceptable. Bad ratings!"" he said.

Trump tweeted a total of six times Sunday about the American flag and protests.

Trump tackles athlete protesters

While in Alabama to campaign for Sen. Luther Strange in the final days before the special election, Trump took a moment to slam athletes who kneel in protest during the national anthem – reigniting a debate that had begun to be dormant.

""Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say 'get that son of a b---- off the field right now, out, he's fired,'"" Trump said to cheers.

“You know, the NFL ratings are down massively, massively,” Trump said as he railed against the league’s officiating on certain tackles. “A referee gets on television, his wife is sitting at home, she’s so proud of him. They’re ruining the game.”

Trump accused ""those people taking a knee"" during the anthem of ""hurting"" football and encouraged people to ""leave the stadium"" if just one player protests.

Buffalo Bills come up short

Before he became president, Trump owned the New Jersey Generals of the now-defunct United States Football League. Trump pushed for the league's games to be played in the fall, in competition with the NFL, and was widely blamed for the collapse of the league.

After the USFL folded in 1985, Trump unsuccessfully tried to be a NFL team owner.

Trump lost a bidding war to become the Buffalo Bills' new owner in 2014. He was outbid by Terry Pegula, 66, who reportedly paid $1.4 billion for the team.

Trump decried the NFL and the team on Twitter multiple times after losing the ownership fight.

“The [NFL] games are so boring now that actually, I’m glad I didn’t get the Bills. Boring games, too many flags, too soft!” Trump said on Oct. 13, 2014.",Trump tackles the NFL and national anthem: A timeline,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/09/trump-tackles-nfl-and-national-anthem-timeline.html

I don’t think so.”Telsa has been contacted for comment.","Car giant General Motors has slammed tech start-up Tesla for planning to release autonomous vehicle technology before it’s ready.

Tesla’s entrepreneurial boss Elon Musk claims his cars “already have the hardware needed for a full self-driving capability”, known in the industry as a “Level Five” engineering standard.

However in a briefing about autonomous cars to Australian media in Detroit overnight, Scott Miller, General Motors’ director of autonomous vehicle integration said “I think he’s full of crap”, when asked what he thought about Musk’s claim.

“If you think you can see everything you need for a Level Five autonomous (car) with cameras and radar, I don’t know how you do that,” said Mr Miller.

“To be what an SAE Level Five full autonomous system is, I don’t think he (Elon Musk) has the content to do that.”

The car industry tests extensively before releasing new technology to the public.

“We put the customer in the middle of everything; we think it’s irresponsible to say (a car has fully autonomous capability) at this point,” said Mr Miller.

“The level of technology in doing what it takes to do … Level Four or Level Five, which is cameras and radar, I don’t think it’s physically possible (with what Tesla currently has),” he said.

“I think you need the right sensors and the right computer package to do it. We have lydar, radar and cameras on (our cars). The reason we have that type of sensor package is … to be deeply integrated into Level Five, you should have some redundancies (back-up measures in case of equipment failures).”

Mr Miller added: “Do you really want to trust one sensor measuring the speed of a car coming into an intersection before you pull out? I think you need some confirmation.”

Mr Miller said lydar and radar systems do a good job of measuring object speed and cameras do a great job of identifying objects.

Tesla’s autopilot hardware technology suite includes eight cameras, one radar and ultrasonic sensors.

“You can use the right sensor images to give you competence in what you’re seeing,” said Mr Miller. “That’s important if we’re going to put this technology out for general consumption to the public.

“Could you do it with what’s in the current (Tesla) Model S? I don’t think so.”
