HGTV programs like “Tiny House, Big Living,” which have helped popularize the movement, often gloss over this not-so-tiny detail. But the many Facebook pages and websites devoted to tiny-house culture are obsessed with it: Online discussions are dominated by requests, if not outright pleas, for tips on how and where to find tiny-house-friendly locations.

Zoning regulations in most places — especially densely developed regions like the New York metro area — typically do not allow full-time living in temporary structures like R.V.s or movable tiny houses. Most tiny homes are built on wheeled trailers that can be towed. Unlike R.V.s, however, tiny houses are generally not wheeled for touring, so much as for flexibility of location.

Zoning also commonly specifies a minimum home or lot size that is too large and expensive for a lifestyle geared toward affordability. Residential building codes can also present a problem for tiny houses built on foundations.

As a result, “easily upwards of 90 percent of tiny-house owners are living illegally, when it comes to zoning,” said Andrew Morrison, a professional builder and tiny-house advocate in Oregon who travels the world teaching seminars on tiny-house construction.

“A very small minority live in R.V. parks, though they usually have a limit on how long you can stay,” he said. “A friend or family’s backyard, or land in the country, is much more common.”

For some, flouting zoning restrictions is an accepted, even celebrated, aspect of a culture that rejects the American appetite for big houses, rampant consumption and excess stuff. “It’s one of the last things we have where you can kind of stick it to the man,” Marcus Stoltzfus, a co-owner of Liberation Tiny Homes, near Lancaster, Pa., said with a smile.

In the right setting, illicit tiny-house dwellers can usually get away with it. “If it’s off the road and you’re on good terms with your neighbors, you probably won’t have an issue,” said Dave Cramer, an owner of Hudson River Tiny Homes, in the Albany area.

But with the tiny-living craze having lasted well past the fad stage, pressure is growing for municipalities to embrace tiny houses as legal residences. And more tiny-house building companies are popping up, anticipating just such a shift.

“The way they’re legalizing it, it’s coming from West to East,” said Tori Pond, who opened a tiny-home company called Craft & Sprout with her husband, Ken, in Greenwich, Conn, last year. “It’s a matter of when, not if.”

So far, advocates have made the most progress in changing ordinances governing so-called accessory dwelling units and backyard cottages. Some high-cost municipalities, including Fresno, Calif., and Nantucket, Mass., now allow tiny houses to share land with existing homes.

“It’s a spirit of cooperation,” Mr. Morrison said. “It’s a simple way to bring in affordable housing that doesn’t cost the municipality anything.”

Advocates hope the movement will gain more ground in coming years now that the International Code Council has approved a model code for tiny houses for inclusion in its International Residential Code, the most widely recognized residential building code in the country. Mr. Morrison, who led the effort to write the code, said it should alleviate both safety and aesthetic concerns for those states and municipalities that adopt it.

“There’s a fear that people are going to end up living in shanty shacks,” he said. “We don’t want that either. We want people to be safe in their houses, and in something they can afford.”

For the time being, however, finding a place to live long-term in a tiny house requires creativity, flexibility and considerable networking.

For Amy Garner and John McCarthy, it was a conversation over coffee with a well-connected architect that led them to the ideal location for their 340-square-foot tiny house in New Haven: waterside, at a marina on the Quinnipiac River.

For about $400 a month, including utility hookups, the couple enjoy up-close views of the river through the glass front of their Traveler XL, a high-end tiny home made by Escape Traveler. The spot alongside the docks has made their home a favorite hangout for friends, despite the close quarters, and it is only about a mile from their business, a Pilates studio.

“It’s perfect,” said Ms. Garner, 30. “You wake up in the morning, and the sun reflects off the water, and you get this twinkle effect on the bedroom ceiling.”

They have been there since April without issue, other than the occasional curious passers-by. And now they have a like-minded neighbor: A woman living in an Airstream, an aluminum-sided travel trailer, recently moved in behind them.

Lisa Cohen and Richard Ratcliff, who met last spring while hiking the Appalachian Trail, are hoping for similar stability while they finish converting a school bus they bought on eBay into a tiny house. Finding a place to park it within reasonable commuting distance of Sarah Lawrence College, in Bronxville, N.Y., where Ms. Cohen is a graduate student, was no easy feat.

“We asked a few farms, a gardening center and a flea market,” Ms. Cohen, 27, said in an email. “Everyone was kind and said they would think it over, but then would either not answer calls or said ‘no’ in the end.”

Eventually the couple found a restaurant owner in Dutchess County willing to let them park off to the side of his lot for $150 a month. (They asked that the restaurant not be identified.) Settled there for about a month now, they have access to electricity and well water. The train ride to Sarah Lawrence takes Ms. Cohen about 90 minutes, with three transfers, but she is appreciative of the spot, which she deemed preferable to “ending up in Walmart parking lots.”

Brianna Welch, 25, starts graduate school at the University of Vermont in January, and hopes to move from her Bronx apartment to the Burlington area in a 340-square-foot tiny house being built by Craft & Sprout. She and her husband, Chris Murphy, a 24-year-old software product manager, are actively hunting for land to rent, hoping to get settled before the first snow.

As of last week, they had no promising prospects. A year-round R.V. campground they looked into is already booked for the winter. Someone offered to rent them a building lot, but that particular town would require them to install a septic system, at a cost of about $18,000, and pay an $8,000 impact fee. As they look for farmland to rent, the couple are tapping sites like Tiny House Hosting, on Facebook, for connections.

“I think it’s going to be through our network that we find someone who knows someone who has land,” Ms. Welch said. “We knew this would be the hardest part, but I didn’t think it would be this hard.”

Finding a site in rural towns is often easier, because of the likelihood of looser zoning and enforcement. In Lodi, N.Y., for example, Eleanor Liebson, an occupational therapist, is hoping to start a tiny-house community on a portion of the 100-plus acres she owns near Finger Lakes National Forest. “There’s the potential because there’s no zoning in our town,” she said. “We can do it.”

The downside to remote sites, however, is the absence of readily available utility hookups. Seth Porges, a science and technology journalist, found that out after he bought a 180-square-foot tiny house last February. He put the house on rented farmland in the Hudson Valley to use as an Airbnb rental, and imagined it would be an off-the-grid experience.

The house had a solar energy system, 50-gallon water tanks and a dry-flush toilet. But he quickly realized that the solar power supply was not nearly robust enough, especially when the air-conditioner was on. And the water supply lasted only a few days before it had to be replenished.

“People think they’ll throw their house on a cheap piece of land and that’s the end of it,” said Mr. Porges, who lives in a regular house in a nearby town. “They don’t realize all the logistical challenges they’re going to face.”

He wound up hiring an electrician to lay heavy-gauge extension cords connecting the tiny house to a power supply elsewhere on the farm. And he invested in hoses specially designed for potable water to run downhill to his house from a spigot. But come winter, he expects those hoses will freeze, once again necessitating the use of the water tanks.

As for the dry-flush toilet, it functions as expected, essentially “shrink-wrapping your waste,” Mr. Porges said. But the disposable cartridges are fairly expensive: He calculates the cost at about $1 per flush. Other bathroom options for tiny homes include composting and incineration toilets.

For Kerri L. Richardson, a clutter-clearing coach and the author of “What Your Clutter is Trying to Tell You,” the hassles of tiny-house living are more appealing than the headaches of being tied to a traditional single-family home. She and her wife, Melissa Silk, sold their 2,200-square-foot home in Newburyport, Mass., about three years ago and have been gradually downsizing ever since. They are currently renting a 500-square-foot apartment in Groton, Conn., while building a 240-square-foot tiny home on a trailer.

“The roots that we had planted felt more like shackles,” said Ms. Richardson, 46. “It takes some courage to go against that societal template of life, but we decided we wanted to have more experiences and less things.”

As they both are able to work remotely, their plan is to tow their house up to northern New England later this fall – although they haven’t yet found a place to park it. While they’re not entirely averse to living under the radar, they would prefer to find a town where they can live aboveboard, Ms. Richardson said.

And if all else fails, they have a fallback: a year-round R.V. park they heard about in New Hampshire. “That’s our last choice,” Ms. Richardson said. “But if we have to, we will do it.”",Where Can You Park a Tiny Home?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/realestate/where-can-you-park-a-tiny-home.html

The country has also detained dozens of foreign nationals on similar charges, including several Americans. It has become increasingly clear that they are seen as potential bargaining chips in Ankara’s efforts to force the extradition of Mr. Gulen.

The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has also expressed anger over the charges brought against 15 of his bodyguards over their use of violence against protesters in Washington in May, and over court cases against a former cabinet minister and three others in a case of conspiracy to violate sanctions against Iran.

President Trump has praised Mr. Erdogan as a stalwart ally in the fight against terrorism. And he said last month after a meeting on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly that ties between the two countries were “as close as we’ve ever been.”

Turkish officials seemed to be taking steps to ease tensions by midday Monday. The Foreign Ministry called for an end to the visa suspension since it was causing “unnecessary victimization,” the Turkish state news agency, Anadolu reported.

Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gul said in an interview on live television that there was no decision for any further arrests of United States employees, dismissing local news reports that prosecutors were preparing to detain another consulate worker.

Yet Turkish news outlets reported further detentions. The Istanbul Chief Prosecutor’s Office was quoted on Monday as saying that a worker at the consulate in Istanbul, who was identified only by the initials N.M.C., had been invited to the prosecutor’s office for an interview. The man’s wife and child were taken into custody in town of Amasya. Two more people were detained in connection with the case of Mr. Topuz, the news channel NTV reported.

Driving rain, withering heat and sawdust storms come with the job. This used to be men’s work. Not anymore.



Making charcoal for sale out of the refuse from nearby sawmills, work for the desperate and destitute, has become almost exclusively women’s work in San Pedro. It may have started with one widow from Bogart, a desperately poor slum, who ventured into one of the three charcoal fields in San Pedro, the Parc Du Pont, intent on making a dollar to feed her family.

Ms. Choumali, a freelance documentary and fine art photographer from Abidjan, was on an assignment in San Pedro when she first spotted the phenomenon.



Three years later, Ms. Choumali’s project, “Sissi Barra (The Work of Smoke),” illustrates the harsh reality for women with few choices, the poorest of the poor, in the Ivory Coast. While the country is enjoying an economic revival and now boasts Africa’s fastest growing economy, the charcoal producers of San Pedro live like paupers. Her conversation with Evelyn Nieves has been condensed and edited.

Q.

What drew you to this topic?

A.

I was passing by this park at the entrance of the town, an immense expanse of coal-black soil, and hundreds of busy people around smoke-filled ovens. I then noticed that they were mostly women. I was intrigued by the contrast between the harshness of the place and the presence of these women, adolescents and little children.

Photo

Q.

Do you know why the industry has gone from all male to almost all female?

A.

At first, this work was exclusively masculine. Women began to become interested when Makandjé, the oldest of these women and leader of the Women Coal Producers Association of the Parc du Pont, dared to venture into this field. She first started assisting male producers, then started her own oven. Today, she has inspired hundreds of women follow her example. Men progressively deserted the charcoal field. Now, most of the men we meet around these fields are wood sellers or carpenters. Charcoal fields are usually near wood manufacturers.

Q.

What did you witness in your three years of documenting the “work of smoke” that stands out?

A.

Some women, like Makandjé, are widows; some are part of a polygamous marriage or have been repudiated. Except for one, Awa, they have no other qualifications, and have no choice but start to work in this field to survive.

All the decisions are made together. I was impressed by the solidarity and unity between the women. They support each other. They have a joint financial arrangement where they contribute equally to save money. I was inspired by the strength, the resilience and the dignity they have.

Q.

What are they made of? Who builds them?

A.

The ovens are made of wood and sawdust left by the carpenters and wood manufacturers. The women build them themselves. The last day of my stay one of the women invited me to work with them. I collected the trash wood from manufacturers that they sometimes use because they can’t afford to pay for good wood. Then we placed the wood in a very specific way to make the oven. It takes a whole day or more to build an oven, depending on the size, and each oven is made for only one time. They can’t be reused.

Photo

Q.

What are some of the hazards?

A.

The sawdust is very light and it is a powder and as the place is very windy, this sawdust enters the eyes and the nose, and sticks on the skin. The eyes are irritated. My eyes and nose were irritated the first day, so I had to wear glasses and a mask to avoid the smoke and the wind with sawdust.

Then there is a lot of heat on the floor from all these ovens which are on fire underneath.

After when the charcoal is ready, they break the oven and collect the hot charcoal and put into bags with their hands. The charcoal is sharp and hot. They need gloves.

So they need masks, proper work shoes, boots for example, and gloves. They do not have enough tools to work, since it’s too expensive for them to buy one for each of them. They share their tools. During the rainy season, the mix of mud and sawdust becomes a sort of moving mud. They also need boots. And as they do not have raincoats, some of them protect themselves with pieces of plastic they find or go without protection from the rain.

After trying to work with them for a day I got sick. The work is physically hard. I couldn’t do it for more than two hours. Everything is done by hand.

Photo

Q.

What do you plan to do with this project?

A.

This project, made possible with the support of the Magnum Foundation Emergency Grant in 2016 and the Prince Claus Fund, is finished. I am very happy because next month, I will go back to San Pedro to introduce the team of “The Poplin Project,” a socially responsible brand of artisanal textiles that wants to empower women and to create a future for underprivileged kids by working with small local organizations and cooperatives. This year, 33 percent of their profit will go to the women’s cooperative of charcoal producers of “Sissi Barra” in San Pedro. The aim is to finance a drinking water system, to build a safe recreation room for the women and children and to help the young girls get an education.

— “This is the other arm. Was she wearing a black abaya?” Daoud Salem Mahmoud shouted as he lifted the bone from the rubble and held it out to the small group looking on. A piece of cloth still clung to the sinews. “This one is a black abaya.”

Mr. Mahmoud and a small band of men had picked carefully through the remains of a demolished city street of Mosul, digging through personal belongings and the crumbled walls of family homes.

The work was slow and laborious. They were searching for the dead.

Two months after the ferocious, nine-month battle to liberate Mosul from Islamic State militants, much of the city lay in ruins. Government forces supported by coalition planes had carried out repeated strikes, and the militants had fiercely defended their positions. Thousands may have died in the fighting, many lying uncounted beneath the rubble.

Now that the fight has moved on, the city has turned it attention to recovering those bodies to return them to their families. That task has fallen to the city’s Civil Defense workers, mostly trained as firefighters and rescue workers.

The are focused on the devastated Old City district, where Islamic State fighters made their last stand. The workers move cautiously to avoid leftover bombs and unexploded suicide belts. In August, one of their officers was killed and three crew members were wounded when they disturbed explosives.

It took most of the day for a rotating crew of more than 10 men using an excavator to retrieve just two bodies. The men have months of work ahead of them.

This day, the crew worked slowly and methodically as Sondus Mazaal, her husband and her elderly aunt Nadhira Aziz waited anxiously for any signs of their relatives or their personal belongings.

Mrs. Aziz, the homeowner, sat in a plastic chair 15 feet from the excavator. At times she was engulfed in dust whipped up as the driver dumped mounds of stone and parts of her house beside her, but she refused to move.

She directed the driver and shouted at the men on the ground to retrieve books and bags that she saw poking out of the debris. By the end of the day she was surrounded by a pile of tattered belongings that she wanted to bring with her. When the men said they were unable to bring all of the belongings with them she almost refused to leave.

Nadhira Aziz watched as Iraqi Civil Defense workers dug out the bodies of her sister and niece from her house in the Old City where they were killed by an airstrike in June.

There are still dangers.

A week earlier, the men said, someone shot at them and immediately fled. It was hard to fathom how an ISIS fighter might still be alive months after the battle had ended, and in an area that was largely razed, but the men were on high alert.

The sprawling ancient quarter is now largely sealed off from residents who used to live there, but soon after the crew arrived on this recent morning, some of the group began shouting.

They had come across a young man hiding in a partially collapsed building. He had managed to survive in an area cut off from the rest of the city months after the fight had ended. He denied being an ISIS fighter. But he was found with a mobile phone, some money and four automatic rifle magazines.

A man suspected of being an Islamic State militant was found hiding in the rubble.

Earlier in the day, Mrs. Mazaal had confirmed that the arm bone belonged to her sister. Now, after hours of digging, the crew found her mother in what was once a basement.

Iraqi Civil Defense workers recovered the body of Sondus Mazaal’s mother, who was killed by an airstrike in Mosul’s Old City in June.

Much of the room was still intact, a shelving unit standing along one wall. Her body was almost fully intact, but heavily decomposed after months buried under debris.

Three men worked delicately, digging by hand to remove the mortar and twisted metal around her body. They wanted to remove her body as carefully as possible.

It took most of the day for a rotating crew of more than ten men using an excavator to retrieve just these two bodies. The men have months of work ahead of them.

There was no time to grieve as the men carried the three bodies through the destroyed streets over piles of masonry, past uncleared improvised explosives.

They are also being asked to retrieve those who were hastily buried during the months of fighting before their families fled.

Five members of Fouad Mohammed Sadi’s family died during one week in June. As the push to retake the Old City was in full swing, his wife, his 10-year-old daughter and his brother’s wife were killed when their house was hit by what he believed was a heavy artillery strike aimed at targeting ISIS militants in the area.

“They told us to stay at home and then they bombed us,” Mr. Sadi said.

Mr. Sadi and his brother survived and early the next morning, under continued shelling, buried the bodies before they fled. Mr. Sadi has one remaining daughter and they now live with relatives on the east side of Mosul.

He returned with the Civil Defense to the spot where he had buried his family to exhume their bodies from the shallow grave on the outskirts of the Old City and give them a proper burial.

Leyla Hasan Said sat beside the bodies of five of her relatives and others belonging to another family after workers recovered their remains.

Iraqi Civil Defense workers and Mr. Sadi’s relatives carried the bodies of his wife, daughter and sister-in-law through his heavily destroyed neighborhood in the Old City.

Mr. Sadi wept as helped to lower the bodies of his wife, daughter and two brothers into the ground.

Under Mr. Sadi’s direction, the team of ten men dug into the rocky ground. It didn’t take them long to hit the wooden panels Mr. Sadi had used to crudely cover the bodies. The men removed the remains and placed them in white body bags, as Mr. Sadi leaned in to try and identify his family. There was no time to grieve as the men carried the three bodies through the destroyed streets over piles of masonry, past uncleared improvised explosives.

Mr. Sadi’s two brothers were killed that same week in June, when their home was brought down by an airstrike aimed at targeting ISIS militants in the area. On the same day he dug up the bodies of his wife and daughter, he watched as the Civil Defense workers recovered the remains of his two brothers from what was left of their house.

Before the sunset, Mr. Sadi buried them in four graves, side-by-side in a cemetery in western Mosul.

He never broke down, but he wept quietly throughout the day as he kept himself busy directing the workers.

The New Generation of Japanese Accommodations

Any traveler to Japan knows that its sense of hospitality — the sober, subtle beauty of the country’s lodgings, and the elegant, unobtrusive service within them — is unmatched anywhere else. For years, visitors could choose between two kinds of hotels: the Western kind (though often reinterpreted with Japanese materials, textiles and sightlines), or the traditional Japanese inn, the ryokan. Ryokans were originally built in medieval times to keep traveling merchants in comfort, offering ofuro baths, woven tatami floors and simple breakfasts of fish, tofu, rice and pickled vegetables. The new generation of Japanese accommodations, though, are neither ryokan nor hotel: They are restored samurai-era mansions, or refit prehistorical huts or even a Baja-esque beach camp. Significantly, many are also in less expected places — small towns and regions where tourists rarely go — giving travelers a chance to explore a part of the country they might otherwise not.

Genshimura

Kosuge, Yamanashi Prefecture, Honshu

A two-hour drive west of Tokyo will take you to the mountainous village of Kosuge in Yamanashi Prefecture, known for hiking trails that wend around waterfalls, the occasional hot spring and tributaries from the Tama River. After a day of exploring, nature lovers can return to Genshimura , which also draws families and history buffs searching for glimpses of Japan’s prehistoric Jomon period (10,500 B.C. to 300 B.C.). Here, in a small valley surrounded by forest, is a miniature replica of a Jomon village, with three simple, straw-encased huts that sleep eight apiece. As in days gone by, they offer the brave visitors who stay within them practically no amenities aside from shelter and a (non-working) fire pit. Luckily, there’s a soba shop on the grounds known for its handmade buckwheat noodles. And for those in search of slightly less rustic accommodations, the property also offers stone cabins with bunk beds and a stilted hillside bungalow, with a narrow river running below.

It’s actually situated within Wild Beach , a “seaside glamping park” a few blocks from the water, with an amusement park (complete with a Ferris wheel) next door. The complex has four retrofitted trailers and eight canvas tents decorated with wood floors, twinkling fairy lights and proper beds. Rhinos’ guests, meanwhile, can choose from a trio of free-standing two-or-three-person glass-steel-and-wood apartments, each with its own interior aesthetic. Vintage Black, for instance, evokes a retro-cool beach shack, with shiplap walls, distressed leather club chairs and a steamer trunk for a nightstand. Otherwise it’s a whitewashed Mykonos-style option or an indoor safari scene, with tribal rugs and Kaare Klint-like canvas chairs. Despite the surfer vibes, there’s no actual surfing here — but there is a sandy outdoor seating area with communal grills for barbecuing and s’more-making.

Kiraku Obi

Obi, Nichinan, Miyazaki Prefecture, Kyushu

Even within Japan, few know about the collection of bukeyashiki — Edo-era samurai houses from the 19th century — in the town of Obi near Kyushu’s southeastern coast. Shrouded in cedar forests, many were abandoned and left to decay in recent decades. Now a company called Kiraku is trying to restore them as private villas, beginning with two that opened this year. The first, Katsume , which can accommodate up to six, is hidden behind a stone gate, and while its exterior and the extensive gardens had been preserved by the local government, the clean-lined interiors have been fully modernized (and include both a kitchen and a washing machine). The other property, Ohya , a five-minute walk away, is a long, one-story structure that was once a gatehouse for a larger samurai estate. In this house, which also sleeps six, there’s a traditional okudosan (stove) that guests are welcome to use. For more history, they can tour the nearby ruins of Obi Castle, a stone and cedar fortress that was originally built in the 15th century, or eat at Gallery Kodama , a merchant-house-turned-restaurant that serves a breakfast of rice, fish, vegetables and a sweet rolled omelet, called tamagoyaki.

Guza Farmhouse Stay

Fujibaru, Mitsuse, Saga Prefecture, Kyushu

Rural areas in Saga Prefecture on Kyushu, the southernmost of the country’s four main islands, are dotted with working farms, several of which welcome overnight visitors, offering access to a way of Japanese life rarely seen by tourists. (Agriculture, once the country’s dominant industry, has declined dramatically since 1960; it now makes up about 1 percent of the economy.) Perhaps the best nouka minshuku (farm guesthouse) is at Guza , a 100-year-old house with a neighboring barn that a husband-and-wife team converted to a two-bedroom inn in 2006. It’s about an hour from Fukuoka, Kyushu’s largest city, and especially worthwhile for food lovers — guests have a chance to help harvest bamboo in spring, sample the farm’s own unfiltered sake (called doburoku ) and gather any of the 100 different kinds of fruits and vegetables grown on the property, including zucchini, shiitake mushrooms, okra, blueberries and plums. The hosts cook guests’ meals on an outdoor wood-fired stove before readying the goemonburo — a deep, circular cast-iron tub filled with steaming hot water.

Malnutrition has also left them vulnerable to illness. Teachers are not being paid, and 12,000 of the nation’s 14,400 schools are effectively closed. More than 700,000 Yemenis — half of them children — have suffered from cholera.

Mohsina, whose family name has not been used to protect her identity, said in a telephone interview from a safe house in Sana, Yemen’s capital, that during the month she spent with her new husband, he beat and raped her nightly, often leaving her bleeding and in too much pain to stand. So she convinced him that she wanted to contribute to the household finances by begging on the roadside.

“The minute I was on the street, I ran,” said Mohsina, who is now 15.

Yemeni law does not set a legal age for marriage, nor does it criminalize marital rape.

Yemen’s conflict began in 2014 when Shiite rebels from the north, known as the Houthis, allied with parts of the armed forces and stormed Sana, later pushing the internationally recognized government into exile. That led to the involvement of Saudi Arabia and other Arab states in the conflict that followed, which has shattered the country, with competing administrations in the north and south.

The fighting has also forced many families to make the most of their dwindling assets. In some cases, those assets are their children.

“All my girlfriends are either getting married or praying for a divorce,” Mohsina said.

Mohsina was forced to marry a man she did not know, Fawzy Mohamed, last winter after the potato chip factory where her father worked in Sana was destroyed in an airstrike by the Saudi-led coalition, which is supported by the United States.

Unable to find new work, her father, the family’s sole breadwinner, accepted Mr. Mohamed’s offer of a $1,300 dowry, she said.

She had never seen her husband, a distant cousin, before getting on a bus with a relative for an hourslong ride to his hometown with nothing but the clothes on her back. On the way, the relative told her that Mr. Mohamed worked as a garbage collector and already had another wife and children.

There was no wedding ceremony.

“When I got there, Fawzy told me to undress,” Mohsina said. “I didn’t want to, so he started kicking and slapping me.”

After she managed to flee, she returned to Sana, where she lives with the family of Maged al-Ajmal, a wealthy tribal leader who has converted a room in his house into an informal shelter for abused girls.

He temporarily takes in about 10 girls fleeing early marriages every six months, he said. Mohsina is the seventh he has received this year.

Mohsina said her father refused to take her back, because it would mean returning the dowry. So Mr. Ajmal is trying to raise the money so that her husband will accept a divorce.

“What her husband did to her destroyed her psychologically,” Mr. Ajmal said.

Neither her father nor her husband could be reached for comment.

The war has also preyed on boys’ childhoods. Many child soldiers have been sent to the front lines by poverty-stricken parents who need their sons’ meager pay of about $55 every three months — enough money to support a family of five for two weeks.

Before the war, the United Nations had documented about 900 child soldiers in Yemen. Now, it has found about 1,800, according to Ms. Relano. The actual number was assumed to be higher.

“I only joined the fight after I got sick of sleeping all day,” said a 17-year-old fighter who joined the Houthis in Saada Province, near the Saudi border, last year. “Most of my classmates are now my comrades.”

He and his father, a civil servant, spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals from the rebels, who deny the presence of child soldiers in their ranks.

“He thinks there is no alternative,” his father said. “He also knew I had no money, and he wanted to help.”

As with early marriages, children’s rights advocates say the war makes it hard to determine how widespread the use of child soldiers is, but they believe that it has spread in recent years and that it is more common among the Houthis than other armed groups.

Activists say the warring parties discreetly recruit children, many of them well under 18, flouting the country’s minimum age restriction for military service.

“These officers tell the boys that they can’t claim to be men or Yemenis without joining the fight,” the father said. “It’s a cruel thing to do to a child. They don’t understand the risks they are taking, and they feel like they will be worthless if they don’t go with their friends to fight.”",Yemen’s War Turns Children Into Young Brides and Soldiers,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/09/world/middleeast/yemen-war-children.html

Moonee is six. She lives in the shadow of Disney World, in a stretch of central Florida dominated by cheap thrills and off-brand amusements. Home is a room in a motel called the Magic Castle, one of many garishly painted stucco-clad palaces whose names represent either false advertising, honest aspiration or brutal irony. This is an unmagical kingdom, a zone of tawdriness and transience, of strip clubs and strip malls, knockoff souvenir shops and soft-serve ice cream shacks.

But for Moonee (who is played by an uncannily poised and resourceful young actress named Brooklynn Prince), the Magic Castle and its surroundings are a land of endless enchantment and nonstop adventure. Mischievous and fearless — heroically bratty; devilishly cute — Moonee may remind you of Eloise, who tries the patience of the grown-ups at the Plaza Hotel in that immortal picture book. Their situations are different, of course. Moonee’s mother, Halley (Bria Vinaite), is not jetting around Europe leaving her daughter in the care of a stressed-out nanny. She’s very much a presence in Moonee’s life, perhaps more big-sisterly than maternal, but doing whatever she can to keep them housed, clothed, fed and entertained.

Video

What “Eloise” shares with “The Florida Project,” Sean Baker’s risky and revelatory new film, is the ability to tell its young heroine’s story from two perspectives at once. Moonee’s free-range existence looks like a lot of fun, and she and her friends — mostly a boy named Scooty (Christopher Rivera) and sometimes a girl named Jancey (Valeria Cotto) — run wild with an exuberance that adult viewers can only envy. Moonee and Scooty are like Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer; the service road is their Mississippi River. They cook up pranks and follow their whims, heedless of the consequences.

But of course the viewer who experiences vicarious delight in their capers — ice cream tastes so much sweeter when you have conned some tourists into paying for it — is simultaneously conscious of an undertow of sorrow, anxiety and dread. We are well aware of the possible consequences, and also of the grim circumstances that grant Moonee her freedom. She is in every sense a child at risk. We watch her Little Rascal antics increasingly sure that something terrible is going to happen.

To balance joy and desperation as gracefully as Mr. Baker does — to interweave giddiness and heartbreak — is no easy feat. “The Florida Project” could easily have been cruel and exploitative, punishing its characters for their wildness and the audience for enjoying it. But the director, who wrote the script with Chris Bergoch, avoids the traps of condescension and prurience that ensnare too many well-meaning movies about poverty in America. Like Mr. Baker’s earlier features “Starlet” and “Tangerine,” this movie insists on meeting people on both sides of the screen where they are, on suspending judgment and extending compassion without abandoning its ethical grounding.

Worshiping Santa Muerte, ‘Holy Death,’ in Queens

To her followers, Santa Muerte is a powerful healer, a bringer of prosperity, an agent of vengeance. Some ask her for green cards, lovers, health, protection against violent drug cartels or immigration agents. Some ask her to punish their rivals. They call her the Pretty Girl, the White Girl, the Godmother, the Bony Lady and dozens of other names, including Santisima Muerte, most holy death.

Little celebrated before 2001, and rejected by the Vatican , she has garnered a following of 10 million to 12 million devotees in Mexico and beyond — the fastest-growing religious movement in the Americas, said R. Andrew Chesnut, a professor of religious studies at Virginia Commonwealth University and author of “ Devoted to Death: Santa Muerte, the Skeleton Saint .” Her following includes drug lords, hard-working families, prisoners and members of sexual minorities.

Here in New York, the photographer Griselda San Martin , 38, a native of Barcelona, followed a trail of saint worship to a transgender Queens woman named Arely Vazquez, who since 2006 has thrown a lavish annual party to honor Santa Muerte, and holds monthly gatherings in her home. “It’s social as well as religious,” Ms. San Martin said of the gatherings. “They pray, almost like at a Catholic church, then she cooks. Everything is free. And she cooks very delicious.”

Most of the attendees are immigrants, which gives the gatherings a different flavor than the ones she has attended in Mexico, Ms. San Martin said. “The fact of immigration puts them on the margins of society, so this makes them feel they belong to something,” she said. “They’re connected.”

Despite the Vatican’s condemnation, many devotees consider themselves Catholic, and turn to the Godmother for extra intercession, Prof. Chesnut said. The Bald Lady doesn’t care if you’re gay or straight, rich or poor, a narco trafficker or a narc — death has a place for you. “Not like the Catholic Church or the evangelical church,” he said. “Death doesn’t discriminate. She takes all comers.”

SAN JUAN, P.R. — Gov. Ricardo A. Rosselló of Puerto Rico discussed the aftermath of Hurricane Maria and the needs of island residents with a reporter from The New York Times on Tuesday. Here are his remarks, edited for length and clarity.

Q. What keeps you up at night?

A. The safety of the people of Puerto Rico. I haven’t slept much. It’s been very intense, but I am committed to making sure that during this emergency period we have our people safe, we can make sure they are alive, getting food and water. After we stabilize the situation, we can think about how to rebuild Puerto Rico.

Q. What’s your biggest worry?

A. Here’s my worry: the perception that this is just, for lack of a better term, this was a regular hurricane impact. This is a major catastrophic event here. Puerto Rico, within the span of two weeks, received two Category 4-5 hurricanes. That has never happened anywhere. The devastation has been enormous.

Q. Have you spoken to President Trump?

A. I have spoken to him at least five times. A few hours ago, I was in the Situation Room briefing him. He has been acting proactively. He issued two pre-landfall emergency declarations for Puerto Rico. That had never been done before. He declared Puerto Rico a disaster area practically while the storm was still hitting Puerto Rico.

Q. What do you tell him? The phones are down; the lines are around the streets and back; hospitals are closed. Where do you begin to tell him what you need?

A. There are several priorities. The health care situation, making sure we have hospitals running, making sure we have situational awareness of those hospitals.

We have fuel in Puerto Rico, the distribution has been a little slow. We have been hard pressed to find bus drivers; we are hard pressed to communicate with people. It’s been a little slower than expected.

Q. What happened to the drivers?

A. Several things. There has been severe devastation on many parts of the island. There are places still disconnected in terms of roads. People can’t get out of where they are at. If you happen to be a driver that was there, you can’t leave.

Second, and this is happening to all our government employees: There has been a reduced percentage of people who have reported. Some have reported to say, “Hey we’re stuck, we can’t leave.” So those are the reasons. We are finding more of them. Things are moving.

Again, the anxiety builds because people feel there is no fuel, when there is. And we made some progress there: 48 hours ago, we had 181 gas stations open, and now we have 450.

Q. How many are there total?

A. 1,100

Q. For there to be this level of a communication failure, was there a failure of some kind, was it an inevitable act of God and nobody’s fault, or was there a problem somewhere?

A. If we are going to talk about the root causes, our energy infrastructure had not been maintained properly for, you know, over a decade. We had a very, very weak energy infrastructure. I came in eight months ago, and one of our objectives was to go to the private sector and see how we can refurbish and renew this infrastructure. It was subject to collapse even when there wasn’t an emergency or an event like this.

Communications are essentially down. It affects essentially everything. In terms of some underlying problems that we had, sure, I would significantly point to a few: the power generation structure. It was old, it was unmaintained.

Vulnerable housing, houses made out of wood. They just didn’t stand a chance. They just didn’t stand a chance. That’s why our efforts five days before the storm was, “Hey, if you are in a flooded area, or in wooden housing, or mudslide region, get out or you will lose your life.”

Q. How is it that there are hospitals without generators and satellite phones?

A. Most hospitals have generators; they ran out of fuel. What we are doing in terms of fuel is making sure it gets to hospitals.

Some capability of sat coms should be around the island. We didn’t have it. What we have been doing is, provisionally, I’ve been going personally and my team has been going personally to different sides of the island and handing over sat phones to the mayors so they can communicate.

But again, once the infrastructure collapsed, in terms of the energy grid, and because we had many obstacles in the roads, and some communities were essentially cut off, those things aggravate one another. There’s no communication, there’s no direct linking, and that’s why this became an enormous challenge.

Q. How long will it take to restore power?

A. It depends. Pockets will be restored earlier. There was severe devastation. To give you a sense, Irma came by, Irma shook the power grid. We had to revamp it. It took us about 10 days to get to 97 percent. Not one tower was harmed. I saw personally at least 30 towers, in pieces, collapsed. This is completely different. We are going to need generators.

Q. Are you pleased with the pace of aid, the relief?

A. Here’s the thing, and I want to be very clear with this. I am very pleased with the consideration the president has given to Puerto Rico. He has been on top of it, at least personally in communication with me and communication with some of our officials as well as his officials. However we still need more, and the president understands that, and his team understands that.

Because it was an unprecedented event, on an island, that’s something needs to be considered. This is not a Category 3 hurricane going to Florida, causing severe devastation but also having the access of people in Georgia, New York and so forth driving down and giving you the resources. We have to actually bring them down by boats or airplanes. And adding to that, air traffic control has been clogged. We are working at about a 20 percent clip. With that 20 percent, when we notified the administration, they took action quickly, they opened alternative airports that would alleviate the need for more resources to come to San Juan.

Q. You were tough yesterday in your words and suggested Puerto Ricans were being treated as second-class citizens. Presumably you meant in comparison to Texas and Florida, which were recently hit by storms.

A. I was [giving] a warning essentially to Congress, to take action. I wanted to make sure, and I think that message got across, that people know [our] people are U.S. citizens.

Q. I’ve had people on social media tell me that they hoped Puerto Ricans would not be able to come to the United States, because we’ve already met the 50,000 refugee cap.

A. So this is why there needs to be some orientation on this front, which is one of the reasons that the federal government also needs to act. If it doesn’t act, one of the outcomes is a massive exodus of Puerto Ricans, who are U.S. citizens, and can fly in and fly out without any sort of paperwork, they just need to buy a plane ticket. That will cause deep demographic turmoil for us here in Puerto Rico and it will cause deep demographic turmoil in the states where they go as well.

Q. You talked about a humanitarian crisis. Are you worried about disease?

A. My words yesterday were to warn about a possible humanitarian crisis. We don’t want the United States to have a humanitarian crisis, and it could happen here in Puerto Rico.",What Keeps Puerto Rico’s Governor Awake at Night,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/us/governor-puerto-rico-rossello-hurricane.html

The raid was carried out with near perfection, though it cost the lives of four hostages and of the commando leader, Lt. Col. Yonatan Netanyahu, the older brother of the current Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.

A new era in counterterrorism had dawned. Joshua Shani, a retired Israeli brigadier general, was there, having flown the first C-130 Hercules cargo plane to land at Entebbe. He told Retro Report: “It was like the whole world say, ‘Wow, they have chutzpah, these guys. They are damn good.’”

They were so good that the United States tried something similar in April 1980 to end a hostage crisis in Iran that traumatized this country. Fifty-two United States diplomats and other citizens had been taken captive five months earlier under a new Iranian theocracy hostile to America. From the get-go, this rescue mission, code-named Eagle Claw, would not be an easy assignment for a Delta Force commando unit still in its infancy. “The only difference between this and the Alamo is Davy Crockett didn’t have to fight his way in,” said Mr. Ishimoto, who was an intelligence officer on the Delta Force raid.

Almost everything that could have gone wrong did. Two American helicopters were disabled by severe dust storms over Iran. Separately, a third one broke down. Still another crashed into a tanker aircraft; eight servicemen were killed. It was a disaster that left America humiliated — and left the hostages stuck for nine more months.

But failure can be a powerful teacher. Eagle Claw was. What emerged within a few years was a well-trained, disciplined force of special operators groomed for counterterrorism, hostage rescue and other demanding missions. The force today is perhaps 10 times as big as it was in 1980, when its numbers, Mr. Ishimoto said, were between 6,000 and 8,000. As for successes, one need look no further than the 2011 SEALs raid on a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where the Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was found and killed.

With Americans weary of war without end since Sept. 11, 2001, President Obama withdrew most conventional soldiers from Iraq and Afghanistan. At the same time, he turned the Joint Special Operations Command into a dray horse. Its members are just about everywhere: Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, Syria, Somalia, Pakistan, you name it. Their impact can be deadly. But their footprint is lighter, and less costly, than that of a fully decked-out Army operation.

This commando force plainly appeals to Mr. Trump, who has shown scant faith in “soft power,” the use of diplomacy and humanitarian example to win friends and influence nations. His budget proposals have included many billions more for the Defense Department and billions less for the State Department and the Agency for International Development. In his first half-year in office, military special operators were sent on about five times as many lethal missions in what for the United States are non-battlefield countries — Yemen, Pakistan and Somalia — as there had been during Mr. Obama’s final six months.

Relying on them so heavily has a price. Though they make up roughly 5 percent of the total armed forces, they have accounted for at least half of the nation’s combat deaths since 2015. The risks were evident mere days into the Trump presidency when a member of the SEALs was killed on a flawed night mission in Yemen that also left more than a dozen civilians dead.

It’s easy to romanticize commandos. Just ask any Hollywood director. But they are not supermen. Even Israeli forces have lost their post-Entebbe glow, with blemished missions in Lebanon and Gaza that led to their own men and innocent civilians being killed.

Some military experts worry that even though the American teams also have chutzpah and are damn good, they are being asked to do too much too often. “These guys truly are amazing warriors,” Russell D. Howard, a retired brigadier general who was a special forces commander, told The Cipher Brief, a website focused on security issues. “But they’re more than that. They’re smart, flexible, adaptable and unafraid.” The problem, General Howard said, is that “the guys are still deployed all the time.”

“These guys are a national treasure,” he said. “In my day, it cost an average of $1 million to train a special forces soldier. Now it probably costs closer to $1.5 million, and you don’t waste that asset. You use them judiciously when you really need them.”",Special Ops Forces: How Elite Forces Became Military Muscle,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/25/us/special-ops-retro.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

It’s certainly not beheaded.”With wicked delight, Ms. Thede continued, “Unless they don’t do their jobs.","To the extent that her weekly 11 p.m. show is aimed at black viewers, Ms. Thede said, “I’m speaking to stories that matter to us.”

But her approach, she said, is the same one taken by the other members of late-night TV’s mostly white male fraternity. Those hosts, Ms. Thede said, “are speaking to the stories that they feel matter to them — they’re certainly not saying, ‘Women, don’t watch,’ or ‘Black people, don’t watch.’”

What will ultimately bring an audience to “The Rundown,” Ms. Thede said, is the opportunity to laugh and “to get an authentic opinion about stories they’re not going to hear anywhere else.”

The program is both a risky proposition and a potential breakthrough for BET, which has a sporadic history of late-night talk-show programming, and for Ms. Thede, who was most recently the head writer and an occasional performer on Comedy Central’s “The Nightly Show With Larry Wilmore.”

On a recent Wednesday morning, Ms. Thede was working out of her corner office in Midtown Manhattan, a work space furnished with a designer tick-tack-toe board and some down-market fidget spinners.

As she prepared to shoot a test show later in the week, Ms. Thede noted several news stories that “The Rundown” could mine for material: professional athletes protesting racial injustice; O. J. Simpson’s release from prison; facial-recognition software that misidentifies black people.

Ms. Thede explained, “We’re not going to spend a half-hour telling you Trump is bad, because black people didn’t vote for him anyway. They know that.”

“The Rundown” is BET’s first late-night talk show since “The Mo’Nique Show,” which ran from 2009 to 2011. Mo’Nique, the comedian and Academy Award-winning actress, was one of very few black women to have hosted such a program, including Wanda Sykes (whose Fox show ran one season in 2009-2010) and Whoopi Goldberg (whose show ran in syndication from 1992 to 1993).

Connie Orlando, BET’s head of programming, said in an interview that Ms. Thede had approached the network just when it was looking to expand its after-hours offerings.

“It was something that made sense for the direction we’re going in,” Ms. Orlando said of “The Rundown.” “We realized our real prime time starts at 10, and our audience loves to laugh. It felt like the perfect moment to add the voice of an African-American female to the conversation.”

Ms. Orlando said she believed the program’s topical content and viral potential would help it reach viewers who might not otherwise be watching BET.

“The show’s going to cover anything from Cardi B to what’s happening in the White House,” she said, “and I think all kinds of audiences will be interested to know and listen to what Robin has to say.”

Ms. Thede has broken ground here before: When she joined Mr. Wilmore’s “Nightly Show” as its head writer, she became the first black woman in late-night TV to hold such a title.

Mr. Wilmore said in an interview that when he sought Ms. Thede for the job, “she was already getting ready to move to New York and knew, in her mind, that she had the job.”

“That’s Robin’s personality,” Mr. Wilmore added. “Whatever happens in her mind is going to be real — she’s that strong of a thinker.”

Ms. Thede grew up in Davenport, Iowa; her mother, Phyllis, is now a Democratic member of the state’s House of Representatives. Her father, Dave, a teacher, turned her on to the comedy albums of Richard Pryor and Eddie Murphy, and Ms. Goldberg’s performances on “Comic Relief.” Ms. Thede was named after Robin Williams.

She performed in campus sketch-comedy groups while a student at Northwestern University’s Medill School of Journalism, and trained at the Second City improv theater in Chicago. Before she joined up with Mr. Wilmore, she wrote for several BET awards shows and its reality-TV satire “Real Husbands of Hollywood,” and was head writer of daytime TV’s “The Queen Latifah Show.”

“The Nightly Show” provided Ms. Thede with opportunity and exposure. She was the head writer for Mr. Wilmore’s performance at the 2016 White House correspondents’ dinner, which drew some criticism when Mr. Wilmore referred to President Obama as “my nigga.”

Today, Ms. Thede shrugs off any backlash. “Those jokes still hold up, and they’re genius,” she said. “I think that, in an age of Trump, history will be kinder to that performance.”

The abrupt cancellation of “The Nightly Show” in August 2016 was a gut punch but did not turn Ms. Thede off from late-night comedy.

“I sold this show like two weeks later,” she said with a laugh. “I was sad, and I’m still sad — it felt like we should have been able to stay on through the election. But I wasn’t discouraged at all. I was empowered.”

Though she never felt she had to compromise her voice at Comedy Central, Ms. Thede said that while she was there, “because you’re speaking to a majority-white audience, you are explaining things a little bit more from your perspective.”

“On BET,” she continued, “I don’t have to take that step. I can just speak how I speak.” (Both BET and Comedy Central are owned by Viacom.)

At its outset “The Rundown” will not feature any comic correspondents or celebrity guest interviews, just Ms. Thede’s satirical takes as well as skits and documentary segments that will feature her. (There will also be occasional pop-up concerts by surprise musicians.)

As she gets ready to take center stage, Ms. Thede is drawing inspiration from other late-night stars like Samantha Bee, of TBS’s “Full Frontal,” who, she said, naturally gravitates to subjects that other hosts overlook; and Jimmy Kimmel, of ABC’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live,” who has offered his intensely personal perspectives on broader issues of health care and gun control.

Mr. Wilmore, who has remained a friend of Ms. Thede’s, said the proliferation of topical comedy programs would make it challenging for “The Rundown” to find an audience, but not impossible.

Recounting advice he had given Ms. Thede, Mr. Wilmore said, “Just be the best version of who you are onscreen, and whatever happens after that, you can’t really control. Either it’ll cut through that or it won’t. But the more you’re that, the better chance you have.”

While Ms. Thede is mentally preparing herself for a healthy, 10-year run, she said she is already proud to have given jobs to candidates who had not previously worked in late night.

By her own estimate, Ms. Thede said that on a staff of about 40, 75 percent were women and/or people of color, and she said several departments were headed by women.

She stopped herself for a moment. “Headed by a woman? Is that a word? That sounds odd. It’s certainly not beheaded.”

Premium prices for hot Broadway shows — especially those with limited runs or popular stars nearing the end of their runs — have been climbing as producers try to claim for their investors and artists some of the revenue now going to resellers.

Although the prices are shocking to some consumers, many in the theater industry are sympathetic to the practice as a way to counter a booming secondary market that affects popular music and sports as well.

But Victoria Bailey, who as executive director of the Theater Development Fund both runs the most prominent ticket discounter (TKTS) and is an advocate for greater access to theater, said the stratospheric prices create a problem, both real and perceived.

“More and more people think Broadway tickets are $800 and it stops there, and the question is, ‘Can the industry find a way to make it clear that there are other tickets available?’,” she said.

For some fans, the cost is worth it.

”If there’s something you really want to do, and you can afford it, do it,” said Paul M. Lisnek, a political analyst and theater podcaster in Chicago who paid $750 to see “Hello, Dolly!” from the front row of Broadway’s Shubert Theater this summer. “She’s an icon and a legend,’’ he said of Ms. Midler, who hadn’t been in a Broadway musical in five decades, “and I just thought it was amazing.”

Asked what he thought of a $998 ticket, Mr. Lisnek said “that might turn out to be a bargain compared to what things are going to go for on the secondary market.”

But for others, the prices are just too high. On Friday, John Landrigan, a Memphis retiree, walked up at the box office for “Dolly!” hoping to get tickets to see Ms. Midler before she leaves, but he blanched at the $550 tickets he was offered (or $229 for obstructed view seats) on the Sunday after Thanksgiving.

Instead, he bought tickets to see Ms. Midler’s replacement, Bernadette Peters, in April, for $125 each.

“Five-hundred and fifty is just too far,” he said. And then, alluding to the film adaptation of the musical, he added, “I can just watch Barbra Streisand and Satchmo on my big TV.”

Many tickets to Broadway shows are available at deep discounts, and many shows are not as expensive as the handful of big hits. But plenty charge top dollar for the best seats — generally center orchestra, side seats just off the aisle, and the first rows of a mezzanine.

During the week that ended Oct. 1, according to figures reported by the Broadway League, six shows sold top-priced seats with face values over $300 — “Hamilton,” which had a top price of $849; “Dolly!,” at $748 (the $998 price is for seats to shows starting late next month); “The Book of Mormon,” at $477; “Dear Evan Hansen” at $448; “Anastasia” at $350; and “Come From Away” at $347.

“Premiums have really changed the game in the last year and a half, because of ‘Hamilton,’” said Merritt F. Baer, a co-founder and president of TodayTix, a company that sells full-price and discounted theater tickets via mobile app. “The sheer fact that it had $849 tickets, and that so many people bought tickets for $1,500 to $2,000” — which were on the secondary market — “made premium pricing so much easier for every show.”

None of the big shows scheduled to open soon on Broadway are pricing as aggressively as “Dolly!,” Springsteen and “Hamilton,” according to ticketing information on the Telecharge and Ticketmaster websites and interviews with producers.

A revival of “The Iceman Cometh,” produced by Mr. Rudin and starring Denzel Washington, appears to have the top premium price among shows that have yet to open, at $350. “Meteor Shower,” a new play by Steve Martin and starring Amy Schumer, as well as a revival of the classic musical “Carousel,” top out at $325; “Frozen,” a Disney adaptation of the hit animated film, at $297, and “Mean Girls,” Tina Fey’s stage adaptation of her hit film, at $277.50.

“Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,” a sequel to the books and the season’s most anticipated play, will have a top premium price of $249, for each of its two parts. But “Potter” will also discount more substantially than many: each performance will have 300 seats priced at $40 or less, including 150 at $20.",$998 to Say Hello to Dolly?

“He doesn’t just say he’s going to do this,” Mr. Mowery said. “He gets thrown out of office over it. And then he gets re-elected.”

In order to fill the Senate seat that Attorney General Jeff Sessions held for 20 years, Mr. Moore must pass one more test: a special election in December against the Democratic candidate, Doug Jones, a former federal prosecutor who is a formidable rival, especially by the diminished standards of Alabama Democrats.

Although Mr. Trump said on Friday that Mr. Moore “has a very good chance of not winning” in December, strategists in both parties expect the state’s voters to choose Mr. Moore, who was one of the public figures who stirred doubts about the birthplace of Barack Obama.

If he is elected to the Senate, Mr. Moore will have gotten there as a rare retail politician with a penchant for reciting Blackstone’s Commentaries on common law. At the same time, and to greater political benefit, Mr. Moore, a former professional kickboxer, exhibits traits that many Alabamians see in themselves and seek in their elected officials: He is outwardly pious and prone to political pugilism, self-assured and satisfied with standing alone.

“Roy Moore is Huey Long with religion,” said Jim Zeigler, a Republican who is the state auditor. “Huey Long would tell it like it is. He ran against the establishment, he defeated the establishment, he would not compromise with the establishment. Roy Moore does all those things, but he has a biblical worldview.”

Yet Mr. Moore, who twice ran unsuccessfully for governor, is far from universally beloved in this state. For many people in Alabama, he remains part novelty, part demagogue and part embarrassment, his reputation marred not by bribes or sex scandals but by his brand of stubborn populism. More than once, Mr. Moore has found himself rebuffing comparisons to George C. Wallace, the governor who said in 1963 that he wanted “segregation now, segregation tomorrow and segregation forever.”

Mr. Moore is “a one-issue man, and all of the other things fall to the side,” said Joel Sogol, a lawyer from Tuscaloosa who has tangled with Mr. Moore. “Either you accept those issues from his position or you don’t, and there’s a lot of folks here who accept them.”

Mr. Moore’s fame stems almost entirely from years of pitched legal battles over Ten Commandments displays on public property and over the authority of the federal courts to recognize same-sex marriages. Cast aside, even by some in his own party, as a bigot and a hatemonger, Mr. Moore has turned high-decibel clashes with his critics — he blamed “atheists, homosexuals and transgender individuals” for one conflagration — into opportunities.

In Alabama politics, Mr. Sogol said: “He’s an outsider who has a flag to hold on to. His flag is Christianity, the Bible. There are a lot of people in this area who think that is the No. 1 thing in the world.”

During his periodic exiles from public office, Mr. Moore helped to steer public debate using a nonprofit organization called the Foundation for Moral Law, which says it “exists to restore the knowledge of God in law and government and to acknowledge and defend the truth that man is endowed with rights, not by our fellow man, but by God!”

The organization, which Mr. Moore’s wife now leads, was the subject of a complaint filed to the Internal Revenue Service last week, accusing the group of “repeatedly and expressly” advocating Mr. Moore’s election to the Senate, in conflict with its tax-exempt status. Mr. Moore says the criticism of the organization is politically motivated.

Though he has done little to excise himself from the clamor of evangelical politics, Mr. Moore sometimes complains about being regarded solely as a culture warrior.

“They put me in a religious thing because I acknowledge God,” he said in an interview. “I regret voters don’t hear me talk about laws and all the things I do otherwise in government. When I was on the court, I dealt with everything.”

Service in the Senate presents similarly sweeping challenges, and the Capitol Hill establishment is not likely to roll out a welcome mat for Mr. Moore. He said throughout the campaign that he would be a gadfly, not an obedient follower of the party line laid down by Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, whose allies spent heavily in Alabama trying to help Mr. Strange keep his seat.

“McConnell and all of those people in Washington know I’m not to be controlled,” said Mr. Moore, whose campaign won the support of Stephen K. Bannon, the executive chairman of Breitbart News and Mr. Trump’s onetime chief strategist. “I’m not going to be managed, I’ve never been,” Mr. Moore said.

Though he is dismissive of his party’s leadership, he is no one’s idea of a centrist, and would probably vote the same way as Mr. McConnell on most issues. Like nearly every Southern Republican running for a statewide office this year, he has campaigned on repealing the Affordable Care Act, protecting gun rights, increasing military spending and toughening immigration enforcement.

Yet longtime observers of the man whom many know simply as Judge Moore sometimes struggle for a neat, overarching description of his approach to public policy, beyond simple populism. In his years on the bench, he stayed at something of a remove from the pro-business orthodoxy of the Republicans who have won near-absolute power in Alabama in recent years, and for an array of reasons, business leaders have chronically kept their distance from him.

“He’d probably be considered conservative by some standards, less so by others,” said Jere Beasley, a trial lawyer who once served as a Democratic lieutenant governor and who donated to Mr. Moore’s campaign.

Mr. Beasley praised Mr. Moore for a ruling he handed down on arbitration, but other decisions give his judicial record a texture that surprises both supporters and critics. In occasional dissents, for instance, Mr. Moore voiced support for overhauling sentencing laws that some say are too harsh and too rigid. Writing in a robbery case last year, Mr. Moore said, “There is a difference between justice and overkill.” In another case, he argued that a life sentence for a nonviolent drug crime had shown “grave flaws in our statutory sentencing scheme.”

“He is a populist,” Mr. Zeigler said of Mr. Moore, whose campaign had a fraction of the financial support that Mr. Strange attracted. “I don’t think he intends to be. He just is.”

It is a model that has long proved politically effective. And on Tuesday, at least, it overcame more than $10 million in advertising spending by Mr. Strange’s allies.

“It’s almost the same appeal that Trump has, but it comes from a totally different place,” Mr. Mowery said. “The state’s motto is, ‘We dare defend our rights.’ It kind of starts right there: A lot of people feel Roy Moore is the guy who’s done that.”","Alabama Republicans Bet on Roy Moore, a Familiar Rebel, for Senate",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/us/politics/roy-moore-alabama-senate.html

51A: Religious references always bounce off my unschooled mind, but I find Pope Francis’ personality fascinating and when I saw this quote — “when one goes against one’s conscience” — I assumed that he meant guilt, which didn’t fit. This was also probably not a universally difficult clue, but it was a thought-provoking one for me. He’s referring to SIN, something I’ve always thought of as an absolute, objective rather than subjective or personal.

72A: “Cause of insomnia, maybe” just had to be guilt. Why did I fixate on this particular sensation while doing this puzzle? Worry, stress, self-doubt, a strong urge to begin a move to Scandinavia at 3 a.m. — there are many things that can keep one up at night. Including, I guess, a DRIP — be it a slow leak or someone who just won’t stop talking.

138A: An example of how precise cluing can be, “We should avoid doing that” led me to snap in BAD IDEA when I was first circling the grid.

“He took my head and put it on Joe’s neck,” said Mr. Rochford, who is 20 years Mr. Schmitt’s junior.","Joseph William Schmitt was born on Jan. 2, 1916, in O’Fallon, Ill. His father, Benjamin, was a city marshal who was killed in the line of duty only a few weeks after Joseph’s birth. His mother, the former Apollonia Berkel, raised him and his siblings with the help of extended family.

In the 1930s, his high school principal, knowing Joe was mechanically inclined, suggested he join the Army Air Corps. He first studied aircraft engines but, with World War II still in the future, found himself looking for more to do.

“It was kind of a slow period,” Mr. Schmitt said in an oral history. “I asked if I could go back to take a parachute riggers course and also an aircraft clothing repair course.”

That proved pivotal when, after leaving the service in 1939, he found his way into the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, a forerunner of NASA. He started as an airplane mechanic, working on the 1947 flight in which Chuck Yeager broke the sound barrier, but was later put into its Space Task Group as the agency began thinking about manned spaceflights and what astronauts would need to wear.

As an equipment specialist, or a suit tech, Mr. Schmitt would accompany astronauts to the spacecraft and hook up the various connections that would keep them alive, monitor their health and enable them to communicate during flight. It was a job that above all required a high level of attentiveness.

“Joe was a perfectionist in many respects,” James W. McBarron II, his supervisor, recalled in a telephone interview.

Mr. Schmitt suited up John Glenn for the 1962 flight in which he became the first American to orbit the earth. The many missions he worked also included Apollo 11, the first lunar landing, and other Apollo missions, where a less-heralded part of the job — care of the suit after a flight — took on new significance.

“We vacuumed out all the moon dust,” Mr. Schmitt said in the oral history. “A lot of people at that time, contractors mostly, they would take some of that dust and try and give it to their friends.” Officials eventually clamped down on that practice, he said.

Mr. Schmitt married Elizabeth Ann Rayfield in 1939; she died in 2008. He is survived by a son, Joseph Michael; a daughter, Norma Jean Spencer; six grandchildren; and nine great-grandchildren.

Mr. Schmitt accumulated an enviable collection of mementos, including a medal with Mr. Schmitt’s initials on it that Glenn gave him after taking it with him into space.

He also made a game-show appearance: He was a mystery challenger on “What’s My Line?” in May 1963, just days after he had suited up Gordon Cooper for the final Mercury mission. (The celebrity panel surmised that he was part of the space program but failed to guess his role.)

He also became an artistic footnote during his NASA career: That’s him kneeling on the left in “Grissom and Young,” a 1965 painting Norman Rockwell made of the Gemini astronauts Gus Grissom and John Young as they’re being suited up. But Mr. Rochford said Mr. Schmitt is actually in the painting one and a half times.

Rockwell took photographs of the astronauts to work from, pictures that Mr. Schmitt posed for in his role as suit tech. Later, Rockwell asked NASA to send him a spacesuit so he could get the details just right. Mr. Schmitt brought a suit to Rockwell’s studio in Massachusetts and, Mr. Rochford said, told the artist that there were actually two suit techs for the Gemini 3 flight: He had dressed Mr. Young, while Mr. Rochford had dressed Mr. Grissom. So Rockwell obtained a photo of Mr. Rochford’s face and put a second suit tech into the painting, on the right.

FRIDAY PUZZLE — TGIF, everyone! What a way to kick off the weekend; Damon Gulczynski has returned for his seventh themeless puzzle this year, and like all the rest of his work, it’s chock-full of pizazz.

Themelesses by their nature have numerous longer entries, and they show off overall vocabulary as opposed to an interesting theme, with a few fun nuggets of surrounding fill. However, there are many different styles to actually creating a themeless that should be noted. Some constructions are focused on a formidable-looking grid that has super smooth fill and a low word count. Other grids are less open, yet their longer answers are much flashier and thus allow the solver to overlook any dull, shorter fill.

Today, Mr. Gulczynski presents us with a hybrid of this concept: at 70 words total, he hasn’t quite reached the maximum allowed for a themeless (72), and yet the grid doesn’t appear very open. However, every answer of eight or more letters ranges from good to phenomenal: PHALANGE, I DARE NOT, GARY HART, SODA JERK, TELEKINESIS, OVER THE HUMP, HOVERBOARDS, IT’S NO BIGGIE, GIVE ME A RING, PABLO NERUDA, GENDER-BINARY and JOLLY RANCHER. That’s a ton of juicy fill.

As I said above, with so many marquee entries, the shorter fill usually suffers. But today? I pored over this grid post-solve, as I do when working with Will and Joel on submissions, and I couldn’t find more than three — maybe five, if I’m being super nitpicky — subpar answers. Can you guess which ones they were?

To have a puzzle be both so smooth and so exciting is near impossible, though Mr. Gulczynski makes it look easy. Let’s take a look at the cluing:

After the “X Case” of 1992, in which a 14-year-old rape victim was prevented from traveling to Britain for an abortion, voters passed a constitutional amendment that left the ban intact but recognized a woman’s right to travel abroad. Another amendment, also passed in 1992, permitted Irish women to obtain information on abortion services overseas, which had been prohibited by the state.

Much of the impetus for the new constitutional effort stems from the case of Savita Halappanavar, 31, an Indian-born dentist who died of sepsis after miscarrying in a Galway hospital in 2012. Having learned that her 17-week-old fetus would not live, Ms. Halappanavr repeatedly asked the staff to terminate the pregnancy to relieve her own worsening condition. She was told that her pregnancy could not be terminated while the fetus had a heartbeat.

An inquiry determined that recent interpretations of the Eighth Amendment had found therapeutic terminations to be permissible, but the medical staff’s uncertainty over the law and the lack of clear legislation contributed to a delay in her treatment.

The case helped build momentum for a citizens’ constitutional assembly, which this year recommended that the Eighth Amendment be repealed or amended, and that legislation be introduced to allow abortion, effectively on request.

A number of social and economic factors have made contemporary Ireland a more liberal country that the one that passed the Eighth Amendment. Not least among these is an erosion in the status of the Roman Catholic Church, weakened by scandals over the sexual abuse of children and the treatment of marginalized women in bleak church-run laundries, where many died and were buried anonymously.

The 1983 campaign to ban abortion, backed by bishops and Catholic lay groups, represented the high-water mark for institutional Catholic power in Ireland, coming just four years after Pope John Paul II drew huge crowds in the first papal visit to the country. While a significant majority describe themselves as Catholic, few now adhere to the church’s teachings in matters like divorce, contraception, sex outside marriage or gay rights.

An Irish Times poll in May showed that large majorities supported legal changes allowing abortion in cases of rape or serious risk to the physical or mental health of the mother, but less than a quarter of people supported changes making it legal under all circumstances.

Leaders of the Repeal the Eight campaign are likely to be buoyed by another liberal constitutional effort, the 2015 referendum that legalized same-sex marriage, though the country’s well-organized anti-abortion activists will find much in the polls to encourage their own hopes.

Traditionally cautious, Ireland’s mainstream politicians may huddle as close as they can to the middle ground. Mr. Varadkar’s own position is somewhat ambiguous. Though he came out as gay during the same-sex marriage campaign, Mr. Varadkar had sounded conservative notes earlier in his political career, opposing abortion and same-sex adoption.",Ireland to Hold Abortion Referendum Next Year,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/26/world/europe/ireland-abortion-ban-referendum.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Federal officials said Wednesday that the quake on Sept. 19, and one on Sept. 7 that struck mainly the southern states of Oaxaca and Chiapas, damaged more than 153,000 homes, with more than 24,000 destroyed and more than 46,000 damaged so severely as to be uninhabitable.

In Mexico City, at least 38 buildings collapsed in the quake. The city’s mayor has said about 500 have been deemed “high risk” and would have to be demolished or have major reconstruction before people could return. Most of those buildings are residential.

Public and private efforts to help displaced people with housing and reconstruction needs have begun to take shape. On Tuesday, the authorities in Mexico City announced a plan to provide low-interest loans and other financial assistance to homeowners, depending on their needs and the conditions of their homes. The city has also promised financial assistance for renters.

President Enrique Peña Nieto has promised that the government would “directly support families with resources and materials” to repair damage and build new homes, and he announced Wednesday that his administration would help the country’s most powerful business leaders obtain private-sector assistance for reconstruction through a newly created fund.

A project called Arriba Mexico has started a website that invites people to “book a symbolic stay in a ruined home and help rebuild Mexico,” with the proceeds going toward relief efforts for victims, including temporary housing. The offers are truly symbolic; donors will not set foot on the properties.

“Stay in a gorgeous ruined apartment (parking included) in Atlixco, Puebla,” says one listing, beneath the photo of a building reduced to rubble. The price is $44 a night.

The future for many of the displaced, at least in the near term, is highly uncertain, leaving them in a frustrating, exhausting transitional state that could test friendships and strain relationships.

Last week’s quake drove Ana Paula Velasquez from her apartment in the Roma Sur neighborhood, where she and her husband, daughter and mother lived. Their building was found to be unsafe, and its residents scattered to hotels and to the homes of relatives and friends.

Ms. Velasquez, 39, and her family spent the first night after the earthquake with a friend of her mother’s, and the second at a relative’s home.

She and her husband then decided to send their daughter to live with family friends while they, along with Ms. Velasquez’s mother, moved into a shelter that had opened in a grade school in their neighborhood.

It was the primary school that her daughter, now 13, once attended.

“Ironic, isn’t it?” Ms. Velasquez said, sitting on a bench designed for small children. Classrooms had been converted to dormitories, with mattresses on the floor.

Ms. Velasquez, a former receptionist for a parking lot company, had decided to move to the shelter in part because she did not want to impose on friends and family. In addition, she said, the shelter has functioned as an outlet for information about legal assistance and other aid for earthquake victims. Staying there allows her to remain on top of her case.

“If you let this get cold, there’s even less chance the government will do something,” she said.

The shelter is scheduled to close on Friday, and the family will be forced to move to another one, though she is not sure where.

In the Portales Sur neighborhood, evacuated residents of a three-tower complex on Tokio Street have set up an encampment of tents in front of the building and organized a round-the-clock patrol to keep an eye on it.

Two towers are leaning precipitously, and the entire complex has sunk by one story. Demolition is certain.

The residents’ constant presence ensures that they do not miss a visit from a utility company representative, or a lawyer, or officials who might be able to clarify what happens next, including whether they will be able to recover their belongings.

Mario Jiménez, 54, a restaurant worker who lived on the fourth floor, says he has been able to look into his apartment from an upper-floor window next door.

“And I just think: It is right there. If I could just reach in,” he said. “Get stuff like the invoice that proves I own my car, to that one jacket I like, to a pot from the kitchen. It’s the story of a life, if you will, and it is stuck there. And who knows if we will have access to it again.”

Longer-term questions for many also remain unanswered, like whether new apartment buildings will rise to replace those that are demolished, allowing developers and unit owners to recover their investments. Many homeowners in Mexico do not have property insurance.

Nobody believes that the process will be quick, particularly if the aftermath of the devastating 1985 earthquake is any indication. That quake flattened hundreds of buildings in Mexico City and caused structural damage to thousands of others in the capital, many of which were later demolished.

Rebuilding in some areas of Mexico City took more than a decade. Some buildings slated for demolition became ensnarled in litigation for years.

“The one thing we know for sure right now is that our recovery is in for the long haul,” said Oscar Ramírez, 52, an engineer who owns an apartment in a Mexico City building that, though only a year old, collapsed in last week’s quake.

“The good thing is that most of us are alive,” he said. “And we just hope that we are not forgotten.” The top elected official from the district vowed on Tuesday to punish the building’s developer for “endangering people and using low-quality materials.”

Neighbors of the building where Ms. Flores, the property manager, lived in the Letrán Valle district have also set up a round-the-clock watch, taking turns on four-hour shifts. They are waiting for a final ruling by the authorities on whether the building can be saved or must be demolished.

Despite the safety concerns, however, several residents have quietly resumed living in their apartments.

“Some don’t have anywhere else to go,” said Juan de la Barrera, 70, a resident and retired real estate broker.

He admitted he had visited his apartment, hanging out for a couple of hours at a stretch, though not staying overnight.

Jurich met with members of the university’s board Wednesday morning but left after only five minutes. Pitino met with the trustees soon after Jurich. His meeting, too, was short; one reporter waiting outside noted that the driver of the vehicle that delivered Pitino did not turn off its engine while he was inside.

On Tuesday evening, Pitino denied any knowledge of, or responsibility for, the accusations detailed in the federal charges, saying in a statement: “These allegations come as a complete shock to me. If true, I agree with the U.S. Attorney’s Office that these third-party schemes, initiated by a few bad actors, operated to commit a fraud on the impacted universities and their basketball programs, including the University of Louisville.”

Pitino was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2013, recognition for a four-decade coaching career in college basketball and the N.B.A. With 770 wins over parts of 32 seasons, Pitino ranks 12th on the Division I career victories list — although that figure could change pending the appeal of the N.C.A.A. penalties announced in June. He is also the only college coach to win national titles with two different colleges, Kentucky and Louisville — although that distinction, too, could change if Louisville is forced to vacate its 2013 championship.

The reasons for the potential erasure of dozens of his wins at Louisville, and his second N.C.A.A. championship, are allegations, some of which Louisville has accepted, that a former basketball staff member who had played under Pitino hired prostitutes to entertain recruits and players in an on-campus dormitory.

While the N.C.A.A. has vacated victories and even Final Four appearances, it has never stripped a championship from the winner of its signature annual tournament.

While in that case the N.C.A.A. accepted Pitino’s explanation that he had no knowledge of the actions of the assistant found to be responsible, it nonetheless found that he had failed in his broader obligation to monitor his staff. Pitino and Louisville have disputed that conclusion, which led to his suspension, pending appeal, for the first five games of Atlantic Coast Conference play this season.

Tuesday’s federal charges, which also implicated the global marketing director for Adidas basketball, four assistant coaches at other Division I programs and several other men involved in college basketball, detailed a scheme to funnel money to two prospects in order to attend a university whose description matches Louisville, and of doing so with the knowledge of two unidentified coaches at the school. It was not clear whether the man the complaint calls Coach-2, who is characterized as having significant leverage at Adidas (which sponsors Louisville), is Pitino.

Born in New York City and raised on Long Island, Pitino never lost the thick accent he earned during a childhood in the region, and first made his name with an improbable Final Four run with Providence in 1987. His career also included less successful stints in the N.B.A., with the Knicks and the Boston Celtics.

Most notably, he revived the two beloved college programs in the Bluegrass State, first leading the University of Kentucky, starting in 1989, out of heavy N.C.A.A. sanctions and to three Final Fours, including the 1996 national title, and then leading the Cardinals to three Final Fours and another national title.

The fact that Pitino was not fired outright could be financial. Pitino, according to a USA Today database, is the nation’s highest paid college basketball coach, at more than $7.7 million a year, and his contract includes language that gives him 10 days to contest a firing for cause.

“My fascination for fashion photography emerged because of my complete disbelief at how widely ignored the genre was in academia,” said Ms. Shinkle, a reader in photography at the University of Westminster, London.
Photo“The history of fashion photography is the history of a growing confidence in its ability to comment explicitly on the wider world,” Ms. Shinkle noted.

“Fashion photography is a most fantastic barometer of the time,” Ms. Shinkle said.","With so many exhibits and monographs devoted to fashion photography and its leading practitioners, it’s hard to imagine that it wasn’t that long ago that the genre was seldom the focus of highbrow studies. Yet, that’s what Eugénie Shinkle discovered when she began researching it almost a decade ago.

“My fascination for fashion photography emerged because of my complete disbelief at how widely ignored the genre was in academia,” said Ms. Shinkle, a reader in photography at the University of Westminster, London. “Apart from a handful of exceptions, there was a real reluctance amongst scholars to engage with it in a serious way,” she said. “Unapologetically commercial, it had been reduced to ‘only advertising.’ And, until recently — that is until it started appearing in galleries — it was considered to be ephemeral. Because it wasn’t meant to last and because it wasn’t created with any kind of critical or artistic intent, people didn’t believe its history should be approached in that way.”

After publishing “Fashion as Photograph: Viewing and Reviewing Images of Fashion” in 2008, which examined why the genre deserves intellectual scrutiny, she’s now releasing “Fashion Photography: The Story in 180 Pictures,” a compendium of important figures who help chart the genre’s evolution. From Camille Silvy, a diplomat turned studio photographer in the 1850s, to the contemporary creative couple of Maurice Scheltens and Liesbeth Abbenes, who specialize in abstract still lives, the volume published by Aperture chronicles various movements and turning points.

“The history of fashion photography is the history of a growing confidence in its ability to comment explicitly on the wider world,” Ms. Shinkle noted. “Initially, it was reluctant to engage explicitly with politics, but since the end of the ’60s it has become more openly, overtly and unabashedly political.”

After World War II, photographers like Henry Clarke subtly alluded to the changing role of women in society by portraying them as “independent and in control,” writes Ms. Shinkle. Artists like William Klein parodied fashion conventions and encouraged his peers to engage in self-criticism. Even Richard Avedon proved to be a revelation: “I learned to appreciate his depth and talent by seeing how he was able to reinvent himself halfway through his career and noticing how ardently he campaigned for the use of models of color. Creatively, and politically, he’s one of the most important fashion photographers of the 20th century.”

By the ’90s, thanks in no small part to the nonconformist British magazine “The Face,” the grunge movement — which challenged gender norms, capitalism and the ideals of social respectability — appeared in mainstream publications and paved the way for today’s more cerebral work. Collier Schorr’s images, for example, question gender fluidity, notions of desire and how identity is constructed, while Chen Man speaks up creatively about China’s complexities.

Looking at the people in the volume, it also become more apparent how conservative the industry has been. Most photographers listed are Western-educated white men. This is due in part to the author’s and publisher’s decision to keep close reins on what was considered a primer. “We focused on the West because that’s where the major fashion houses and publications have historically been located,” Ms. Shinkle said. “I had to make that decision early on. Did I want to include more vernacular practices like that of Cameroonian photographer Samuel Fosso, who has been doing amazing fashion-inspired work since the ’70s? Or, did I want to restrict it to so-called pure fashion photography?”

In doing so, she revealed how difficult it has been for traditionally marginalized groups to be taken seriously. Case in point: Women, in the early 20th century, were rarely behind the camera. Yva, Madame D’Ora and Toni Frissell were trailblazers working “at a time when that was not what a well-bred women did, because photography was seen as a technical job.” To showcase them and highlight their technical prowess and unique perspectives is to revise history, which too often ignored them. Similarly, the inclusion of the Harlem Renaissance photographer James Van Der Zee, well known in the African-American community, but virtually unknown at the time outside of it, “points out how exclusive and white-centric the industry was in those years.”

While there’s now a more diverse roster, there’s still a long way to go. “Fashion photography is a most fantastic barometer of the time,” Ms. Shinkle said. “It’s representative and it popularizes certain tendencies in ways that no other type of photography can because it’s so ubiquitous.”

Correction: Sept. 27 2017:

An earlier version of this article misstated the academic title held by Ms. Shinkle. She is a reader in photography, not a professor of Photographic Theory and Criticism.

I used it to explore a neighborhood where I used to be a local (Astoria, Queens) to see if it could deliver. The fact that it included a wide assortment of suggestions in a borough not named Manhattan was impressive enough, compared to the other apps I tested, but the recommendations themselves were also spot on.

For example, Astoria’s popular Bohemian Hall and Beer Garden was rightfully featured, but so was SingleCut Brewery, a lesser-known, but worthwhile, beer spot.

The advice for each location is the perfect length — detailed but not overwhelming, and the “Nearby” tab on the map makes it easy to scope out places wherever you are.

Cool Cousin

This app scored points for originality as well as its practicality, and is perfect for travelers who don’t have any cool cousins of their own.

Cool Cousin gives you access to contributors in 40 large cities around the world. Each “cousin” has a profile, with name, age, photo, occupation and a lot more information. The idea is to add those to your network who seem to have similar tastes to your own. After each add, the cousin’s recommendations are added to your map and broken down into eight different categories, such as food, coffee, night life and outdoors.

The app seems geared toward younger travelers — it feels like a cross between Facebook, Tinder and Foursquare — and most of the cousins themselves have an appropriately hipster look. For New York, this leads to a higher concentration of recommendations below 14th Street in Manhattan and several in Brooklyn (very few in Queens), and heavy in the food and night life areas.

But the app itself is easy to figure out, and the map includes the option to download and use offline (for free). No matter where you are, just hit the location arrow to see what’s nearby.

The recommendations themselves are solid and are written casually — think Yelp, minus the negativity. I added 26 of 55 available cousins in New York and was impressed with what was revealed, including free public gardens and lesser-known art galleries, as well as a wide variety of intriguing bars and restaurants.

Your new cousins will even message you through the app to say hello, and you have the option of writing them back to ask for more tips. You will also get a push notification every time you receive a new message, which you can turn off by adjusting your settings. After asking two of my paired cousins, I received additional restaurant recommendations.

The recommendations are detailed yet concise, giving an excellent general overview and a “special tip” for each location. For example, at the Brazilian restaurant Beco in Brooklyn, Kelly advises: “Come early because the restaurant’s seating space is limited. CA$H ONLY.”

There’s also an option to “ask locals,” which works like a message board. I asked for Upper East Side restaurant recommendations (it is a neighborhood not represented well on any of the apps) and after a week had yet to get a response.

It is a widely held feeling among South Korean politicians and Olympic officials, as well as some international athletes, that the Games would be safer with North Korea’s participation, lessening security concerns and perhaps spurring slow ticket sales.

In that view, Kim Jong-un, the unpredictable North Korean leader, would be less likely to act provocatively if athletes from his country were competing in the Olympics, alongside those of China, North Korea’s benefactor.

And there is no guarantee that North Korea will participate. It is not a winter sports power and did not compete at the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, Russia. It also boycotted the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, the South Korean capital.

A general wariness seems to be encroaching on these Games. France has said its Olympic team will not travel to South Korea if its safety cannot be guaranteed.

Still, Thomas Bach, the president of the I.O.C., has said there is “so far not even a hint” that security concerns related to North Korea threaten the Games. In any case, officials say it is too late to move the Olympics.

“There is no Plan B,” said Anita DeFrantz, a vice president of the I.O.C. from the United States.

Mr. Chang, the I.O.C. delegate from North Korea, has said its athletes will also attempt to qualify for the Games in short-track speedskating and Nordic skiing, which includes cross-country events. According to Reuters, North Korea has formally complained that international sanctions have interfered with its ability to purchase skiing equipment needed for training.

In April, North Korea sent its women’s hockey team to play in South Korea. In June, it sent a taekwondo team. That month, South Korea’s sports minister mentioned the possibility of fielding a combined hockey team in the Olympics and permitting North Korea to host an Alpine skiing event.

Those prospects seem unlikely now, South Korean Olympic and government officials said last week in New York.

“North Korea is my biggest worry,” Choi Moon-soon, the governor of Gangwon Province in South Korea, where the 2018 Olympics will take place, said in a recent interview. “It’s not because of North Korea making an impact on the Olympics, it’s that if North Korea can participate, then it will make a great contribution for our goal of hosting a Peace Olympics, and it will be a great selling point.”

If North Korea does compete, perhaps its most visible — and only — athletes will be Ms. Ryom and Mr. Kim. They finished 15th at the 2017 world figure skating championships in March with a style influenced by classic Russian efficiency and precise placement of the arms and head.

Dressed in silver and black costumes at training on Wednesday, the pair skated to an instrumental version of the Beatles’ “A Day in the Life,” as performed by Jeff Beck, which will provide a musical backdrop for Thursday’s opening performance.

The issue can be culturally sensitive. At the world championships, the North Koreans ended a brief interview with The Associated Press when asked how they had chosen the Beatles’ music.

On Wednesday, Ms. Ryom and her partner, Mr. Kim, appeared smiling though slightly nervous during practice. (“Trying to be too much,” Mr. Marcotte said.) Still, they received polite applause from the four dozen or so people who watched them train at the Eissportzentrum in this Alpine village with bell cows in the pastures and snow dusting the highest peaks.

It is not uncommon for pairs skaters to have an artistically stressed relationship, and as Mr. Marcotte put it, a coach can sometimes be more of a marriage counselor. But the North Koreans remained unfailingly upbeat during their summer training, he said. And they even made kimchi, a staple dish, for a South Korean pair that he also trained.

“I think there is a will for friendship, a will for peace,” Mr. Marcotte said of the skaters. “They were so driven and so positive. I didn’t expect that. They were sponges. They wanted to learn so badly.”

Ms. Ryom and Mr. Kim will be under enormous scrutiny and pressure this week to qualify for the Olympics. But they also appear confident, Mr. Marcotte said.

Ri Chol-un, an official with the North Korean figure skating association, said the pair might even speak to reporters on Friday after the pairs competition ends.

“As long as it’s about figure skating,” he said.","North Korea Skaters Seek Olympic Bid, and Diplomats Cheer",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/sports/olympics/north-korea-winter-olympics.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Federal officials said Wednesday that the quake on Sept. 19, and one on Sept. 7 that struck mainly the southern states of Oaxaca and Chiapas, damaged more than 153,000 homes, with more than 24,000 destroyed and more than 46,000 damaged so severely as to be uninhabitable.

In Mexico City, at least 38 buildings collapsed in the quake. The city’s mayor has said about 500 have been deemed “high risk” and would have to be demolished or have major reconstruction before people could return. Most of those buildings are residential.

Public and private efforts to help displaced people with housing and reconstruction needs have begun to take shape. On Tuesday, the authorities in Mexico City announced a plan to provide low-interest loans and other financial assistance to homeowners, depending on their needs and the conditions of their homes. The city has also promised financial assistance for renters.

President Enrique Peña Nieto has promised that the government would “directly support families with resources and materials” to repair damage and build new homes, and he announced Wednesday that his administration would help the country’s most powerful business leaders obtain private-sector assistance for reconstruction through a newly created fund.

A project called Arriba Mexico has started a website that invites people to “book a symbolic stay in a ruined home and help rebuild Mexico,” with the proceeds going toward relief efforts for victims, including temporary housing. The offers are truly symbolic; donors will not set foot on the properties.

“Stay in a gorgeous ruined apartment (parking included) in Atlixco, Puebla,” says one listing, beneath the photo of a building reduced to rubble. The price is $44 a night.

The future for many of the displaced, at least in the near term, is highly uncertain, leaving them in a frustrating, exhausting transitional state that could test friendships and strain relationships.

Last week’s quake drove Ana Paula Velasquez from her apartment in the Roma Sur neighborhood, where she and her husband, daughter and mother lived. Their building was found to be unsafe, and its residents scattered to hotels and to the homes of relatives and friends.

Ms. Velasquez, 39, and her family spent the first night after the earthquake with a friend of her mother’s, and the second at a relative’s home.

She and her husband then decided to send their daughter to live with family friends while they, along with Ms. Velasquez’s mother, moved into a shelter that had opened in a grade school in their neighborhood.

It was the primary school that her daughter, now 13, once attended.

“Ironic, isn’t it?” Ms. Velasquez said, sitting on a bench designed for small children. Classrooms had been converted to dormitories, with mattresses on the floor.

Ms. Velasquez, a former receptionist for a parking lot company, had decided to move to the shelter in part because she did not want to impose on friends and family. In addition, she said, the shelter has functioned as an outlet for information about legal assistance and other aid for earthquake victims. Staying there allows her to remain on top of her case.

“If you let this get cold, there’s even less chance the government will do something,” she said.

The shelter is scheduled to close on Friday, and the family will be forced to move to another one, though she is not sure where.

In the Portales Sur neighborhood, evacuated residents of a three-tower complex on Tokio Street have set up an encampment of tents in front of the building and organized a round-the-clock patrol to keep an eye on it.

Two towers are leaning precipitously, and the entire complex has sunk by one story. Demolition is certain.

The residents’ constant presence ensures that they do not miss a visit from a utility company representative, or a lawyer, or officials who might be able to clarify what happens next, including whether they will be able to recover their belongings.

Mario Jiménez, 54, a restaurant worker who lived on the fourth floor, says he has been able to look into his apartment from an upper-floor window next door.

“And I just think: It is right there. If I could just reach in,” he said. “Get stuff like the invoice that proves I own my car, to that one jacket I like, to a pot from the kitchen. It’s the story of a life, if you will, and it is stuck there. And who knows if we will have access to it again.”

Longer-term questions for many also remain unanswered, like whether new apartment buildings will rise to replace those that are demolished, allowing developers and unit owners to recover their investments. Many homeowners in Mexico do not have property insurance.

Nobody believes that the process will be quick, particularly if the aftermath of the devastating 1985 earthquake is any indication. That quake flattened hundreds of buildings in Mexico City and caused structural damage to thousands of others in the capital, many of which were later demolished.

Rebuilding in some areas of Mexico City took more than a decade. Some buildings slated for demolition became ensnarled in litigation for years.

“The one thing we know for sure right now is that our recovery is in for the long haul,” said Oscar Ramírez, 52, an engineer who owns an apartment in a Mexico City building that, though only a year old, collapsed in last week’s quake.

“The good thing is that most of us are alive,” he said. “And we just hope that we are not forgotten.” The top elected official from the district vowed on Tuesday to punish the building’s developer for “endangering people and using low-quality materials.”

Neighbors of the building where Ms. Flores, the property manager, lived in the Letrán Valle district have also set up a round-the-clock watch, taking turns on four-hour shifts. They are waiting for a final ruling by the authorities on whether the building can be saved or must be demolished.

Despite the safety concerns, however, several residents have quietly resumed living in their apartments.

“Some don’t have anywhere else to go,” said Juan de la Barrera, 70, a resident and retired real estate broker.

He admitted he had visited his apartment, hanging out for a couple of hours at a stretch, though not staying overnight.

“I’ve done it just for the comfort,” he explained. “My clothes are there, my things. There’s no place like home.”",Still More Victims in Mexico’s Quakes: Legions of Displaced,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/world/americas/mexico-earthquakes-displaced.html

Diane Cook and Len Jenshel present some answers in their new book, “Wise Trees,” which will be published by Abrams in October.

“Taking that strength from the trees, we had this idea of looking at wise trees around the world,” said Ms. Cook.
I need to go back to that tree,’” Ms. Cook recalled.","Trees can live without us, but we cannot live without trees.

With a history dating back to the dinosaurs, trees are the planet’s documentarians, watching us cycle through life while providing oxygen, shade and shelter. Trees, the oldest of which, according to Peter Wohlleben’s “The Hidden Life of Trees,” has 9,500 years, are a critical part of the human experience. We rely on them, from their deep roots to fluttering leaves.

But — at least when we’re not cutting them down — how do we influence trees? Diane Cook and Len Jenshel present some answers in their new book, “Wise Trees,” which will be published by Abrams in October. Traveling to more than 70 locations, they found trees that represent “landscapes of complexity where nature and humanity converge.” In other words, trees with stories, like the young sycamore that witnessed the Civil War, or the elm that survived the Oklahoma City bombing. These photos show how events have shaped trees, their energy, and sometimes, literally, the shape of their limbs.

“Forty-million trees are being lost every day,” said Mr. Jenshel. “We love the environment and wanted to do something that would make people think differently about trees.”

Though Mr. Jenshel and Ms. Cook — who are married, collaborate on all their projects and frequently finish each other’s sentences — have a long history of photographing trees, a much more personal seed for their project was planted in the spring of 2012. They were in Japan documenting a nighttime cherry tree ritual when Ms. Cook learned that her father was dying. Struggling to process the information, she found herself watching the fragile petals of the cherry blossoms slowly drift to the ground, one by one.

“We did what the Japanese have been doing for centuries,” said Ms. Cook. “To take in that beauty, appreciate its ephemeral nature, and know that life does go on.”

Her father died soon after, but a new project was born, influenced by the cherry blossoms and a National Geographic magazine commission. “Taking that strength from the trees, we had this idea of looking at wise trees around the world,” said Ms. Cook. “And the importance trees have had throughout history in so many cultures.”

After the Sept. 11 attacks, search and rescue workers were looking for human remains among the rubble, when they found part of a Callery pear tree, which traditionally is the first tree to bloom in spring and the last to change leaves in autumn. Though its trunk was scorched and many branches missing, the tree had survived the attacks. Now a symbol of strength and survival, the pear tree was nursed back to health at a Bronx nursery and, nearly a decade later, replanted at the World Trade Center memorial.

Other trees have been a part of unspeakable cruelties. From 1846 to 1870, in Goliad, Tex., an oak known as “The Hanging Tree,” provided shade for court sessions and branches for lynching.

“It’s not always a happy story,” said Ms. Cook.

One of the rain or monkeypod trees in Cambodia (imported from South or Central America), was isolated from the others as “The Killing Tree.” In 1975 when Pol Pot’s murderous rule started, the tree was used to bash children’s heads while their mothers were forced to watch.

“It took us days to recover from that experience of photographing that tree,” said Ms. Cook. “That left the deepest scar on us.”

Other trees seem to travel, and quite far. It is not clear how the adansonia gregorii (or boab) tree got to Western Australia. Perhaps it was the result of seeds dropped from the fruits by early migrants. It was a good thing, though, for the local aboriginals who used the tree as a spiritual home and lifeline, since it can hold up to 26 gallons of water.

In India, from the ancient tree deities to current bodhis of enlightenment, most trees are seen as sacred. In a Varanasi sweet shop, they found a neem tree, said to cure all ailments. Long after they shot the photo, Ms. Cook noticed her spouse’s anxiety.

“Len kept saying, ‘I don’t think we got the picture. I need to go back to that tree,’” Ms. Cook recalled. “I totally knew it was about the sweets.”

review declared James unfit for release, James requested that the court appoint him an independent evaluator and grant him a hearing.
Among the hospital’s 937 forensic patients, there were 1,908 incidents of seclusion and restraint in 2014.","In 1996, when James was 20, the police responded to a frantic 911 call near the house where he lived with his mother. At the scene, the officers found a woman bloodied and in distress. She said that James had lured her inside for a housekeeping interview — and that he’d been screaming when he started ripping her clothes off and beating her. The cops later picked him up at his grandmother’s house, a few miles away. At the police station, James signed a statement saying he understood his rights. He waived the right to representation. He signed a confession. (He and his mother now claim that the confession was coerced and that he is innocent.) When doctors subsequently evaluated him, they found him so unstable that they ruled him incompetent to stand trial. He was remanded to a hospital for several months, then sent back to jail, where he regressed again, then sent back to the hospital for several more months, stabilized once again, then sent back to jail, where in preparation for his trial, he was returned to the hospital to be evaluated for mental illness. Doctors diagnosed borderline-personality disorder, his mother says — which enabled him to plead “not responsible by reason of insanity.”

James says that he understood the plea he took. In the abstract sense, he did. But the specifics of it were as mysterious to him and his family as they are to most people. Before he was arrested, James and his mother were set to move to Georgia, where they had relatives, and where Ann had friends and a job lined up. After his plea deal, Ann says, she “put everything on hold,” for what she thought would be a few years.

Instead, James, now in his 40s, has been in the hospital for almost two decades. This isn’t because he was sentenced to 20 years, or to 25. He was not sentenced at all; he is technically, legally, not responsible. The court believes beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed the act he was accused of, a prerequisite for the state to accept an insanity plea. The plea does not, however, prescribe or limit the duration of his stay. The laws that govern the practice of committing people who are acquitted because of mental illness dictate that they be hospitalized until they’re deemed safe to release to the public, no matter how long that takes.

James’s insanity acquittal placed him in an obscure, multibillion-dollar segment of domestic detention. According to a 2017 study conducted by the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors, more than 10,000 mentally ill Americans who haven’t been convicted of a crime — people who have been found not guilty by reason of insanity or who have been arrested but found incompetent to stand trial — are involuntarily confined to psychiatric hospitals. Even a contributor to the study concedes that no one knows the exact number. While seemingly every conceivable data point in America’s prison system is meticulously compiled, not much is known about the confinement of “forensic” patients, people committed to psychiatric hospitals by the criminal-justice system. No federal agency is charged with monitoring them. No national registry or organization tracks how long they have been incarcerated or why.

In 1992, the Supreme Court ruled, in Foucha v. Louisiana, that a forensic patient must be both mentally ill and dangerous in order to be hospitalized against his will. But in practice, “states have ignored Foucha to a pretty substantial degree,” says W. Lawrence Fitch, a consultant to the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors and former director of forensic services for Maryland’s Mental Hygiene Administration. “People are kept not because their dangerousness is because of mental illness. People stay in too long, and for the wrong reasons.”

Michael Bien, a lawyer who helped bring a successful lawsuit against the California prison system on behalf of prisoners with psychiatric illnesses, concurs. “Under constitutional law, they’re supposed to be incarcerated only if they’re getting treatment, and only if the treatment is likely to restore sanity,” he says. “You can’t just punish someone for having mental illness. But that’s happening.”

In the visiting room in New York that Sunday, as the hours went by, families came and went. Ann settled in. On James’s birthday, she brings a party: relatives, presents, a cake. And almost every week, on every visiting day, she and James try to make a life here together at the hospital — because it now seems possible that he could die there.

The insanity defense has been part of the American judicial system from its founding, carried over from our English forebears. British law has long reflected the moral sense that society has a duty not to punish people who can’t comprehend or control their crimes. But the insanity defense has always sat uneasily with the public, which tends to regard it as a means to escape justice. In the United States, such sentiments reached fever pitch in 1981, when a 25-year-old named John Hinckley Jr., hoping to win Jodie Foster’s heart, tried to assassinate President Reagan, wounding the president and three others, including James Brady, the White House press secretary, who was left permanently disabled. Hinckley was found not guilty by reason of insanity (N.G.R.I., as it is frequently abbreviated) and sent to St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington. The country was outraged. Dan Quayle, then a senator from Indiana, called the verdict “decadent” and said the insanity defense “pampered criminals.” His Senate colleague Strom Thurmond equated it to a free ride.

In fact, despite its reputation as a “get out of jail free” card, the insanity defense has never been an easy way out — or easy to get. After a defendant is charged, the defendant, her lawyer or a judge can request evaluation by a psychiatrist. A defendant may be found incompetent to stand trial and committed for rehabilitation if she isn’t stable enough or intellectually capable of participating in the proceedings. If she is rehabilitated, she may be tried; if she cannot be, she may languish in a psychiatric hospital for years or decades. But mental illness is not exculpatory in itself: A defendant may be found mentally ill and still competent enough to stand trial. At that point, the district attorney may offer an insanity plea — some 90 percent of N.G.R.I. verdicts are plea deals. If the district attorney doesn’t offer a plea, or the defendant doesn’t take it, the case goes to trial. The defendant may still choose insanity as a defense, but then her case will be decided by a jury.

If N.G.R.I. was always difficult to get, it became even harder after Hinckley. With the Insanity Defense Reform Act of 1984, Congress restricted the judicial definition of “insanity” to only the most severe cases. Some states — Idaho, Utah, Kansas and Montana — have eliminated the defense altogether. In trials in which it is attempted, doctors may disagree, and jurors are often influenced by emotional considerations. Today, only an estimated one-120th of 1 percent of contested felony cases end in a successful N.G.R.I. defense — that is, the prosecutor disputes the insanity defense, the case goes to trial and the jury finds the defendant not guilty by reason of insanity. In addition, the legal standards for “insanity” vary among states; some define it as a defendant’s inability to know the crime was wrong or the inability to act in accordance with the law, but most define it, post-Hinckley, as only the first of these. At the trial of James Holmes, who killed 12 people and injured 70 in a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., one psychiatrist testified that he was mentally ill but that he knew right from wrong and should be considered “sane.” Another testified that he was mentally ill and incapable of reason (and, by extension, guilt). All four who examined him agreed that he had some form of schizophrenia. Jurors rejected his insanity plea.

And when an N.G.R.I. defense does succeed, it tends to resemble a conviction more than an acquittal. N.G.R.I. patients can wind up with longer, not shorter, periods of incarceration, as they are pulled into a mental-health system that can be harder to leave than prison. In 1983, the Supreme Court ruled, in Jones v. the United States, that it wasn’t a violation of due process to commit N.G.R.I. defendants automatically and indefinitely, for the safety of the public. (Michael Jones, who was a paranoid schizophrenic, had been hospitalized since 1975, after pleading N.G.R.I. to petty larceny for trying to steal a jacket.) In almost all states, N.G.R.I. means automatic commitment to a psychiatric facility. In most states, like New York, there is no limit to the duration of that commitment. In the states that do have limits, like California, the limits are based on the maximum prison sentence for the offense, a model that belies the idea of hospitalization as treatment rather than punishment. As Suzanna Gee, an attorney with Disability Rights California (a protection and advocacy agency with counterparts in every state), points out, the law allows two-year extensions as patients approach a “top date,” the limit set on their confinement. And so, she says, “it can be extended in perpetuity.”

James’s mother, Ann, now knows the predicament of forensic confinement well. At some point during James’s stay at the state hospital, she became an advocate for mentally ill offenders. “It’s like a roach motel,” she says. “At least in prison, inmates know they’re leaving. Once you check into the hospital, it’s hard to check out.”

Though forensic detentions get little attention, they can range from ethically questionable to flagrantly unconstitutional and illegal. In 1983, a national study found that N.G.R.I. patients often lost their freedom for twice as long as those actually convicted of the same offense. A study of N.G.R.I. patients in seven states between 1976 and 1985 found that in four of those states, they were confined for less time than people who were found guilty, and that in three, they were confined for longer. Scant research, conducted decades ago, seems to constitute the most recent survey of the fate of the country’s forensic commitments.

“There’s not been a lot done,” Fitch says. The federal government doesn’t collect data on forensic patients’ lengths of stay, crimes or treatment. In some cases, neither do the state or local departments in charge of their custody. In 2015, I began collecting, via request or the Freedom of Information Act, all individual length-of-stay data by legal status that existed in each state and Washington. Colorado, Wyoming, Arkansas, Missouri, California, Maine, New Hampshire, Kentucky, Wisconsin, Delaware, New Jersey, Ohio and South Carolina said they simply didn’t have that information. Alabama may or may not: In response to repeated queries, it “decided not to release forensic data,” and hospital reports are excluded from its public-records law.

Many of the above states have reported legal status and average lengths of stay. In 2014, Fitch, on behalf of the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors, estimated, based on states’ self-reported average lengths of stay, that the national average for all N.G.R.I.s was around five to seven years. He says he finds that “horrendous,” given that civil commitments with the same diagnoses as forensic commitments can get out in under 30 days. There is no accepted body of research to suggest that lengthy institutionalization leads to better treatment outcomes. On the contrary, says Marthagem Whitlock, an assistant commissioner in Tennessee’s Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services, “The deeper penetration into the system usually means more complications for the individual.” There are, as Fitch acknowledges, “people who don’t respond to treatment or who refuse treatment.” But, he argues, “it should almost never be necessary to hospitalize people that long.”

According to the state records collected for this article, in 2015, Florida had 24 N.G.R.I. patients who had been hospitalized for longer than 15 years. Texas had 27. Connecticut had 40, and Georgia had 43. New York and Washington had around 60 apiece. That’s six of the 28 states from which such data can be extrapolated, along with the District of Columbia. In those states — which exclude thousands of N.G.R.I. patients — a significant portion of N.G.R.I. patients had been hospitalized more than two years. Nearly 1,000 had been hospitalized for five to 15 years. More than 400 had been in for longer than 15. Of these, more than 100 had been in longer than 25 years and at least 60 for more than 30. And those numbers don’t present the whole picture, either: Many factors, like hospital transfers or conversion to civil commitment, can start the clock over or obscure patients’ histories. In many cases, Gee says, when patients reach out to Disability Rights California to advocate on their behalf, “if they’d not pled N.G.R.I. and just gone to prison, they might have gotten out earlier.”

Which is not to say there aren’t protocols for release. Most states do have a formal review process to judge whether N.G.R.I.s no longer fit commitment criteria: They are no longer mentally ill or are no longer dangerous as a result of their mental illness. Some states review cases on a schedule — every year, say, or in the case of New Hampshire, every five years. In others, patients (or their lawyers) have to request the review. Doctors can recommend patients for discharge at any time. Patients’ lawyers can also file writs of habeas corpus or petitions for restoration of sanity to have their cases heard in court.

At the psychiatric facility where James is a patient, as at every New York state hospital, cases are reviewed every two years or so, in a joint process by the hospital and the Office of Mental Health (O.M.H.) in Albany. In 2002, when the hospital and O.M.H. review declared James unfit for release, James requested that the court appoint him an independent evaluator and grant him a hearing.

That doctor found that he wasn’t dangerous and was ready to be transferred. The judge agreed and ordered it.

But James didn’t leave.

“Even the mechanisms for getting out,” says Pat McConahay, communications director for Disability Rights California, “are not really mechanisms for getting out.”

James’s almost-transfer 15 years ago fell under the jurisdiction of Guy Arcidiacono, now 61, the district attorney in charge of the Suffolk County Forensic Psychiatric Litigation Unit, who has handled 130 N.G.R.I. cases over 25 years. After the judge approved James for transfer, Arcidiacono and the Suffolk County district attorney’s office, joined by the New York State attorney general’s office, which represents the hospital, appealed to have the transfer order overturned. Under another judge, it was.

James’s police files are terrible to read. There was never a trial, but the allegations are disturbing. They include a statement by the woman whom the police responded to near his house saying that James sexually assaulted her, beat her unconscious, then threw her down the basement stairs. She told the police that when she came to, naked, she realized she was locked in. This, you might presume, was the basis for the rape and kidnapping charges that James said put him in the state hospital.

“Well,” Arcidiacono clarified when I contacted him, “there were two cases, actually.”

Two months earlier, James had been arrested based on another woman’s statement, taken at the emergency room, that she was pinned by her throat and raped in an empty field. (In his statement, James said she had agreed to have sex with him in exchange for crack, and that he didn’t actually intend to make good on his promise.) Charges were filed, and James was released to his mother’s custody — Arcidiacono says there’s no record of why, but it could have been because James hadn’t been indicted yet. When James pleaded N.G.R.I. to the subsequent attack, the charges from the first incident were lumped together with the new ones: in total, second-degree kidnapping, second-degree assault, second-degree aggravated sexual abuse, first-degree sexual abuse, first-degree rape and third-degree robbery.

“You can see in his case,” Arcidiacono said, “that they were serious charges.”

Like most district attorneys, Arcidiacono has substantial discretion when an N.G.R.I. patient comes up for review. Any time a hospital wants to release or transfer an N.G.R.I. patient, his office can demand a hearing. In contesting transfer or release, Arcidiacono can compel the patient to be examined by a doctor he selects. Even if that doctor agrees that the patient is ready to leave, the district attorney can still contest the release. Arcidiacono has done this and won. If a patient does win release or transfer (in New York, a forensic patient is almost always transferred to a civil, less secure facility for another unspecified amount of time before release), the district attorney can appeal, as in James’s case. When you’re dealing not with facts but with opinions, Arcidiacono told me, “reasonable people can differ.”

He went on to explain: “There are two considerations here. What is good for the defendant, and also, the safety of the public. And that’s the difficult part of these cases, balancing those two interests.”

All this adds up to a difficult path to freedom for some N.G.R.I.s. In most states, as in New York, the courts have final review over forensic releases and transfers, and judges have the prerogative to side with the prosecution regardless of what doctors advise. Cas Shearin, director of investigations and monitoring at Disability Rights North Carolina, recalls a 1988 case in which, during an alcohol-related psychotic break, a man shot four strangers he thought were demons. “Year after year after year, his treating doctors went to the judge and said, ‘He’s ready to be released.’ ” The hospital where he was committed gave him increasing leave privileges, including reporting to a full-time job and visiting a girlfriend with whom he had children. After 21 years of incarceration and seven psychologists and psychiatrists testifying that he was no longer mentally ill and posed no threat to the public, he was released — though the judge still ordered that he submit to random drug tests for a year.

Politics, says Joel Dvoskin, a former New York State Office of Mental Health forensic director, can determine if “you’re going to stay locked up for a really long time, regardless of whether it’s safe to let you go.” Elected judges, fearing bad publicity, may be loath to release an offender into the community. As Ira Burnim, legal director of the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, a national advocacy organization based in Washington, explains the situation: “You have a mechanism to confine, for the protection of the public, these individuals when they’re mentally ill and dangerous, and the further you stray from that, the less it’s legally justified.”

John Hinckley Jr. became a famous example. Last September, Hinckley was released from St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, 35 years after being found not guilty. It had been two decades since his doctors declared his mental illnesses in full remission, which should have provided the basis for his release. “That anyone can justify keeping him in the hospital” for so long, Fitch says, “is just nuts.”

The question, according to Dvoskin, “becomes one of risk tolerance. America has become — to an extreme level that’s almost impossible to exaggerate — a risk-intolerant society.” Fears of people with mental illness persist, even though, according to the best estimates, only 4 percent of violent acts in the United States are uniquely attributable to serious mental illness. One study has found that those with mental illness are actually less likely to be seriously violent than the general population. (In addition, some N.G.R.I.s have been acquitted of nonviolent crimes, like public-order offenses, traffic offenses and prostitution.) Even if a mentally ill person has committed a crime, says Chris Slobogin, director of the criminal-justice program at Vanderbilt University Law School, “it doesn’t mean they’re going to do it again,” especially because their encounter with the forensic psychiatric system means they’ve received treatment. “This is a group of people that are incredibly stigmatized and misunderstood in terms of how dangerous they are.”

Recidivism for N.G.R.I.s is relatively low. Whereas, nationally, recidivism for released prisoners is above 60 percent, “people who are found N.G.R.I. tend to go back out into the community, and they tend to do really, really well,” Fitch says. The arrest rate for people in Maryland on conditional release, a kind of mental-health parole from the hospital, is less than half the arrest rate of the general population in the state. “If you provide treatment of illness and provide the supports they need, then they don’t reoffend,” Fitch says. As a 2016 study of N.G.R.I. recidivism in Connecticut — which has a post-release supervision program, too — also concluded: “The vast majority of individuals are not rearrested.”

It is not sober data analysis, however, that sticks in the public’s mind — or influences judges’ rulings. Hearing that a man in Nebraska whose most recent diagnosis was “cannabis abuse, unspecified” had been in the hospital for 37 years may evoke less sympathy or outrage when you learn that he killed six people, three of them children. Two of his victims he raped. One of them was dead when he did it. The other one, who was alive for the assault, was 10.

“It’s not an easy population to represent,” Bien says. “No one likes these people.”

On Nov. 21, 2011, after months of having delusions about aliens, conspiracies and poison, Houston Herczog, then 21, partly decapitated his father, Mark. Six days earlier, Mark Herczog had written a letter to God (“God — Help!”) asking him to save his newly unrecognizable son. After Houston was arrested in the bloodied family kitchen, he told the police: “The look in his eyes! I had to!”

I heard about the murder from my mother. Houston is my distant cousin, though I had never met him or his immediate family. During his trial, as psychiatrists testified about a psychotic break related to an onset of schizophrenia, his family — my family — prayed that he would be found not guilty by reason of insanity and sent somewhere for treatment. Charged with first-degree murder, Houston was facing 25 years to life. When he was found N.G.R.I. and sent to nearby Napa State Hospital, it was a relief.

It wasn’t until he was inside that any of us realized, from the mounting anxiety in his phone calls, the rules and restrictions that governed the possibility of his getting out.

Houston has now been in the hospital for four years. In 2015, I visited him there for the first time. After passing through a prison fence and four locked doors, I sat with him in an all-beige room. Schizoaffective disorder is the current diagnosis, and he is stable on medication, though he has periods of deep hopelessness. He struggles with what he has done; at the beginning of his incarceration, when, pharmacologically stabilized for the first time, he was suddenly lucid, he couldn’t do anything but lie in bed and cry. But he also struggles with the uncertainty of how long his confinement will last. Had he been convicted and received the minimum sentence, he would be out before his 50th birthday. His “top date,” according to his hospital paperwork, is Dec. 31, 2600 — 587 years after he was admitted.

Houston doesn’t dispute that he did what he did, but he does dispute the basis for his continued detention. “What are they rehabilitating?” he asked me that day, shaking his legs up and down when the caffeine from a Mountain Dew Code Red kicked in, his blue eyes wide behind wire glasses. He held his hand up, ticking the points off on his fingers. “Not a pattern of violent behavior, since I have no record of violent behavior before my crime. Is it my insanity? Because the treatment for my disease is medication, and I’m medicated and stable now.” And he is — high-functioning as you please. Before we began talking about his incarceration, he kept trying to engage me in a debate about feminist theory.

When he calls, Houston sometimes apologizes for not having much to say about his life — what would he have to say? — in limbo as it is. He would love to have a girlfriend, his first, but it seems unlikely to happen at the hospital. (“You know, I came here for the women,” he joked once.) He spends a portion of his unnumbered, many-numbered days arguing with staff about how many packets of sweetener he’s allowed to use at a time. (Patients are restricted to two at lunch; he likes his tea quite sweet.) His schedule consists of shuffling from group activity to group activity in a beige uniform, between feedings of institutional food three times a day, mind-numbing TV in the background, no internet or cellphones.

Houston’s plan is to wait until he has been hospitalized for at least five years before he bothers to file any writs or petitions for release. That number has nothing to do with what he thinks of his mental state but with comments his first social worker at Napa made: that because of what he did, he can’t possibly be let go for a long time. (When reached for comment about whether this was a plausible conversation, a spokesman for the hospital said, “A patient with a determinate sentence length of life for a high-profile crime might end up staying in the hospital for many years. It is reasonable and therapeutic for a treatment team to discuss these realities with patients.”)

Houston’s sister Savannah says that she gets it — the urge to confine forever someone who did something horrific. Savannah was home the night her brother killed their father. Only 17 at the time, she “had to walk past them to get the phone” to call 911. When she ran to her room to dial, Houston followed her, still holding a knife, but stopped when she shut the door on him. “Part of me thinks he should still have to pay in some way, whether he was in his right mind or not,” she says. “It’s hard though, too, because it is ‘not guilty.’ I have to remind myself of that a lot. I think that’s because I was there. I saw it happen.” But, she went on, “it’s my brother, and obviously I don’t want him to spend his whole life there, because even seeing what he has to eat makes me want to cry. Being there just deteriorates him more and breaks his spirit. He realizes what he did and where he is, and he’s depressed.”

Not everyone in the family is so sympathetic, says Houston’s half sister, Cameron McDowell, 43. “We have some family members who just hate him and will never forgive him. It was just such an awful thing. And I wish Dad were here every day. I can’t even imagine what he went through that night — oh, God, it was so awful.” But, she says, “he’s gone. And we have Houston now. We have to support him. This is going to sound strange, but I’ve not once been mad at him. I really, truly, passionately believe that it’s not the person that commits the crime. It’s the illness.”

At the same time, she understands why people are afraid. Cameron’s own husband isn’t yet comfortable with the idea of Houston’s hanging around their two young kids; though he loves Houston, he’s “a little bit freaked.” “I hope my husband will change his mind when Houston gets out,” she says. She, too, worries about what will happen after his release, though for entirely different reasons. “Is he going to be so institutionalized that he won’t know how to live? That’s what breaks my heart for him.”

Like Houston’s sisters, the judicial and medical systems struggle to find a balance between the blamelessness of N.G.R.I. patients and the gravity of many of their crimes. The rights of the patient are always weighed against the public good, a standard that may include a more or less explicit desire for retribution. Those who provide treatment for forensic patients, says Michael Norko, professor of psychiatry at Yale and director of forensic services for the Connecticut Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, “still have to answer to a court, or to the board, or to the court of public opinion. Every facility has people in it who have so violated a community, a community that is so angry, so hurt, that they’re basically pariahs.” He recalls one patient who shot a police officer; at hearings for his release, a crowd of uniformed cops repeatedly showed up and stood silently, facing the review panel. The question of a patient’s hospitalization can be “reduced to people’s grief, people’s anger, people’s fear — and the complexity of the patient’s rights and their recovery, all of those complexities get overshadowed very quickly.” When I asked Norko what happened to the patient who shot the officer, he said, “Well — well, eventually, he died.”

Because diagnoses and treatment assessments cannot predict future behavior, the standards for involuntary confinement — degree of mental illness and dangerousness — are necessarily subjective. Emotions and prejudice easily come into play, even from experts. A 2003 study in The American Journal of Forensic Psychology, for example, showed that doctors are more likely to find minorities incompetent to stand trial and more likely to diagnose psychotic disorders in African-Americans. At Napa, I spoke with a patient, a friend of Houston’s, who pleaded N.G.R.I. to a murder charge and had been hospitalized for nearly 20 years. When he was granted a hearing in which, according to court transcripts, multiple clinicians recommended his release, one doctor dissented — a doctor with whom he had had an ugly dispute and who, another doctor testified, wasn’t objective. The patient’s release was denied.

Stephen Seager, a 67-year-old psychiatrist who was at Napa for five years, writes openly about his own reactions to his patients in his 2014 memoir, “Behind the Gates of Gomorrah: A Year With the Criminally Insane.” He describes being in the hallway with a group of them heading to lunch as being “engulfed in a wave of hungry psychopaths.” When one of his patients tells him a story about his childhood, he writes, “I didn’t like thinking that some of the men even had childhoods.” Asked in court about a patient’s diagnosis, he gave the admitting diagnosis — bipolar disorder, manic with psychotic features — though he writes that he knew he wasn’t currently mentally ill. But he did think he was dangerous. When I asked him about this, he said: “The point is they’re supposed to be dangerous because they’re mentally ill, but if they get better and they’re still dangerous, what do you do?” He is well aware of the import of expert testimony in retention decisions. “Most of the time,” he said, “judges take our opinion on it.

“I look for the safety of the community,” he went on. “I live here. Sometimes you just have to say something for everybody’s best interest, regardless of whether they’re mentally ill or not.”

Of patients who “just never quite get better,” in doctors’ estimations, Seager said: “Oh, they’ll be here till they die.”

Napa State hospital’s vast, drought-dry campus is roamed by a pack of screeching peacocks. At 1,255 beds, it is one of the largest state psychiatric hospitals in the country. For most of his time there, Houston has been on what’s called a discharge unit, with one to three roommates, where it’s possible to get privileges like walking to the visitors’ center alone. After a bout of suicidal thoughts, he was moved, indefinitely, to a locked unit where all activities and access to the courtyard are supervised.

Houston’s treatment consists of up to 20 hours of group classes a week. His schedule at one point included Emotional Management, Substance Recovery, Current Issues in Mental Health, Self-Esteem, Fitness/Easy Exercise, Leisure Skills/Computer, Fitness/Weight Lifting, Discharge Planning, Wellness Recovery Action Plan, Coping Skills/Fitness, Leisure Skills/Journal and Conditional Release Prep. He says they watch a lot of videos. I once talked to a fellow patient of Houston’s on the phone who said he was heading to a class where the day’s lesson was learning to make cheesecake.

“Cheesecake!” he said. “Imagine that.”

State forensic hospitals vary widely in size — anywhere from just one ward to 1,500 beds — and they also vary in the activities and treatments they offer. Public psychiatric hospitals across the country may be accredited by an independent nonprofit called the Joint Commission. But it doesn’t require, for a start, the use of evidence-based therapies. One-on-one psychotherapy can be hard to get. (Houston began receiving such therapy only after his mother spent two years asking for it, his family says. Napa declined to comment, citing privacy laws.) State mental-health agencies may not be required to report what kind of care hospitals are giving, unless something goes so wrong that it attracts the attention of federal authorities. (Many do, however, voluntarily participate in national data-collection systems.)

The American archetype of bad mental-health practices is the movie “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest”: doped-up patients locked away from society to suffer and, ultimately, to perish. Some advocates argue that the conditions at psychiatric institutions aren’t always much better. Until recently, Oregon State Hospital, where “Cuckoo’s Nest” was filmed, may in ways have been worse.

In 2006, The Oregonian won a Pulitzer Prize for its exposé of the institution. It reported that there was a male staff member who worked on one ward for only a year in the late ’80s but still managed to sexually abuse six female patients; there was a wrongful-death suit in 2003; a rape lawsuit in 1995 that accused the hospital of what The Oregonian described as a “longstanding pattern of sex abuse,” some of it by a staff member who, the paper reported, had nearly been fired the year before, “after he and several other staff asphyxiated a patient while restraining him for refusing to take off his shoe.”

The problems weren’t unique to Oregon: Nebraska state psychiatric hospitals settled two major lawsuits, one in 1996 and another in 2006, which claimed that staff members and patients raped and sexually assaulted female patients; two lawsuits have been brought against Massachusetts in the last 10 years by families of forensic patients who were subjected to illegal restraining methods, one whose condition declined and another who died. Napa had more than 4,000 reported patient-on-patient or patient-on-staff assaults in 2014; in 2010, a staff member was killed.

Today Oregon State Hospital still has the towering 1883 brick face of the “Cuckoo” era, but inside, it’s all sparkling new facilities, yoga props and a physical-therapy pool — thanks, in part, to a state senator, Peter Courtney. On a 2004 tour of the hospital, Courtney was astonished to learn of 3,600 badly corroded cans of cremains in an outbuilding, still unclaimed. Around the same time, after the death of yet another patient, the Justice Department became involved. Oregon State is now the first state psychiatric hospital in the nation to use “collaborative problem solving,” instead of, say, automatic “seclusion and restraint” of patients who start to become difficult. Courtney pushed funding for the reforms through Oregon’s State Legislature and brought in a new superintendent, Greg Roberts.

“Very often when you find serious problems, the problem is one of three things: leadership, leadership or leadership,” Roberts says. (A notable problem of leadership was found at Napa: The man who was its executive director between 2007 and 2010, Claude Edward Foulk, is now serving 248 years in prison for sexually molesting children.) Before Roberts came to Oregon, he was the person New Jersey sent to take over “problematic” hospitals that had “a serious negative incident or series of negative incidents.” He revamped three there, one of them twice.

More than 10 years into its transformation, Oregon State has come a long way. But, Roberts acknowledges, it still has a long way to go. Among the hospital’s 937 forensic patients, there were 1,908 incidents of seclusion and restraint in 2014. And while Roberts’s reforms included securing timely releases for patients — between 2012 and 2015, the hospital discharged 90 percent of its “guilty except insanity” (Oregon’s N.G.R.I.) patients with “top dates” early — it still has several patients who’ve been in for more than 15 years, who it acknowledges long ago ceased to be dangerous. Staff recently discharged one patient who had been in for more than 30.

Unfortunately, there aren’t a lot of other places for forensic patients to go. When the push to deinstitutionalize psychiatric patients began in the 1970s, many inpatient facilities were shut down or downsized in favor of community integration and outpatient services, which never adequately materialized because of a lack of funding. But institutions have remained the preferred repository for forensic patients, who fill an increasing share of the remaining 42,000 state psychiatric hospital beds. In Pennsylvania, the proportion of forensic patients increased by 379 percent between 1988 and 2008. In California, some 90 percent of approximately 7,000 state-hospital patients are now forensic. Nationwide, nearly one-third of “consumers” in state hospitals in 2007 were forensic, and that number is “rapidly expanding,” according to the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (Samhsa). In the last 10 years, forensic patients’ costs jumped to $4.25 billion from $2.5 billion; forensic patients now account for 43.9 percent of total state psychiatric hospital expenditures. This means less room for others who might be seeking psychiatric care, while at the same time, states have cut billions from mental health, leaving even scantier outpatient systems. In Hawaii, as a 2015 Samhsa report notes, “There is no voluntary admission to the [state psychiatric] facility because of the volume of admissions from the court system.” The same lack of services that contributes to people’s reaching a mental-health crisis that ends in arrest also keeps people institutionalized longer afterward.

Whitlock, of Tennessee’s mental-health department, says that there are N.G.R.I. patients whom her state’s hospitals are trying to discharge but for whom they “just can’t find a provider.” Under her lead, Tennessee, more than any other state, has been trying not to commit forensic patients to begin with. Since 1974, it has done its pretrial competency evaluations on an outpatient basis, no insignificant matter given that elsewhere these can take six months or longer. In 2009, the state also started doing post-N.G.R.I. evaluations to see if N.G.R.I.s even needed hospitalization, also on an outpatient basis. “We did not think there was a need to spend 60 or 90 days in the hospital to determine if N.G.R.I.s fit the involuntary-commitment standard,” Whitlock says. “Once you get someone into the hospital, it’s hard to get the court to take them back out. We could probably determine it in a day.” Now only 55 percent of Tennessee’s N.G.R.I.s are committed. Their typical length of stay ranges between seven months and 4.5 years, and they get out, on average, in about two. The state’s new initiative adds to the body of evidence that less hospitalization doesn’t lead to higher crime rates. Since Tennessee stopped automatically committing N.G.R.I.s, says Jeff Feix, the state’s director of forensic services, “the recidivism rate we have is no different than it was before.”

Despite the clinical benefits and cost savings — in 2015, according to a Samhsa report, the average annual cost of one forensic patient, nationwide, was $341,614 — Tennessee’s model is still unusual. There is no outcry, from the public or politicians, for alternatives to indefinitely institutionalizing N.G.R.I.s. After 45 years of studying the issue and filing lawsuits on behalf of patients, Michael Perlin, an emeritus professor at New York Law School and an expert on mental-disability law, thinks he knows why: “Everybody except for people who take the Constitution seriously and people who are in the hospital are happy the patients are there. Prosecutors, police, they’re glad they’re not going anywhere. I believe that the disability rights community has never gotten substantially involved in the issue because some of the people have been charged with very horrific crimes.”

As he put it: “This is an area that everybody kind of wishes would go away.”

Nearly two decades into James’s confinement, it remains unclear if he will ever be considered fit for release. He says that currently his entire medication regimen consists of “fish oil twice a day, calcium, vitamin D and two Kool-Aids and prune juice and Metamucil.” In the 2004 appellate court overturning of his transfer, the hospital doctor testifying in favor of his continued retention pointed out that there was no medication for his diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder — just therapy, to which he was resistant. The hospital forensic committee said that they believed James was insufficiently willing to take responsibility for his actions. One of his doctors called him “sexually preoccupied”; the appellate court concluded that “the disorder will continue to cause him to be dangerous at least until such time as he decides he wants to change and begins working seriously with his treatment providers.”

The court-appointed psychiatrist at the hearing two years earlier, when James was ordered for transfer, said quite the opposite. In his opinion, James “acknowledged the wrongfulness of his actions, and although he does not show much remorse or regret for his actions as a result of limited insight, he certainly realizes that what he did was wrong and against the law.” He said that James “has benefited from [the state psychiatric facility] as much as he will benefit, and at this point he could be transferred to a civil hospital, where he will continue to benefit from the structured environment and continue to receive individual treatment, hoping that he will eventually gain further insight.” But in its appeal at that time, as in every review since, the hospital successfully petitioned to retain him.

How much James’s perceived dangerousness is due to his illness and how much to his extended hospitalization can be difficult to untangle. During a phone call last year, he confessed that lately he’d been “going through a lot of crap.” He was referring to recent fights on the ward. The 2004 appeal notes that he was assaulted twice in 2002 and “got into an altercation with another patient” that year; all of the incidents read as demerits against him. Such disputes are not uncommon for patients with personality disorders, says Norko, the Yale professor and clinician. A hospital is generally “not a good place for them,” he says. “Clinically you try very hard not to hospitalize people who have personality disorders. They can’t quite seem to ever get it right. To them it looks like: ‘The staff want me to do this, they want me to do that, they keep changing the rules,’ and they don’t understand the rules, and they get into arguments, they get into fights. It’s all part of their personality disorder, which in itself isn’t necessarily all that dangerous, but it’s kind of hard to move somebody along when their record is dotted with all of these altercations.”

Perhaps the most cleareyed view of the compromises inherent in N.G.R.I. commitments comes from Paul Appelbaum, professor and director of the division of law, ethics and psychiatry at Columbia University. Appelbaum acknowledges that some N.G.R.I.s are “unnecessarily detained for a longer period than what seems to be warranted by their mental disorder and its impact on their likelihood of being violent in the future.” But, he says, such exaggerated concerns about public safety may be necessary to the survival of the insanity defense. “There are injustices that are imposed on individuals,” Appelbaum says. “But I also see at a 30,000-foot level why the system works that way, and recognize perhaps the paradox that if it didn’t work that way, we might lose the insanity defense altogether, or at the very least have an even more restrictive system that we have to deal with.”

For many, Appelbaum says, an N.G.R.I. verdict is still superior to a conviction. “It exempts them from a formal finding of guilt, which can be important later in their lives. It enables them to serve their time of confinement in what is generally a much better and safer environment than an overcrowded state prison.” While one way to look at indefinite confinement is as an unbearable uncertainty, another is that it offers hope: “Compared to a life without the possibility of parole, you know, maybe that’s better.”

Yet for the insanity defense to live up to the moral imperative it was designed to embody — exculpating those with diminished responsibility for their acts — better mechanisms for evaluating release will need to be adopted, Slobogin says. In an attempt, in part, to protect N.G.R.I.s’ constitutional rights to be released when they don’t fit commitment criteria, the American Bar Association recently revised its criminal-justice mental-health standards, which were adopted in 1986. The association recommended that forensic patients be detained only if there is clear and convincing evidence — a standard that, if it had to be quantified, means about 75 percent certainty — that they’re mentally ill and dangerous; the current legal burden of proof in most jurisdictions is a “preponderance of the evidence,” or 51 percent certainty.

“It’s immoral to deprive someone of liberty because you’re mad at them for being found N.G.R.I.,” says Slobogin, who was on the task force. “Under our new standards, after a year you have to have very strong proof of dangerousness, or you can’t detain them.” But the standards are just recommendations, and some states didn’t even follow the ones from the ’80s. Slobogin concedes that in many jurisdictions, they may have no impact at all.",When ‘Not Guilty’ Is a Life Sentence,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/magazine/when-not-guilty-is-a-life-sentence.html

This person said that there were jokes about Mr. Weinstein in a comedy sketch that was dropped before airtime, and also in its “Weekend Update” segment. These cuts were made simply because the material seemed to fall flat with the show’s studio audience, the person said.

Over all, this person said, the tone of this weekend’s show was greatly affected by the shooting massacre at a Las Vegas country music festival on Oct. 1, in which 58 people were killed and hundreds more were injured. The “S.N.L.” broadcast opened with remarks and a performance by Jason Aldean, the country singer who was onstage at the festival when the shootings began; “S.N.L.” also featured long comic monologues from the “Weekend Update” co-anchors Colin Jost and Michael Che, who spoke in favor of gun control.

All three countries have been conducting military exercises near the border of Iraqi Kurdistan this week.

Iraqi troops, including Shiite Muslim militias incorporated into Iraq’s armed forces, are already in the Kirkuk area. While the city is controlled by Kurdish forces, Iraqi troops are fighting the Islamic State as part of an American-led coalition about 40 miles southwest of the city.

Kurdish troops known as pesh merga seized Kirkuk in 2014, when the Iraqi Army fled an assault by militants there.

The inclusion of Kirkuk and other disputed areas in the referendum enraged the Iraqi government, which interpreted the move as a land grab. Baghdad has accused the Kurds of illegally selling Iraqi oil from the Kirkuk oil fields through a pipeline that runs into Turkey.

The Kurdish independence challenge is the latest crisis to rock Iraq in recent years. The country was controlled by Saddam Hussein’s regime until 2003, when the American invasion helped set off a brutal civil war and years of wrenching upheaval.

Just three years ago, Iraq lost a third of its territory to Islamic State militants. Now that the Islamic State is finally being driven out, Iraq is faced with losing a third of its territory and access to areas with oil and natural gas if Kurdistan breaks away.

Beyond the threats of military action, Iraqi authorities have struggled to come up with any meaningful punishment for the Kurds for carrying out the referendum. But with its move to shut down flights to the landlocked region, Iraq seems to have found a weak point.

Iraqi aviation authorities notified foreign airlines on Wednesday that it would cancel all permits to land and take off from two international airports in the Kurdish region as of Friday afternoon. The action followed an ultimatum by Prime Minister Abadi on Tuesday for Kurdistan to surrender control of its two international airports or face a shutdown of international flights.

The Kurdish Regional Government said Wednesday that it would refuse to hand over the airports. The region’s transportation minister, Mawlud Murad, called the Iraqi ultimatum “political and illegal.” He said the airports were critical to the American-led coalition’s fight against Islamic State militants.

Kurdish officials had planned to send a delegation to Baghdad on Wednesday to discuss the issue, but the offer was rebuffed.

On Wednesday night, Mr. Murad said that the Kurdish government had agreed to hold talks with Iraq about placing Iraqi government observers at its airports.

There was no immediate public response from the Iraqi government, but Mr. Abadi, speaking to Parliament earlier, said Iraq would not negotiate with the Kurds unless they annulled the results of the vote.

He said he had warned the Kurds “of the consequences of the crisis with Kurdistan.”

“The preservation of the security of the citizens of the country is our priority,” he added.

At least six airlines — three Turkish companies, the Lebanese carrier Middle East Airlines, Royal Jordanian and Egypt Air — started notifying passengers on Wednesday that they were canceling regularly scheduled flights from the airports in Erbil and Sulaimaniya.

Baghdad can make good on its threat because the Iraqi civil aviation authority oversees all airports in the country, including the two international airports in the Kurdish region.

The threat to cancel landing and takeoff permits would force international airlines to cancel flights to those airports because insurance risks would be too high, according to Robert W. Mann Jr., a former airline executive who is now an industry consultant.

“The issue turns on which entity controls Kurdish region airspace and airports,” Mr. Mann said. “Unless and until the autonomous region is given that control, Iraq controls and can ban, blockade or embargo air service to airports under its control, much as Qatari airports have been embargoed or blockaded by nearby nations. Faced with such a restriction, most commercial airlines would comply, in part due to warnings by their insurers.”

The Turkish Consulate in Erbil said that Turkish airlines were working to increase their seat capacity in an effort to get all passengers out of the Kurdish areas before the flight ban took effect on Friday afternoon.

Without international flights, getting in or out of Kurdistan would require going through Turkey, Iran, Syria or Iraq, where there are also threats of a blockade.

The Iraqi Parliament urged the government on Wednesday to close off its land border with Kurdistan.

For years, the Kurdish authorities in Erbil have controlled their own borders with Turkey and Syria. Mr. Abadi has demanded that all borders return to full Iraqi central government control by Friday.

Turkey’s customs minister, in remarks carried by Turkish state television, said that the main land border crossing between Turkey and the Iraqi Kurdish region remained open, although he would not say for how long that would remain the case.

Turkey is the largest trade partner with Iraqi Kurdistan, and the road border is used for much of the cargo trade. Turkey also is the transit country for the oil pumped out of areas controlled by the Kurdish authorities to the world market.

Turkey and Iran have opposed the referendum and any moves toward Kurdish independence, fearing unrest by their own Kurdish minorities.

Kurdish authorities in Erbil announced on Wednesday that 92.7 percent of those who went to the polls on Monday had voted for Kurdish leaders to seek independence. About 72 percent of 4.6 million registered voters cast ballots, with about 2.9 million voting yes to independence and about 224,000 voting no, the Kurdish Independent High Electoral Referendum Commission reported.

The referendum does not automatically trigger a declaration of independence but sets in motion a series of moves toward the establishment of a Kurdish state. The most important one of those may be negotiations of a separation with Iraq, which Iraq has refused.

American officials opposed the vote because they feared it would destabilize Iraq, stir ethnic conflict and undermine the American-led coalition.

Kurdish pesh merga fighters have played a central role in the coalition’s operations against the Islamic State militants, fighting alongside Iraqi Army units.

The Kurdish region’s president, Massoud Barzani, pushed for the referendum in hopes of obtaining a strong public mandate for eventual independence that he could use to begin negotiations with Baghdad.

Kurds have been celebrating since Monday evening, setting off fireworks, honking horns and affixing flapping red, white and green Kurdish flags to their automobiles. Government billboards promoting Monday’s independence vote were still in place on Wednesday.","Iraq Escalates Dispute With Kurds, Threatening Military Action",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/world/middleeast/kurdistan-referendum-iraq.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Mr. McConnell could be an anchor around incumbents in the same fashion as Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, who is routinely used to undermine Democratic candidates. The loudest applause Mr. Moore received during an election-eve rally came when he declared, “Mitch McConnell needs to be replaced.”

In a memo about the Alabama election that circulated among Republican donors, Steven Law, president of the Senate Leadership Fund, a “super PAC” closely allied with Mr. McConnell, said primary voters were intensely angry and inclined to blame Republicans for dysfunction in Washington.

“The Republican Congress has replaced President Obama as the bogeyman for conservative G.O.P. primary voters,” Mr. Law wrote, cautioning that the president was helping to amplify that point of view: “This narrative is driven by Trump himself, and it resonates with primary voters who believe the Republican Congress ‘isn’t doing enough’ (as we frequently heard in focus groups) to advance the president’s agenda.”

Mr. Law, whose group spent more than $10 million to prop up Mr. Strange, said in the memo that Republicans had been damaged by “the Obamacare repeal fiasco,” and said they should expect to fight hard-right primary candidates in Mississippi and Nevada, among other states. Mr. Law derided Mr. Bannon for being focused mainly on “promoting his own brand,” and discounted him as a major force in Alabama.

The convulsive mood on the right has considerably reshaped the political map for 2018, making a favorable list of Senate races somewhat less hospitable to Republicans. Two Republican senators, Dean Heller of Nevada and Jeff Flake of Arizona, have seen their poll numbers collapse after clashing with Mr. Trump and embracing unpopular legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act.

In Tennessee, Senator Bob Corker, a well-liked lawmaker from a traditional Republican mold, on Tuesday became the first Senate Republican to announce that he would not seek re-election in 2018. His departure is likely to yield a contentious Republican primary, much like the one just concluded in Alabama.

The Alabama race “is going to inspire a lot of people,” Mr. Bannon said in an interview in Montgomery on Tuesday night.

Mr. Bannon said he had held discussions about the Tennessee race with Mark E. Green, a state senator who was nominated to be Mr. Trump’s Army secretary before withdrawing after facing scrutiny for his past statements about gay and transgender people. Tennessee could be the site of the next major populist-versus-establishment conflagration if Gov. Bill Haslam responds to entreaties to enter the race.

Mr. Bannon also said he aimed to oust Mr. Heller, Mr. Flake and Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi. Ed Martin, a former chairman of the Missouri Republican Party, said Mr. Bannon had also inquired about the state’s Senate race, in which the Republican establishment has rallied around Josh Hawley, the state attorney general, as an opponent for Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat.

After leaving the White House last month, Mr. Bannon returned to his perch at Breitbart News, and has been using the hard-right website and his close ties to the Mercer family, New York-based conservative donors, to create a new, insurgent power base.

It remains unlikely that Republicans will lose control of the Senate next year, because the playing field of races is tilted so strongly in their direction. The party is defending just eight seats, mostly in strongly conservative states, compared with 25 seats held by Democrats or independents who caucus with them.

Yet the pitfalls Republicans have encountered so far have created unexpected opportunities for Democrats, and the party is assessing even long-shot races where there is the possibility of an upset. In Tennessee, a solidly Republican state, several new Democrats are considering the race for Mr. Corker’s seat: Mayor Andy Berke of Chattanooga said in a statement that he would explore a bid “in the coming weeks,” and State Senator Jeff Yarbro, a Nashville legislator, is also eyeing the race. One Democrat, James Mackler, a lawyer and Iraq war veteran, is already running.

And in conservative Alabama, both Democrats and Republicans believe Mr. Moore’s nomination may put the seat at risk in a Dec. 12 general election, when he faces Doug Jones, a former federal prosecutor who is the Democratic nominee.

Mr. Jones is scheduled to campaign with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. next week, and said in an interview on Tuesday that he would seek support from Republican and independent voters who may be repelled by Mr. Moore, who was removed from the bench for defying Supreme Court rulings and has called in the past for banning homosexuality.

In a sign of Mr. Moore’s vulnerability, Mr. Law’s memo described him as off-putting to “business-oriented Republicans,” who “recoil at Moore’s grandstanding.”

It is not only Republican senators who could find themselves cast out by conservative challengers next year. A parade of candidates, aligning themselves explicitly with Mr. Trump, is lining up to take on House Republicans whom they view as insufficiently loyal to the president. If enough Republican lawmakers are ousted in primaries, or forced to spend millions just to secure renomination, it could give Democrats a better chance to pick up the two dozen seats they need to take a majority.

“I think incumbents are extremely vulnerable,” said Barry Moore, an Alabama state representative challenging Representative Martha Roby, a Republican who called on Mr. Trump to withdraw from the presidential race late last fall. “The American people are sending a message that there’s nothing getting done in D.C., and we’re going to have to replace a lot of those people.”

A spokesman for Ms. Roby, Todd Stacy, noted that she and “her House colleagues have voted to repeal Obamacare, roll back Obama regulations, repeal Dodd-Frank, fund border wall construction, rebuild the military, reform the V.A. and tax reform got rolled out today.”

Still, the alarm is most acute in the Senate. Party strategists have seen private polling in a number of states that shows Mr. McConnell deeply unpopular with his fellow Republicans. In Arizona they have found Mr. Flake trailing his primary challenger, Kelli Ward, a former state senator, by a significant margin.

This month, Senator John McCain, Mr. Flake’s Arizona colleague, staged something of a gentle intervention, urging Mr. Flake to move more aggressively to repair his standing in the party, according to two Republicans briefed on the conversation.

Mr. Bannon taunted Mr. Flake on Tuesday night, suggesting that if the Arizona senator “doesn’t get a better poll in the next 30 days, you’re going to see him step down or the establishment is going to make him” — a possibility Mr. Flake’s campaign spokesman discounted.

“He is running,” said Will Allison, a spokesman for Mr. Flake.

In Mississippi, Mr. Wicker, a former chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, has been gearing up early in anticipation of a revolt on the right, hiring a veteran campaign manager, Justin Brasell, and branding himself on social media as a fierce ally of Mr. Trump.

But Chris McDaniel, a Mississippi state senator who nearly toppled Mr. Wicker’s colleague, Thad Cochran, in a 2014 primary, said that Mr. Moore’s victory made a challenge against Mr. Wicker “more compelling” and that he would decide by the end of October. He said he had spoken multiple times with the Mercers in recent months and had received assurances of support.

Mr. Wicker, he charged, had become “Mitch McConnell’s yes-man.”",Roy Moore’s Alabama Victory Sets Off Talk of a G.O.P. Insurrection,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/us/politics/republican-senate-alabama-mcconnell.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Mr. McKay said hello and yelled out, “Merry Christmas!” Mr. Paddock kept walking.
The message was clear: Mr. Paddock was a man who did not want to be seen.","When it came to guns, Mr. Michel said, “he was not a novice.”

The son of a bank robber and a secretary, Mr. Paddock grew up lower middle class in Southern California in the 1960s. From an early age, he focused on gaining complete control over his life and not having to rely on anyone. He cycled through a series of jobs he thought would make him rich, Eric Paddock said.

“He went to work for the I.R.S. because he thought that’s where the money was, but it turned out the money wasn’t there,” the younger Mr. Paddock said. “He went to the aerospace industry but the money wasn’t there either. He went to real estate and that’s where the money was.”

Stephen Paddock began buying and refurbishing properties in economically depressed areas around Los Angeles, teaching himself how to put in plumbing and install air-conditioning. By the late 1980s, “we had cash flow,” said Eric Paddock, who added that he had given his life savings to his older brother to invest and eventually became a partner in his company, because “that’s the kind of guy he was. I knew he would succeed.”

“He helped make my mother and I affluent enough to be retired in comfort,” he said.

With success came a rigidity and uncompromising attitude, along with two failed marriages, both short and childless. Stephen Paddock started gambling. Some who met him described him as arrogant, with a strong sense of superiority. People in his life bent to his will, even his mother and brother. He went out of his way for no one.

“He acted like everybody worked for him and that he was above others,” said John Weinreich, 48, a former executive casino host at the Atlantis Casino Resort Spa in Reno, where he saw Mr. Paddock frequently from 2012 to 2014. When Mr. Paddock wanted food while he was gambling, he wanted it immediately and would order with more than one server if the meal did not arrive quickly enough.

Mr. Weinreich said he would get irritated and “uppity about it.”

Mr. Paddock was uncompromising but he was also smart.

“I would liken him to a chess player: very analytical and a numbers guy,” Mr. Weinreich said. “He seemed to be working at a higher level mentally than most people I run into in gambling.”

Mr. Paddock cherished his solitude, his brother said. In 2003, he got his pilot’s license after training in the Los Angeles area, eventually taking the extra step to get an instrument rating so that he could legally fly in cloudy conditions with limited visibility. He bought cookie-cutter houses in Texas and Nevada towns with small airports so that he could park his planes. He was utterly unremarkable.

“This guy paid on time every time and did not cause any problems at any time,” said Lt. Brian Parrish, the spokesman for the Police Department in Mesquite, Tex., where he rented a hangar for $285 a month from 2007 through 2009. He also stored planes at the small airport in Henderson, Nev., from 2002 to 2010, an airport spokesman said, though it is not clear he ever lived at the local addresses to which they had been registered.

Even in death, Mr. Paddock seemed to stay true to his ways. He remained in control, answerable to no one but himself. He was ensconced in a carpeted hotel suite. He was wearing gloves, as he often did to protect his sensitive skin. He shot himself before the police broke into his room. A piece of paper with numbers written on it lay on a table near his body.

“If Steve decided it was time for Steve to go, Steve got up and left,” Eric Paddock said. “He did what he wanted to do when he wanted to do it.”

The ‘Most Boring’ Son

Mr. Paddock was the oldest, and least angry, of four boys growing up in the 1950s, said another brother, Patrick Benjamin Paddock II, 60, an engineer in Tucson. Stephen Paddock was born in Iowa, the home state of their mother, Irene Hudson.

“My brother was the most boring one in the family,” Patrick Paddock said. “He was the least violent one in the family, over a 30-year history, so it’s like, who?”

Their father, Patrick Benjamin Paddock, also known as Benjamin Hoskins Paddock, was mostly absent, living a life of crime even before the boys were born. A 1969 newspaper story described him as a “glib, smooth talking ‘confidence man,’ who is egotistic and arrogant.”

His rap sheet was long and included writing bad checks, stealing cars and robbing banks. He was on the F.B.I.’s most wanted list. The agency described him as an avid bridge player, standing 6-foot-4 and weighing 245 pounds, who “has been diagnosed as being psychopathic, with possible suicidal tendencies.”

Stephen Paddock learned resourcefulness and self-reliance from an early age. In 1960, when he was 7, his father went to prison for a series of bank robberies and the family moved to Southern California.

The boys’ mother raised them alone on a secretary’s salary, the younger Patrick Paddock said. The brothers would fight over who would get the whole milk. Powdered milk, less tasty but cheaper, was the norm. Their mother never explained where their father was.

“She kept that secret from the family,” Patrick Paddock said.

Stephen Paddock graduated from John H. Francis Polytechnic Senior High School in the Sun Valley neighborhood of Los Angeles in 1971, according to a Los Angeles Unified School District official. Richard Alarcon, a former Los Angeles city councilman, who lived near the Paddocks, said their neighborhood was working class, with a Japanese community center and tidy ranch houses bought with money from the G.I. Bill.

Mr. Alarcon took a science class with Mr. Paddock and remembered him as smart but with “a kind of irreverence. He didn’t always stay between the lines.”

He recalled a competition to build a bridge of balsa wood, without staples or glue. Mr. Paddock cheated, he said, using glue and extra wood.

“Everybody could see that he had cheated, but he just sort of laughed it off,” Mr. Alarcon said. “He had that funny quirky smile on his face like he didn’t care. He wanted to have the strongest bridge and he didn’t care what it took.”

A Knack for Making Money

Mr. Paddock spent his 20s and 30s trying to escape the unpredictability of poverty. He worked nights at an airport while going to the California State University, Northridge, his brother Eric said, and then at jobs with the Internal Revenue Service and as an auditor of defense contracts. But it was real estate that ultimately lifted Mr. Paddock to financial freedom.

In 1987, he bought a 30-unit building at 1256 W. 29th Street in Los Angeles, near the University of Southern California, according to property records. His brother Eric Paddock said the buildings they bought were not “Taj Mahals, but they were nice safe places.”

Crucially, they were excellent investments: Stephen Paddock more than doubled his money on his California holdings, which included at least six multifamily residences, according to property records. He made money in Texas, too. In 2012, he sold a 110-unit building in Mesquite, outside Dallas, for $8.3 million.

He was a good landlord. He kept the rents low, responded promptly to his tenants’ complaints, learned all their names and made sure they were happy. When one reliable tenant complained about a rent increase, he took half off the difference. He designed the ownership structure so his family would profit and installed his mother in a tidy house just behind the apartment complex in Mesquite, Tex.

Mr. Paddock had an apartment in the complex, but he mostly lived elsewhere. He had been married twice, but the apartment looked like a bachelor pad, said Todd Franks, a real estate broker in Dallas. “What you would expect from a 25-year-old single guy.”

To Mr. Franks, Mr. Paddock stood out because it was unusual for the landlord of a property that size to pay such close attention to the day-to-day running of his complex.

“He was frustrated by people who did stupid things,” Mr. Franks said.

He was also willing to fight to defend what was his. During the riots in Los Angeles in the 1990s, he went to the roof of an apartment complex he owned in a flak jacket and armed with a gun, waiting for the rioters, Mr. Franks said.

Though Mr. Paddock might have adopted an accommodating attitude toward his tenants and dressed casually — Mr. Franks remembered him regularly wearing sandals and a sweatsuit — Mr. Paddock was focused and astute when he made deals.

“He was a tough negotiator,” Mr. Franks said. “He wanted his price. His terms. He was a very savvy businessman.”

The House Advantage

By the 2000s, with both of his marriages long over, casinos became Mr. Paddock’s habitat. He liked being waited on, seeing shows and eating good food.

“He likes it when people go, ‘Oh, Mr. Paddock, can I get you a big bowl of the best shrimp anybody had ever eaten on the planet and a big glass of our best port?” Eric Paddock said.

Gambling made him feel important, if not social.

“You could tell that being in that high-limit gambling environment would lift him up,’’ said Mr. Weinreich, the Atlantis casino host in Reno. “He liked everyone doting on him.”

He sometimes called for company, inviting his brother Eric and his children for a free weekend in a luxury suite. But mostly he stayed alone.

A couple of years ago, Mr. Paddock stayed in one Las Vegas hotel gambling for four months straight, said a gaming industry analyst here who was briefed on Mr. Paddock’s gambling history.

The analyst described him as a midlevel high roller, capable of losing $100,000 in one session, which could extend over several days. He said Mr. Paddock may have lost that amount at the Red Rock Casino in Las Vegas within the last few months.

Playing a slot machine can be mindless and is usually a guaranteed win for the casino. That is not what Mr. Paddock played. His game, video poker, requires some skill. Players have to know the history of a particular machine. They can do that by reading a pay table, which tells them what each possible winning hand pays out.

One of the ways that video poker players get an advantage is to play casino promotions, which essentially pay out bonuses to winners, said Richard Munchkin, author of “Gambling Wizards: Conversations With the World’s Greatest Gamblers.” A gambler like Mr. Paddock will often “lock” a machine, meaning he or she monopolizes it and makes sure no one else uses it during a gambling session.

For one casino promotion, Mr. Paddock showed up two hours early, locked two machines and played them for 14 hours straight, Mr. Munchkin said, based on information he had compiled from other gamblers who were there at the time. The promotion lasted 12 hours, he said, “but he wanted to play for two hours before anybody got those machines. He knew they were the best machines based on pay tables.”

Mr. Paddock “knew the house advantage down to a tenth of a percent,” he said.

As for the mystery of why Mr. Paddock would go on a shooting rampage at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino and then kill himself, most in the gambling industry do not believe it had anything to do with money.

He was in good standing with MGM Properties, the owner of the Mandalay and the Bellagio, according to a person familiar with his gambling history. He had a $100,000 credit limit, the person said, but never used the full amount.

The Absent Neighbor

Mr. Paddock spent so much time in casinos that he was mostly a ghost in the neighborhoods where he had homes.

Colleen Maas, a neighbor of Mr. Paddock’s in Reno, said she had not seen him once in a year and a half, despite walking her dog three times a day and going to line dancing events with his girlfriend, Ms. Danley, at the community center.

He did travel. On his 60th birthday, April 9, 2013, he flew to the Philippines on Japan Airlines and stayed for five days, according to a spokeswoman for the Philippine Bureau of Immigration. The family of Ms. Danley, his girlfriend, lived there and she was visiting the country at the time. The couple went again for his birthday the following year.

When he did appear at his Reno home, he could be curt. Another neighbor, John McKay, recalled a day when he was hanging Christmas lights on a railing in his front yard when Mr. Paddock walked by. Mr. McKay said hello and yelled out, “Merry Christmas!” Mr. Paddock kept walking. “He said nothing,” Mr. McKay said. “Not a word. No eye contact.”

Even more baffling, when Mr. McKay tried to strike up a conversation with Mr. Paddock about Donald Trump during the election campaign, he got no response.

“Almost everyone has a reaction to Trump,” said Mr. McKay’s wife, Darlene.

Ms. McKay said that she would usually get up early each morning to watch the sunrise and, when Mr. Paddock was at his home, she would see him dressed in his gym clothes walking to the community center for a workout. Ms. McKay recalled something peculiar: “He always walked across the street and would never pass in front of our house.”

Mr. McKay said that he rarely saw a window or a door open at the house. One day he saw Mr. Paddock’s garage door open, and noticed a large safe inside.

It is not clear what set Mr. Paddock on his path to destruction. As early as 2010, he could no longer fly his planes. His medical certificate expired, according to Federal Aviation Administration records, and there are no indications that he renewed it.

Mr. Paddock bought his last house in Mesquite, Nev., a retirement community of 18,000 people about 90 minutes from Las Vegas that attracts golfers and gamblers from around the country. He seems to have paid in cash, according to property records, and, as he did with other houses, spent very little time there.

His neighbors added personal touches to their yards — decorative pots, plants of all colors and sizes. Mr. Paddock’s house was unadorned. One of the few things neighbors remembered about him was the solid-panel fence he erected. The message was clear: Mr. Paddock was a man who did not want to be seen. On Thursday, investigators had left. A tiny paint-splattered easel, its brush drawer open and empty, stood in the back yard.

Ms. Danley worked in Mesquite. She took a job booking sports bets at a local casino called the Virgin River, where gamblers sat together in rows watching horse races and waitresses circled in tight black skirts.

Several days a week, she attended morning mass at a local Catholic church, said Leo McGinty, 80, a fellow parishioner who knew her from the casino.

Ms. Danley dressed smartly and modestly, he said. She usually sat alone.",Who Was Stephen Paddock? The Mystery of a Nondescript ‘Numbers Guy’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/us/stephen-paddock-vegas.html

Five percent of her staff members are DACA recipients, or Dreamers, as they are known, and the museum is operating in a borough where about 91,000 undocumented immigrants are eligible for DACA, the highest of New York City’s five boroughs.

National politics is sensitive territory that arts organizations all over the country are trying to navigate during this polarized era, and some are asking whether it is appropriate for museum directors to also be public advocates.

“It’s hard to put one’s own politics aside when we represent public institutions that welcome all viewpoints,” said Anne Pasternak, the director of the Brooklyn Museum. “This is a moment when cultural leaders are asking themselves, do I want to be on the right side of history?”

Traditionally, museum directors have remained behind the scenes, allowing the art they show to speak for itself. But increasingly they have been forced to defend and — in two recent cases, at the Guggenheim and the Louvre — remove controversial exhibitions. Many see the withdrawal of artwork as a troubling development for cultural institutions that are supposed to champion free expression.

When the Trump era of fast-moving political developments headed toward cultural institutions this year — specifically the president’s proposed defunding of the National Endowment for the Arts — at least two museum directors in New York felt compelled to jump into the fray.

Some museums have also responded by quickly staging politically relevant exhibitions. To protest Mr. Trump’s executive order on immigration, the Museum of Modern Art in February rehung part of its permanent collection with works by artists from some of the majority-Muslim nations whose citizens were blocked from entering the United States. And the Brooklyn Museum organized its recent show, “The Legacy of Lynching: Confronting Racial Terror in America,” in just five weeks.

But in Queens, where 165 different languages are spoken, Ms. Raicovich seems to be charting her own community-focused path, with an emphasis on making the museum a safe haven for the borough’s large immigrant population.

“I take my leadership very seriously — not just in a physical and managerial sense,” Ms. Raicovich said in a recent interview at her museum office. “Care and equity has to be part of what I bring to my position.

“This isn’t an abstraction; this is real,” she added. “It’s people that I work with every day. This museum is interacting with immigrants.”

On Mr. Trump’s Inauguration Day in January, the Queens Museum closed its galleries in solidarity with an art strike called by hundreds of artists — including Cindy Sherman, Richard Serra and Louise Lawler — to combat, as the organizers put, it “the normalization of Trumpism — a toxic mix of white supremacy, misogyny, xenophobia, militarism, and oligarchic rule.” The museum invited the community to come make protest posters, buttons and banners (materials provided for free).

And, since some immigrant residents have been newly wary of going out in public — Ms. Raicovich said attendance noticeably dropped after the election — the museum has been holding events in people’s homes and on their blocks. “Xenophobia is not a new thing,” Ms. Raicovich said. “Our work has just intensified.”

A politically outspoken museum director could run the risk of alienating trustees, donors and potential future employers, who may disagree with her views or deem such advocacy inappropriate. But so far, the Queens Museum board has supported Ms. Raicovich. “This is an engaged time, and she is an engaged leader who has placed values of difference and multiplicity at the center of her leadership,” Mark J. Coleman, the museum’s chairman, said.

Artists also say they appreciate Ms. Raicovich’s bold stances. “Having a young director brave enough to talk about issues that are directly affecting Americans — especially people born Dreamers — is so worthy,” said the conceptual visual artist Mel Chin, who will have a retrospective at the museum in April. “Someone in a position to speak out on behalf of people who don’t have voices is what it’s all about.”

To help New York’s cultural institutions through this thicket, the city’s Department of Cultural Affairs and the Ford Foundation last spring invited arts leaders to a discussion with legal experts on what is permissible for nonprofits in lobbying and political activity. Nonprofit laws bar institutions from engaging in electoral politics and holding political fund-raisers, a hornet’s nest the Queens Museum ran into this past summer when it appeared to cancel and then reinstate an Israel-sponsored event after accusations of anti-Semitism.

Two city officials in August called for Ms. Raicovich’s removal, and one of them, Councilman Rory I. Lancman, said in an interview this month that he is still awaiting the results of the museum’s investigation into the matter.

“The museum discriminated against a Jewish organization in a way that I think makes it impossible for her to serve as the head of the museum,” he said. “I have given the board of the museum the opportunity to conduct a thorough investigation and present me with facts showing me she’s not at fault, and she should not be removed, but they haven’t done so yet.”

Mr. Coleman said the museum’s board could not elaborate on its ongoing investigation, but he expected it to be concluded by the end of November.

Ms. Raicovich said the decision regarding the Israel event, which was made by the board, simply had to do with an application of the museum’s space rental practice, which has not permitted art fund-raisers, auctions or political events. The board then decided to overrule its initial decision and allow the event upon realizing that a museum official had led the Israeli Ambassador to believe the rental would proceed.

“The decision was not anti-Semitic,” Ms. Raicovich said. “The accusation is very painful. This is not who I am. My grandmother helped young Jewish men escape across the border out of fascist Italy during the war. My husband is the grandson of Holocaust survivors. I have dedicated my career to freedom of expression, inclusiveness and civic discourse.”

For Ms. Raicovich, immigration issues are also personal. Her father is Italian; her mother, Italian-American. Raised mostly in Roslyn, N.Y., she also spent years in Milan and Bucharest as a child when her father worked as a banker there.

The Queens Museum — built as a pavilion for the 1939 World’s Fair and then home to the United Nations General Assembly before becoming a museum in 1972 — was physically in her life at an early age; she learned to drive a stick shift nearby, often stalling in front of its entrance.

After a brief stint at the Guggenheim, she spent 10 years at Dia Art Foundation, before joining the nonprofit Creative Time in 2012 to expand the organization’s international presence.

Because the Queens Museum has a collaborative quality and loyal staff similar to that of Dia and Creative Time, Ms. Raicovich said she felt “at home” in becoming director. Nevertheless, she said there has been a learning curve in “understanding what it means to be in Queens.”

“What is hyper local here is intrinsically linked to what is international,” she said.

In addition to mounting exhibitions like the artist Patty Chang’s multimedia “Wandering Lake” or “Never Built New York,” about unrealized architectural plans, the museum offers Immigrant Movement International, a community storefront space on Roosevelt Avenue that provides free educational, health and legal services. And the museum will in the next few years house a branch of the Queens Public Library.

“The highest-level curatorial program also has to be rooted in the realm of the real,” Ms. Raicovich said.

“To be a responsible citizen in a democracy, one has to be involved in a kind of civic engagement,” she added. “Culture has a huge role to play in that. And museums have a huge role to play in that.”","At Queens Museum, the Director Is as Political as the Art",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/08/arts/design/queens-museum-laura-raicovich-daca.html

In an email, Mr. Guglielmi said the punishment was consistent with that in “other cases in which officers engaged in potential political activity while on duty and in uniform.” This year an officer was reprimanded for displaying a “Make America Great Again” hat in a squad car, he said.

“Police officers must serve and protect people on both sides of any given issue,” Mr. Guglielmi said. “They can’t effectively do that if they are perceived to take one side over another. So when officers are on duty and wearing the uniform, there are no sides, just service to anyone who needs them.”

Asked whether that meant the officers who posed with Ms. Clark would not have been reprimanded if they had taken the photo while off duty and out of uniform, he said, “Absolutely.”

The photo was particularly resonant in Chicago, a city where the Justice Department found in January that the police had frequently violated civil rights; where civil rights groups filed a lawsuit in June alleging police abuses; where protests erupted over the police shooting of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald; where an officer was convicted in August for shooting two black teenagers in a car that was driving away from him. The city’s police and politicians have been trying in various ways to gain residents’ trust.

Mayor Rahm Emanuel told reporters on Tuesday that he supported the decision to reprimand the officers, and that the Police Department’s policy was consistent. But he acknowledged that the officers “were somewhat betwixt, between two different aspirations”: the desire to follow department rules and the desire to improve relations between the police and the public, The Sun-Times reported.

Kneeling took on popular significance as a form of protest in 2016, when the National Football League player Colin Kaepernick did it during the national anthem. But when President Trump denounced it last week, what had been isolated actions exploded into a national display of defiance, with players from New York to Indianapolis to Los Angeles dropping to their knees on the sidelines of their Sunday games.

In their photo, Ms. Clark and the two officers paired kneeling with another symbol of protest, made famous by the American runners John Carlos and Tommie Smith on the medal podium at the 1968 Summer Olympics: raised fists and, from Ms. Clark, a downward gaze.

In the early stages of promoting Trump’s tax cut, they have made a series of statements that are blatantly false — not merely shadings of truth or questionable claims but outright up-is-down falsehoods mocked by various fact-checkers. The statements make the two look more like Trump press secretaries than serious business executives whom members of Congress can trust.

They fall into two main categories. The first is who benefits from the tax plan. “Wealthy Americans are not getting a tax cut,” Cohn said on “Good Morning America.” He was echoing a promise that Mnuchin had made before the inauguration: “Any reductions we have in upper-income taxes will be offset by less deductions, so that there will be no absolute tax cut for the upper class.”

No one needs to read a sophisticated analysis (although you can do that, as well) to know these claims are ridiculous. Trump’s tax plan is reducing the top income-tax rate to 35 percent, from 39.6 percent. It is deeply cutting corporate taxes, which benefits people who own a lot of stock. It is eliminating the estate tax.

Want to guess how many families in New York State — population 20 million — are wealthy enough that they’re likely to pay any estate tax next year, according to an estimate based on I.R.S. data? Just 470. The number is so low in Montana, Vermont, West Virginia and four other states — likely fewer than 10 families in each — that the I.R.S. doesn’t provide details, to avoid privacy concerns.

There is no way to make up for tax cuts this large by eliminating deductions, as Mnuchin claimed. The administration isn’t trying very hard, anyway. The deductions for charitable donations and mortgage interest, including on second homes, will remain.

Then there are the two men’s deficit claims. “This tax plan will cut down the deficits by a trillion dollars,” Mnuchin said. Cohn claimed that “we can pay for the entire tax cut through growth.” These may seem marginally more defensive, because they’re predictions. But they’re silly predictions, not so different from my vowing to lose weight by eating more ice cream.

The Harvard economist Greg Mankiw coined the phrase “charlatans and cranks” specifically to describe people who claim that tax cuts pay for themselves. And Mankiw is a conservative who’s worked for George W. Bush and Mitt Romney.

It is not too late for Cohn and Mnuchin to take a different approach. Doing so still won’t win over many people to their tax plan (including me). But they can make a free-market case for lower taxes that is based on something other than lies.

Neither one of them has yet turned 60 years old. These won’t be their last jobs. In the daily scrum, I’m sure that pleasing their boss must seem like the most important possible thing.

In the months and years that followed, Guevara oversaw executions at La Cabaña prison before becoming a top-level economic minister and diplomat, traveling the world to promote Cuba’s ideals.

Departure and Death

In October 1965, Fidel Castro confirmed the growing speculation: Guevara, an increasingly mysterious figure, had left Cuba. Castro read aloud a letter he said he had received from Guevara that said: “I feel I have completed the duty which the Cuban revolution gave me. I say farewell to you.”

He added, “Other nations require my services and I must leave you.”

Photo

Those nations included Congo, where a six-month revolutionary effort failed, and then Bolivia, where he found himself on the run from the country’s army, which was aided by the C.I.A.

After Guevara was captured and summarily killed, it took several days for something close to the truth to emerge. The Bolivian Army initially announced that he had died in a clash and that he had “admitted that he failed in the seven-month guerrilla campaign he organized in Bolivia,” an article on The Times’s front page said.

The next day, the nature of his death became clearer: “A medical report indicated today that Ernesto Che Guevara was slain at least 24 hours after his capture in the southeastern jungle on Sunday,” The Times reported.

Still shrouded in mystery, however, was the location of his body, which was buried secretly in a mass grave. (His hands were cut off and preserved in formaldehyde to prove his identity.)

A Second Burial

It was not until nearly 30 years later that Jon Lee Anderson, who was writing a biography of Guevara, learned of the location, and the revolutionary was given a second burial with full honors in Cuba.

On that occasion, in October 1997, Fidel Castro described him as “the paradigm of the revolutionary” who is “everywhere there is a just cause to defend,” The Times reported.

“I would say you’re a Questioner,” Ms. Rubin told me, because among other things I balked at her quiz questions.
“Questioners don’t like to be questioned,” Ms. Rubin, a proud Upholder, said.
Whatever happened to just being Type A?","Meanwhile, Ms. Rubin gestated her eighth book.

“The Four Tendencies: The Indispensable Personality Profiles That Reveal How to Make Your Life Better (and Other People’s Lives Better, Too),” out last month, is already a best seller. By mid-September, over one million people had taken Ms. Rubin’s online quiz, making her the queen of personality typing.

A colleague of mine took it and learned she is an Obliger, “which is totally messing up my career,” she said. She thinks I’m a Rebel because I’m squirrelly about deadlines, but the quiz deemed me an Upholder when I first took the test, and then a Questioner the second time around; a couple of days ago, I took the test again and came up an Obliger.

Photo

Now Obligers, Ms. Rubin writes, are the most challenging of the Tendencies, other than Rebels. This is because Obligers, pushed to their limits, will go rogue: quit their jobs, walk out on their marriages, abruptly end friendships. Obliger rebellion, she calls it. (Lateness, she writes, is a small but popular form of Obliger rebellion.)

“I would say you’re a Questioner,” Ms. Rubin told me, because among other things I balked at her quiz questions. She had phoned from Los Angeles, where she was on the first leg of her book tour, and was amusing herself by noting how her audiences were dividing themselves by Tendency. “We did a meet-up through the app,” she said, “and only one Rebel showed up in crowd of almost 100 people.” This was not because Rebels won’t R.S.V.P., she concluded, but because “they don’t like to be told they have to arrive between 5 and 7.”

But back to me.

Ms. Rubin said: “Maybe you aren’t meeting your deadlines because you aren’t convinced they are really true.” According to Ms. Rubin’s research, Questioners have other charming weaknesses in addition to a certain mulishness about deadlines. These include “crackpot potential” and an inability “to accept closure on matters that others considered settled if their questions aren’t answered.”

Also, they don’t like to wait in line.

“Questioners don’t like to be questioned,” Ms. Rubin, a proud Upholder, said.

Whatever happened to just being Type A?

Ms. Rubin was a Yale-educated lawyer who once clerked for Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, before diving into the self-help business with her 2009 book, “The Happiness Project: Or, Why I Spent a Year Trying to Sing in the Morning, Clean My Closets, Fight Right, Read Aristotle, and Generally Have More Fun.”

The energetic Ms. Rubin, a member of four book groups who has said that she loves to take notes, “often for no apparent reason,” larded her memoir with insights and observations, nuggets from Nietzsche to Diana Vreeland (and the Duke of Wellington, whose advice is to urinate whenever you get the chance, a happiness booster we can perhaps all agree on), along with enough social science “data” to fill three Malcolm Gladwell books.

The book and its offspring — journals, calendars and coloring books — have been consistent best sellers, having sold close to three million copies, according to Ms. Rubin’s longtime agent, Christy Fletcher.

“It came out in the wake of ‘Eat, Pray, Love,’” said Ms. Fletcher of “The Happiness Project,” “this idea that to find happiness you had to leave your husband and quit your job and eat, pray, love. What Gretchen realized is that most people don’t want to leave their husbands and their jobs, and what she provided was recipes for being happier in place. It created a lot of entry points for people. Everybody can make their bed. What we’ve learned is that this kind of advice couched in the language of one person’s very specific experience was more accessible to people than having the Dalai Lama or a Harvard professor tell you what the human path to happiness is.”

I would argue that Ms. Rubin’s exhaustive and exhausting methods — her rigorous list making and goal setting, her extreme research (speed-reading every parenting manual, say, since Dr. Spock, or the collected works of Plutarch, Montaigne and Adam Smith) — would make all but the most high-functioning humans feel like slackers. But maybe that’s the point: She strives, and you warm yourself in the afterglow of her efforts.

To fully grok Ms. Rubin’s newest oeuvre, I read “The Four Tendencies” and its prequel, “Better Than Before,” in which along with the typology she introduces a complex and confounding layer of additional sorting methods that I gamely, if lamely, tried to assume and address.

But if I was a Lark, a Procrastinator, an Underbuyer, a Simplicity Lover, a Finisher and a Familiarity Lover, as I apparently am according to my answers to the questions in Chapter 3 of “Better,” what did that actually mean and did I have to answer all the other questions Ms. Rubin strewed at the end of that same chapter, and throughout the rest of the book?

In “Better,” Ms. Rubin does attempt to soothe her information-addled readers with a section called “Desire, Ease and Excuses,” all of which, as she writes, “play a role in the Strategies of Abstaining, Convenience, Inconvenience, Safeguards, Loophole-Spotting, Distraction, Reward, Treats and Pairing,” but I had already grown contrary. Perhaps it was all the capital letters. Or was I exhibiting the hallmarks of my type?

Questioners, Ms. Rubin writes, follow “their own judgment — sometimes even when it flies in the face of experts who (allegedly) know more.”

Personality typing has long bubbled merrily atop the self-help soup. Self-improvement may be a distinctly American habit, from its founding, a national credo, but the father of psychological types was Carl Jung, the Swiss psychiatrist, who laid them out in a book of the same name in 1921.

“It has a long and sordid history in psychology, especially pop psychology,” said Scott O. Lilienfeld, a professor of psychology at Emory College, in an email. “Most people seem to love sorting themselves into discrete, mutually exclusive categories (e.g., I’m an extrovert, you’re an introvert; I’m a perceiver, you’re a judger). Managers, bosses, and administrators seem to love them too. None of this is terribly surprising. Decades of psychological research show that the human mind craves simplicity and prefers categories to dimensions when it comes to conceptualizing ourselves and others.”

On online dating profiles, some note their Myers-Briggs type, that hoary system based on Jung’s types and beloved by white-collar companies since the 1970s, as if it were a professional affiliation or a college degree.

“As swipe-based dating apps proliferate, the pressure is on to differentiate yourself in sound bites,” said Emily Listfield, a co-founder of Jyst, a dating-advice app. “One trend we see is people putting their personality types in their profiles as a shortcut to describing themselves. The problem is that most people have no idea what the acronyms stand for. ‘Likes long walks on the beach, looking for a woman who can wear jeans or a little black dress, E.N.F.P.’ leaves most people scratching their heads.”

Ms. Listfield recalled an inscrutable profile from a military veteran who proclaimed his score from two personality systems, Myers-Briggs and something called Kolbe, a business-performance classification that rates you in a very unsexy series of numbers.

(One yearns for simpler times: “Sultry Scorpio seeks Tempestuous Leo.”)

“This kind of neat categorization is highly appealing when one’s internal emotions and struggles are so messy,” said Natalia Mehlman Petrzela, an associate professor of history at the New School who has been researching wellness and self-help culture since the 1950s. “Isn’t it comforting to put yourself in a box that others occupy as well? Doesn’t that assure us of our normalcy? And unlike, say, trying to understand your problems through a clinical source like the D.S.M.” — the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the Baedeker of pathologies and a bucketing good read — “all of the categories tend to have some generally objectively positive traits. That is, you won’t arrive at the diagnosis that you’re a narcissist or a sociopath in a popular self-help book, in part because no one would buy that book.”

Self-help enthusiasts do buy an awful lot of books. A third to one-half of all Americans will buy a self-help title in their lifetimes, said Christine Whelan, a professor of consumer science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, adding that at any given time there are more than 45,000 titles in print.

Last year, the entire self-help industry — books and products — was worth nearly $10 billion, according to Market Data Enterprises. A self-help author herself, Dr. Whelan wrote her Ph.D. thesis on the history of the self-improvement movement in the United States (and met Ms. Rubin, coincidentally, in the stacks of the main branch of the New York Public Library, where both had holed up to do their research).

“Since 1975, self-help books — nonfiction books that offer advice for behavior modification and make explicit promises for positive change — have doubled as a percentage of all book titles,” Dr. Whelan said. “Self-help offers us hope that we can take control of our lives. The more alienated we feel from what’s going on in the larger world, the more likely we are to seek to regain some sense of control. And what can you control? Yourself.”

Ms. Rubin, though, bristles at the term “self-help.” “I always think of my books as being self-helpful,” she said. “How do we achieve our aims in life? How do we make ourselves happier and more productive? What’s the category for that? I don’t know.”

She divides self-help authors into Astronomers (scholarly) and Astrologers (intuitive), placing herself firmly in the Astronomer camp.

Personality typologies seem to multiply with each publishing season, growing ever more baffling. Everett Jones, the reviews editor at Publishers Weekly, recalled “Reconcilable Differences: Connecting in a Disconnected World,” out last June, whose authors rated people according to their communication styles, which they described as visual, auditory or kinesthetic. It was a confounding paradigm that created some unfortunate acronyms: VAK, VKA, KAV and so forth.

“Our reviewer found it too elaborate and indecipherable,” Mr. Jones said. “I think you need a story, something you can latch on to.”

Mr. Jones admired the archetypes in a coming book, “The Right and Wrong Stuff: How Brilliant Careers Are Made and Unmade,” out next January. These are five mind-sets that apparently are impediments to successful careers: Captain Fantastic, Solo Flyer, Version 1.0, One Trick Pony and Whirling Dervish. (To my mind, that’s a tad too much narrative, but I’m still recovering from the collected works of Ms. Rubin.)

Mary Ellen O’Neill, an editor at Workman Publishing, is wrapping up her edits on “Your Story Is Your Power: Free Your Feminine Voice,” out next March, a self-help title that uses methods including the Enneagram, another ’70s holdout, to figure out how you developed your worldview and how you can rid yourself of patriarchal and other cultural biases — second-wave feminism meets personality typing for the woke generation.

Remember Kingdomality? Neither do I. But in 2005, this mash-up of pop psychology and parable making presented in a business self-help book of the same name was poised to be a best-seller. Or so its publisher hoped, said Ms. O’Neill, the book’s editor, who was then at Hyperion. “The parable was that there was a king, and his kingdom was in disarray. If he could figure what everybody’s job should be, the kingdom would be in better order.”

There were eight questions, she said, that led you to one of 12 personality types. “It was fascinating because it was so accurate. It identified your personality to a T. Everyone at Hyperion took it. I was a Shepherd, which meant I was really good at keeping things organized and together. Here’s the funny thing. Each type had a logo that went with it. The Benevolent Ruler was a heart with a crown on top of it. And our head of sales, who was also deemed a Benevolent Ruler, happened to have a tattoo on her shoulder of a heart with a crown on it. That was how she saw herself. It was pretty great.”

Nonetheless, the book was published to the sound of crickets, Ms. O’Neill said.

“I have a feeling that Kingdomality was the end of the parable trend,” she said. “And it was a very goofy parable.”",Whatever Happened to Just Being Type A?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/style/personality-type-the-four-tendencies-gretchen-rubin.html

In an email, Mr. Guglielmi said the punishment was consistent with that in “other cases in which officers engaged in potential political activity while on duty and in uniform.” This year an officer was reprimanded for displaying a “Make America Great Again” hat in a squad car, he said.

“Police officers must serve and protect people on both sides of any given issue,” Mr. Guglielmi said. “They can’t effectively do that if they are perceived to take one side over another. So when officers are on duty and wearing the uniform, there are no sides, just service to anyone who needs them.”

Asked whether that meant the officers who posed with Ms. Clark would not have been reprimanded if they had taken the photo while off duty and out of uniform, he said, “Absolutely.”

The photo was particularly resonant in Chicago, a city where the Justice Department found in January that the police had frequently violated civil rights; where civil rights groups filed a lawsuit in June alleging police abuses; where protests erupted over the police shooting of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald; where an officer was convicted in August for shooting two black teenagers in a car that was driving away from him. The city’s police and politicians have been trying in various ways to gain residents’ trust.

Mayor Rahm Emanuel told reporters on Tuesday that he supported the decision to reprimand the officers, and that the Police Department’s policy was consistent. But he acknowledged that the officers “were somewhat betwixt, between two different aspirations”: the desire to follow department rules and the desire to improve relations between the police and the public, The Sun-Times reported.

Kneeling took on popular significance as a form of protest in 2016, when the National Football League player Colin Kaepernick did it during the national anthem. But when President Trump denounced it last week, what had been isolated actions exploded into a national display of defiance, with players from New York to Indianapolis to Los Angeles dropping to their knees on the sidelines of their Sunday games.

There was substantial evidence that he had done so. There was also reason to think that Mr. McCoy’s belief in his innocence was both earnest and delusional.

There was no ambiguity in Mr. McCoy’s position, Mr. English recalled.

“I know that Robert was completely opposed to me telling the jury that he was guilty of killing the three victims,” Mr. English said. “But I believed that this was the only way to save his life.”

When they tried to discuss the case with Mr. English, they wrote, he responded with a tirade and “insulted us by talking to us as if we were children.”

During his opening statement at the trial, Mr. English did what he had promised to do. “I’m telling you,” he told the jury, “Mr. McCoy committed these crimes.”

Mr. McCoy objected. “Judge Cox,” he said, “Mr. English is simply selling me out.”

“I did not murder my family, your honor,” Mr. McCoy said. “I had alibis of me being out of state. Your honor, this is unconstitutional for you to keep an attorney on my case when this attorney is completely selling me out.”

Whatever its wisdom, Mr. English’s trial strategy failed. Mr. McCoy was convicted and sentenced to death. He appealed to the Louisiana Supreme Court, saying his lawyer had betrayed him. The court ruled against him.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

“Given the circumstances of this crime and the overwhelming evidence incriminating the defendant,” the court said, “admitting guilt in an attempt to avoid the imposition of the death penalty appears to constitute reasonable trial strategy.”

The decision relied on a unanimous 2004 ruling from the United States Supreme Court in Florida v. Nixon, which said lawyers need not obtain their clients’ express consent before conceding guilt in a capital case. But the ruling did not address whether it was permissible for a lawyer to disregard a client’s explicit instruction to the contrary.

That is the question in the new case, McCoy v. Louisiana, No. 16-8255.

The right answer, Louisiana prosecutors told the justices, is that lawyers may ignore their clients’ wishes. “Counsel’s strategic choices should not be impeded by a rigid blanket rule demanding the defendant’s consent,” they wrote in a brief urging the court not to hear the case.

Mr. English declined requests for an interview, saying he would not comment until after the Supreme Court ruled.

In a brief supporting Mr. McCoy, the Ethics Bureau at Yale, a law school clinic, said Mr. English had essentially switched sides. “Far from testing the prosecution’s case,” the brief said, “Mr. English seemed downright eager to advance it.”

Mr. McCoy’s situation is not particularly unusual, according to a second supporting brief, this one filed by the Louisiana Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and the Promise of Justice Initiative, a nonprofit group. “In Louisiana,” the brief said, “a capital defendant has no right to a lawyer who will insist on his innocence.”

Since 2000, the brief said, the Louisiana Supreme Court allowed defense lawyers to concede their clients’ guilt in four other capital cases over the clients’ express objections.

The Sixth Amendment guarantees a right to “the assistance of counsel.” Those words, the Supreme Court said in 1975 in Faretta v. California, indicate that the client is the boss.

“It speaks of the ‘assistance’ of counsel,” Justice Potter Stewart wrote, “and an assistant, however expert, is still an assistant.”",Facing the Death Penalty With a Disloyal Lawyer,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/09/us/politics/death-penalty-supreme-court-attorney.html

SAN JUAN, P.R. — Gov. Ricardo A. Rosselló of Puerto Rico discussed the aftermath of Hurricane Maria and the needs of island residents with a reporter from The New York Times on Tuesday. Here are his remarks, edited for length and clarity.

Q. What keeps you up at night?

A. The safety of the people of Puerto Rico. I haven’t slept much. It’s been very intense, but I am committed to making sure that during this emergency period we have our people safe, we can make sure they are alive, getting food and water. After we stabilize the situation, we can think about how to rebuild Puerto Rico.

Q. What’s your biggest worry?

A. Here’s my worry: the perception that this is just, for lack of a better term, this was a regular hurricane impact. This is a major catastrophic event here. Puerto Rico, within the span of two weeks, received two Category 4-5 hurricanes. That has never happened anywhere. The devastation has been enormous.

Q. Have you spoken to President Trump?

A. I have spoken to him at least five times. A few hours ago, I was in the Situation Room briefing him. He has been acting proactively. He issued two pre-landfall emergency declarations for Puerto Rico. That had never been done before. He declared Puerto Rico a disaster area practically while the storm was still hitting Puerto Rico.

Q. What do you tell him? The phones are down; the lines are around the streets and back; hospitals are closed. Where do you begin to tell him what you need?

A. There are several priorities. The health care situation, making sure we have hospitals running, making sure we have situational awareness of those hospitals.

We have fuel in Puerto Rico, the distribution has been a little slow. We have been hard pressed to find bus drivers; we are hard pressed to communicate with people. It’s been a little slower than expected.

Q. What happened to the drivers?

A. Several things. There has been severe devastation on many parts of the island. There are places still disconnected in terms of roads. People can’t get out of where they are at. If you happen to be a driver that was there, you can’t leave.

Second, and this is happening to all our government employees: There has been a reduced percentage of people who have reported. Some have reported to say, “Hey we’re stuck, we can’t leave.” So those are the reasons. We are finding more of them. Things are moving.

Again, the anxiety builds because people feel there is no fuel, when there is. And we made some progress there: 48 hours ago, we had 181 gas stations open, and now we have 450.

Q. How many are there total?

A. 1,100

Q. For there to be this level of a communication failure, was there a failure of some kind, was it an inevitable act of God and nobody’s fault, or was there a problem somewhere?

A. If we are going to talk about the root causes, our energy infrastructure had not been maintained properly for, you know, over a decade. We had a very, very weak energy infrastructure. I came in eight months ago, and one of our objectives was to go to the private sector and see how we can refurbish and renew this infrastructure. It was subject to collapse even when there wasn’t an emergency or an event like this.

Communications are essentially down. It affects essentially everything. In terms of some underlying problems that we had, sure, I would significantly point to a few: the power generation structure. It was old, it was unmaintained.

Vulnerable housing, houses made out of wood. They just didn’t stand a chance. They just didn’t stand a chance. That’s why our efforts five days before the storm was, “Hey, if you are in a flooded area, or in wooden housing, or mudslide region, get out or you will lose your life.”

Q. How is it that there are hospitals without generators and satellite phones?

A. Most hospitals have generators; they ran out of fuel. What we are doing in terms of fuel is making sure it gets to hospitals.

Some capability of sat coms should be around the island. We didn’t have it. What we have been doing is, provisionally, I’ve been going personally and my team has been going personally to different sides of the island and handing over sat phones to the mayors so they can communicate.

But again, once the infrastructure collapsed, in terms of the energy grid, and because we had many obstacles in the roads, and some communities were essentially cut off, those things aggravate one another. There’s no communication, there’s no direct linking, and that’s why this became an enormous challenge.

Q. How long will it take to restore power?

A. It depends. Pockets will be restored earlier. There was severe devastation. To give you a sense, Irma came by, Irma shook the power grid. We had to revamp it. It took us about 10 days to get to 97 percent. Not one tower was harmed. I saw personally at least 30 towers, in pieces, collapsed. This is completely different. We are going to need generators.

Q. Are you pleased with the pace of aid, the relief?

A. Here’s the thing, and I want to be very clear with this. I am very pleased with the consideration the president has given to Puerto Rico. He has been on top of it, at least personally in communication with me and communication with some of our officials as well as his officials. However we still need more, and the president understands that, and his team understands that.

Because it was an unprecedented event, on an island, that’s something needs to be considered. This is not a Category 3 hurricane going to Florida, causing severe devastation but also having the access of people in Georgia, New York and so forth driving down and giving you the resources. We have to actually bring them down by boats or airplanes. And adding to that, air traffic control has been clogged. We are working at about a 20 percent clip. With that 20 percent, when we notified the administration, they took action quickly, they opened alternative airports that would alleviate the need for more resources to come to San Juan.

Q. You were tough yesterday in your words and suggested Puerto Ricans were being treated as second-class citizens. Presumably you meant in comparison to Texas and Florida, which were recently hit by storms.

A. I was [giving] a warning essentially to Congress, to take action. I wanted to make sure, and I think that message got across, that people know [our] people are U.S. citizens.

Q. I’ve had people on social media tell me that they hoped Puerto Ricans would not be able to come to the United States, because we’ve already met the 50,000 refugee cap.

A. So this is why there needs to be some orientation on this front, which is one of the reasons that the federal government also needs to act. If it doesn’t act, one of the outcomes is a massive exodus of Puerto Ricans, who are U.S. citizens, and can fly in and fly out without any sort of paperwork, they just need to buy a plane ticket. That will cause deep demographic turmoil for us here in Puerto Rico and it will cause deep demographic turmoil in the states where they go as well.

Q. You talked about a humanitarian crisis. Are you worried about disease?

A. My words yesterday were to warn about a possible humanitarian crisis. We don’t want the United States to have a humanitarian crisis, and it could happen here in Puerto Rico.",What Keeps Puerto Rico’s Governor Awake at Night,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/us/governor-puerto-rico-rossello-hurricane.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Ms. Yingluck became Thailand’s first female prime minister in 2011, having had no prior experience in politics. She was widely considered a proxy for Mr. Thaksin, a controversial but popular former telecommunications tycoon who served as prime minister for five years before he was ousted in a coup in 2006. Mr. Thaksin was later convicted in absentia on conflict of interest charges, after having fled the country himself.

Since 2001, every nationwide election in Thailand has resulted in victories for Mr. Thaksin or political forces loyal to him. But judicial actions and a pair of army coups have unseated each of these governments.

Mr. Thaksin’s sister was removed from office in May 2014, after the Constitutional Court found her guilty of abuse of power. The same month, the army orchestrated its latest coup, one of a dozen successful putsches carried out since Thailand abandoned absolute monarchy in 1932.

Thailand’s politics are cleaved, roughly, between the rural poor, who have supported the populist policies of politicians aligned with Mr. Thaksin’s family, and a traditional ruling class that has dismissed the Shinawatra clan as corrupt, power-hungry and dangerously divisive.

A security crackdown on street protests by Mr. Thaksin’s supporters in 2010 resulted in more than 90 deaths in downtown Bangkok.

Since then, Thailand has experienced periods of martial law, and its economic growth has trailed that of other Southeast Asian nations. The country’s current Constitution, drafted under the oversight of a junta that calls itself the National Council for Peace and Order, curtails democratic institutions. It stipulates that the upper house of Thailand’s Parliament, for instance, is appointed, rather than elected.

The junta, led by Mr. Prayuth, has promised elections next year. But with Ms. Yingluck and her brother in self-imposed exile, and many in the top echelons of Pheu Thai sidelined by various legal rulings, it is unclear how effectively the party’s supporters will be able to campaign.

Last month, a former commerce minister who served in Ms. Yingluck’s cabinet was sentenced to 42 years in prison in connection with the rice program.

At the courthouse on Wednesday, some of Ms. Yingluck’s supporters sounded philosophical about both the verdict and the exile of the Shinawatra siblings.

“Maybe it is good that they both aren’t here, because now the other side can stop saying we are Shinawatra slaves,” said Rungrawee Chaloenpol, a market vendor, breaking down in tears. “Now we can fight for true democracy without having the Shinawatra name attached to us.”","Yingluck Shinawatra, Ex-Leader Who Fled Thailand, Gets 5-Year Sentence",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/world/asia/thailand-yingluck-sentence.html

The main attractions have been hotels, condominiums, office buildings and distressed real estate loans.

Few tears will be shed for financial losses borne by wealthy investors who gambled on Puerto Rico, especially those like Mr. Paulson, who made billions off the 2008 collapse of the United States housing market.

But the interests of these investors and the Puerto Rican economy might be aligned. Tourism supports more than 60,000 jobs in Puerto Rico. Luring deep-pocketed investors from the mainland has the potential to hasten the island’s recovery.

At the moment, though, those investors are staring at hard-to-quantify red ink.

“We sustained a lot of damage, and we’re facing very significant losses,” said Brian Tenenbaum, regional director for the Morgan Reed Group, which owns or operates several office buildings, commercial buildings and residential complexes on the island.

Samuel Kirschner, chief operating officer with CPG Real Estate, which has been investing in commercial and residential properties in Puerto Rico for nearly 18 years, has struggled to get his properties open because of damage from the storm. After chartering a private plane from Fort Lauderdale, Fla., with canned goods, diapers and batteries, CPG managed to partly open an outdoor shopping plaza in San Juan. The idea was to give residents a place to drink, eat and cool down.

“We’re going to lose a lot of money opening it now,” Mr. Kirschner said.

The Puerto Rico Tourism Company lists at least seven hotels closed with no clear reopening date. About two dozen expect to begin taking reservations before the end of October. Some resorts are said to have suffered little structural damage but severe damage to their beaches and grounds. Tourists might balk at returning to the island anytime soon.

“The turnaround was set back years,” said David Tawil of Maglan Capital, whose firm used to hold Puerto Rican debt.

On Tuesday, the bondholders, including big investment firms such as OppenheimerFunds, the Baupost Group and Tilden Park Capital Management, got a jolt when President Trump said some of Puerto Rico’s debt might have to be wiped out — a comment that sent the price of those already distressed bonds plunging. Prices stabilized after the White House clarified that the administration was not planning to interfere with the bankruptcy process.

The pool of bond investors — many of which bought Puerto Rico’s debt at deeply distressed prices — is different from those that plunged into real estate. But both camps are now betting that insurance payouts and aid from Washington will speed the commonwealth’s recovery and increase the value of their investments.

“I think a lot of money will be spent fixing Puerto Rico, and that should be better for everyone,” said Marc Lasry, a founder of the Avenue Capital Group, a hedge fund that owns some of Puerto Rico’s debt.

Some investors are calling for an ambitious federal rescue package — an initiative that would help both the island and the investors’ bottom lines.

“The electrical grid has had catastrophic damage, and Congress is going to need a major relief bill,” said Adam Greenfader, who runs AG&T, a company that owns a number of lower-income housing complexes on the island. “Many people will leave if things don’t get turned around quick enough.”

As for Mr. Paulson, two of his resorts — Condado Vanderbilt Hotel and La Concha Renaissance San Juan Resort — suffered minimal damage and are housing federal relief workers and hotel employees whose homes were damaged. Federal workers are being charged a negotiated rate, while employees are staying at no cost. A third resort, St. Regis Bahia Beach Resort, is currently closed.

In a statement, Paulson & Company said, “We look forward to welcoming guests as early as the winter season.”

Mr. Paulson’s firm, which once managed $36 billion, has shrunk to just under $10 billion after a series of bad trades in recent years. This year, several of his funds have suffered further losses. Mr. Paulson has trumpeted his wager on Puerto Rico as a crucial part of his long-term investment strategy.

Mr. Paulson, speaking at an investment conference last year, compared Puerto Rico to Miami in the 1980s, when Miami had many abandoned buildings and vacant lots.

Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times 周日，在2011年的地震及海啸中受灾严重的气仙重新开放了当地的佛寺。

幕后故事

对于日本气仙(Kesen)来说，这个周末是个大日子。2011年3月地震及海啸侵袭过后，气仙成为了日本众多受灾严重的社区之一。

周日，气仙重新开放了它的佛寺。经常为我们的早报挑选图片的时报图片编辑益池广子(Hiroko Masuike)在现场捕捉了那一刻。

益池每年会前往当地两次，记录下居民们自灾难发生后重建生活的努力。那次灾难导致近1.6万人丧生，并且引发了核电站熔毁灾难。

在这里的其中一个村庄，海啸导致200多人丧生，让大部分的建筑都成了废墟。

益池说，这场灾难留下的疮疤今日仍历历在目。大多数居民都已搬走，仅有10座建筑得到了重建。

但她说，气仙的故事也展现着坚韧。一位名为小林信夫(Nobuo Kobayashi)的僧人留在了当地，通过出售土地和捐赠的帮助，在更高的地势上重建了这个有着1100年历史的金刚佛寺。经过艰苦的努力，寺庙里的佛像也得到了恢复。

周日，约300人聚集起来参加了开放仪式。来自日本各地的僧人们为逝者诵经，益池说，“他们为这座庙能在这里永存祈祷。”","

The race in many ways presaged the campaign of Mr. Trump, whose prospects Mr. Miller soon eyed with excitement.
“Trump gets it,” Mr. Miller wrote to friends weeks later, forwarding a Breitbart interview with Mr. Trump, who concluded that Mr. Cantor’s defeat owed to “his softness on immigration.”“I wish he’d run for president,” Mr. Miller added of Mr. Trump.
When he did, Mr. Miller joined him early, before a vote had been cast in the primaries — and before Mr.
“We’re going to build that wall, and we’re going to build it out of love!” Mr. Miller promised.","“He just seemed really happy,” said Charles Gould, a classmate and friend at the time, “as if that’s how he planned it.”

In the years since, Mr. Miller has rocketed to the upper reaches of White House influence along a distinctly Trumpian arc — powered by a hyper-fluency in the politics of grievance, a gift for nationalist button-pushing after years on the Republican fringe and a long history of being underestimated by liberal forces who dismissed him as a sideshow since his youth.

Across his sun-kissed former home, the so-called People’s Republic of Santa Monica, they have come to regret this initial assessment. To the consternation of many former classmates and a bipartisan coalition of Washington lawmakers, Mr. Miller has become one of the nation’s most powerful shapers of domestic and even foreign policy.

“The 31-year-old?” Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, muttered to reporters earlier this year, despairing over who might be making decisions in Mr. Trump’s White House.

Yet on perhaps the president’s signature issue — immigration policy — Mr. Miller has emerged in recent days as the driving force behind the administration’s insistence on a wish list of hard-right proposals as part of any deal with Democrats to protect young undocumented immigrants from deportation. White House demands include a crackdown on unaccompanied children at the border, the construction of a border wall with Mexico and legislation to sharply reduce legal immigration.

As the surviving watchman on the president’s right flank since the removal in August of Stephen K. Bannon as chief strategist, Mr. Miller also remains a key craftsman in speechwriting at the White House. Mr. Trump, who has long prized Mr. Miller’s fierce loyalty, has embraced his instincts to sharply restrict the number of refugees admitted to the United States next year and to impose new travel restrictions on several predominantly Muslim countries and others deemed to be national security risks.

From the administration’s opening stanzas — when Mr. Trump let fly his “American carnage” inaugural address — to his swaggering turn last month before the United Nations, it is Mr. Miller’s worldview, as often as anyone’s, that the president projects on the grandest scale.

“We have this running joke,” said Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, “that if we were going to get key man’s insurance on anyone, Stephen would top the list.” She was referring to policies that companies take out on their most important employee.

The Beginnings in Santa Monica

Mr. Miller’s journey to this point, outlined over dozens of interviews with friends, classmates and current and former colleagues, is a triumph of unbending convictions and at least occasional contrivance. It is a story of beliefs that congealed early in a home that he helped nudge to the right of its blue-state ZIP code, and of an ideology that became an identity for a spindly agitator at a large and racially divided public high school.

These formative years supplied the template for the life Mr. Miller has carved out for himself in Washington, where he remains the hard-line jouster many of Mr. Trump’s most zealous supporters trust most in the White House — and many former peers fear.

“I can hear Stephen’s voice,” said a fellow Santa Monica student, Nick Silverman. “Even when Trump reads these statements, I know, ‘That’s Stephen.’”

Through Mr. Miller’s nearly nine months in the Trump White House, the question — how did he come from here? — has curdled across these eight square miles of progressive oceanside paradise, where a stroll near the beach can quickly produce images that border on a self-parody of limousine liberalism. Environmentalist stickers festoon a neighborhood pocked with gas guzzlers; a small dog, seated in a stroller, twitches in the sea breeze, rumbling past a homeless man sprawled across a sidewalk bench.

“It does have this tang of the seething id of Santa Monica,” another student, Jake Zambas, said of Mr. Miller’s nativist streak, noting that their high school, like the town, was largely self-segregating. “Everyone here is just a scared white person.”

In his time on this campus of roughly 3,000 students, Mr. Miller sculpted the brand of hard-charging conservatism that would deliver him to the president’s ear, tracing a pathway at once complicated and straightforward. Mr. Miller, the middle child in a financially comfortable Jewish family, plainly relished the attention and notoriety of being the city’s red-hued exception, according to classmates — some of whom recalled chuckling at, or at least shrugging off, the antics of their resident gadfly. The line between puckishness and principle blurred in due time.

Mr. Miller set off on a patriotic semi-striptease before the editor of the student newspaper, according to the editor, Ari Rosmarin, theatrically removing a button-down to reveal an American flag T-shirt in protest of an article he found inconsistent with the national interest. (The White House denied any symbolic unbuttoning, though officials confirmed Mr. Miller’s fondness for the T-shirt.)

He jumped, uninvited, into the final stretch of a girls’ track meet, apparently intent on proving his athletic supremacy over the opposite sex. (The White House, reaching for exculpatory context, noted that this was a girls’ team from another school, not his own.)

Most memorably, classmates say, Mr. Miller established a reputation for barreling eagerly toward racial tinderboxes, leaving some to wonder whether his words were meant to be menacing or hammy. Jason Islas, who had been friendly with Mr. Miller in middle school, has little doubt.

Shortly before the start of ninth grade, Mr. Islas said, he received a call from Mr. Miller informing him that the two could no longer be friends.

“He gives me this litany of reasons,” Mr. Islas said.

Most were petty, if mean, he recalled: an insult about his social awkwardness, a dig at his acne-specked face. But one stuck out.

“He mentioned my Latino heritage as one of the reasons,” Mr. Islas said. “I remember coming away from the conversation being like, ‘O.K., that’s that.’”

Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, called Mr. Islas’s account “a completely inaccurate characterization of their relationship, or lack thereof,” disputing his recollection and suggesting the two were more acquaintances than friends.

But several students said Mr. Miller’s trail of racially tinged comments amounted to a pattern. He railed against bilingual announcements, asking in a local editorial why there were “usually very few, if any, Hispanic students in my honors classes, despite the large number of Hispanic students that attend our school.”

Latino students remembered him engaging them outside group meetings, asking why they required a separate forum to discuss issues of identity, and chafing at Spanish being spoken in the halls.

“He tended to make some of the Spanish language stuff very personal,” said Moises Castillo, a classmate who described the exchanges as hurtful to this day. “There was a ‘if you’re not speaking English, perhaps you should go somewhere else.’”

He was asked whether Mr. Miller may have been leaning into a sort of provocative shtick, or crafting a character deliberately. In the campaign speech, after all — a portion of which was captured on video and published by Univision in February — Mr. Miller often appears to be smirking.

“It’s a character?” Mr. Castillo said. “When you hear it more than once, when you hear it in private, when you hear it in public, that ‘character’ kind of fades away. That benefit of the doubt is gone.”

Mentors on the Right

Mr. Miller’s defenders have argued that Mr. Miller’s high school persona — more merry prankster than fearsome bomb thrower, in their view — should not diminish the seriousness of his beliefs. Mr. Miller has attributed his conservative awakening, in part, to encountering right-leaning writings on gun policy and other issues, including a 1994 book, “Guns, Crime and Freedom” by Wayne LaPierre, the National Rifle Association leader.

Mr. Miller has said he was also shaped by his school’s response to the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when he confronted what he believed to be excess political correctness and insufficient support for American military efforts. Among his causes: pressing administrators to require the daily recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance. (He prevailed.)

Mr. Miller found mentors in David Horowitz, the onetime “New Left” Marxist who evolved into a conservative author, and a radio host, Larry Elder, who booked Mr. Miller as a recurring guest. He courted local controversy by inviting both to campus for speeches.

“He was already reading Ayn Rand. He was already reading the Federalist Papers,” Mr. Elder said, describing Mr. Miller as effectively a fully formed ideologue by the time he contacted the radio host’s show. “It’s not an act. He believes what he believes.”

News articles have often described Mr. Miller as the product of liberals whose politics changed through sheer force of their son’s arguments. Public documents do support this timeline: Mr. Miller’s parents, Michael and Miriam, changed their registration to Republican from Democrat after Mr. Miller left for college, according to Los Angeles County records.

But some who knew the family at the time have challenged the suggestion that he was raised in a classically hard-left Southern California home.

Ms. Miller’s brother, David Glosser, said the elder Mr. Miller, a real estate investor, had longed skewed conservative on some issues, describing him as a “responsible, thoughtful sort of economic Republican” that Mr. Glosser contrasted with Mr. Trump.

Messages left for Mr. Miller’s parents were not returned. Mr. Miller declined to be interviewed.

At Santa Monica Synagogue, the Millers proved an awkward fit in the largely liberal Reform congregation, according to people who knew them then. The younger Mr. Miller — true to form — established himself as the perpetually debate-ready boy who most enjoyed taking on all comers in 10th-grade confirmation class. A group photo, with Mr. Miller grinning from the back row in a prayer shawl, still hangs in the hall.

“We did our best here,” said Mr. Miller’s rabbi, Jeff Marx, “to teach Jewish ethics and talk about our need to reach out to the strangers, to those less fortunate than we are.”

By then, the Miller family had suffered its own notable reversal of fortunes. Earthquake-related property damage had upended Michael Miller’s real estate business, forcing the family to eventually abandon its stately home in the city’s exclusive North of Montana neighborhood.

Some classmates have speculated that the move, which found the family in a new house a short distance from the grittier and far more ethnically diverse Pico neighborhood, helped shape Mr. Miller’s still-developing views of race and class as he wended through his teens.

But others have dismissed this theory, suggesting that the family’s plight should not be overstated. A visit on a recent weekday found a succession of Mercedes-Benzes and Lexuses gliding down the block, with a team of Latino workers tending to landscaping along the sidewalk.

“They still moved to a two-story house in Santa Monica,” said Taylor Brinckerhoff, a family friend of the Millers’ who often attended Passover dinners with them.

For fellow students, the most credible origin story for Mr. Miller remains the simplest.

Surely he believed what he was saying, or at least most of it. But he also seemed to grasp quickly that contrarianism could be its own reward in an ecosystem of the like-minded, a way to stand out among the egos and trust funds of a singular American school district.

“Confrontation was his sort of modus operandi,” said Mr. Rosmarin, the former Santa Monica high school newspaper editor, who now works for the American Civil Liberties Union. “I think it’s why he came to school in the morning.”

And there is little doubt that he subscribed early to a future tenet of Breitbart-era conservatism: If you are upsetting liberals, you are probably doing something right.

“That was you?” Andrew Breitbart, the founder of the far-right website that bears his name, asked Mr. Miller in 2011, according to three people present for the exchange, during a gathering at the Breitbart townhouse beside the Supreme Court.

When Mr. Miller’s history was mentioned, these people said, Mr. Breitbart instantly recalled the California teenager who had become something of a cult figure in right-wing news media for laying verbal waste to his high school.

Duke, and on to Washington

The megaphones only got louder, a function of timing and gumption.

As a student at Duke University, when the school became a national political minefield in 2006 after a black woman accused three white lacrosse players of rape, Mr. Miller sensed an opportunity.

Where most students and professors sided quickly with the alleged victim, Mr. Miller became the players’ most vocal defender on cable television, appearing on Fox News to accuse the prosecutor of a witch hunt long before the case collapsed.

“We are at a terrible dearth of intelligent, common-sense, courageous voices on campus,” Mr. Miller, then a senior, told Bill O’Reilly on his Fox show, taking something of a victory lap.

After graduating, Mr. Miller moved to Washington to work as press secretary for Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota. By 2009, he found his way to Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama (Mr. Horowitz, the author, had introduced them), and he was eventually elevated to Mr. Sessions’s communications director.

In their years together, Mr. Miller positioned himself — and helped position Mr. Sessions, now the attorney general — inside the Republican Party’s burgeoning Breitbart wing, seizing on immigration as a central issue while bipartisan immigration legislation slithered through Congress in 2013.

Mr. Miller also found common cause with Mr. Bannon, who hoped to fashion the Breitbart News site into a battlefield for the so-called alt-right, a far-right fringe movement that often embraces an ideology of white nationalism. In 2014, the two helped propel a nearly anonymous House candidate in Virginia, Dave Brat, to a primary election victory over Eric Cantor, the majority leader at the time, in part by hammering Mr. Cantor as overly tolerant of illegal immigration. The race in many ways presaged the campaign of Mr. Trump, whose prospects Mr. Miller soon eyed with excitement.

“Trump gets it,” Mr. Miller wrote to friends weeks later, forwarding a Breitbart interview with Mr. Trump, who concluded that Mr. Cantor’s defeat owed to “his softness on immigration.”

“I wish he’d run for president,” Mr. Miller added of Mr. Trump.

When he did, Mr. Miller joined him early, before a vote had been cast in the primaries — and before Mr. Sessions became Mr. Trump’s most significant elected supporter. At rallies, Mr. Miller often warmed up crowds in his dark suits, his receding hairline slicked back. “We’re going to build that wall, and we’re going to build it out of love!” Mr. Miller promised.

Mr. Miller quickly grew comfortable with Mr. Trump’s impromptu style during the campaign, on more than one occasion ripping up a completed speech in the back of the candidate’s black S.U.V. because Mr. Trump had a change of heart on the way to an event.

And people close to both men say that more than anyone, Mr. Miller has grasped how to fuse the cadences of Mr. Trump’s own plain-spoken language with something loftier, at times scribbling notes on a piece of paper pressed to the side of a car window as he jotted down the president’s thoughts.

Occasionally, Mr. Miller has retained a public-facing role. In August, when the administration announced its support for a proposal to slash legal immigration, the White House briefing room belonged to him.

By the time the news conference was over, Mr. Miller had sparred with The New York Times, accused a CNN reporter of “cosmopolitan bias” and suggested that the poem associated with the Statue of Liberty (“Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses”) should not inform American immigration policy because it was not added to Liberty Island until 17 years after the statue’s unveiling.

As he spoke, Ms. Sanders, the press secretary, inched closer, sensing it was time to reclaim the microphone. But Mr. Miller seemed tickled by the combat.

“I think that went exactly as planned,” Mr. Miller said coyly, finally ceding the stage. “I think that was exactly what we were hoping to have happen.”","Stephen Miller, the Powerful Survivor on the President’s Right Flank",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/09/us/politics/stephen-miller-trump-white-house.html

“Why go in there with batons and guns when you can go in with something simple, like a sound generator?” said Dr. Geoffrey S. F. Ling, a neurologist at Johns Hopkins University and the former director of the Biological Technologies Office of the federal Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.

The Pentagon funded development of loudspeakers to deliver long-range blasts of sound. The Navy uses them to ward off pirates, while the Army deploys them at checkpoints. In recent years, police have used so-called long range acoustic devices to break up crowds like those at the protests in Ferguson, Mo.

But these weapons work because they are insufferably loud, and if one were used against diplomats in Cuba, there would be no mystery about it. So speculation has swirled around another possibility: a device producing a sound outside the range of human hearing.

One possibility is infrasound — low-frequency sound that cannot be heard by humans. A report by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences in 2002 noted that the military had tried to weaponize infrasound but had not succeeded because it was hard to focus the wavelengths.

The primary effect of infrasound on humans “appears to be annoyance,” the report concluded.

Ultrasound is the more likely possibility. At frequencies higher than 20,000 hertz, beyond human hearing, ultrasound can damage tissue if produced with enough power.

Doctors use focused blasts of ultrasound to smash kidney stones. Decades ago, researchers created intensely powerful ultrasound beams in laboratories that can kill a mouse at close range.

Less powerful ultrasound beams don’t cause injuries and have a variety of medical uses, including commonplace medical scans. But there’s anecdotal evidence at certain intensities, they can make people very uncomfortable.

Steven L. Garrett, who taught acoustics at Penn State University before retiring last year, used to demonstrate ultrasound beams to his students. Often he would get nauseous and develop a headache; eventually he took to wearing protective gear.

“We didn’t use them any more unless we not only had earplugs in our ears, but earmuffs over the earplugs,” he said.

Unfortunately, anecdotes like this make up most of what scientists know about the health effects of ultrasound. “The data is very slim,” said Timothy Leighton, a professor of ultrasonics and underwater acoustics at Southampton University.

It’s difficult to get people who report symptoms to volunteer for the studies, he said. And while the military, too, has investigated weapons based on sound beyond the audible spectrum, they dropped major research projects in the 1990s.

Even if another player has succeeded in developing an ultrasonic weapon, researchers said, the laws of physics make it unlikely that the device could harm diplomats from afar.

“Ultrasound cannot travel a long distance,” said Jun Qin, an acoustic engineer at Southern Illinois University. The further the sound goes, the weaker it gets. And, noted Dr. Garrett, humidity in a place like Havana would weaken it still more.

Moreover, a beam of ultrasound will mostly bounce off the exterior of a building. What little sound got through would be of a lower, less harmful frequency.

One way to overcome these hurdles would be to use a bigger weapon. But a massive vehicle topped with a giant sound cannon in front of diplomatic houses would probably not go unnoticed.

“If you’re talking about a ray-gun rifle knocking out someone with ultrasound they can’t hear at a hundred meters — that’s not going to happen,” said Dr. Leighton.

An ultrasound-emitting device planted inside a building, on the other hand, might be close and powerful enough to cause harm to occupants. But even an interior wall would block its waves.

A smaller emitter placed even more closely, perhaps in someone’s pillow, might do the trick, said Dr. Qin. But it’s hard to believe such a device could escape attention. In theory, a building could be packed with small emitters; however, experts called it unlikely.

And while ultrasound can cause many of the symptoms reported, there’s no evidence that it can cause mild brain injury.

“I know of no acoustic effect that can cause concussion symptoms,” Dr. Altmann said. “Sound going through the air cannot shake your head.”

For all of these reasons, experts said, ultrasound weapons should not top the list of possible explanations for the hearing loss and headaches and other symptoms said to have been observed in diplomats.

“I believe those people got something that hurt them,” said Dr. Qin. “But it could be something in the environment.” The possibilities include toxins, or bacterial or viral infections, that can damage hearing.

Dr. Leighton said contagious anxiety or another psychogenic contributor couldn’t be ruled out. “If you make people anxious that they’re under attack from an ultrasonic weapon, those are the symptoms you’ll get,” he said.

Sorting through all those possibilities will be difficult now.

If a mysterious high-tech ultrasound weapon were used, it ought to have been easy to get the evidence while the attack was underway, Dr. Garrett said. Cellphone microphones are often sensitive to ultrasonic sound, he noted, and commonly available iPhone apps could have revealed it.

They are also meant to appeal to millennial recruits, many of whom are more comfortable working in a Starbucks than in a traditional office.

That doesn’t mean a return to the glory days of private offices, but it does mean workers have more space and more places to seek solitude than in the neo-Dickensian workbench settings. The new designs often include “isolation rooms,” soundproof phone booths, and even lounges where technology is forbidden.

And it’s meant to be tweaked as needs change. “This continues to be iterated,” said Frank Cuevas, who is working on a major redesign at IBM — and whose use of the word “iterated” hints at the kind of start-up mentality the changes are intended to evoke.

“It’s not something we’re going stop and say, ‘This is it,’” he said.

The corporations setting the new standard are not young Silicon Valley companies known for free food, slides and foosball tables at work — or for carefree spending, as at Apple, whose new corporate mothership cost a reported $5 billion. Nor are the designs one-of-a-kind projects that veer toward eccentricity. Salesforce’s new skyscraper campus in San Francisco, for example, has areas on every floor for meditation, partly inspired by the teachings of Thich Nhat Hanh, a Buddhist monk.

Instead, the companies behind the emerging new norm in workplace design are a lineup of more staid companies across a range of industries, and they may spend heavily but also systematically. They include Microsoft, IBM and General Electric. Certain workspace innovations may surface first at Google or Facebook, but the older stalwarts are combining and refining them for mainstream businesses.

“These workplace ideas are beginning to be adopted across all industries,” said Arlyn Vogelmann, a principal at Gensler, an architecture and design firm whose clients include Facebook and G.E.

The new designs are not about looks. They are an attempt to adapt to the spread of internet-era digital technology — and its hurry-up ways — into every industry. Space drives behavior, experts say, and the goal of the new designs is to hasten the pace of sharing ideas, making decisions and creating new products. They are also meant to appeal to millennial recruits, many of whom are more comfortable working in a Starbucks than in a traditional office.

The new model eschews the common dogmas of work life: Everybody gets an office, or everyone gets a cubicle, or everybody gets a seat on a workbench. A diversity of spaces, experts say, is more productive, and the new concept is called “activity-based workplace design,” tailoring spaces for the kind of work done.

“Office geography matters, and it can be a key managerial lever to increase communication and the cross-fertilization of ideas,” said Christopher Liu, an assistant professor at the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto.

One of the most aggressive makeovers is happening at Microsoft, a change forced by business necessity. The company faces a new wave of technology, as the market has shifted to software delivered and constantly updated as a service over the internet cloud, as opposed to being loaded onto individual computers, with the code often stored on compact discs and sold as a product every few years. To compete, Microsoft has had to adopt a faster pace.

“You have to collaborate more,” said Michael Ford, Microsoft’s general manager of global real estate. “We absolutely have to change.”

For decades, the company, based outside Seattle, housed its software engineers in secluded offices, thinking that the privacy helped employees focus while writing computer code. But in 2010, Microsoft started testing open designs with a quarter of a floor, and then expanded. Since 2014, it has opened 10 renovated buildings without offices, including four this year.

Microsoft, Mr. Ford said, has taken a test-and-learn approach. It learned, for example, that its early designs were too open plan, with 16 to 24 engineers in team-based spaces. Engineers found those spaces noisy and distracting, and concentration suffered. Too much openness can cause workers to “do a turtle,” researchers say, and retrench and communicate less — colleagues who retreat into their headphones all day, for example

Today, there are more private spaces, and the team areas hold only eight to 12 engineers. “That’s the sweet spot for Microsoft,” Mr. Ford said.

The company thinks it is working. Microsoft’s Azure cloud software business has surged in the last few years, as has the company’s stock price. Mr. Ford said about 20 percent of the workplaces have been redone on Microsoft’s campus in Redmond, Wash., and the surrounding area. Within five years, he said, he expects the renovated share to reach 80 percent.

Offices, he said, will not disappear entirely, but they will be reserved mainly for people who regularly have confidential conversations, like lawyers and top executives.",Don’t Get Too Comfortable at That Desk,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/business/the-office-gets-remade-again.html

53A: Since this puzzle was solving fairly straight, I wasn’t at sufficient goofball level to see how “become lightheaded” could mean GO BLONDE. I figured it out after a few crosses but I think this is also a total gem of a clue.

58A: The first challenge for some of us when encountering “Dress-up at a comic con” might be figuring out the ol’ comic con part. Is this term widely known at this point? New York’s goes back to 2006 and it looks like the San Diego Comic Convention started in 1971. The art of dressing as featured characters is COSPLAY, a term coined in Japan in the ’80s. I would say something about nothing new under the sun, as we’ve been playing masquerade as a species for millenniums, but these costumes are really something else. New York’s con is in less than a week, guys! Come to think of it, maybe Sam has sequestered himself in his sewing room.

23D: Like the above example, this clue, “Secondary personas in role-playing game lingo” called for some knowledge of the way the kids talk.

Then I switched to a trophy or some such award, and it took forever to realize that in this case track was a racetrack, and we were talking about horse races, which get run as STAKES. This seems to be a grande olde worde from when betting folks in the Middle Ages stuck their wager, maybe a fat chicken or cute child, onto a stick and tried their luck.

Constructor Notes

From Crack Teammate #1, M.L.G.:

My seed entry for this themeless was the RIJKSMUSEUM, a place I hope to see in person someday. It was inspired by my visit to a special exhibit at the Dayton Art Institute, Rembrandt and the Golden Age of Dutch Art: Treasures from the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam. My first themeless grid with this seed entry was submitted in July of 2016. I received a rejection in August noting that Will really liked some of the grid fill including this seed entry, but there was too much crosswordese. I asked Jeff for his assistance in reworking the grid. He pointed out I had too many three letter entries. He noted it was best not to go above 12 for a themeless grid. After numerous back and forths using a grid of Jeff’s design we submitted a revised grid a few weeks later. We received an email in November accepting the revised grid. Jeff worked the NYT debut words COSPLAY, MAMA BIRD, BEER BRAT and GO BLONDE into the grid and my contribution in addition to RIJKSMUSEUM, was OBAMA ERA. I was surprised to see the clue we had for TOMY, “Big name in toys headquartered in Japan”, was replaced by the partial TO MY. I did like the edited change of clues for EARS and DJS to “Reception figures” as well as the clue change for HARRY from a name to “Badger”. I hope you’ve enjoyed your Saturday solving experience.

And, from Crack Teammate #2, J.C.:

I like trying multiple dozens of versions of every region within a themeless. Luckily, ML graciously puts up with my OCD about exploring the entire solution space. We saved so many versions that I didn’t remember which one we finally submitted. Thankfully, ML has a good eye for what’s the best trade-off between strong entries and gluey short ones. Looking back on it, I would have tried to open up the NW and SE corners, which feel more disconnected from the rest of the puzzle than I like. It did let us easily try many dozens of versions in each area, but with so few entries connecting everything up, hopefully solvers don’t get stumped on LAKSHMI or RIJKSMUSEUM.

Almost everything that could have gone wrong did. Two American helicopters were disabled by severe dust storms over Iran. Separately, a third one broke down. Still another crashed into a tanker aircraft; eight servicemen were killed. It was a disaster that left America humiliated — and left the hostages stuck for nine more months.

But failure can be a powerful teacher. Eagle Claw was. What emerged within a few years was a well-trained, disciplined force of special operators groomed for counterterrorism, hostage rescue and other demanding missions. The force today is perhaps 10 times as big as it was in 1980, when its numbers, Mr. Ishimoto said, were between 6,000 and 8,000. As for successes, one need look no further than the 2011 SEALs raid on a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where the Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was found and killed.

With Americans weary of war without end since Sept. 11, 2001, President Obama withdrew most conventional soldiers from Iraq and Afghanistan. At the same time, he turned the Joint Special Operations Command into a dray horse. Its members are just about everywhere: Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, Syria, Somalia, Pakistan, you name it. Their impact can be deadly. But their footprint is lighter, and less costly, than that of a fully decked-out Army operation.

This commando force plainly appeals to Mr. Trump, who has shown scant faith in “soft power,” the use of diplomacy and humanitarian example to win friends and influence nations. His budget proposals have included many billions more for the Defense Department and billions less for the State Department and the Agency for International Development. In his first half-year in office, military special operators were sent on about five times as many lethal missions in what for the United States are non-battlefield countries — Yemen, Pakistan and Somalia — as there had been during Mr. Obama’s final six months.

Relying on them so heavily has a price. Though they make up roughly 5 percent of the total armed forces, they have accounted for at least half of the nation’s combat deaths since 2015. The risks were evident mere days into the Trump presidency when a member of the SEALs was killed on a flawed night mission in Yemen that also left more than a dozen civilians dead.

It’s easy to romanticize commandos. Just ask any Hollywood director. But they are not supermen. Even Israeli forces have lost their post-Entebbe glow, with blemished missions in Lebanon and Gaza that led to their own men and innocent civilians being killed.

Belarus produces top-level technical talent, an inheritance from its Soviet past, said Arkady M. Dobkin, who immigrated to the United States in the 1990s and established a software company there.

Today, Mr. Dobkin is the chief executive of EPAM, which does programing for the world’s leading tech companies and is considered one of the fastest-growing public tech companies in the world.

EPAM’s headquarters is in Newtown, Pa., but its main development hub is in Minsk, where more than 6,000 of its technology specialists work.

“I think it was the absence of oil that made Belarus do this,” said Mr. Dobkin, 57. “Here, universities produce more highly qualified specialists than the internal market needs.”

Many locals say the government’s talk about growing as a tech hub is a comfortable distraction in a country that heavily depends on Russia for cut-rate fuel and political patronage.

People with ties to a region may want to give locally. Animal lovers may want to give to a shelter. Others may want their money directed to certain groups of people, like children, or causes, like public health.

Many opt to leave the decision to the charities themselves, which is sometimes best: “If you’re trusting them with your money, you should trust them to spend it well,” Mr. Harold said.

Decide how to spend your time

Your time is a resource, too, and you should decide how you want to spend it.

Some people prefer to deeply research the charities they support, while others simply want to know they’re giving to a trustworthy group.

For those who prefer the latter, Mr. Harold recommends groups like Global Giving, which collects donations and redistributes the funds to vetted, locally focused organizations.

Do your research before you give

Evaluating a charity is often the most daunting part of donating, but it doesn’t have to be.

In addition to GuideStar and Charity Navigator, the Better Business Bureau’s Wise Giving Alliance and Charity Watch offer helpful resources.

Tax filings and other documents can shed light on a group’s operations, but donors should look beyond the numbers, too, experts said. That includes reviewing an organization’s website, annual report, governing board and mission.

“If the organization is only talking about the problem, but not talking about how the work they do leads to solutions to that problem, that is a red flag,” Mr. Harold said.

Ask questions about the charity, including how much experience it has in disaster relief, how long it’s been around, how it measures accomplishments, and how others in the field talk about it.

He also said that too much focus is often placed on overhead, a measure of administrative and fund-raising costs. While it can signal inefficient spending or, worse, fraud, some overhead is necessary to support a nonprofit’s long-term viability.

Cash is often the best way to help

It may feel impersonal, but money is often the most useful form of donation. Unlike goods, financial gifts have no associated transportation costs.

A $20 pair of jeans, for example, would cost about $165 to ship from Washington, D.C., to the capital of Honduras, according to an online calculator developed by the University of Rhode Island. That money could instead be used locally to buy 24 blankets, nearly 33,000 liters of water or a variety of other supplies, according to the calculator.

There are secondary benefits, too: With cash, relief organizations can support local economies, according to the Center for International Disaster Information, which was created by the United States Agency for International Development.

Follow up later. Recovery takes a long time.

Donations surge in the immediate aftermath of disasters, but recoveries unfold over a much longer timeline.

For that reason, donors should consider sustained involvement with charities, whether that involves checking up on how resources were spent and how needs have changed weeks or months down the line or making automatic monthly contributions.

This battle that Trump insists on maintaining also serves a wider goal for him: distraction. As long as we focus on the latest outrage he publishes on Twitter attacking one person or another, the less time we have to focus on the fact that his presidency thus far is a colossal legislative failure, his cabinet is an unending game of cloak and daggers meets musical chairs, his Justice Department is systematically and unrelentingly expressing its hostilities to equal rights, and Trump’s reckless, emotionally triggered language and actions are making us less safe by denigrating diplomacy and advocating military aggression.

This says nothing of the work that Special Counsel Robert Mueller is doing, although I try to keep that to the side while still keeping an eye on it. No one outside of Mueller’s team truly knows the extent of his investigation or the extent of what has been discovered. In other words, we don’t know what we don’t know.

Just this week, Trump signaled his plan to decertify the landmark nuclear deal with Iran that was negotiated under the Obama administration, while at the same time he ominously mused at a photo op with military commanders: “You guys know what this represents? Maybe it’s the calm before the storm.” When asked what he meant by storm, Trump refused to clarify. But, on Saturday afternoon in consecutive tweets, Trump wrote:

“Presidents and their administrations have been talking to North Korea for 25 years, agreements made and massive amounts of money paid...... ...hasn’t worked, agreements violated before the ink was dry, makings fools of U.S. negotiators. Sorry, but only one thing will work!”

It is completely possible that this is all just big talk from a small man, but that small man holds the presidency. Now, put yourself in the shoes of the North Koreans: By backing away from the Iran deal, Trump has signaled that the word of the U.S. is not to be trusted, because it is amendable by each successive administration. At the same time, Trump is minimizing diplomacy while maximizing bluster. There is no incentive for them to pull back at all, which means that Trump is making a bad situation worse.

Trump continues his mission to undermine Obamacare, since he and his legislative majority failed to repeal and replace it. He has already drastically reduced ad spending to encourage people to enroll, but now he’s attacking actual benefits. Last week the administration unveiled a new rule to curtail women’s access to “a full range of birth control at no cost,” as CNN reported. The report continued:

“The rules, which take effect immediately, would grant exemptions to employers whose religious or moral beliefs conflict with providing contraceptive coverage. This could allow many organizations and companies to stop providing some or all of the 18 contraceptive methods that are now required, including birth control pills, IUDs, emergency contraception and sterilization, policy experts say.”

Also last week, as The New York Times reported: “Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Thursday ordered the Justice Department to take the position in court cases that transgender people are not protected by a civil rights law that bans workplace discrimination based on sex. The move was the Trump administration’s latest contraction of the Obama-era approach to civil rights enforcement.”

Trump’s attacks on the media are mere sideshow; the main events are his attacks on civil rights and his itching for a military attack on North Korea.",Attacking Media as Distraction,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/09/opinion/trump-attacks-twitter-media.html

J.J. Watt is injured in Texans’ loss.

J.J. Watt, a three-time defensive player of the year, suffered a tibial plateau fracture in the first quarter of the Houston Texans’ 42-34 loss to the undefeated Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday. The injury, which affects the knee’s stability, will likely sideline Watt for the rest of the season.

Watt appeared to be in tears as he was helped along the Houston Texans’ sideline after he collapsed on the field. On the play, Watt was charging at the quarterback and appeared to land awkwardly on his left foot before falling to his right knee. He was helped off the field, walking gingerly, with the crowd seemingly stunned by an injury to their team’s star.

Houston’s defense, weakened by injuries to Watt and Whitney Mercilus, allowed a touchdown or field goal on each of Kansas City’s first five possessions, falling behind 23-7 at halftime. Deshaun Watson, the Texans’ exciting rookie quarterback, did his best to get his team back into the game, throwing five touchdown passes, but the Chiefs’ offense was able to grind things out by keeping Houston’s offense off the field for huge swaths of time.

On Monday morning, Watt sent a message to Texans fans:

The win came with serious injuries for Kansas City as well. Tight end Travis Kelce left with an apparent concussion and Chris Conley came out late in the game with an Achilles injury. But even with his offensive options limited, Alex Smith continued his unusual breakout season — which is coming in his 13th year. He completed 29 of 37 passes for 324 yards and three touchdowns. It was Smith’s second 300-yard passing game of the season, which is a career high.

Kansas City will try to stretch their record to 6-0 next week when they host the Pittsburgh Steelers, while the Texans prepare to host the Cleveland Browns as they await further word on Watt’s status.

Rodgers rips the Cowboys’ hearts out again.

You can’t give Aaron Rodgers more than a minute.

The Dallas Cowboys took a 3-point lead over the Green Bay Packers with a little more than a minute to play after a back-and-forth N.F.C. battle. That was plenty of time for Rodgers, who showed little interest in tying the game with a field goal, and instead engineered a lightning-fast 75-yard drive, winning the game with a 12-yard touchdown pass to Davante Adams.

In an on-field interview after the game, Adams seemed nonchalant about the latest heroic performance from his team’s quarterback, shrugging and saying “He just reminded us all we need is time and downs.”

Rodgers had three touchdown passes, got some unexpected help from his team’s running game, and had his defense chip in a pick-six to improve Green Bay’s record to 4-1.

Asked after the game about his ability to succeed at AT&T Stadium in Dallas, Rodgers, who was named the M.V.P. of Super Bowl XLV in the stadium, smiled and said, “They should have the Super Bowl here every year.”

It was a quiet day in terms of yardage for Rodgers, who completed 19 of 29 passes for 221 yards, but he hit the passes he needed to and did not need to do all of the heavy lifting thanks to the emergence of Aaron Jones. In relief of the injured Ty Montgomery, Jones ran for 125 yards on 19 carries. His 7-yard touchdown near the end of the first half was the start of the Packers’ eventual comeback.

Packers Coach Mike McCarthy was full of praise for Rodgers after the game.”I just don’t know what else to say about him,” McCarthy said. “I’ve got to expand my vocabulary.”

That the Packers were in the game at all was surprising after Dak Prescott threw touchdown passes on each of his team’s first three drives. But for a second consecutive week, the Dallas offense stalled for much of the second half.

Prescott threw three touchdowns and ran for another, but he was part of the problem thanks to a deflected pass that turned into a pick-six for Damarious Randall, who to that point had been a major liability in a game in which the Green Bay secondary lost Kevin King, one of its top performers, to a concussion.

Odell Beckham Jr. could be out for season with broken ankle.

The Giants dropped to 0-5 after losing 27-25 to the Los Angeles Chargers, but the bigger story of the game was Odell Beckham Jr., the team’s superstar wide receiver, fracturing his ankle in what could be a season-ending injury.

The Giants were up 22-20 with four minutes left in the game when Beckham was brought down by Casey Hayward following an incomplete pass. Beckham’s left ankle turned badly under him, and he was on the ground for several minutes before being carted off the field. ESPN and other media outlets have reported that Beckham has a fractured fibula, and possible ligament damage, but the team thus far has not gone beyond the “fractured ankle” description.

“You never want to see any receivers go down,” Manning said in a post-game news conference. “I told him I’d be thinking about him.”

In a matchup between winless teams, the Giants’ receiving corps was decimated by injuries. Not only did Beckham leave in what could be a season-ending injury, but Dwayne Harris was forced out with a foot injury and Brandon Marshall left after coming down awkwardly on his heel in what could potentially be a season-ending Achilles tear. Sterling Shepard left the game with an ankle injury, meaning the team’s top four receivers are all currently injured.

Beckham had five catches for 97 yards and a touchdown before the injury, but on the next play following his exit, Eli Manning lost a fumble and the Chargers were able to capitalize on the short field with Philip Rivers hitting Melvin Gordon for his third touchdown pass of the game. The Giants got one more chance to win, but Manning threw an interception, which sealed the team’s fate.

After 49ers take a knee, Pence walks out of game.

Vice President Pence began the day by tweeting a photo of himself at the game between the Indianapolis Colts and the San Francisco 49ers. Less than two hours later, Pence left the game because of a protest during the playing of the national anthem. President Trump later supported Pence’s decision, saying he had asked his vice president to leave if there were any protests.

Mr. Pence’s first tweet was a photo of himself and his wife, with the vice president wearing a Colts hat and shirt, while his wife was wearing a Colts jersey. He said he was there to honor Peyton Manning, the longtime Colts quarterback who had a statue of himself unveiled in Indianapolis this weekend and was set to have his number retired into the team’s ring of honor at halftime.

But just as they did last week, the 49ers had 20 or more players kneeling during the anthem in solidarity with their former teammate, Colin Kaepernick. The Colts had a demonstration of their own, with players wearing black t-shirts that said “We Will” on the front and “Stand for equality, justice, unity, respect, dialogue, opportunity” on the back.

At 1:08 p.m. Eastern, just minutes after the anthem was played, Mr. Pence tweeted that he had left the game because of the demonstrations. He said he was unwilling to “dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem”.

After several tweets explaining his reason for leaving, Mr. Pence tweeted a photo of himself and his wife standing during the anthem, with a member of the military next to them.

Cam Newton shakes off the distractions to win.

The question coming into the game was whether off-field distractions would affect Cam Newton, but the quarterback of the Carolina Panthers was at his best, leading his team to a 27-24 victory over the Detroit Lions.

Newton, who lost a sponsorship this week over sexist remarks made to a female reporter, survived his team committing numerous sloppy penalties early in the game. He completed 26 of 33 passes for 355 yards and three touchdowns. It was the second consecutive game in which he had 300 passing yards and three touchdowns, and this week it was a result of his repeatedly taking advantage of Detroit’s inability to handle Ed Dickson. Asked to fill in for the injured Greg Olsen, Dickson, a tight end, caught five passes for 175 yards, repeatedly extending drives that appeared on the verge of stalling out.

Jaguars pick apart Roethlisberger and the Steelers.

The Jacksonville Jaguars are a team of many flaws, but when it comes to pass defense they are among the best in the game. The Pittsburgh Steelers found that out the hard way, losing at home to Jacksonville, 30-9.

Ben Roethlisberger, who publicly quarreled with his receiver Antonio Brown this week, had one of the worst games of his career, throwing a career-high five interceptions while completing 33 of 55 passes for 312 yards.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Two of Roethlisberger’s interceptions were returned for touchdowns, and Jacksonville’s other touchdowns came as a result of short fields following Roethlisberger interceptions, meaning the Pittsburgh turnovers led to 27 of the Jaguars’ 30 points.

The game showed off the best aspects of Jacksonville’s defense, as the team moved to 3-2. Jalen Ramsey broke up several big plays to go along with his interception, Tashaun Gipson intercepted two passes in the second half, while Barry Church returned his pick for a touchdown. The team also got a pick-six from Telvin Smith, a starting linebacker.

The Jaguars defense was not all interceptions, however, as they tightened things up considerably when Pittsburgh got the ball into the red zone, with the Steelers not scoring on any of their three drives that got inside the 20-yard line.

The lack of offense by the Steelers was exacerbated by a great game from Leonard Fournette, the rookie running back who had 181 rushing yards and two touchdowns, including a 90-yard score in the fourth quarter. He has now scored touchdowns in four of his first five career games.

Despite recent tension between them, Brown defended his team’s quarterback following the disastrous performance, saying the Steelers do not point the finger, but point the thumb at themselves when they fail.“He’s our general,” Brown said of Roethlisberger. “We rally around him, the good and the bad. We know there’s going to be more good.”

Thanks to Roethlisberger’s interceptions, no offense was necessary.

Here’s what teams did during the national anthem on Sunday.

San Francisco 49ers: More than 20 Niners knelt during the anthem, with several of their teammates standing behind them. Vice President Pence walked out of the game shortly after the anthem, stating on Twitter that he would “not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem.”

Indianapolis Colts: The Colts wore black t-shirts with the words “We Will” on the front and “Stand for equality, justice, unity, respect, dialogue, opportunity” on the back for the second straight week. During the anthem, the players stood with their arms locked.

Tennessee Titans: Receiver Rishard Matthews stayed in the locker room during the national anthem for the second straight week. The rest of the Titans stood during the song.

Miami Dolphins: Dolphins receiver Kenny Stills, safety Michael Thomas and tight end Julius Thomas stayed in the locker room during the anthem before their game against the Titans. All three players knelt before last Sunday’s game against the Saints in London

Philadelphia Eagles: Malcolm Jenkins, with teammate Chris Long’s arm around his shoulder, raised his first above his head during the anthem before the game against the Cardinals. Rodney McLeod joined him by raising a fist.

N.Y. Giants: Injured defensive end Olivier Vernon knelt during the anthem before the game against the Chargers, as he has done in previous weeks. Linebacker Keenan Robinson raised his fist in the air, while the rest of the Giants locked arms.

Around the N.F.L.: Jets win again; Browns still winless.

Josh McCown came back to Cleveland and beat the team that cut him, throwing two touchdown passes and leading the surprising New York Jets to a 17-14 win over the winless Browns, who benched rookie quarterback DeShone Kizer and fell to 1-20 under coach Hue Jackson.

McCown threw a 2-yard TD pass to Austin Seferian-Jenkins in the third quarter and a 24-yarder to Jermaine Kearse in the fourth to give the Jets (3-2) a 17-7 lead en route to their third straight victory.

■ The Indianapolis Colts scrapped the Peyton Manning playbook Sunday. Instead, they relied on ball control and patience.

So it’s not surprising that we humans are unable to make something like time or the marking of time bend to our collective wills. For centuries, different countries used different calendars, and even the old Julian calendar had its problems.

That is why, in 1582, Pope Gregory XIII ordered that everyone stop messing around and use one calendar. Even then, the later a country switched over, the more days had to be dropped in order to stay in sync with the vernal equinox and the winter solstice. This resulted in a lot of confusion for a while, including the month of September 1752 in North America, which looked like this and which children across the continent still whisper about as “The Best Start to the School Year Ever.”

But here’s the challenge that rule-following Australia now finds itself confronting: What’s to be done with those who have a different experience, say in countries where rules are more negotiable, or those who simply want a less rigid society and more, well, encouragement of difference?

Our ethical conundrum was relatively minor (kangaroos have survived far worse than white bread), but there are bigger issues afoot that are testing Australia’s sense of when to hold the line and when to live and let live.

With same-sex marriage, for example, Australians are deciding whether the old rules of relationships should still be enforced, or loosened. The debate isn’t just about competing arguments of freedom or fairness, or about what the word marriage should really mean; it’s also about whether or not to change how Australians interact with each other.

That question affects immigration too. The elevation of rules restricting access drives the refugee policy that led to the detention centers on Manus and Nauru. It’s also what lets the country’s leaders pat each other on the back for Australia’s “multicultural society” even as they work to add additional rules that make it harder to obtain citizenship, and insist that immigrants exhibit “Australian values,” which mean just about anything that the establishment deems important.

Indeed, I’m often struck by the gap between white Australians who insist everyone is welcomed in Australia — no hyphenated identities here! — and the experience of immigrants or the children of immigrants who tell me the many ways they are treated as “other” and made to feel that their differences are unwelcome.

This is hardly unique to Australia; immigrants and expanding ideas of sexuality and gender are challenging societal norms all over the world. And yet what’s so interesting about the current moment in Australia are the ways that these forces — those defending the status quo, and challenging it — are colliding.

The postal plebiscite for gay marriage has already been answered by nearly 60 percent of eligible Australians, far surpassing expectations. The debate over Australia’s refugee policies regularly brings out both supporters and critics, while outside the gaze of the Australian establishment, immigrant communities in places like Fairfield, one of Sydney’s most diverse western suburbs, are creating their own versions of “Australian values” every day.

Where, I often wonder, will Australia be in five or 10 years on its adherence to rules, and on these issues of sexuality and gender, and race and immigration?

With trust in government and media sharply declining in the country, will Australia become a messier or a more rigid democracy, with more bending of the rules or more conflict? Or will new compromises emerge?

At our cottages, my daughter found her own middle ground. When offered a slice of bread to feed the kangaroos, she declined, but without comment. She did not defend the rules to those who may not have seen the signs (they had walked in from another area), nor did she violate the rules herself.

Maybe, just maybe, there’s something to be learned in that?

I don’t dye my hair. It’s so fabulous. I had brown hair for so long. I was always getting my roots done. Sometimes I did it myself because I couldn’t afford to go to a hair salon. When I turned 60, I decided to see what color I am underneath. I started dyeing my hair a very light blond and then I let it grow out. I cut it very short.

When did you first start modeling?

At 15. I was a science nerd. I have two science degrees. I enjoyed the sciences, nutrition, so I always modeled part time, thinking it would end. And it hasn’t, of course. “Just getting started” is my hashtag. I had three kids in three years, so that slowed me down somewhat. I was 28 and the oldest model in the city.

What advice would you give to young models today?

Be nice to everybody. Keep your brain active. Read a lot.

Did you ever involve your kids in your modeling work?

When I didn’t have a nanny, the shows weren’t long, so they would have their books and sit in the front row. I tried to get them to model, but they found it boring. They didn’t have iPads back then. When you’re on set you stand a lot and you wait, wait, wait. Tosca was doing runway with me and she was about 11, and they did her hair in a style she hated and she refused to step on the runway. And I said, “That’s the end of your modeling career.” And that was fine with me, too.

What do you love about makeup?

For me, it makes a huge difference because my face is pretty plain, and I’m very fair with very few eyebrows and very short eyelashes. Makeup transforms me. I feel like I’m in disguise when I walk my dog without makeup on.

I was 12 or 13 when I started experimenting. At 15, I was modeling. I had to do my own hair and makeup. I also made my own clothes because I grew up in South Africa, where fashion was six months behind because of the seasons.

We wore a lot of makeup. It took us an hour to get ready. The eyelashes on top, the black eyeliner in the crease of the eye that you can see in photos from the ‘60s, the beehive hairstyle.

The modeling industry has a lot of issues with eating disorders and underweight workers. What’s your perspective on that as someone who studies nutrition?

There are models who are naturally skinny, but the thing is that many of them are emaciated. You can tell because they have hirsutism. There’ll be some hair on their face. It’s to protect their body and keep it warm because they’re too skinny. They also don’t have good energy. I’m surprised how many of them can do so many shows.

The schools chancellor, Carmen Fariña, said Monday that, in response to last week’s fatal stabbing at a school in the Bronx, the Education Department would focus its training for teachers on how to defuse behavior crises and make sure that bullying was reported.

Last Wednesday, Abel Cedeno, an 18-year-old student at the Urban Assembly School for Wildlife Conservation, brought a switchblade to school and stabbed two classmates, killing one, Matthew McCree, 15, and leaving another, Ariane Laboy, 16, seriously wounded. The police have said that Mr. Cedeno told them that he had been bullied since the start of school, though not by Mr. McCree and Mr. Laboy, who were said to be throwing pencil bits and balled up paper at him during class. Parents have said that the school’s administration failed to address complaints about bullying.

On Monday, in a conversation about school safety with invited parent leaders from throughout the city, Mayor Bill de Blasio and Ms. Fariña emphasized that crime in schools was at its lowest level on record and said they were making investments in mental health programs in schools and in so-called restorative justice, which replaces punitive approaches to behavioral problems with discussion and mediation.

“Even though we’re all feeling a lot of pain right now, we know that these approaches are taking us on the right path,” Mr. de Blasio said.

Ms. Fariña said that all schools would use time on Mondays designated for teacher professional development to discuss bullying and de-escalation techniques for at least three weeks. A spokeswoman for the Education Department, Toya Holness, said the department would share more information with schools this week and that the training would start this month.

In response to a parent who asked if the department would consider hiring more school psychologists, Ms. Fariña said that she would instruct superintendents to examine whether the schools they oversee needed more resources or needed to share resources differently with other schools.

“Certainly we are looking at more guidance counselors,” she said.

Some parents in the room said they believed that schools were not doing enough to confront bullying or more generally to address disorder.

Judge has been all but absent at the plate in this series — he is now 0 for 10 with eight strikeouts — but he did his part with his glove when Francisco Lindor, whose grand slam launched the Indians’ comeback in Game 2, lifted a towering fly ball to right field in the sixth inning.

The vibrant ballpark grew silent as the ball carried through the unseasonably warm October air. But Judge, his back as close to the wall as the Yankees’ were on Sunday night, leapt and snatched the ball, which was about to become a two-run homer.

The crowd erupted in cheers and the game remained scoreless. Enter Bird, the 24-year-old whose two homers are the only runs the Yankees have scored in this series against Indians pitchers not named Corey Kluber.

It was the kind of hitting expected of Bird, who missed last season because of shoulder surgery, at the start of the season, when he batted third on opening day. But an ankle injury that was misdiagnosed and a subsequent operation kept him out until late August. Manager Joe Girardi said recently that he would not have bet on Bird returning.

“I bet on it,” said Bird, who started for the Yankees in a wild-card loss in 2015. “I bet on myself. I got a little taste in 2015 and I wanted nothing more than to be back.”

That determination was evident when Bird crossed home plate and delivered a forearm shiver to Todd Frazier. “I couldn’t really feel my forearm for a couple minutes,” Frazier said. Then Bird got to the dugout and gave Judge a fierce chest bump.

“I could barely hold my emotions,” Judge said. “I was about to throw him around the dugout.”

Bird added: “Plain and simple, I’m not ready to be done playing and I don’t think the rest of the team is.”

Among the most grateful that the series will see a Game 4 was Girardi, the subject of withering criticism over his decision not to have a hit-by-pitch call reviewed by the umpires in Game 2, which left the door open for the Indians’ rally. Girardi acknowledged before Game 3 that “there’s a lot of people upset” with him. That was evident when he was roundly booed when he took the field during pregame introductions.

“Not the first time,” Girardi said afterward.

Girardi, whose contract will expire after this season, also told reporters before the game that while he loved managing — and was excited about the possibilities presented by the talented young team the Yankees have built — he would speak with his family before deciding whether he would return next season.

As for whether the Yankees want him back?

“That’s Hal’s and Brian’s decision and whatever their decision is, I’ll live with it,” he said, referring to Hal Steinbrenner, the principal owner, and Brian Cashman, the general manager whose contract also expires after this season.

Girardi was set up for more second-guessing on Sunday with his decision to start Tanaka. Though Severino had an abysmal start in the wild-card victory over the Minnesota Twins last week, lasting just one-third of an inning, he had clearly been the Yankees’ best pitcher this season. Meanwhile, Tanaka, while he struck out a career-high 15 batters in his last start of the regular season, had been erratic all year. He allowed a career-high 35 home runs, the fourth-most by a starting pitcher in the majors this season.

And by holding Severino back for Game 4, where he will oppose Trevor Bauer, Girardi risked being eliminated in this series without using his best starter.

“You can say that,” Girardi acknowledged before the game. Then he countered with his own view: If the Yankees were to come back and win the series, they would need Severino at some point.

Whatever the rationale, Tanaka rewarded Girardi’s faith with a brilliant performance, using his fastball and slider to set up a devastating split-fingered fastball, which he leaned on heavily.

The one bit of trouble Tanaka endured came in the fourth when Jason Kipnis scorched a liner to right that carried over the head of Judge, who misjudged the ball and had it deflect off his glove. By the time Judge retrieved the ball and returned it to the infield, Kipnis had slid into the third with a triple.

But Tanaka steeled himself and struck out Jose Ramirez and Jay Bruce — both on splitters in the dirt — to escape.

Tanaka found himself with a runner on base in two other instances — when Carlos Santana singled in the second and walked in the fifth — but he extricated himself with double-play grounders that were turned with ease.

As good as Tanaka was, he needed to be.

Carrasco held the Yankees without a hit until Didi Gregorius singled with two out in the fourth and shut them out into the sixth — just like he did against the Yankees in Cleveland this August. But this time, rather than leave a tiring Carrasco in when the Yankees loaded the bases in the sixth, Indians Manager Terry Francona turned to Miller.

Miller, whom the Yankees traded to the Indians before the non-waiver trade deadline in 2016, coolly retired Starlin Castro on a pop-up to escape.

But an inning later, he challenged Bird with a high fastball, and Bird was ready for a pitch — and a moment — for which he had long been waiting.","Greg Bird Preserves Yankees’ Season, Toppling the Indians With a Lone Blast",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/08/sports/baseball/mlb-playoffs-yankees-indians-game-3.html

“The Vietnam War” made the war matter again.
Opening eyes to history is priceless, and “The Vietnam War” accomplished that like no other documentary in this field.
The success that was “The Vietnam War” can take us in one or two historical directions.
Traditional military history blended with cultural and social history.","Finally, in 1993, the historical team of Robin Prior and Trevor Wilson lashed out at the stagnation that had overtaken their field, fuming that the metanarrative served to “preserve historical writing about the Great War in its ridiculously protracted adolescence.” Aided by an emerging school of young historians, their work acted like an alarm clock, jostling the field of World War I history out of its slumber. New questions were asked: How much were civilian leaders to blame for Britain’s mistakes in the war? What was the role of colonial soldiers in the war? How did the British home front — and in particular women — respond to the war?

Like the Great War for Britain, answers to what the Vietnam War was, why it was fought and the causality of its unsatisfactory conclusion will define America’s nature and very soul in the 20th century and beyond. Was the United States a stumbling, but well intentioned, colossus beset by overmatched presidents, bumbling military leaders, divisive protesters, an invasive press and bad allies? Or was America perhaps more sinister, a grasping imperial power defeated as much by its own hubris as by a stalwart Vietnamese foe?

At stake in these historical debates over a war fought 50 years ago is America’s definition of itself. Were and are we a force for good, or might we be tarnished and tawdry?

The underlying questions on this debate have remained quite few and always the same — questions of causality and blame. Like the historians of Britain’s Great War, those of Vietnam have tended to focus on a few figures and their decision-making, to the exclusion of everyone and everything else.

How much ink has been spilled on that pair of brooding, scheming presidents, Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon? How many bookshelves can be filled with tomes on the audacious Ho Chi Minh, the slippery and shadowy Henry Kissinger, the overmatched Robert McNamara?

Topping them all, though, has to be Gen. William Westmoreland. Tall. Ramrod straight. Grim visage. He just had that look, and he, like Haig before him, is the subject of endless debate. Was he a martinet who never really understood his war and cost America a chance at victory, or was he perhaps something more complex? In either case, the “Great Westmoreland Debate” rages on, with the general often serving as the vessel of our Vietnam sins.

As the “Great Haig Debate” did once before, the Vietnam metanarrative has often served to stymie a field that needs to broaden its horizons. Take just the battlefield history: From the A Shau Valley to Leatherneck Square, from the Arizona Territory to Dak To, from Snoopy’s Nose to the Parrot’s Beak — there are major battles spanning South Vietnam still awaiting their first real historical attention.

Other topics are even less well-covered: pacification, the American advisory effort, the development of counterinsurgency techniques, the complex role of the South Vietnamese military, the military roles of South Korean and Thai troops and the related, concurrent wars in Cambodia and Laos. What about the plethora of military commanders not named Westmoreland? And what of wider questions of race, class and gender?

So much of the history of the Vietnam War is an unplowed field, while so many of the war’s historians remained fixated on the same old furrows. New questions, voices, sources, perspectives, battles, commanders, ideas — the field needs all of these, and not just to fill academic conferences. If we’re ever going to understand America in the 20th century, we need a much better understanding of what it did in Vietnam.

Mr. Burns and Ms. Novick’s “The Vietnam War” is arguably a masterpiece of its genre. It included new film footage, followed a rich and compelling narrative and added fresh voices to weave a synthetic history of the war. Audiences watched spellbound as a history that most didn’t know or have access to unfolded before their eyes. “The Vietnam War” made the war matter again. Opening eyes to history is priceless, and “The Vietnam War” accomplished that like no other documentary in this field.

What we saw, though, was a thorough and compelling re-asking of the same basic questions over half a century. That’s partly the limitation of the medium — a general-interest documentary is not going to venture too far into new fields of inquiry. But even if the filmmakers had wanted to, the fact is that historians haven’t ventured there much either.

The success that was “The Vietnam War” can take us in one or two historical directions. It could stand as the culminating moment of the metanarrative in which the Vietnam War ceases to be a current event and lapses into history. Similar to what Prior and Wilson did for Britain’s World War I, “The Vietnam War” could well serve as a launching point for new questions and new history.

This was certainly the case for Mr. Burns’s breakthrough 1990 documentary, “The Civil War.” For five consecutive nights, an estimated 40 million Americans sat glued to their televisions, mesmerized by horror and the sacrifice made by millions. They ordered copies of the Union officer Sullivan Ballou’s letter after it was read during the first episode and rehashed the previous night’s events at work and in schools the next day.

Scholars cringed at the clichés Mr. Burns’s narrative reinforced and spent years correcting many of the documentary’s simplifications. But historians also acknowledged that he ignited a unquenchable curiosity among viewers, giving us the opportunity to clarify his points as well as our own. Discussion on soldiers’ motivations, personal history and memories; questions of home fronts and guerrilla operations; questions about women and slave life and resistance were commonplace. Traditional military history blended with cultural and social history. And the central role of race and slavery in the cause and legacy of the war, if not fully clarified in the film, became a focus of discussion for years to come.

As historians, we can only hope that the surge of interest provided by “The Vietnam War” will have a similar impact, re-energizing debate and study. The timing is ripe: A generation of young historians, many of them fluent in Vietnamese, is digging into newly opened archives and developing fresh discussion, from the political history of North Vietnam to the role that the war played in American consumer culture.

But a re-energized debate is far from guaranteed. Unlike the Civil War, Vietnam is still within many currents lifetimes, and many of those people are invested in the old verities about Johnson and Westmoreland and Tet and the rest. If the success of “The Vietnam War” results in a continued reasking of the same questions, our understanding of the war and its combatants will remain maddeningly incomplete, and the history of the war will remain mired in its own ridiculously protracted adolescence.",The Ken Burns Effect,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/09/opinion/ken-burns-vietnam.html

“We are not here to clip any one president’s wings, but to create a check on any future presidents,” Mr. Tillis said.

The two bills share much in common, and both try to build on the existing Justice Department statute governing special counsels to ensure that any firing is for good cause.

Mr. Graham’s bill, introduced with Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, would require the attorney general — or a deputy — to petition a panel of federal judges for permission to remove a special counsel.

Mr. Tillis’s bill, in contrast, would allow for a judicial review process after a special counsel is fired. The attorney general would have to prove good cause for removal, and a panel of three federal judges would have 14 days to reach a decision. The bill was introduced with Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, and a bipartisan pair of representatives have introduced parallel legislation in the House.

Mr. Mueller was appointed in May, after the firing of the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, and was given broad latitude to investigate Mr. Trump and his associates. But the statute under which he was appointed affords Mr. Mueller, or other future special counsels, few formal job protections. If he wished, Mr. Trump could order top Justice Department officials to fire Mr. Mueller.

Supporters of the Judiciary Committee measures repeatedly alluded on Tuesday to comments and actions made by Mr. Trump about the investigation that they said made their work necessary. Most saliently, in a late-July interview, Mr. Trump told The New York Times that Mr. Mueller’s team was rife with conflicts of interest and warned that investigators would be crossing a red line if they began to look at Trump family finances beyond any relationship to Russia.

Separating themselves from the Republicans, committee Democrats said those comments, and Mr. Trump’s repeated hostility toward investigators, made the need for action urgent.

“Simply put, I have strenuous concern about President Trump’s respect for the rule of law,” Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the committee’s ranking Democrat, said in an opening statement. “The president must know that Congress will not stand idly by if he attempts to undermine independent criminal investigations.”

The committee’s chairman, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, did not make his leanings toward the bills known, but he made clear in his opening statement that he saw an important role for Congress to oversee special counsel investigations.

The Judiciary Committee is one of several congressional committees investigating Mr. Trump’s links to Russia. The committee’s particular interest stems from Mr. Comey’s firing, but it has outlined a broad investigation into several other matters, from the Obama Justice Department’s handling of the Hillary Clinton email case to Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign.

Tuesday’s discussion frequently returned to a 1988 Supreme Court case that weighed the constitutionality of the now-expired independent counsel statute, put in place after the Watergate scandal. In the ruling, the court voted 7 to 1 that the counsel statute did not violate the separation of powers doctrine and was therefore lawful.

But the decision came with a powerful dissent from Justice Antonin Scalia, which in the years since has gained a widespread following.

Independent counsels, such as Kenneth W. Starr, had considerably broader powers and more latitude than today’s special counsels, but the constitutional scholars and members of the committee repeatedly used the decision and the dissent to make arguments for and against the constitutionality of the proposed protection bills.

Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah, both Republicans, appeared most skeptical that the bills were constitutionally supportable.

“The overriding concern I have whenever we are talking about this area is that bad things happen when we depart from the three-branch structure of the federal government,” Mr. Lee said.

Was Israel’s special relationship with Germany, too, now in danger?

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hastened to say that it was not, announcing Tuesday that he had spoken with Chancellor Angela Merkel. He congratulated her on winning and expressed confidence that Israel and Germany would only deepen their ties.

But Mr. Netanyahu added that Israel was “concerned about the rise of anti-Semitism” on both the political right and left, and noted that “there are two different things: denying the Holocaust and denying responsibility.” He called on Ms. Merkel’s new government to “act to strengthen the forces in Germany that take on the historical responsibility.”

Among the opposition, Amir Peretz, a Knesset member from the left-of-center Zionist Union, wrote on Twitter in German that the election was “a bad day for Germany democracy, with the entry of xenophobes and open anti-Semites into the Bundestag.”

Yet like so much else dividing Israeli society today, the advances by the Alternative for Germany, or the AfD, as it is known, seems to provide more of an excuse for political recriminations and partisan bile than a source of common Jewish ground.

On the right, there was newfound scorn, and worse, for Israeli expatriates in Germany.

Aryeh Eldad, a former Knesset member and medical professor, wrote in Maariv of his revulsion at the “20,000 Israelis who moved from Israel to Germany of their own free will,” whether for “cheaper housing and cheaper cottage cheese” or to live under “the wonderful German democracy” out of a “distorted” leftism. Both groups, he said, were “emotional cripples.”

“These Israelis,” Mr. Eldad wrote, “are not like the dog that comes back to eat his own vomit, but rather like the vomit that returns to the dog that spewed it.”

On the left, there was renewed criticism for the Israeli government that so many left behind when they moved to Germany.

Michael Sappir, a 29-year-old in Tel Aviv who earned a degree in linguistics at the University of Leipzig, in Saxony, and now works in high tech, said the election “makes me think twice about the idea of moving there again, both as a Jew and a leftist.”

But, he added, “the situation in Germany is much, much better than here, where the governing coalition is composed mostly of parties that are intellectually akin to the AfD.” He said, “What’s considered the terrifying right wing there is on many policy points just mainstream here.”

Even after Sunday’s election, Mr. Sappir said, he still believes he would be safer in Germany than in Israel. “The norms of governance, the rule of law, there is much stronger,” he said. “Here I feel like an embattled minority. There I know that we’re a much bigger minority, and there’s at least a pretty broad anti-fascist consensus.”

Eldad Beck, an Israeli journalist and author of a book on German-Jewish relations, said left-wing Israelis in Germany who were surprised by Sunday’s vote were “suffering from blindness.” But he also said that he knew some Israelis in Germany who had voted for the AfD “because they consider the arrival of so many Muslims and the violence, terror and criminality a big problem that has to be stopped.”

Indeed, feelings about the subject do not fall into neat categories, even among left-leaning Israelis.

Mr. Weinberger, the marketing executive in Berlin, said he believed that, aside from anti-Merkel sentiment, what had driven Germans to the AfD was an understandable emotion: “There are strong feelings of fear,” he said. “It’s part of human nature at some point. And some of them I’m sure are really concerned about this open-door policy. It affects their lives.”

Shai Levy, 44, a Jerusalem-born filmmaker in Berlin, said he was saddened to see Israel and the Jewish people fueling the resurgent right wing “because they have a common enemy; being anti-Muslim is considered to be good for the Jews.”

He sees many Israelis newly arrived in Berlin tensing up at the sight of people in Muslim head scarves, a “reflex of phobia for Muslims,” he said, adding: “I know it because I had it. I needed to get rid of it.”

Where Germany goes from here, and how Israel and Israelis will adjust, will depend less on Ms. Merkel than on those who succeed her when she leaves the stage, said Mr. Beck, the author of “Germany, at Odds.”

“As long as Merkel is chancellor, the special relationship is O.K.,” he said. “But Israelis will have to make a special effort, otherwise things are going to fall apart.”

He said that the millions of Muslims who have arrived in Germany in recent years would inevitably influence the country’s politics.

“I’m not so sure the young generations of German politicians feel as connected to Israel and to the past,” he warned. “And I don’t see yet that Israel is really making an effort to convince them why it is doing certain things and why it’s important to do those things.”

Younger Israelis, too, can be frustrating to their elders.

To Miki Goldman, 92, a survivor of Auschwitz and other concentration camps who later helped collect evidence against Adolf Eichmann, diplomacy is one thing, but emigrating to Germany another.

“Undoubtedly Germany of today is a democracy, but it still has a kernel of something else that could become dangerous,” he said. “We can be in good relations with Germany, but why do young Israelis have to forget the fate of their fathers and go back there?”

But some Israelis in Germany insisted they were neither forgetful nor naïve.

Ruthi Grossman, 24, a student who moved to Berlin last year, said she still planned to stay there.

“I think it’s just part of the world moving toward dark times,” she said of the rightward drift. “But I do trust Germany more than I trust any other country in the world to deal with it morally, because of that history.”","Is Germany Still a Haven for Israelis?

After the rocket strikes, Afghan helicopters circled the capital’s diplomatic quarters and the airport for hours. Gen. Salem Almas, the head of criminal investigations for the Kabul police, said Afghan forces had started an operation in the area where the rockets were fired.

He did not provide details on the number of rockets, which were most likely rocket-propelled grenades, but officials at the airport said that many had landed, and that assailants had entered a house behind the airport.

The operation to clear the house lasted about six hours. Najib Danish, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry, said all of the three attackers in the house were killed.

Mr. Danish said one civilian had also been killed and 11 wounded. Two houses were damaged in the attack on the airport and during government’s response, he said.

American helicopter gunships operating in support of the Afghan special forces caused several civilian casualties when “one of the missiles malfunctioned,” the United States military command said in a statement. It was not clear precisely what the errant missile had struck.

A senior Afghan security official said the assailants had stockpiled so much heavy weaponry in the house behind the airport that a standard clearance operation was impossible and helicopters targeted the area.

One Western official said the insurgent rockets had ignited part of an American weapons depot at a military camp, causing secondary explosions. The airport remained closed to domestic and international flights for much of the day, resuming flights on Wednesday night.

Some officials said Afghan and American aircraft parked at the airport may have been hit. Jalaluddin Ibrahimkhel, a spokesman for the Afghan Air Force, denied this. “The rockets landed in the military and civil parts of the Kabul airport, but it did not damage the runway or any aircraft,” he said.

Capt. Bill Salvin of the United States Navy, a spokesman for the military, also denied reports of aircraft damage and said “nothing in the schedule of the visit changed because of the attack.”

At the time the rockets struck, Mr. Mattis was meeting with Mr. Ghani and Mr. Stoltenberg. Mr. Mattis, who arrived from India, emphasized that President Trump’s new strategy for Afghanistan was an “inclusive” effort to bring stability to South Asia.

The strategy has caused a particularly harsh reaction in Pakistan, which Afghan and American officials contend has long been a safe haven for the Taliban leadership. Mr. Mattis said that the Trump administration would work with Pakistan, but that it would also “watch Pakistan’s choices.”

Mr. Mattis did not provide details on how many more American troops would be arriving in Afghanistan, saying he did not want to share details that could help the enemy. But the lack of transparency has raised concerns, particularly since it was revealed that the United States already had thousands more troops in Afghanistan than officials had declared.

Mr. Ghani emphasized that American and NATO troops stationed in the country would not be “returning to a combat role,” but would be assisting, training, and advising the Afghan forces who are leading the fight.

“We will not abandon you to a merciless enemy trying to kills its way to power,” Mr. Mattis said, emphasizing the American position that a negotiated settlement was the only way out of the 16-year-old war.

The rival claims of responsibility for the rocket assault by both the Taliban and Islamic State pointed to the confusing landscape of the Afghan insurgency. Although the groups have fought territorial battles, American and Afghan officials have expressed concern about their convergence in certain areas.

The officials have been particularly concerned about an overlap in the enabling networks for major attacks planned by the Islamic State branch operating in Afghanistan and the Haqqani Network, an arm of the Taliban.

Making matters worse, 911 still does not work, officials said.

“What do you think? There has to have been deaths,” said Dr. Rafael Rodríguez-Mercado, Puerto Rico’s health secretary. “I can’t give you a number, but we have to be conscious and realistic. To say no would be a lie.”

So far, seven regional hub hospitals are taking in patients. The island’s dialysis patients are also getting care. But none of it is easy. Hospitals should be required to have backup generators, diesel, a stockpile of medication and satellite phones, the doctor added. Even with those precautions, problems could arise. There is enough diesel on the island, but a shortage of gas tanker drivers — some cannot get to their jobs — and working gas stations. In Lares, the mayor, Roberto Pagan, said the municipal hospital almost had to close yesterday because it ran out of diesel fuel.

“We have been putting out fires,” Dr. Rodríguez-Mercado said. “The hospitals call you and say, ‘I have two hours of diesel left.’”

The potential for a public health crisis is a big concern, he said. Rats and decomposing animals can spread disease, the doctor added. Without running water, people are probably not washing their hands or boiling water often enough, or cooking their food well enough. This could lead to gastrointestinal outbreaks.

“What worries me is the sincere possibility of epidemics,” Dr. Rodríguez-Mercado added.

High mosquito counts on the island could also lead to a resurgence of mosquito-borne diseases, like Zika, dengue and chikungunya, doctors said.

A shortage of open pharmacies is another stressor, especially for the chronically ill and elderly residents. Most pharmacies in Puerto Rico remain closed, although they are slowly beginning to reopen. A CVS spokesman said that 21 out of 25 Puerto Rico-based CVS stores are now open, including 17 pharmacies. The first one reopened last Thursday. A Walgreens spokesman said about half of the island’s 120 stores are open and running on generators, but that hours vary. The stores are also receiving supplies of medication.

But many pharmacies in Puerto Rico are independently owned. With so many people pleading for medication, some pharmacists who know their clients are dispensing drugs without the required prescriptions or refill bottles.

Hospitals still have adequate supplies, and so do many of the open pharmacies, but there are concerns they may run out because suppliers are unable to get to them, said Dr. Victor M. Ramos Otero, the president of the College of Doctors and Surgeons of Puerto Rico.

Even when people find the drugs, they often cannot pay for them. Without electricity, A.T.M.s do not work and stores cannot accept credit cards or process insurance plans. That is what happened to José Castillo when he showed up at the Express Care Pharmacy in Santurce, a San Juan neighborhood, on Tuesday, hoping for a refill on the anti-depressants that help him sleep.

Pharmacy workers were outside, tending to customers on the sidewalk. The manager, Yanissa Serrano, told Mr. Castillo the pills cost 25 cents each — cash only.

“But I don’t have the money,” he said.

Her patience worn out, Ms. Serrano erupted.

“I would have been able to give you your medicine, but three times they robbed my generator. Three! Thanks to the fine people of this neighborhood,” she shouted. “I lost my house. I lost everything. I could be home tending to my apartment, but instead I’m here providing this service to the community, and this is how they repay me.”

Before Mr. Trump’s announcement, Representative Luis Gutierrez, Democrat of Illinois, said on the House floor that, “what I fear is that the federal government is not stepping up as fully and as quickly as we must.”

“This emergency cannot just be treated by Congress, the president, FEMA and the other agencies as just another storm,” he added.

But Mr. Trump defended the response by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Tuesday.

Ms. Rigau was among three senior Catalan government officials who were recently found guilty of civil disobedience for helping coordinate the nonbinding vote on Catalan independence in 2014.","Those elections presented big tests of the bloc’s cohesion. The dispute over Catalonia instead presents a test of the cohesion of a member state itself. And it points to ominous storm clouds in other independent-minded regions, from Scotland to northern Italy.

Catalonia, which has its own language and culture, has long been an uneasy part of Spain, and aspirations for independence have surged and ebbed for generations. But Catalonia is also Spain’s economic engine, and Madrid is determined to hold onto it. The tug of war is now entering perhaps its most intense and unpredictable phase since the approach of the Spanish Civil War last century.

In 2014, the last time Catalonia held an independence vote, it, too, was declared illegal by Spain’s constitutional court. But Catalan officials described that vote as a straw ballot, and the government in Madrid and the police did not prevent it.

This time, sensing the growing seriousness of the Catalan referendum, which the regional government says will now be binding, Madrid is taking a far more aggressive tack.

The approach has left many Catalans bridling under what they say is a heavy hand by the government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy. The steps to intimidate people who back a vote not only may backfire, they argue, but also threaten to transform the conflict into a broad campaign of civil disobedience that could spiral out of control.

Tensions on the streets have mounted, along with political recriminations. While the separatists charge that Mr. Rajoy is taking Spain back to the dark days of Franco, Madrid warns that the separatists have shifted from violating Spanish law to encouraging civil strife.

In the interview, Mr. Puigdemont said the conflict would not turn violent, but he warned that Madrid would have to assume its share of the blame if things got further out of hand. “If you stop somebody from unfolding a banner that asks for more democracy, the problem is with the person who forces its withdrawal,” he said.

Even President Trump has weighed in, declaring that he supports a unified Spain after a meeting in Washington with the Prime Minister Rajoy. Mr. Trump took no position on whether the referendum should be held.

The swirl of competing pressures is perhaps nowhere greater than at the local level, among city and small-town mayors who must decide whether to host the voting.

On Monday, Joan Rabasseda, the mayor of Arenys de Munt, headed for a courthouse rather than his town hall because of his decision to ignore Spain’s government and constitutional court and help his residents vote. Mr. Rabasseda could be suspended from office if found guilty of civil disobedience — along with about 750 of the almost 950 mayors of Catalonia who have vowed to facilitate the referendum.

“Spain’s judiciary can go after me, but that’s only helping unite my town even more and increasing everybody’s determination to vote,” Mr. Rabasseda said defiantly.

Catalan officials who do not favor independence say that they, too, are facing intimidation — but from an increasingly aggressive pro-independence movement that wants them to go through with a vote declared illegal by Madrid.

With the referendum just days away, taking a side has become inescapable. In many ways, for Catalonia’s officialdom, it’s a case of be damned if you do and damned if you don’t.

“This conflict is forcing elected officials to walk into a cul-de-sac and then deal with very difficult consequences,” said Irene Rigau, a Catalan politician. “Whatever you do, you will be punished either by your citizenship or by the state.”

Separatist mayors must endorse the referendum, she said, because otherwise “nobody will vote for you again.”

“But if you stick to your promise,” she said, “the state could then never allow you to be a politician again.”

Ms. Rigau was among three senior Catalan government officials who were recently found guilty of civil disobedience for helping coordinate the nonbinding vote on Catalan independence in 2014.

This time, Spain’s judiciary is promising to punish anybody involved in organizing Sunday’s referendum. But for mayors like Mr. Rabasseda, the choice to go ahead with the ballot was simple, if potentially disastrous for him.

His was the first town in Catalonia to hold an independence straw ballot in 2009, at a time when secessionism had far less supporters than it now has. On Monday, a group of about 100 residents escorted their mayor to the courthouse in the nearby city of Mataró and sang the Catalan hymn as he entered the building.

A smaller number of mayors are complaining about suffering harassment and insults for refusing to turn their town hall buildings into polling stations. Their decision is forcing Catalonia’s separatist government to find alternative venues for a referendum whose logistics have already been seriously complicated by the Spanish police, who are seizing ballot papers and other election-related equipment.

While Mr. Rabasseda was in court, Josep Monràs, the mayor of the town of Mollet del Vallès, was filing a police complaint after a group of about 100 separatists surrounded his home last weekend and shouted insults. The protesters used a megaphone and also plastered secessionist posters on his house, Mr. Monràs said in a telephone interview.

He argued that Catalonia “isn’t viable as an independent state,” but that his opposition to the vote was in any case entirely justified by his duties as a Spanish mayor. “Every mayor takes office with a promise that includes respecting the Constitution,” he said.

Mr. Monràs, who has been mayor since 2004, said he had never before received such insults on his doorstep, including people calling him a fascist.

“There have always been people who defend different ideas using legitimate means, but there are now some who use instead coercion and insults,” he said. “It’s outrageous.”

Sunday’s referendum has widespread support in the smaller towns and villages of the Catalan hinterland like Arenys de Munt.

There, the owner of one fish distribution company had plastered a banner showing Josep Lluís Trapero, the head of the autonomous Catalan police force, who has become an icon of the region’s assertion of an independent identity since last month’s terrorist attacks in Barcelona, the region’s capital.

After a foreign journalist left a news briefing, frustrated that it was being held partly in Catalan, Mr. Trapero commented, “Well, very good, well, farewell.” His words have since been turned into a slogan by separatists who want to say the same to Spain.

But support for independence is far more limited in places like L’Hospitalet de Llobregat, the second-largest city in Catalonia, whose mayor, Núria Marín, has been leading the call for mayors not to be intimidated into hosting the referendum.

“I was elected to manage a city, not to provide ballot boxes,” she said in an interview. “Telling me that I should help people vote is a political and not a legal argument — and in this case it’s clearly not one that carries a lot of weight if made before a judge.”

Spain’s attorney general has warned Catalonia’s political leaders that they could be arrested at any time and face criminal charges for misusing public money to finance an illegal referendum.

The separatists, however, have lashed out at Madrid’s efforts to prosecute mayors and eventually, perhaps, thousands of other officials involved in their referendum. They say Mr. Rajoy is returning authoritarianism to Spain.

Mr. Rabasseda, the mayor of Arenys de Munt, said that Madrid’s clampdown has been disproportionate. He was prepared for a court battle, but acknowledged that his legal problems were worrying others, starting with his 86-year-old mother.

“She’s really upset and concerned,” he said. “For her, it’s a bit like returning to the past and the loss of all political freedom.”",Catalan Officials Are Squeezed as Madrid Tries to Stop Independence Vote,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/world/europe/catalonia-spain-referendum.html

Identify your values before donating

When considering how to give, it’s helpful to start by asking what motivates you.

“You pick the issue with your heart and you pick the organization with your head,” said Jacob Harold, the chief executive of GuideStar, a nonprofit that publishes information about charities in an effort to promote transparency.

People with ties to a region may want to give locally. Animal lovers may want to give to a shelter. Others may want their money directed to certain groups of people, like children, or causes, like public health.

Many opt to leave the decision to the charities themselves, which is sometimes best: “If you’re trusting them with your money, you should trust them to spend it well,” Mr. Harold said.

Decide how to spend your time

Your time is a resource, too, and you should decide how you want to spend it.

Some people prefer to deeply research the charities they support, while others simply want to know they’re giving to a trustworthy group.

For those who prefer the latter, Mr. Harold recommends groups like Global Giving, which collects donations and redistributes the funds to vetted, locally focused organizations.

Do your research before you give

Evaluating a charity is often the most daunting part of donating, but it doesn’t have to be.

In addition to GuideStar and Charity Navigator, the Better Business Bureau’s Wise Giving Alliance and Charity Watch offer helpful resources.

Tax filings and other documents can shed light on a group’s operations, but donors should look beyond the numbers, too, experts said. That includes reviewing an organization’s website, annual report, governing board and mission.

“If the organization is only talking about the problem, but not talking about how the work they do leads to solutions to that problem, that is a red flag,” Mr. Harold said.

Ask questions about the charity, including how much experience it has in disaster relief, how long it’s been around, how it measures accomplishments, and how others in the field talk about it.

He also said that too much focus is often placed on overhead, a measure of administrative and fund-raising costs. While it can signal inefficient spending or, worse, fraud, some overhead is necessary to support a nonprofit’s long-term viability.

Cash is often the best way to help

It may feel impersonal, but money is often the most useful form of donation. Unlike goods, financial gifts have no associated transportation costs.

A $20 pair of jeans, for example, would cost about $165 to ship from Washington, D.C., to the capital of Honduras, according to an online calculator developed by the University of Rhode Island. That money could instead be used locally to buy 24 blankets, nearly 33,000 liters of water or a variety of other supplies, according to the calculator.

There are secondary benefits, too: With cash, relief organizations can support local economies, according to the Center for International Disaster Information, which was created by the United States Agency for International Development.

Follow up later. Recovery takes a long time.

Donations surge in the immediate aftermath of disasters, but recoveries unfold over a much longer timeline.

For that reason, donors should consider sustained involvement with charities, whether that involves checking up on how resources were spent and how needs have changed weeks or months down the line or making automatic monthly contributions.

SATURDAY PUZZLE — I’m going to do something a bit different today. I’ve spilled a few clues, but I want you to get through the puzzle yourself, mostly so you will appreciate the rest of the column. I’ve been looking for an opportunity to develop my Lewis Black impression, and this is it.

Sometimes, when I’m feeling like I haven’t yet had enough pain and humiliation in my life, I take a Zumba class. No, don’t write me letters about how I’m doing it wrong and if I would just relax I’d learn to enjoy it. No one on the entire planet has ever convinced another human being to do anything that way, especially when it comes to tripping over their own two feet. I’ve accepted my fate when it comes to Zumba.

At other times, I solve puzzles by Byron Walden. It has largely the same effect as the Zumba, minus the muscle pain. Mr. Walden, who is one of the nicest people you would ever want to meet, quietly takes his aggressions out by writing the kind of clues that make many solvers, myself included, feel a lot like this dog:

That’s called misdirection. Misdirection is when you look at a clue like 20D’s “One who tries to avoid being touched” and your brain starts to run through the names of disorders where people don’t like being touched because that’s got to be what the constructor is thinking, right, and then the answer winds up being an odd word like EPEEIST. (A “touch” is when your fencing opponent scores against you.)

It’s when you see a clue like “Fabulous speaker?” and think O.K., maybe it’s AESOP, because you’ve been trained, I mean trained, to think AESOP’s fables whenever you see the word “fabulous” in a clue, but the answer turns out to be LIAR. And he’s not wrong. Someone who tells tales is a LIAR.

As Jonathan Kalb, a professor at Hunter College who has written a book on marathon performances, put it: “Most solo shows, the better ones, are 90 minutes tops. More than that, boy, you’re risking everything.”

This “Strange Interlude” won’t be the longest straight play staged in New York in recent years — that honor belongs to Elevator Repair Service’s eight-hour “Gatz.” It’s certainly not the longest solo, clocking in at only a quarter of the length of Taylor Mac’s “A 24-Decade History of Popular Music.” But it is an occasionally lurid interwar ragout of sex, death and boat races. It is also probably one of the last times anyone decided to name a dashing romantic swain Gordon. Censored in New York and banned in Boston, the play nevertheless became an unlikely Broadway hit.

O’Neill joked that if the play were a sandwich it would be “a four-decker with nothing but ham.”

Mr. Greenspan has been chewing on that for a while now. In the summer of 2013, he, Transport Group’s artistic director, Jack Cummings III, its dramaturge Krista Corcoran Williams and a couple of associates met for an artistic residency in upstate New York. They’d all enjoyed working together on “The Patsy.” Now they wanted a project “to go deeper and further with,” Ms. Williams said.

So Mr. Greenspan read “Strange Interlude” aloud, which took him seven or eight hours. And the company agreed to produce it. Mr. Greenspan has been rehearsing ever since.

The published script runs 190 pages. Mr. Greenspan worked through the acts one at a time, putting in four to five hours a day, five to six days a week even while rehearsing, performing and touring other plays. Last year, Mr. Cummings gave him a cameo in his William Inge double-bill just to keep Mr. Greenspan around and on salary while he worked. This summer, while appearing in “Minor Character” in Connecticut, he requested a rehearsal space as part of his contract. “I had to memorize Act 8,” he said.

Mostly, Mr. Greenspan works at home, in the small one-bedroom in Westbeth Artists Housing that he shares with his partner, the teacher and painter William Kennon. He moves their furniture around to replicate the set and takes breathers to feed their two cats and one German Shepherd. Sometimes he borrows Mr. Kennon’s painting studio.

On a good five-hour day, he can learn perhaps two pages. But often it’s less. “Line by line,” he said. “Sometimes you learn just a few words, sometimes a sentence. It’s very deliberate.” Ms. Williams, who has often observed him, described the process as “mind-numbing and thrilling in kind of equal measure.”

Mr. Greenspan prizes accuracy. In rehearsal he scolded himself for missing “and” in one sentence, “the” in another. But for him, memorizing means more than rote learning or brute-force drills. It means discovering in each line “what the intentions are, what the feeling is, what the state of being is, what the emotional state is,” he said.

He tries to make his characters as full and real as possible, figuring out how they move, how they think, how they sound. From there he develops a map of each act, “like making up a dance in a way,” he said, a dance he then fine-tunes with Mr. Cummings and his team.

Sitting in the rehearsal room, he cycled though some of this choreography. He stuffed his hands into his pockets for Ned, then gave his neck a sensual stroke as Ned’s lover, Nina, then knit his fingers as Nina’s forbidding father, Professor Leeds. Each character was conjured with what looked like minimal effort and eerie, easy grace. Then Mr. Greenspan stood and played the bit where Ned hands the prescription to Sam. One man moved to offer it; another snatched it away. The effect was delightful, and also unnerving.

Ms. Williams said that watching the full production can feel “like you’re either on drugs or experiencing some kind of religious reckoning.”

“There is something that happens when you’re in the room that long with one person doing something this audacious,” she continued.

For Mr. Greenspan, the effects are mellower. When he finishes a run-through he feels “good afterward,” he said, “neither tired or exhilarated.” And if there is lingering excitement “a little herbal tea will, I think, handle that.”","A Eugene O’Neill Marathon: 1 Actor, 1 Script, 5 Hours",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/theater/david-greenspan-eugene-oneill-marathon-performance.html

He also said that Mr. Corker had asked to be secretary of state. “I said ‘NO THANKS,’” he wrote.

Mr. Corker flatly disputed that account, saying Mr. Trump had urged him to run again, and promised to endorse him if he did. But the exchange laid bare a deeper rift: The senator views Mr. Trump as given to irresponsible outbursts — a political novice who has failed to make the transition from show business.

Mr. Trump poses such an acute risk, the senator said, that a coterie of senior administration officials must protect him from his own instincts. “I know for a fact that every single day at the White House, it’s a situation of trying to contain him,” Mr. Corker said in a telephone interview.

The deeply personal back-and-forth will almost certainly rupture what had been a friendship with a fellow real estate developer turned elected official, one of the few genuine relationships Mr. Trump had developed on Capitol Hill. Still, even as he leveled his stinging accusations, Mr. Corker repeatedly said on Sunday that he liked Mr. Trump, until now an occasional golf partner, and wished him “no harm.”

The White House did not respond to a request for comment on Mr. Corker’s remarks.

Mr. Trump’s feud with Mr. Corker is particularly perilous given that the president has little margin for error as he tries to pass a landmark overhaul of the tax code — his best, and perhaps last, hope of producing a major legislative achievement this year.

If Senate Democrats end up unified in opposition to the promised tax bill, Mr. Trump could lose the support of only two of the Senate’s 52 Republicans to pass it. That is the same challenging math that Mr. Trump and Senate Republican leaders faced in their failed effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.

Mr. Corker could also play a key role if Mr. Trump follows through on his threat to “decertify” the Iran nuclear deal, kicking to Congress the issue of whether to restore sanctions on Tehran and effectively scuttle the pact.

Republicans could hold off on sanctions but use the threat of them to force Iran back to the negotiating table — a strategy being advocated by Senator Tom Cotton, the Arkansas Republican. But that approach could leave the United States isolated, and it will be up to Mr. Corker to balance opposition to the deal with the wishes of those, including some of Mr. Trump’s own aides, who want to change the accord but not blow it up.

Beyond the Iran deal, Mr. Corker’s committee holds confirmation hearings on Mr. Trump’s ambassadorial appointments. If the president were to oust Rex W. Tillerson as secretary of state, as some expect, Mr. Corker would lead the hearings on Mr. Trump’s nominee for the post.

In a 25-minute conversation, Mr. Corker, speaking carefully and purposefully, seemed to almost find cathartic satisfaction by portraying Mr. Trump in terms that most senior Republicans use only in private.

The senator, who is close to Mr. Tillerson, invoked comments that the president made on Twitter last weekend in which he appeared to undercut Mr. Tillerson’s negotiations with North Korea.

“A lot of people think that there is some kind of ‘good cop, bad cop’ act underway, but that’s just not true,” Mr. Corker said.

Without offering specifics, he said Mr. Trump had repeatedly undermined diplomacy with his Twitter fingers. “I know he has hurt, in several instances, he’s hurt us as it relates to negotiations that were underway by tweeting things out,” Mr. Corker said.

All but inviting his colleagues to join him in speaking out about the president, Mr. Corker said his concerns about Mr. Trump were shared by nearly every Senate Republican.

“Look, except for a few people, the vast majority of our caucus understands what we’re dealing with here,” he said, adding that “of course they understand the volatility that we’re dealing with and the tremendous amount of work that it takes by people around him to keep him in the middle of the road.”

As for the tweets that set off the feud on Sunday morning, Mr. Corker expressed a measure of powerlessness.

“I don’t know why the president tweets out things that are not true,” he said. “You know he does it, everyone knows he does it, but he does.”

The senator recalled four conversations this year, a mix of in-person meetings and phone calls, in which he said the president had encouraged him to run for re-election. Mr. Trump, he said, repeatedly indicated he wanted to come to Tennessee for an early rally on Mr. Corker’s behalf and even telephoned him last Monday to try to get him to reconsider his decision to retire.

“When I told him that that just wasn’t in the cards, he said, ‘You know, if you run, I’ll endorse you.’ I said, ‘Mr. President, it’s just not in the cards; I’ve already made a decision.’ So then we began talking about other candidates that were running.”

One of the most prominent establishment-aligned Republicans to develop a relationship with Mr. Trump, the senator said he did not regret standing with him during the campaign last year.

“I would compliment him on things that he did well, and I’d criticize things that were inappropriate,” he said. “So it’s been really the same all the way through.”

A former mayor of Chattanooga who became wealthy in construction, Mr. Corker, 65, has carved out a reputation over two terms in the Senate as a reliable, but not overly partisan, Republican.

While he opposed President Barack Obama’s divisive nuclear deal with Iran, he did not prevent it from coming to a vote on the Senate floor, which exposed him to fierce fire from conservatives, who blamed him for its passage.

Mr. Trump picked up on that theme hours after his initial tweets, writing that “Bob Corker gave us the Iran Deal, & that’s about it. We need HealthCare, we need Tax Cuts/Reform, we need people that can get the job done!”

Mr. Corker was briefly a candidate to be Mr. Trump’s running mate in 2016, but he withdrew his name from consideration and later expressed ambivalence about Mr. Trump’s campaign, in part because he said he found it frustrating to discuss foreign policy with him.

To some extent, the rift between the two men had been building for months, as Mr. Corker repeatedly pointed out on Sunday to argue that his criticism was not merely that of a man liberated from facing the voters again.

After a report last week that Mr. Tillerson had once referred to Mr. Trump as a “moron,” Mr. Corker told reporters that Mr. Tillerson was one of three officials helping to “separate our country from chaos.” Those remarks were repeated on “Fox News Sunday,” which may have prompted Mr. Trump’s outburst.

In August, after Mr. Trump’s equivocal response to the deadly clashes in Charlottesville, Va., Mr. Corker told reporters that the president “has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful.”

He said on Sunday that he had made all those comments deliberately, aiming them at “an audience of one, plus those people who are closely working around with him, what I would call the good guys.” He was referring to Mr. Tillerson, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and the White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly.

“As long as there are people like that around him who are able to talk him down when he gets spun up, you know, calm him down and continue to work with him before a decision gets made, I think we’ll be fine,” he said.

Mr. Corker would not directly answer when asked whether he thought Mr. Trump was fit for the presidency. But he did say that the commander in chief was not fully aware of the power of his office.

“I don’t think he appreciates that when the president of the United States speaks and says the things that he does, the impact that it has around the world, especially in the region that he’s addressing,” he said. “And so, yeah, it’s concerning to me.”",Bob Corker Says Trump’s Recklessness Threatens ‘World War III’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/08/us/politics/trump-corker.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

I live a in a rent-regulated apartment complex in Corona, Queens. The landlord hired a private investigator to inspect every apartment to “ensure the level of quality in the building.” The inspection company, run by retired police officers, specializes in criminal investigations and surveillance, and uses policing techniques. Tenants must provide photo identification and sign an inspection checklist. This feels like an invasion of privacy that goes beyond typical maintenance-related inspections. Must I comply? If I refuse, could the landlord evict me?

A. You may be experiencing a sweep: An owner (usually a new one) begins checking up on rent-regulated tenants. Cameras are installed in hallways to monitor who comes and goes. Online records are scoured in search of alternate home addresses. This strategy is intended to weed out tenants who are violating the lease — and it can be effective. The goal? Clear out rent-regulated tenants.

Bradley S. Silverbush, a lawyer who represents landlords, said that hiring private investigators to check on tenants “has become standard practice.”

So do you have to comply? Well, you are not required to show an inspector identification or sign a checklist, but you are required to give the landlord access to your apartment to, say, make repairs or check for dangerous conditions, according to Samuel J. Himmelstein, a Manhattan lawyer who represents tenants.

Landlords cannot use an access clause in a lease to get into your apartment for nefarious reasons. Read your lease closely, and if you find that the justification for the inspections is not covered, then you and your neighbors should organize a tenants’ association and respond as a group. “The landlord would love to pick people off,” Mr. Himmelstein said. So stick together.

The association should write the landlord a letter explaining why tenants will not comply with the demand. The landlord may back off. Or, the landlord could bring tenants who refuse entry to housing court on what is known as a non-access holdover proceeding. If the judge sides with the landlord, tenants would have to provide access or face eviction. The landlord could not sue a tenant for eviction until the tenant defies the judge’s orders. The judge could also side with tenants, blocking the landlord’s demand.

They wait on a platform at the Milan train station in 1970, their many suitcases secured with rope, their bags filled to the brim. A box of panettone, a Milanese holiday specialty, accompanies this family of travelers, suggesting Christmastime. Dressed for the cold, the family of five — parents, children, and an older woman wearing black from head to toe — gaze to the right, pondering perhaps their unknown destinies. We see them in Gianni Berengo Gardin’s photograph, shot at mid-distance from above, a portrait of Italy as a migrant nation.

I know these people.

No, they are not my family, but they could be. My parents left their respective mountain towns for New York City two decades earlier than those in the photo, fleeing the destruction, the penury and the hopelessness of post-World War II Italy.

The family on the platform could have easily been one of the multitudes of migrating Italians I encountered on trains when I lived in Milan and Bologna in the mid-1970s, traveling between their hometowns and northern Italian cities, Switzerland, Germany, and other enchanted places of drudgery, sacrifice and desires, temporary stops along an unending journey toward security.

Indeed, Italians keep leaving now, not with the same desperation of the undereducated masses that changed the course of nations in North and South America beginning in the 19th century, but with college degrees and smartphones in hands, grasping for opportunities their country remains incapable of providing.

These images from the mid-20th century capture the ubiquity and possibility of travel and escape, from the gaggle of scugnizzi (street urchins) hitching a ride on the back of a Neapolitan tram to a couple cuddling in their bathing suits, nestled between train tracks. I know them too, having met them in my own travels across the peninsula, heard about them in family stories on both sides of the Atlantic, and encountered them through the countless viewings of films by the likes of Vittorio De Sica, Federico Fellini, and Michelangelo Antonioni.

The 31 black-and-white images displayed in the London gallery exhibition of Gardin’s work, “The Italians,” are, for the most part, those he made in the midcentury, when Italy hovered between agrarian provincialism and an internationally touted cosmopolitanism. The meta-image of an Asian tourist posing for a photographic portrait against a Mediterranean backdrop highlights Italy as destination, in stark disparity to the fleeing migrant family.

Contrasts are a leitmotif for Gardin, as seen with the seven girls in communion whites delighted by a dark-haired dog before them, or the jangle of men on a train, caught in mirrored reflections. The pairing of Italy with style and leisure is found in the photos of an elegantly veiled woman in sunglasses and pearls aboard what appears to be a Venetian water taxi, and the portly man in bathing trunks beatifically splayed on an outcrop, the sea below a resounding swirl.

Gardin is a master of the patterned panorama, vistas of startling beauty shot from above: In one image a donkey-driven plow cuts a billowing swath across an astonishingly stark landscape and in another, two men scurry across a plank in a flooded Piazza San Marco. These are captured flashes of haunting revelation.

His images are not merely of the real, the documented — they are also reveries of the imagination. Lovers, clothed but barefoot, embrace on a beach. A blanket, a pair of shoes and vinyl records in the foreground.

I know them, too.

On the right, there was newfound scorn, and worse, for Israeli expatriates in Germany.
Even after Sunday’s election, Mr. Sappir said, he still believes he would be safer in Germany than in Israel.
“We can be in good relations with Germany, but why do young Israelis have to forget the fate of their fathers and go back there?”But some Israelis in Germany insisted they were neither forgetful nor naïve.
“But I do trust Germany more than I trust any other country in the world to deal with it morally, because of that history.”","Were the very things that have made Germany seem so safe to so many Israelis — the national preoccupation with contrition, aversion to raw nationalism, and determination never to repeat the sins of the past — now in danger of being shunted aside by a new generation unburdened by collective guilt and determined to assert its national identity?

Was Israel’s special relationship with Germany, too, now in danger?

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hastened to say that it was not, announcing Tuesday that he had spoken with Chancellor Angela Merkel. He congratulated her on winning and expressed confidence that Israel and Germany would only deepen their ties.

But Mr. Netanyahu added that Israel was “concerned about the rise of anti-Semitism” on both the political right and left, and noted that “there are two different things: denying the Holocaust and denying responsibility.” He called on Ms. Merkel’s new government to “act to strengthen the forces in Germany that take on the historical responsibility.”

Among the opposition, Amir Peretz, a Knesset member from the left-of-center Zionist Union, wrote on Twitter in German that the election was “a bad day for Germany democracy, with the entry of xenophobes and open anti-Semites into the Bundestag.”

Yet like so much else dividing Israeli society today, the advances by the Alternative for Germany, or the AfD, as it is known, seems to provide more of an excuse for political recriminations and partisan bile than a source of common Jewish ground.

On the right, there was newfound scorn, and worse, for Israeli expatriates in Germany.

Aryeh Eldad, a former Knesset member and medical professor, wrote in Maariv of his revulsion at the “20,000 Israelis who moved from Israel to Germany of their own free will,” whether for “cheaper housing and cheaper cottage cheese” or to live under “the wonderful German democracy” out of a “distorted” leftism. Both groups, he said, were “emotional cripples.”

“These Israelis,” Mr. Eldad wrote, “are not like the dog that comes back to eat his own vomit, but rather like the vomit that returns to the dog that spewed it.”

On the left, there was renewed criticism for the Israeli government that so many left behind when they moved to Germany.

Michael Sappir, a 29-year-old in Tel Aviv who earned a degree in linguistics at the University of Leipzig, in Saxony, and now works in high tech, said the election “makes me think twice about the idea of moving there again, both as a Jew and a leftist.”

But, he added, “the situation in Germany is much, much better than here, where the governing coalition is composed mostly of parties that are intellectually akin to the AfD.” He said, “What’s considered the terrifying right wing there is on many policy points just mainstream here.”

View all New York Times newsletters.

Even after Sunday’s election, Mr. Sappir said, he still believes he would be safer in Germany than in Israel. “The norms of governance, the rule of law, there is much stronger,” he said. “Here I feel like an embattled minority. There I know that we’re a much bigger minority, and there’s at least a pretty broad anti-fascist consensus.”

Eldad Beck, an Israeli journalist and author of a book on German-Jewish relations, said left-wing Israelis in Germany who were surprised by Sunday’s vote were “suffering from blindness.” But he also said that he knew some Israelis in Germany who had voted for the AfD “because they consider the arrival of so many Muslims and the violence, terror and criminality a big problem that has to be stopped.”

Indeed, feelings about the subject do not fall into neat categories, even among left-leaning Israelis.

Mr. Weinberger, the marketing executive in Berlin, said he believed that, aside from anti-Merkel sentiment, what had driven Germans to the AfD was an understandable emotion: “There are strong feelings of fear,” he said. “It’s part of human nature at some point. And some of them I’m sure are really concerned about this open-door policy. It affects their lives.”

Shai Levy, 44, a Jerusalem-born filmmaker in Berlin, said he was saddened to see Israel and the Jewish people fueling the resurgent right wing “because they have a common enemy; being anti-Muslim is considered to be good for the Jews.”

He sees many Israelis newly arrived in Berlin tensing up at the sight of people in Muslim head scarves, a “reflex of phobia for Muslims,” he said, adding: “I know it because I had it. I needed to get rid of it.”

Where Germany goes from here, and how Israel and Israelis will adjust, will depend less on Ms. Merkel than on those who succeed her when she leaves the stage, said Mr. Beck, the author of “Germany, at Odds.”

“As long as Merkel is chancellor, the special relationship is O.K.,” he said. “But Israelis will have to make a special effort, otherwise things are going to fall apart.”

He said that the millions of Muslims who have arrived in Germany in recent years would inevitably influence the country’s politics.

“I’m not so sure the young generations of German politicians feel as connected to Israel and to the past,” he warned. “And I don’t see yet that Israel is really making an effort to convince them why it is doing certain things and why it’s important to do those things.”

Younger Israelis, too, can be frustrating to their elders.

To Miki Goldman, 92, a survivor of Auschwitz and other concentration camps who later helped collect evidence against Adolf Eichmann, diplomacy is one thing, but emigrating to Germany another.

“Undoubtedly Germany of today is a democracy, but it still has a kernel of something else that could become dangerous,” he said. “We can be in good relations with Germany, but why do young Israelis have to forget the fate of their fathers and go back there?”

But some Israelis in Germany insisted they were neither forgetful nor naïve.

Ruthi Grossman, 24, a student who moved to Berlin last year, said she still planned to stay there.

“I think it’s just part of the world moving toward dark times,” she said of the rightward drift. “But I do trust Germany more than I trust any other country in the world to deal with it morally, because of that history.”","Is Germany Still a Haven for Israelis?

Tricky Clues

1A: “Agcy. for Kennedy and Reagan” is TSA because the clue is referring to the airports, not the presidents after which they are named.

28A: PREGGERS makes its New York Times crossword debut today, clued as “With child, informally.”

122A: This was too good to pass up. At first, I thought these were the kind of chocolate cups you make using a balloon and melted chocolate, but it turns out that we’re talking about the universe’s gift to personkind, the REESE’s peanut butter cup. And the man who first got peanut butter in his chocolate was H.B. REESE. I made sure to indulge in a few of these cups, just to make absolutely sure they were still a thing. No need to thank me. I’m happy to do the research so you don’t have to.

11D: A pun that rhymes. “Divine bovine?” is a SACRED COW.

39D: I think this clue is a nod to Brendan Emmett Quigley’s 2001 debut of the entry “WHY, YOU LITTLE ...” and it’s a great one. The answer, “SON OF A ...,” is also fairly unique, as it was used once in a 1965 puzzle as a fill-in-the-blank clue referring to a biblical quote.

43D: Clue of the Day, in my opinion. “Several quarter turns?” does not refer to actually turning something manually or screwing something in. It refers to the action of a COIN TOSS, when a quarter is turning in the air. I love visually evocative clues like that.

80D: A “System of roots?” sounds on the surface like it refers to a plant. Today it refers to ETYMOLOGY, the study of the origins of words, their roots, and how language has changed over time.

Constructor Notes

Erik Agard: Music and wordplay are but two of Alex’s superpowers (you can see some of her punny drawings on her Instagram), so when this puzzle’s then-half-formed theme needed rescuing, I knew who to shine the Bat Signal for. Through a couple revisions and upwards of a hundred emails, the collaboration was always fun, and I’m looking forward to her next puzzle. Alex Briñas: Erik was the true superhero here — he zipped nimbly through the bulk of the work and picked up after all my snafus. I’m a super-newbie to everything in the crossword world, but I do enjoy myself a good pun every now and then, so this was fascinating and foreign and exciting and daunting all at once. And I owe much thanks to Erik for inviting me to sidekick this mission in the first place. For your enjoyment (we hope), here are some of the theme answers from the cutting room floor: [Human Torch’s favorite band?] (3,7,4) [Blade’s favorite band?] (7,7) [Wonder Twins’ favorite band?] (5) [Storm’s favorite rapper?] (6) [Beast’s favorite singer?] (6) [Wolverine’s favorite guitarist?] (5) [Lady Deathstrike’s favorite band?] (13) [Banshee’s favorite band?] (5,5)

FRIDAY PUZZLE — When you’ve had a busy or a tough week — a week where it feels as if your hair is on fire — your best bet is to find a distraction. Ideally, this distraction should be good for you (or at least not terribly harmful) and should allow you to focus hard on it so that you can temporarily displace thoughts about what kindled that hair fire to begin with.

My own go-to distractions are running, reading, cooking and knitting. When I really need to distract myself and focus down, I enjoy British-style cryptic crosswords. I’m sure you have your own distractions.

My point is, once the hair fire is extinguished and the smoke settles, you deserve a reward for making it through. The Venn diagram of “distractions from hair fires” and “rewards” probably overlaps quite a bit, but in my opinion, sitting down on a Friday with a lovely beverage and a Patrick Berry themeless crossword is one of the best ways to end the week. I put that firmly in the rewards circle.

Mr. Berry can bring some fresh entries to his grids and bring back entries that have not been seen for a while. The middle section — BARBARA JORDAN, SOCIAL STUDIES and ACCOUNT HOLDER — is O.K. in terms of liveliness, but those are all debuts, so bonus points there. What I really liked was the openness of the center, which gave Mr. Berry room to cross those center entries with ROBERT ALTMAN, METEOR SHOWERS and SENATOR ELECT.

“I want to try flipping on the mat.”I agreed to try, and we went last Friday night.","Toward the end of last year, he started doing flips on his best friend’s trampoline. First front flips, and then backward ones. Yes, I am well aware that the trampoline manufacturers and doctors warn against this, and I understand why. But I watched him. The kid could flip. He understood his body and where it was in the air. I had coached gymnastics throughout high school and college, and I knew the ways kids typically got injured. I made sure he understood how to bail and how to handle too much rotation.

Again, I tried to get him to go back to his gymnastics class. He had other ideas. “Can we go to the trampoline park?” he begged me over his holiday break. I looked it up online. It was expensive and sort of far away. At first, it seemed like one more parenting thing I’d have to do.

Then I realized that I could jump, too.

I put on my best sports bra, the leggings I usually wore to yoga and the requisite sticky-bottom trampoline socks. I slapped my hair into a ponytail and walked out onto the trampoline court to an open square next to his.

All the other adults were sitting on benches, holding their kids’ coats and sipping Starbucks. I felt self-conscious at first. The old lady bouncing.

But then I saw Max’s face. “Mom, watch!” he said, as he soared into an easy back flip. “Can you do one?” he asked.

“Yeah, I can,” I said, with far more confidence than I felt. Even though I had been doing gymnastics again, the gym where I went didn’t have a trampoline. So I hadn’t been on one since I was a kid. I took a few bounces to warm up. I remembered fairly quickly how to use the bounce and catch it the right way.

Max looked at me with light in his eyes. “It’s so easy, Mom! See?” he flipped a few more times.

“I’m getting there,” I reassured him as I did some “timer” bounces — essentially, bouncing and lifting my arms up high the way I would if I was going to flip.

“O.K.,” I finally said, “I’m ready.” I took a few more bounces and launched myself backward into a back tuck. I landed with a bounce and a breath and a big smile.

Max flipped with glee. I recognized his easy grace as my own. I had known he had my eyes, my dry skin and my situational shyness. I just hadn’t recognized that he had my love of testing gravity with his body.

We stayed for an hour, and I flipped forward and backward dozens of times. I did straddle jumps and seat drops and handsprings. I got my phone out of my locker and Max and I took turns taking videos of each other. The fact that I didn’t see any other parents jumping ceased to matter. I knew this was it — that moment of pure joy with your kid you always want as a parent and berate yourself endlessly for not creating. Here it was, like an invitation. I laughed and I ached and I felt simultaneously 10 years old and 42 years old. I was so thoroughly worn out when we left, I wasn’t sure how I would drive home — but I knew we’d be back.

Not only have we gone back a few times, Max found out about a Friday night open gym for kids and adults at a small gymnastics center that recently opened nearby. His sister went to a birthday party there and he snagged a flier promoting the open gym. “Can we go? Please?” he begged. “I want to try flipping on the mat.”

I agreed to try, and we went last Friday night. Again, I put on my black leggings and gathered my courage to not look ridiculous. Kids meandered here and there and parents mostly sat watching. After a few minutes, I started to feel at ease and began to tumble.

“I see where he gets it,” another mom said to me as I landed a back tuck on a squishy mat. We both turned to look at Max, who bounded off the springboard into a high and easy front flip.

“Yep,” I said smiling. “We flip. It’s what we do.”","Connecting, Midair, With My 8-Year-Old Son",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/well/family/connecting-midair-with-my-8-year-old-son.html

But you’ll want to book before you hit about 10 days out from Christmas Day, Mr. Surry said.

“Based on Hopper’s historical data, the best time to book Christmas flights is about 83 days before departure, which is the first week of October. Prices begin rising by about $4 per day around Thanksgiving, and then by about $7 per day in the final two weeks,” Mr. Surry said.

Does It Matter Which Day I Book?

There are several different theories about which day of the week, and time of day, has the most affordable fares. For example, Priceline.com data shows that the cheapest day of the week to purchase is Friday, despite the majority of tickets being purchased on a Tuesday.

But there might not be a whole lot to gain from focusing on the day of the week.

“Pricing is extremely nuanced,” Mr. Surry said. “Everyone wants a golden rule about when to buy, but it really depends on your route, dates and demand.”

“If you have flexibility, in general it will pay to extend your trip,” Mr. Surry said.

Regarding Thanksgiving, the most expensive day to depart is the Wednesday before, which should not come as a surprise as it’s also one of the busiest travel days of the year. But if you are able to leave on the Monday or the Thursday of that week you can save around $50 on the first leg of your trip. The same goes for your return day. The busiest and most expensive day to come back is Sunday. But you can save around $160 by returning on Wednesday, Nov. 29, instead, Mr. Surry said.

For Christmas this year, the cheapest days to depart are Saturday, Dec. 16, or Tuesday, Dec. 19, which can save you about $110 compared to traveling on the busiest day, which is Friday, Dec. 22. The most popular return day is New Year’s Day, and returning on Thursday, Jan. 4, instead could save you around $100, according to Hopper’s data.

Does It Matter Where I’m Going?

Yes, data for domestic flights show that some destination cities are more expensive to travel to than others, which can be tied to demand.

Priceline.com found that the most popular travel route for both Thanksgiving and Christmas is New York City to Florida (Miami, Fort Lauderdale and Orlando). For Christmas travel, these destination cities are also among the ones with the highest “holiday premium,” as Hopper terms it, meaning the greatest increase in price compared to non-holiday travel.

No matter where you are traveling from for the Christmas holiday, you can expect to pay up to 82 percent more for a fare to Miami ($383 instead of $211), according to Hopper. Fort Lauderdale and Orlando see spikes of over 60 percent.

For Thanksgiving, you can expect to spend 40 percent more than usual for trips to Denver and Boston.

Weegee,” features vintage prints — many previously unseen — that captures Weegee’s singular point of view.
These prints, Mr. Blau wrote in the book, changed his mind, as he saw pictures vastly different from those he had encountered 30 years earlier in some badly reproduced volume.
Mr. Blau deftly connects the man and his era to how we and Hollywood — to which Weegee decamped in 1947 to try his hand at acting — now perceive it.
“Our reference points to these mysterious words can be found in Hollywood entertainment such as ‘The Sopranos’ or ‘Boardwalk Empire,’” Mr. Blau wrote.","To those among us fortunate enough to have known old-timers who regaled us with tales of tabloid derring-do, New York was once a place of outrageous characters both in front of and behind the camera. Like players in “The Front Page,” hordes of cigar-chomping, fedora-wearing men plied their trade as a contact sport that was not above recreating scenes or putting a prop or two — like a lonesome looking doll — into everyday moments of tragedy.

In this cast of characters, Weegee was the Dante of New York’s nighttime demimonde. His photos, of swells and speakeasies, crime and crowds, or perps and play, are a singular record of New York City in the 1930s and ’40s. And just when you thought you had seen all of his work, a new book, “Extra! Weegee,” features vintage prints — many previously unseen — that captures Weegee’s singular point of view.

Photo

Daniel Blau, the book’s editor, admitted that he had “never really liked Weegee.” Obviously, he has since come to his senses, putting together an impressive volume that captures the many sides of New York as it approached World War II. The images were found in the archives of the Newspaper Enterprise Association, a syndicate founded at the turn of the last century by Edward Willis Scripps. The photos — which had been taken for the association’s Acme Newspictures service — passed through the hands of several owners, and were discovered in storage in 2012 by Ryan Adams.

These prints, Mr. Blau wrote in the book, changed his mind, as he saw pictures vastly different from those he had encountered 30 years earlier in some badly reproduced volume. And in a nod to the current daily torrent of images, these photos had an air of mystery, he said, and the mark of a master.

Weegee, born Ascher Fellig in 1899 in what is now Ukraine, lived a spartan existence down by the old New York Police headquarters in Lower Manhattan. That’s not surprising, since his realm was the streets. And the images he shot revealed not just a knowledge of people and places, but an appreciation for the ironic, odd or absurd.

A car dangles off the roadway that encircles Grand Central Terminal, with a “ONE WAY” arrow pointing at it, while two men stand under an awning, not oblivious, but not impressed, either. In another, an overturned vehicle rests on its side, with a sign reading “SLOW DOWN” hovering behind it like an unheeded warning.

Working crowds, you have images of a sweaty, packed throng in Coney Island and people celebrating the end of World War II. A jubilant sailor is surrounded by four women, flanking a sign he held declaring: “$2,000 In Bank Now I’m Looking for a Wife,” with “18-40” added at the bottom.

Of course, the main character on this sidewalk stage is Weegee himself. Mr. Blau deftly connects the man and his era to how we and Hollywood — to which Weegee decamped in 1947 to try his hand at acting — now perceive it.

“Our reference points to these mysterious words can be found in Hollywood entertainment such as ‘The Sopranos’ or ‘Boardwalk Empire,’” Mr. Blau wrote. “Weegee made these possible. He was a game changer — breaking new ground in both photography and photojournalism. Using a camera to tell a story as others used their pen or speech.”

Mr. Blau concludes that while Weegee may have left to be a movie actor, he had long been on that path.

“By then he had already made all the films he wanted,” he wrote. “All films made of a single frame. All telling a story in one take. Today I love these short films.”

The president’s demands include new rules that say children are not considered “unaccompanied” at the border if they have a parent or guardian in the United States.","The demands were developed by a half-dozen agencies and departments, officials said. But among the officials behind the demands are Stephen Miller, the president’s top policy adviser, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, both of whom have long advocated extremely aggressive efforts to prevent illegal entry into the country and crack down on undocumented immigrants already here.

The demands represented a concerted effort to broaden the expected congressional debate about the Dreamers to one about overhauling the entire American immigration system — on terms that hard-line conservatives have been pursuing for decades.



In a letter to lawmakers, Mr. Trump said his demands would address “dangerous loopholes, outdated laws and easily exploited vulnerabilities” in the immigration system, asserting that they were “reforms that must be included” in any deal to address the Dreamers.

Democratic leaders in Congress reacted with alarm, saying the demands threaten to undermine the president’s own statements in which he had pledged to work across the aisle to protect the Dreamers through legislation.

“The administration can’t be serious about compromise or helping the Dreamers if they begin with a list that is anathema to the Dreamers, to the immigrant community and to the vast majority of Americans,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leaders in the Senate and the House, said in a joint statement.

Mr. Schumer and Ms. Pelosi, who declared after a White House dinner last month that they had reached a deal with Mr. Trump to protect Dreamers, denounced the president’s demands as failing to “represent any attempt at compromise.” They called it little more than a thinly veiled effort to scuttle negotiations even before they begin in earnest.

“If the president was serious about protecting the Dreamers, his staff has not made a good-faith effort to do so,” they added.

Last month, the president abruptly ended an Obama-era policy called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, in which former President Barack Obama had used his executive authority to protect about 800,000 of the young immigrants from the threat of deportation and provide them work permits.

Even as Mr. Trump kept his campaign promise to halt what he had described as “one of the most unconstitutional actions ever undertaken by a president,” he quickly added that he would work with Democrats in Congress to replace the executive policy with legislation, giving them six months to do so. But a White House official said on Sunday that Mr. Trump was not open to a deal that would eventually allow the Dreamers to become United States citizens.

“The president’s position has been that he’s called on Congress to come up with a permanent solution and a fix to this process,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said last week.

Immigration advocates will most likely urge Democratic leaders to refuse a deal that includes the president’s proposals. But immigration and human rights advocates are also under pressure to do something for the Dreamers, thousands of whom will begin, by March, losing permission to work and protection from deportation if a deal is not reached.

Privately, many advocates have acknowledged that a negotiated deal with the Republican president is likely to include some immigration changes.

Administration officials responsible for securing the border and enforcing the nation’s immigration laws told reporters on Sunday night that the changes requested by the president were essential to protecting American workers from unfair competition and deterring what they described as a never-ending flow of illegal immigrants into the country.

On the president’s wish list is a long-sought Republican goal of stopping American residents from sponsoring the arrival of extended family members. His demand would limit residents to bringing only spouses and children.

Also central to the effort, officials said, are legal changes that would strip away the rights of illegal immigrants to claim asylum or make another case to stay in the United States, allowing federal officials to more quickly deport them.

“We cannot have true border security if we don’t change federal laws to ensure that people who are apprehended are removed,” said Ron Vitiello, the acting deputy commissioner for Customs and Border Protection.

Thomas D. Homan, the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said a vast increase in the number of agents and other federal resources would allow for a crackdown on immigration violators that had been difficult in the past.

Another key part of that crackdown would be on tens of thousands of children who have surged across the border with Mexico during the past several years, many of them seeking to escape gang-related violence in Central American countries. This year, about 38,500 children have been apprehended at the border without their parents.

Administration officials say the children — many of whom are sent to live with a cousin, aunt, uncle or sibling in the United States — must be turned back or quickly deported once they arrive. Under current law, many of them remain in the United States for years during legal proceedings to evaluate their asylum or refugee claims.

If the children are not deported quickly, officials say, many will never leave, eventually becoming a new population of sympathetic young immigrants who seek amnesty. That could create lasting cycles in which illegal immigrants demand to be given a legal status, the officials say.

The president’s demands include new rules that say children are not considered “unaccompanied” at the border if they have a parent or guardian in the United States. They also propose treating children from Central America the same way they do children from Mexico, who can be repatriated more quickly, with fewer rights to hearings.

Mr. Trump is also calling for a surge in resources to pay for 370 additional immigration judges, 1,000 government lawyers and more detention space so that children arriving at the border can be held, processed and quickly returned if they do not qualify to stay longer.

Critics say the focus on deporting unaccompanied children is heartless and impractical. They say many were sent by their parents on long, dangerous treks in the hopes of avoiding poverty, hunger, abuse or death by gangs in their home countries.

Advocates acknowledge that more resources are necessary to speed up those hearings. But they argue that White House efforts to demand quick decisions are likely to merely result in many children being sent back to places where they are raped, beaten or killed.

“They’re both highly talented and accomplished gentlemen,” Ms. Spear said. “They complement each other.”

Mr. Cox, the estate’s executor, declined to be interviewed for this article. But many have been unable to resist making a quick mental inventory of Mr. Bergé’s holdings: the paintings, the furniture, the libraries and the cash; an auction of his and Mr. Saint Laurent’s personal collection fetched hundreds of millions in 2009. (The interest Mr. Bergé held in the French daily Le Monde has already been divested.)

Those who pictured Mr. Cox shuttlingluxuriously among the homes Mr. Bergé kept in Paris, Normandy, St.-Rèmy-de-Provence, Marrakesh and Tangier will be disappointed, according to Quito Fierro, the chief administrative officer of the Jardin Majorelle Foundation. The foundation is a subsidiary of the Pierre Bergé-Yves Saint Laurent Foundation that operates, along with the museum in Marrakesh, the public Majorelle Garden and a museum of Berber culture there.

The vacation house Mr. Bergé built in Normandy was not his, Mr. Fierro said; he simply retained the right to use the house after selling it and Château Gabriel, on the same grounds, following Mr. Saint Laurent’s death.

And the other residences — including Villa Mabrouka in Tangier, which has been on and off the market in recent years with an asking price of around $10 million — will be sold to benefit the umbrella foundation, whose presidency has passed from Mr. Bergé to Mr. Cox, Mr. Fierro said.

No one should be worried about Mr. Cox’s housing, however. Villa Oasis, the lavish Orientalist fantasy where Mr. Bergé lived in Marrakesh, is part of the Majorelle Foundation, but is Mr. Cox’s in all but name, a perk that comes with the guardianship of Mr. Saint Laurent’s artistic legacy.

For all the clucking and tallying, Mr. Cox and Mr. Berge’s wedding was met with little more than a nod by those who track the movements of the forbidding and glamorous, if increasingly diminished, clan that surrounded Mr. Saint Laurent.

Christopher Gibbs, a neighbor in Tangier, where Mr. Cox has a residence of his own, called him “a saintly figure, which could not be said of Pierre.” Mr. Gibbs, a retired dealer in high-bohemian antiques who dressed the sets for the Mick Jagger film “Performance,” praised Mr. Cox for being “such a wonderful support to Pierre, through thick and thin, and for so many years. I weep for Madison having all this responsibility. It’s beyond the call of duty.”

Jane Kramer, in her takedown of Mr. Bergé in The New Yorker in 1994, put Mr. Bergé’s unsaintliness another way, writing, “He has a lugubrious, rather terrifying self-regard.” He appears “undisturbed by the tempering plain truths of self-reflection,” she wrote, noting that his wrath was “legendary.”

Mr. Bergé had more than one “L’Amour Fou” (crazy love), the name he gave the 2010 documentary about him and Mr. Saint Laurent. In published letters he wrote to Mr. Saint Laurent after the designer died, he made Mr. Cox’s place in the hierarchy of his heart clear.

“With you, Madison remains the most important relationship of my life.” He arrived “when alcohol and drugs had taken possession of you.”

“Thanks to Madison, probably, I weathered the storm,” Mr. Bergé continued. “He gave me what I needed: his youth, culture, courage, integrity, love.”

“I didn’t leave you,” Mr. Bergé went on to write. “I could have during this time with Madison, I almost did. Finally, it was he who’d had enough, who left.”

“You loved him, hated him, then loved him again.”

Maria Callas could not have sung the strangulated story of Mr. Bergé, Mr. Saint Laurent and Mr. Cox any better.

In 1976, nearly two decades after meeting, Mr. Bergé broke romantically from Mr. Saint Laurent. Still, jealousy and possessiveness ran high, and the men remained business partners.

Accounts of the Cox-Bergé introduction vary. Mr. Cox has placed it in Paris in 1978; Annabelle d’Huart, a jewelry designer and member of the old Saint Laurent tribe, puts their first meeting in New York a year earlier, when Mr. Cox was a student at Parsons. At the time, Mr. Bergé was involved with Joël Le Bon, who was in charge of the music for the Saint Laurent shows and worked for Interview magazine in Paris.

”I introduced Joël to Madison, they fell in love, and Madison followed Joël to Paris, transferring to Parsons there,” Ms. d’Huart said.

Mr. Bergé got to know Mr. Cox better during a trip they took with her and Mr. Le Bon. to the Aeolian Islands the following summer.

According to Mattia Bonetti, a furniture designer who knew Mr. Cox in Paris in the 1980s, “Madison was first with Joël, then Yves, then finally Pierre.”

After the holiday in the Aeolians, “Madison ascended quickly in the Saint Laurent clan,” Ms. d’Huart said. “Joël no longer measured up and was dropped. The clan was like a tank that rolled over you, then moved on, laughing loudly and shrugging, ‘Who cares?’ Joël died of AIDS, forgotten.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Mr. Bonetti said that in the beginning, Mr. Cox and Mr. Bergé “saw each other, not in a hidden way, but separate from Yves, to avoid scenes.” Over dinner one night when Mr. Cox had stepped away from the table, Mr. Bonetti said Mr. Bergé asked him, “‘What do I have to do to keep him?’ I told him, ‘You have to give Madison everything, and I don’t mean materially, because otherwise he’s going to leave.’”

Mr. Bergé felt obliged to engage someone else for the garden at Gabriel, because of the tension that using Mr. Cox would have created with Mr. Saint Laurent. The job fell to a Louis Benech, who would later turn his hand to the Tuileries.

“I said to Pierre that I didn’t see the point of my working at Gabriel when he could hire his friend,” Mr. Benech recalled. “‘Too complicated,’” he said. “‘Period.’”

Peter Dunham, a decorator in Los Angeles, met Mr. Cox in Paris during his early years with Mr. Bergé. “Pierre really didn’t allow Madison to have friends,” Mr. Dunham said. “He lived a very controlled, gilded-cage existence.”

Jane Stubbs, an antiquarian bookseller, was commissioned by Mr. Bergé to create a Morocco-theme library for a guest room at Mabrouka. She remembered “arriving in Tangier with Madison and waiting at the luggage carousel. His phone rang. It was Pierre. ‘Where have you been? You were supposed to get in at 5:25.’ It was 5:27.”

The triangle collapsed during Christmas 1987, when, as Mr. Bergé wrote, Mr. Saint Laurent began hiding tumblers of whiskey from him behind the Jacques Grange taffeta curtains at Gabriel.

Mr. Cox retreated to New York, opening an office and remaking his life with Konstantin Kakanias, a cartoonist. Mr. Bergé took up with Robert Merloz, a young designer he backed with company money. Mr. Merloz’s collection flopped.

Christopher Mason, a musician and social chronicler, said that when Mr. Cox left him, “Pierre was flabbergasted. He couldn’t believe anyone would dare walk out on him.”

Mr. Cox also enjoyed, and was sometimes inconvenienced by, what might be called “amitiés amoureuses” (pararomantic friendships), with Ms. Stubbs and Marian McEvoy, the author of “Glue Gun Decor: How to Dress Up Your Home — from Pillows and Curtains to Sofas and Lampshades.”

Mr. Cox, with a B.F.A. in environmental design and an address book fortified by Mr. Bergé’s, has never lacked business. His clients include Michael Bloomberg, Marella Agnelli, Lauren Santo Domingo and Anne Bass, who let him loose on a thousand acres in Litchfield County, Conn.

At one point Nancy Novogrod, a former magazine editor, expressed interest in hiring Mr. Cox in Litchfield.

“Trademark law tends to be very parochial when it comes to this sort of thing,” said Barton Beebe, a professor of intellectual property law at New York University, in an email. “It only cares about the perception of the relevant consumer population, and in the U.S., the relevant population was not likely and probably still isn’t likely influenced by Australian English.”

Uggs — the generic kind — might seem like an odd place for Australia to plant its cultural flag. But it comes as some in Australia fume about people outside the country appropriating Australian names and ideas. Ms. Winfrey, Kate Moss and Sarah Jessica Parker may have helped make the footwear famous around the world, but many Australians want to call Uggs their own.

“If the French can protect ‘Champagne’, the Portuguese ‘Port’, the Spanish ‘Sherry’ and the Greeks ‘Feta’,” said Nick Xenophon, an Australian senator, in a recent statement, alluding to the brand protections that some famous names enjoy, “then surely Australia can protect the word ‘Ugg.’” (Mr. Xenophon on Friday said he would resign as a senator.)

Uggs came and went from public view in the United States since they were trademarked there, but they won a big boost from Ms. Winfrey, the talk show host, who came out as a fan in the early 2000s. Their roots are more humble. According to Australian trademark officials, they appeared as early as the 1970s in phone directory ads as ug, ugg, ugh boots, among many other variations.

“In Australian slang, ‘ughs’ are sheepskin booties, designed by surfers in the 1960s to coddle feet weary after ‘shooting the curl.’” The New York Times said in 1994.

The brand’s owner in the United States, the Deckers Outdoor Corporation, argues that in the 1990s it bought the American registered name from an Australian entrepreneur, Brian Smith, fair and square. Australians violate the company’s intellectual property rights, it said, when they sell Ugg-like footwear in the United States.

Last year it sued an Australian shoemaker owned by Eddie Oygur in a Chicago federal court, saying he sold ersatz Uggs in the United States. Mr. Oygur sold about $2,000 worth of lowercase ugg boots in the United States over a five-year period, his lawyer said, and believed he had every right to.

“I want to let the American people know what corporate bullies they are and what they’re trying to do – deplete my resources, ruin my business and the whole ugg boot industry,” Mr. Oygur said in his factory in Lidcombe, a Sydney suburb.

Mr. Oygur, 56 years old, plans to take his argument to the court of American public opinion. On Sunday, he said, he plans to join Mr. Xenophon to drive a herd of sheep to Deckers’s headquarters, in Goleta, Calif.

Uggs is not the only Australian name to spur protective feelings — and, potentially, limit the international expansion of Australian companies.

Bondi Wash, a Sydney company that makes natural baby lotions, soaps and dog rinses, groused that it was denied a trademark in the United States because of a similar name held by Abercrombie & Fitch. Bondi, a long crescent of white sand in Sydney, is one of Australia’s most famous beaches.

“They didn’t really care that Bondi was actually quite a well known place in Australia and they’d awarded it to a big U.S. company,” said Belinda Everingham, founder of Bondi Wash, referring to the United States Patent and Trademark Office.

Uluru, the name of an immense rock formation in central Australia, is trademarked in the United States by a California carpet company. Kakadu, the name of a national park, is claimed by a number of companies in the United States.

“Certain words really belong in the public domain,” said Matthew Rimmer, an intellectual property and innovation professor at Queensland University of Technology’s law school. “There’s a certain Australian pride in the ugg boot, and a belief that it is a common article of clothing in Australia and resentment over it being claimed by a United States trademark holder.”

Mr. Oygur’s company, Australian Leather, hopes to undercut Deckers’s argument by saying Uggs were once uggs in the United States too before they were improperly registered as a trademark. To bolster its argument it tapped Mr. Carroll and another famous surfer, John Arnold, who said he exported large volumes of ugg boots to the United States beginning in the late 1960s.

“My honest opinion is that the term ‘Ugg boot’ is not something that should be owned as it is a description,” said Mr. Carroll, who said he believed the name first came from Australian surfers who thought they were ugly.

He also said that Mr. Corker had asked to be secretary of state. “I said ‘NO THANKS,’” he wrote.

Mr. Corker flatly disputed that account, saying Mr. Trump had urged him to run again, and promised to endorse him if he did. But the exchange laid bare a deeper rift: The senator views Mr. Trump as given to irresponsible outbursts — a political novice who has failed to make the transition from show business.

Mr. Trump poses such an acute risk, the senator said, that a coterie of senior administration officials must protect him from his own instincts. “I know for a fact that every single day at the White House, it’s a situation of trying to contain him,” Mr. Corker said in a telephone interview.

The deeply personal back-and-forth will almost certainly rupture what had been a friendship with a fellow real estate developer turned elected official, one of the few genuine relationships Mr. Trump had developed on Capitol Hill. Still, even as he leveled his stinging accusations, Mr. Corker repeatedly said on Sunday that he liked Mr. Trump, until now an occasional golf partner, and wished him “no harm.”

The White House did not respond to a request for comment on Mr. Corker’s remarks.

Mr. Trump’s feud with Mr. Corker is particularly perilous given that the president has little margin for error as he tries to pass a landmark overhaul of the tax code — his best, and perhaps last, hope of producing a major legislative achievement this year.

If Senate Democrats end up unified in opposition to the promised tax bill, Mr. Trump could lose the support of only two of the Senate’s 52 Republicans to pass it. That is the same challenging math that Mr. Trump and Senate Republican leaders faced in their failed effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.

Mr. Corker could also play a key role if Mr. Trump follows through on his threat to “decertify” the Iran nuclear deal, kicking to Congress the issue of whether to restore sanctions on Tehran and effectively scuttle the pact.

Republicans could hold off on sanctions but use the threat of them to force Iran back to the negotiating table — a strategy being advocated by Senator Tom Cotton, the Arkansas Republican. But that approach could leave the United States isolated, and it will be up to Mr. Corker to balance opposition to the deal with the wishes of those, including some of Mr. Trump’s own aides, who want to change the accord but not blow it up.

Beyond the Iran deal, Mr. Corker’s committee holds confirmation hearings on Mr. Trump’s ambassadorial appointments. If the president were to oust Rex W. Tillerson as secretary of state, as some expect, Mr. Corker would lead the hearings on Mr. Trump’s nominee for the post.

In a 25-minute conversation, Mr. Corker, speaking carefully and purposefully, seemed to almost find cathartic satisfaction by portraying Mr. Trump in terms that most senior Republicans use only in private.

The senator, who is close to Mr. Tillerson, invoked comments that the president made on Twitter last weekend in which he appeared to undercut Mr. Tillerson’s negotiations with North Korea.

“A lot of people think that there is some kind of ‘good cop, bad cop’ act underway, but that’s just not true,” Mr. Corker said.

Without offering specifics, he said Mr. Trump had repeatedly undermined diplomacy with his Twitter fingers. “I know he has hurt, in several instances, he’s hurt us as it relates to negotiations that were underway by tweeting things out,” Mr. Corker said.

All but inviting his colleagues to join him in speaking out about the president, Mr. Corker said his concerns about Mr. Trump were shared by nearly every Senate Republican.

“Look, except for a few people, the vast majority of our caucus understands what we’re dealing with here,” he said, adding that “of course they understand the volatility that we’re dealing with and the tremendous amount of work that it takes by people around him to keep him in the middle of the road.”

As for the tweets that set off the feud on Sunday morning, Mr. Corker expressed a measure of powerlessness.

“I don’t know why the president tweets out things that are not true,” he said. “You know he does it, everyone knows he does it, but he does.”

The senator recalled four conversations this year, a mix of in-person meetings and phone calls, in which he said the president had encouraged him to run for re-election. Mr. Trump, he said, repeatedly indicated he wanted to come to Tennessee for an early rally on Mr. Corker’s behalf and even telephoned him last Monday to try to get him to reconsider his decision to retire.

“When I told him that that just wasn’t in the cards, he said, ‘You know, if you run, I’ll endorse you.’ I said, ‘Mr. President, it’s just not in the cards; I’ve already made a decision.’ So then we began talking about other candidates that were running.”

One of the most prominent establishment-aligned Republicans to develop a relationship with Mr. Trump, the senator said he did not regret standing with him during the campaign last year.

“I would compliment him on things that he did well, and I’d criticize things that were inappropriate,” he said. “So it’s been really the same all the way through.”

A former mayor of Chattanooga who became wealthy in construction, Mr. Corker, 65, has carved out a reputation over two terms in the Senate as a reliable, but not overly partisan, Republican.

While he opposed President Barack Obama’s divisive nuclear deal with Iran, he did not prevent it from coming to a vote on the Senate floor, which exposed him to fierce fire from conservatives, who blamed him for its passage.

Mr. Trump picked up on that theme hours after his initial tweets, writing that “Bob Corker gave us the Iran Deal, & that’s about it. We need HealthCare, we need Tax Cuts/Reform, we need people that can get the job done!”

Mr. Corker was briefly a candidate to be Mr. Trump’s running mate in 2016, but he withdrew his name from consideration and later expressed ambivalence about Mr. Trump’s campaign, in part because he said he found it frustrating to discuss foreign policy with him.

To some extent, the rift between the two men had been building for months, as Mr. Corker repeatedly pointed out on Sunday to argue that his criticism was not merely that of a man liberated from facing the voters again.

After a report last week that Mr. Tillerson had once referred to Mr. Trump as a “moron,” Mr. Corker told reporters that Mr. Tillerson was one of three officials helping to “separate our country from chaos.” Those remarks were repeated on “Fox News Sunday,” which may have prompted Mr. Trump’s outburst.

In August, after Mr. Trump’s equivocal response to the deadly clashes in Charlottesville, Va., Mr. Corker told reporters that the president “has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful.”

He said on Sunday that he had made all those comments deliberately, aiming them at “an audience of one, plus those people who are closely working around with him, what I would call the good guys.” He was referring to Mr. Tillerson, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and the White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly.

“As long as there are people like that around him who are able to talk him down when he gets spun up, you know, calm him down and continue to work with him before a decision gets made, I think we’ll be fine,” he said.

Mr. Corker would not directly answer when asked whether he thought Mr. Trump was fit for the presidency. But he did say that the commander in chief was not fully aware of the power of his office.

“I don’t think he appreciates that when the president of the United States speaks and says the things that he does, the impact that it has around the world, especially in the region that he’s addressing,” he said. “And so, yeah, it’s concerning to me.”",Bob Corker Says Trump’s Recklessness Threatens ‘World War III’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/08/us/politics/trump-corker.html

“The president has free speech rights, too,” Mr.","But in weighing in on the Georgia lawsuit and in vowing to voice support in similar cases in coming weeks, Mr. Sessions drew on so-called statements of interest, a technique used aggressively by the Obama administration to push the boundaries of civil rights laws. They are a legal tool, historically reserved for matters of national security and diplomacy, used to interject the federal government in private disputes.

In the Georgia case, an evangelical Christian student sued administrators last year at Georgia Gwinnett College, a public institution, saying they had limited his ability to proselytize.

According to the lawsuit, the student, Chike Uzuegbunam, an undergraduate at the time, had distributed evangelical Christian materials outside the school library. The college’s administration stopped him because he was not within designated free-speech zones and had not obtained a permit.

Mr. Uzuegbunam later reserved a place outside the school’s food court, within a free-speech zone, and began “discussing the brevity of life and how all men and women have fallen short of God’s commands,” according to the lawsuit. After students complained, administrators said Mr. Uzuegbunam’s “open-air speaking” had disturbed the peace, and they restricted it.

Justice Department lawyers argued in the statement of interest that school administrators were unjustified in silencing Mr. Uzuegbunam simply because other students had been “uncomfortable.”

Casey Mattox, a senior lawyer at the Alliance Defending Freedom, which is representing Mr. Uzuegbunam, said the Justice Department’s support was heartening.

“It’s a boost for the broader free speech movement that the federal government is taking First Amendment rights very seriously,” said Mr. Mattox, whose organization is also representing a student arrested last year for distributing copies of the Constitution on the campus of Kellogg Community College in Battle Creek, Mich.

Mr. Sessions also mentioned that case in his remarks on Tuesday.

“The American university was once the center of academic freedom — a place of robust debate, a forum for the competition of ideas,” Mr. Sessions said. “But it is transforming into an echo chamber of political correctness and homogeneous thought, a shelter for fragile egos.”

Condemning a violent protest at Middlebury College, in Middlebury, Vt., that this year shut down a speech by the author Charles Murray, Mr. Sessions noted that some of the dissenters had worn masks, “a common tactic also used by the detestable Ku Klux Klan.”

The debate about how to interpret the First Amendment on college campuses has divided university faculties, with some arguing for unrestricted speech, no matter how inflammatory, and others advocating boundaries be established in an age of internet trolling and cyberbullying.

At the University of California, Berkeley, the faculty is divided on the issue. Last week, a Free Speech Week event featuring the conservative provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos was canceled.

Mr. Sessions invoked a recent appearance at Berkeley by the conservative writer Ben Shapiro, the former editor at large of Breitbart News, whom he described as a “Harvard trained lawyer who has been frequently targeted by anti-Semites for his Jewish faith, and who vigorously condemns hate speech on both the left and right.”

“To my knowledge,” Mr. Sessions said, “no one fainted, no one was unsafe.”

Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the law school at Berkeley and a First Amendment scholar, said he was pleased about Mr. Sessions’s advocacy for free speech. “I think it’s great that the attorney general of the United States is coming down on the side of free speech — I would hope liberals and conservatives can agree,” he said.

But Mr. Chemerinsky, who has co-written a new book, “Free Speech on Campus,” said he thought Mr. Sessions failed to fully consider the balance of freedom of expression with public safety.

“This university spent $600,000 to facilitate Ben Shapiro coming, and it was estimated if Milo Yiannopoulos came, it would cost $1 million,” he said. “It’s not sustainable for this campus on a weekly basis to facilitate free speech while protecting public safety. Where is that line to be drawn? It’s a really hard question.”

Further stoking the debate about First Amendment rights, Mr. Sessions joined Mr. Trump in criticizing professional athletes who have declined to stand for the national anthem to raise awareness of police brutality and racial injustice.

“The president has free speech rights, too,” Mr. Sessions said in response to a question from the audience. “If they take a provocative act, they have a right to be condemned, and the president has a right to condemn them, and I would condemn their actions.”

Some dissenting students and faculty at Georgetown — where Tiffany Trump, the president’s youngest daughter, is newly enrolled in the law school — called the administration’s message inconsistent.

“There’s hypocrisy here,” said Peter B. Edelman, who teaches constitutional law at Georgetown. “Just as the president has shown a lack of respect for freedom of speech, the attorney general comes to make use of his freedom of speech at our law school.”

Mr. Sessions requested Tuesday’s appearance — the subject and time of which was chosen before Mr. Trump’s remarks about the N.F.L. — according to Randy Barnett, a professor of constitutional law who helped organize the event. Attendance was invitation-only, he said, in order to promote a “civil” tone.

Mr. Sessions urged the students to appreciate their ability to speak out. “As you exercise these rights, realize how precious, how rare and how fragile they are,” he said.

In “most societies throughout history,” he added, “openly criticizing the government or expressing unorthodox opinions could land you in jail, or worse.”","Sessions Calls for ‘Recommitment’ to Free Speech on Campus, Diving Into Debate",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/26/us/politics/jeff-sessions-campus-free-speech-georgetown.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Early this morning at Confucius temples across Taiwan, robed officials performed elaborate ceremonies. The reason: Teacher’s Day, a day of honors for those who impart knowledge on what is believed to be the 2,567th birthday of Confucius, the ancient Chinese sage.

Many other countries designate a special day to celebrate the teaching profession. India commemorates the birthday of Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, a philosopher and the country’s president in the 1960s.

The U.S. celebrates National Teacher Appreciation Week in May.

Many countries have their Teacher’s Day next Thursday, thanks to a global effort started in 1994 by Unesco, the United Nations cultural organization, meant to spread respect for the profession.

The world body says that teachers remain underappreciated: “Strangely one of the most central, vital professionals to society does not receive the respect it deserves in some parts of the world.”

So here’s a timeless essay by an American teacher with tips on how to thank a teacher. The gesture won’t be forgotten, she wrote.

A LOVING, FAITHFUL ANIMAL

By Josephine Rowe

165 pp. Catapult. Paper, $16.95.

I don’t want to start with Larkin because Josephine Rowe’s debut novel, “A Loving, Faithful Animal,” makes an ocean from his aphorism. Even if Larkin’s declaration remains stubbornly true — that old, known poem of how our mum and dad mess us up — Rowe’s book, a slim beauty, does so much to complicate this idea, in such a small space, that I found myself considering those rare things only books can do, feats outside the purview of film or fine art. Imagine Rowe taking a page of blank paper — call it linear time — and crumpling the page into a ball. Nineteen-sixty-seven is flush against 1990. This crumpling, collapsing of Chronos is what it means to have a memory that’s associative and wild, or a family that might be equally uncontrollable.

There is a presence and simultaneity of all personal histories in Rowe’s characters; even the memories most glancing, hated or secret make their ripples. A life remembered in swimsuits. An unwanted image of a drugged girl’s body being sexually abused. These geologic core samples extracted and examined horizontally allow all moments to be thrown together in one vessel: a family of four. Here’s Lani sneaking out at night to sell the drugs prescribed to her father, Jack, to help him forget the horrors of Vietnam, right next to her sister Ru and their mother, Evelyn, abandoned by both Jack and Lani, waiting beside a muddy reservoir for a brush fire to either pass them by or destroy all they’ve known.

Through six characters — three pairs of siblings, living in southeast Australia — Rowe tackles the ever-interesting idea of intergenerational trauma or “hereditary mange.” Jack returns home from the war in Vietnam emotionally damaged while his brother Les avoided that particular scar and that particular war by removing both of his own trigger fingers with a hatchet. Rowe’s use of siblings brings to mind experiments based on twins. What happens if one brother goes to war and one stays home? Or when one sister accepts the privilege of wealth, comforts the other sister has rejected? Rowe has constructed a glorious either/or equation that allows a reader to calculate outcomes: “The Corvette is gleaming, cicada-colored, its cream panels like wings and the soft top folded down. … This is Exhibit A in the Museum of Possible Futures, the life that might have rolled out smooth as a bolt of satin if she had just swung her slender legs up into that beautiful car and driven as fast as she could in the opposite direction.”

Rowe gives a reader much chicken-or-egg to consider. Is there a hierarchy or chronology in violence against the self, one’s own family, strangers? Where does violence begin? Where does it make its nest?

In a work of such well defined characters, each so carefully drawn as to breathe, and a work so full of stark emotional moments, one of the most harrowing scenes comes when Les contemplates how Evelyn, Jack’s wife, surrendered feeling: “But this is something else, this blue in the hallway. This has held clear and sharp, unwavering, years after the fact. And he believes it’s owed to this: When Jack’s fist slammed again and again into the hollow door and then through it, an inch from Evelyn’s face, she had not flinched. As in a side-alley show, some knife-throwing act, she had not flinched.”

Photo

This is a highly interior book, in which gorgeous, precise language encourages inner storms as the surface remains calm, and Rowe — introducing notions of airline flights, runaways, fast cars and motorcycles — asks whether we ever move fast enough to escape this deep damage.

Like the best of Breece D’J Pancake or W. G. Sebald, Rowe plants small moments from history as a soldier might bury land mines. What lies dormant beneath us? A massacre, a dead pet, a crime unchallenged. Rowe then waits for her characters to stumble home drunk or tired one night, tripping that memory wire, while we as readers watch the world explode.","Decades After the Vietnam War, Where Does Violence Begin?",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/books/review/josephine-rowe-a-loving-faithful-animal.html

While it is a great way “to jump-start your career, it is not the only way,” she said.","Thirty years ago, Tim Rasmussen wore a mullet to the photojournalism version of Woodstock on a small upstate New York farm. He had traveled from his small town in Utah to the Catskill Mountains, to a celebration of photography where he studied with such masters of photojournalism as Mary Ellen Mark, Greg Heisler and Jodi Cobb.

A local high school band in Jeffersonville was playing a thunderous welcome as he entered a large, partly built barn. Inside he was greeted by the festival’s mastermind: Eddie Adams, the Pulitzer Prize-winning war photographer.

“Everybody who was anybody was there and I didn’t even know they existed,” said Mr. Rasmussen, now the director of photography for digital and print media at ESPN. “I went to this small agricultural college in Utah and didn’t know anybody, but in less than a week I left there with four or five lifelong friends. Sometimes you spend your whole life seeking your community and for me that was the moment that I found it.”

Mr. Rasmussen will return to Jeffersonville this weekend for the 30th Eddie Adams Workshop, which has since become one of the most important stops for up-and-coming photojournalists.

Mr. Adams died in 2004, but the workshop continues under the aegis of his wife, Alyssa Adams, and the assistance of around 150 volunteers. Some things have changed since the first session — Kodak slide film gave way to digital imagery in the late 1990s and audio and video have been added. Some sponsors have fallen away as the industry has withered, and while tuition is still free, students pay $375 for lodging.

The workshop is structured much as it was 30 years ago, with 10 groups of 10 students managed by a well-known photographer as team leader, a photo editor and a producer. This year, all the teams are led by photographers who were once students in the workshop.

For Jimmy Colton, a well-traveled photo editor who will be attending his 27th consecutive session this week, the workshop is about family. He calls himself Uncle Jimmy, and considers all 2,700 students he has worked with to be his nieces and nephews. The barn is also a place of family ghosts for Mr. Colton, whose brother Jay, and father, Sandy, both volunteered as photo editors before their deaths.

The core values of the workshop continue to be “a level of ethics beyond reproach, having great concern for your subjects and treating everyone as you would like to be treated,” Mr. Colton said.

Mr. Adams purchased the 64-acre farm in Jeffersonville in 1976 intending to convert it into a center for photography. But progress on rebuilding the ramshackle structures was slow as assignment work kept him busy. It was after he met Alyssa in 1983 that the plans for a free, merit-based workshop came together. They married shortly after the first workshop.

Photo

“This workshop is not a ‘how to,’ it’s more inspirational and aspirational,” Ms. Adams said. “This is a place where you can let your hair down and experiment a little as a student.”

The workshop does not romanticize photojournalism, and it acknowledges the price many photojournalists have paid while covering conflict. An annual memorial service for photographers who have died during war recognizes friends of Mr. Adams who were killed in Vietnam, like Henri Huet and Larry Burrows, as well as more recent casualties like Chris Hondros, who attended the 1993 workshop. An annual Award is given to a student by the Chris Hondros Foundation.

Recognizing colleagues who have been killed emphasizes that “the truth matters, pictures matter, and you can make a difference with your pictures not just in war,” said Nancy Andrews, who attended the first workshop in 1988 and has volunteered as a photo editor and will be a team leader this year. She returns for the sense of community and generosity, she said.

“I’m actually improved when you, my colleague, or you, my student, make a great picture” said Ms. Andrews, who was a Washington Post staff photographer and director of photography at The Detroit Free Press. “It’s not like there are finite numbers of great pictures out there and you stole one of them so now I can’t get one. It elevates the profession and I might be better as a result.”

Admission to the workshop, for students and professionals with less than three years’ experience is through portfolios judged by a panel of photo editors.

Not being included can be a difficult blow.

Ruth Fremson was among those young photographers who did not make the cut in the late 1980s. She remembers the rejection well, though she has since been part of three Pulitzer Prize-winning teams as a staff photographer for The Associated Press and starting in 2000 at The New York Times. While it is a great way “to jump-start your career, it is not the only way,” she said.

She has been a team leader at the workshop the last two years and is returning this weekend as a kitchen volunteer to help prepare food for the students.

“It’s such a gift to be able to participate in it because the team leaders and volunteers get as much out of the workshop as the students,” she said. “I’ve had the benefit of many great mentors who have championed my career and this is a great place to pay it forward.”

巴黎——残破的滴水嘴兽和掉落的栏杆柱被塑料管和木板替代。飞扶壁因污染变暗，受雨水腐蚀。小尖塔要靠梁支撑，并用绑带做了固定。

对于每年前往巴黎圣母院那几百万瞠目结舌的游客来说，这些颓丧的迹象并不明显，很多人忙着赞叹精雕细琢的外表，没有注意它的破损与斑驳。

但是近日的一个下午，教堂发言人安德烈·菲诺(André Finot)介绍了建筑的破损情况。指尖轻轻一点，一块石灰岩就破了。

Dmitry Kostyukov for The New York Times 教堂发言人安德烈·菲诺介绍了建筑的破损情况。“被腐蚀的石材随处可见，风不断吹，这些零碎的东西不断往下掉，”他说。

“被腐蚀的石材随处可见，风不断吹，这些零碎的东西不断往下掉，”在教堂屋顶的走道上，菲诺小心翼翼地跨过散落在地上的石块。“整个地方完全失控了。”

这不是这座中世纪哥特建筑瑰宝第一次需要大规模整修——也不会是最后一次。但是专家称，虽然尚不面临坍塌的危险，但圣母院已经到了一个临界点——一个昂贵的临界点。

位于法国首都中心的巴黎圣母院，被许多人认为是一辈子需要去一趟的地方，这其中包括了梅拉尼娅·特朗普和碧昂丝这样的人物。皮库说，它是法国和美国之间的一种“情感纽带”，这种关系是在战时同盟、共同价值观和对彼此文化的惺惺相惜中得来的。

圣母院始建于12、13世纪，在1844到1864年间进行了最彻底的一次整修，当时建筑师让-巴蒂斯特-安托万·拉索斯(Jean-Baptiste-Antoine Lassus)和欧仁·维奥莱-勒-杜克(Eugène Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc)重修了尖顶和飞扶壁，做了一些建筑细节修改。

那次整修之前的几十年，此地疏于管理，且在法国大革命中遭到部分损毁，维克多·雨果的1831年小说《巴黎圣母院》给它带来了一些关注，其中就提到了建筑的破败状况。

Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, and a longtime advocate for veterans, said she planned to look into the agency’s decision.","“It’s just reckless and sloppy,” said Walter M. Shaub Jr., a former director of the Office of Government Ethics, said of the agency’s action. He questioned why such a blanket exception for more than 330,000 agency employees should exist when the law allows waivers for individuals or even classes of individuals, like those teaching courses. Invoking the waiver also requires public hearings, he said.

Most troubling to Mr. Shaub, now senior counsel at the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center, is that the move seems like an attempt by the executive branch to overrule the legislative branch. “They are saying the statute is unreasonable, but that’s not for them to say,” he said of agency officials.

Curtis Cashour, a V.A. spokesman, said officials had focused on the ethics law after the agency’s inspector general investigated complaints this year that two V.A. employees were teaching at a for-profit institution. There were no significant conflicts and a waiver was ultimately granted, he said, but the report led to worries among many employees about the impact of more rigorous enforcement.

“Our response was aimed at easing the concerns of numerous V.A. employees,” Mr. Cashour said in an email, adding that the ethics law had been superseded by subsequent conflict-of-interest statutes.

One concern of critics is that officials at the organization’s upper levels could be making decisions about a college in which they have a financial interest, like permitting a school with a record of abuses to recruit at military bases. Another is that people advising veterans about their educational benefits could steer students to a particular school because they were on the payroll.

“There’s no good that can come from allowing colleges to have unseemly financial entanglements with V.A. employees,” Carrie Wofford, director of Veterans Education Success, a nonprofit advocacy group. “Congress enacted a zero tolerance for financial conflicts of interest for V.A. employees precisely because Congress uncovered massive fraud by for-profit colleges targeting veterans.”

She added that “student veterans were already facing an aggressive rollback of their protections under the Trump administration’s Education Department.”

Two months ago, the Republican-led Senate Appropriations Committee issued a report during its debate over the military budget instructing the department to review the statute — but its concern was that the current rules “may be inadequate to identify conflicts of interest that can develop” because of gifts or expensive meals.

Veterans are particularly valuable as potential students: There are limits on the federal funds that for-profit schools can receive, but money from the G.I. Bill is not counted.

Even before last year’s presidential election, some of the biggest veterans and military organizations were urging the department to better monitor for-profit colleges that were misleading veterans about the costs and benefits of enrolling, and violating legal and regulatory standards.

And a report issued in July by the director of the agency’s Education Service found that financial issues involving tuition and fees were by far the leading complaint among students who had called the agency’s G.I. Bill hotline since 2014.

Some ethics experts disagreed with the department’s contention that other federal statutes made the ethics law unnecessary, saying the agency’s rule sets a higher bar, requiring, for example, more public review.

Dozens of other agencies also have supplemental ethics rules that have been written to address potential problems specific to those agencies.

Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, and a longtime advocate for veterans, said she planned to look into the agency’s decision. “I am deeply concerned the V.A. is opening the door for predatory for-profits to take advantage of men and women who have bravely served our country,” she said.",Veterans Agency Seeks to Scrap Ethics Law on For-Profit Colleges,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/29/business/veterans-affairs-ethics.html

It will also build an unspecified number of fast chargers along roadways, each of which will have several charge units.
ChargePoint, the largest installer of vehicle charging stations in the United States, plans to install 400-kilowatt sites in the coming months.
According to ChargePoint, 80 percent of vehicle charging is currently done at home, and industry executives argue that it’s wrong to think about charging electric cars in the way they envision filling up a gasoline or diesel vehicle.
“Electric vehicles are more like horses than gasoline cars,” said Mr. Romano of ChargePoint.","Two levels of charging are typically available in residential settings. Level 1 is a standard AC outlet that provides between 1 and 1.5 kilowatts of electricity. It takes a Level 1 charger about 30 hours to fully charge the electric version of the Ford Focus, which has a range of 115 miles. Level 2 uses a professionally installed charger connected to a 240-volt AC outlet — the kind used by some large appliances — and delivers between 7 and 9 kilowatts, lowering the charge time to about 5.5 hours.

Some commercial charging locations offer more advanced technology, employing so-called fast chargers. These offer about 50 kilowatts of DC power, enabling the same Ford Focus to reach 90 miles of range in 30 minutes (battery chemistry causes charging to go more slowly after a battery is 80 percent full). The electric carmaker Tesla has a proprietary “supercharger” for its vehicles that provides 120 kilowatts of power, adding 300 miles of range in 75 minutes.

A new generation of charging points, the first of which are being installed in Europe this year, offer 350 kilowatts of power. Such a jump would slash charging times to 10 to 15 minutes, depending on the vehicle’s range, according to Charlie Yankitis, director of business development for the German manufacturer Bosch’s electric vehicle unit. Elon Musk, Tesla’s founder, has hinted that charging at even faster rates was being studied.

Several companies are making big bets on the technology.

Electrify America, the Volkswagen subsidiary, is planning on installing such high-capacity chargers along highway corridors throughout the United States. It is investing $2 billion in electric vehicle charging infrastructure and education nationwide, $800 million of which is earmarked for California alone.

By the end of 2020, Electrify America plans to have built 350 Level 2 charging sites in urban areas in California, like workplaces and apartment buildings. It will also build an unspecified number of fast chargers along roadways, each of which will have several charge units. A further 540 are to be built elsewhere in the country in that time.

ChargePoint, the largest installer of vehicle charging stations in the United States, plans to install 400-kilowatt sites in the coming months. But its chief executive, Pasquale Romano, did not specify how many.

Similar pushes are being made elsewhere. In Europe, the German automotive giants BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen have joined with Ford in a joint venture to install 350-kilowatt chargers across the Continent. They will start installing them this year, initially planning to get 400 fast-charging sites up and running, with “thousands” in place by 2020.

“We’re looking for similar solutions across the globe,” said Mike Tinskey, Ford’s global director of electrification and infrastructure.

There are, however, hurdles that need to be overcome.

For one, standards differ across manufacturers and regions. Today’s commercial chargers use three different kinds of plugs that are not entirely compatible. In practice, a Chevrolet, Nissan or Volkswagen cannot be charged at a Tesla charger. A Tesla, however, can use an adapter plug to charge at standard commercial stations, and Electrify America says its charging stations will be compatible with a variety of plugs.

Another issue: No vehicle on the road today is able to use the 350-kilowatt fast-charging stations. It is not a simple upgrade: High-speed charging requires thicker cables that won’t get too hot.

No automakers have indicated when they will sell cars equipped to accept such fast charges. Porsche’s Mission E electric vehicle is expected to be available by 2020, and will be able to charge to a 250-mile range in 15 minutes, according to the carmaker. Electrify America and ChargePoint say they expect vehicles capable of accepting 350-killowatt chargers to be available by 2019.

Utilities will also have to upgrade their infrastructure, a change for which California is already preparing.

Under the state’s zero emission regulations, every manufacturer must sell a certain number of emission-free vehicles, calculated as a proportion of overall sales. Consequently, California has become the hub for the mass installation of fast charging points. One of the state’s utility companies, Southern California Edison, estimates that 25 percent of its network must be upgraded to support new chargers.

“We hope we’ll be ready for fast charging when Electrify America is ready to install it,” said Caroline Choi, the utility’s senior vice president of regulatory affairs.

For now, the number of charging stations remains relatively low. According to the Department of Energy, there are just over 16,000 public electric vehicle charging points in the United States, offering about 44,000 individual outlets of varying charging speeds. By comparison, there are 120,000 gas stations nationwide, many of which have 10 or more pumps.

So customers will have to stick to charging an electric vehicle whenever it’s not being used, much as they already do with smartphones and tablets.

According to ChargePoint, 80 percent of vehicle charging is currently done at home, and industry executives argue that it’s wrong to think about charging electric cars in the way they envision filling up a gasoline or diesel vehicle.

Not a big fan of fantasy, although I’m O.K. with some science fiction.

In the end, we’re balancing.”By January, the engineering department had scheduled station maintenance around the Moynihan project on 116 weeks.
“Amtrak will assume a much greater aggressive posture to address critical reliability issues at Penn Station at all times,” Ms. Leeds said.","Charles W. Moorman, the co-chief executive, said in an interview that he was not aware of any upkeep postponed at the station, though he acknowledged it could have happened before he arrived at Amtrak a year ago. He cautioned that managers who pushed for certain repairs or improvements to get priority might not have known about all the other issues that were considered more pressing. “I would not let anything ever be deferred in terms of maintenance that I thought would then create any kind of safety problem or operating problem,” Mr. Moorman said.

But, he added, Amtrak had long regarded disrupting weekday service as anathema, and that practice hampered its ability to carry out station improvement projects. “We just got to a point this year,” he said, referring to the summer shutdown of multiple tracks, where Amtrak “needed to accelerate the work inside the station, and that’s exactly what we did.”

Amtrak executives said that the summer repairs were a success — accomplishing in weeks what otherwise might have taken months or years — and hinted that the railroad might try that method again.

After full service at Penn Station was restored early last month, the chairman of Amtrak, Anthony R. Coscia, said a backlog of repairs might mean future shutdowns and disruptions. “We’ve got a lot more work to do, and there’s a lot to catch up on,” he said at a business gathering. “The work we’ve done is hardly the cure for everything that ails Penn Station.”

But the railroad will still have to balance competing demands. Because only a limited number of tracks can be taken out of service at once in Penn Station, any priority given to one project affects what can be accomplished on another.

Amtrak, which owns the station and leases space to other transit operators, regularly granted priority shutdown time in recent years for work on the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s $10.1 billion effort to connect the Long Island Rail Road with Grand Central Terminal — a project that would ease the burden on Penn’s tracks. Amtrak also gave track time to Brookfield Properties, a private development company, as it erected a high rise.

On the west side of the station, the largest amount of shutdown time went to the conversion of the James A. Farley Post Office Building, near Penn, into the Moynihan Station passenger hall.

Contractors for the project were not working on the tracks themselves, but rails had to be taken out of service as they reinforced columns and girders for a new concourse and completed other tasks over or near the tracks. The project received about 2,200 weekend hours of track time affecting that area, a thicket of intensely used rails, from December 2013 to March 2017, according to a Times analysis of previously undisclosed Amtrak records. Amtrak’s crews got about 1,800 weekend hours.

Experts say the heavy repair jobs that keep a complex station operating smoothly require longer shutdowns — 24 to 55 hours during which crews of up to 20 work continuously. In the past three years, Amtrak got half as many of those work periods as the hall renovation did.

An Amtrak spokeswoman, Christina Leeds, said that the amount of track time given to the Moynihan project did not prevent Amtrak from working on Penn Station’s west side and that the railroad chose to focus instead on repairing other areas of the station.

Development Took Priority Over Major Repairs

At the same time, wooden ties at two key intersections on the station’s west side were becoming weaker. On April 3, one set of ties gave way under New Jersey Transit No. 3926, sending three 130,000-pound cars hurtling off the tracks, injuring three people and causing nearly $1 million in damage. The timbers that caused the accident had been flagged for replacement in September last year, Amtrak acknowledged. Ms. Leeds said Amtrak workers installed plates and fasteners — short-term fixes — to shore up the tracks, but did not anticipate that the ties would fail so soon.

On July 6, another set of ties broke under New Jersey Transit No. 3276, just north of where the April derailment occurred, disrupting traffic yet again and cementing the impression among commuters that Penn Station was falling apart. Records show that in November 2016, Amtrak had known that the steel and timbers in the intersection were worn and had planned to begin replacing the intersection on July 14 — eight days after the accident.

Representatives of the Moynihan renovation blamed Amtrak for not keeping up with maintenance.

“As Amtrak owns Penn Station, they are solely responsible for its tracks and platforms — and the failure to complete necessary and critical work is the symptom of decades of underinvestment and neglect, not the result of any one project,” said Amy Varghese, spokeswoman for Empire State Development, which is overseeing the Moynihan project.

‘Like No Other Place’

Penn Station is notoriously difficult to maintain. “It is like no other place I have ever seen,” said Mr. Moorman, the Amtrak co-chief executive. “It is the most complex and difficult place to work that you can imagine.”

Clearances are minimal around the 107-year-old track system, making it a challenge to replace worn timbers and steel. Some of the switches that route trains from one set of tracks to another must be custom made, taking a year or more. And the number of New Jersey Transit, Long Island Rail Road and Amtrak riders who pass through Penn Station each weekday — more than 600,000 on about 1,300 trains — is triple the number it was designed for.

No part of Penn Station is harder to maintain than the snarl of tracks between the Hudson River tunnel and the station’s 11 platforms, an area known as Interlocking A. With a series of switches that guide trains between the station and New Jersey, the area is “basically a track maintainer’s job security or nightmare, depending on how you look at it,” said David B. Clarke, a veteran rail engineer who runs the Center for Transportation Research at the University of Tennessee.

After Joseph H. Boardman took over as Amtrak president in 2008, three derailments in Interlocking A and delays caused by other infrastructure failures led him to institute a program aimed at preventing future accidents. Beginning in 2014, workers cataloged the locations and replacement dates of hundreds of track parts in Penn Station and identified jobs that needed to be done, according to records and interviews.

“I didn’t want any defect that could derail a train,” Mr. Boardman said.

Crews had begun working through the list by the time he retired in September 2016, but had yet to replace major sections of track in Interlocking A.

The work would require four huge chunks of intersecting tracks to be removed and their replacements to be assembled outside the station, hauled in and installed using heavy machinery. The work would take much longer than the typical Amtrak repair job, but it was much needed, maintenance officials said. The engineering department planned to begin the work in January this year.

As contractors were finishing a new concourse in the former post office’s basement, Mr. Cuomo was intent on moving ahead with the project’s next phase: transforming the main level into a shop-filled atrium for riders of Amtrak and the Long Island Rail Road.

Ms. Leeds, the Amtrak spokeswoman, said the Moynihan project was also important to Amtrak. “Our responsibility — after ensuring safety — is to do more than simply renew our assets; it is also to improve them,” she said. “And that the experience at Penn Station must be improved is one of the few universally held opinions of all New Yorkers.”

Mr. Boardman, who signed the original agreement prioritizing the renovation, said Amtrak officials had gone along with the project over the years but were “never that excited about it.”

He said he agreed to the work because it was pushed by the federal Department of Transportation under the Obama administration. Amtrak, with its quasi-public status and reliance on congressional appropriations, must remain attuned to politics, he said. “We understood we were beholden to everybody as Amtrak: the states, the federal government. If we didn’t work with them, we wouldn’t get the support we needed.”

In recent years, a high priority for Amtrak has been finding funding for the Gateway program — an infrastructure plan that would add a Hudson River tunnel into Penn Station and cost tens of billions of dollars — and the railroad has sought to enlist Mr. Cuomo’s help in securing the money. (The governor met with President Trump last month to push for the project and afterward described the session as “productive” but “inconclusive.”)

Tensions Simmer

The first of the four major replacement jobs in Interlocking A wrapped up in late February. Before crews could begin on the second, Amtrak executives told them the work might have to wait. Managers overseeing the Moynihan project had asked for a significant amount of priority track time, the executives said, and Amtrak was thinking about giving it to them.

Amtrak’s engineering managers bridled, according to Mr. Holt and other former employees. The chief engineer, Rodrigo Bitar, argued with officials and vented his frustrations to his staff, Mr. Holt said. Mr. Bitar, who resigned in June, declined to comment.

In March, Mr. Keefe, the head of the track department, voiced his concerns to executives.

Mr. Moorman said no final decision had been made about delaying the track work for Moynihan before the derailments started on March 24. But he acknowledged the tensions with the engineering department. “I think they were concerned that at some point it would impede their ability to do safety-critical work,” Mr. Moorman said of the Moynihan project. “Which turned out not to be the case, but I think that was their concern, and a legitimate concern.”

It was a worry born of frustration, Mr. Holt said. “You can go back years and say the track department didn’t get what it needs to keep things up to snuff,” he said.

Competition for track time at Penn was sometimes so fierce it devolved into shouting matches, according to former employees who regularly attended weekly scheduling meetings. Engineering supervisors jockeyed for time for electrical, signal and track repairs, while also competing with contractors seeking time for development projects.

The officials who schedule trains are supposed to make the final decision. But sometimes the outcome is decided by a call from Washington. Scot Naparstek, Amtrak’s chief operating officer, said it was not unusual for managers of different projects to call Amtrak’s headquarters and plead their cases with him or other top executives. Representatives of the Moynihan project said that Amtrak executives rarely objected when pressed for more track time. Ms. Leeds said Amtrak “aggressively pushed back” on requests that the railroad considered unreasonable.

“Everybody believes that their project is priority,” Mr. Naparstek said. “Our goal is to try to do our best to satisfy everybody. In the end, we’re balancing.”

By January, the engineering department had scheduled station maintenance around the Moynihan project on 116 weeks. A Times analysis of weekend track usage records from the past three years showed that Moynihan contractors got about 400 more hours on the west side of the station than Amtrak engineering crews did. Contractors also did work affecting Interlocking A on at least 27 occasions when Amtrak did no work there at all.

During that time, records show, some maintenance tasks were not completed in the area until long after they were first identified. One document from February 2016 listed steel parts that were years past their initial replacement dates. Two were assessed as 5s on an Amtrak rating system described in internal engineering documents, meaning that they were in critical condition and at “risk of imminent failure.” Ten were assessed as 4s, meaning that they were in poor condition.

Ms. Leeds said inspectors often examine such parts and decide they are less worn than was expected, so their use is extended.

Early last year, after planned work on a complicated switch in Interlocking A was delayed, a manager in the track department, Tim Cochran, expressed frustration to Mr. Keefe and others. “If we don’t start getting work done in the station, we’re going to wreck,” he said, two people in the meeting recalled. Mr. Cochran, who left Amtrak this year, declined to comment.

Ms. Leeds acknowledged that contractors spent many hours working on the Moynihan project but added that the engineering department had other priorities than working in Interlocking A in recent years, such as fixing the East River tunnels that were damaged by Hurricane Sandy.

Citing the derailments caused by broken tracks, Augustine F. Ubaldi, a railroad engineering expert who began his career inspecting Penn Station for the Penn Central railroad in the 1970s, said it was clear that Amtrak did not spend enough time working in Interlocking A. “There’s no way to deny that,” he said.

Persistent Pressures

Amtrak wrapped up the emergency repairs to Penn Station on Sept. 5, but much work remains to be done, and the pressure to share time and work space is not going away. As the Moynihan project enters its second phase, maintenance crews at the transit hub will have to schedule work around it for at least the next two years.

Ms. Leeds, the Amtrak spokeswoman, said that the railroad was planning its repair work through next year and that it hoped to accomplish most of it during weekend shutdowns. Still, Amtrak executives have said that they would close tracks during the week as needed. “Amtrak will assume a much greater aggressive posture to address critical reliability issues at Penn Station at all times,” Ms. Leeds said.

Looking back, Mr. Boardman, the former Amtrak president, said the railroad probably tried to do too much at once inside Penn Station, juggling multiple development projects and the railroad’s repair work.

“Would we have prioritized it differently?” he asked. “Well, we would have.”","Before Derailments at Penn Station, Competing Priorities Led to Disrepair",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/09/nyregion/amtrak-penn-station-derailments.html

“Twitter is a wonderful thing for me, because I get the word out,” he said in a March interview with Fox News. “I might not be here talking to you right now as president if I didn’t have an honest way of getting the word out.”

But if the president’s tweets are the Digital Age version of quips at the Rose Garden podium, what then are we to make of the deletions?

The president regularly deletes tweets with typos and misspellings. Less frequently, but not unheard-of, are erasures that pertain to more significant topics. In March, he posted and deleted a tweet that read: “Meeting with Generals at Mar-a-Lago in Florida. Very interesting!”

At least two government watchdog groups, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and the National Security Archive, believe that when Mr. Trump deletes a tweet he may be breaking the law.

The groups filed a lawsuit in June against Mr. Trump and the Executive Office of the President, claiming that deleting social media posts violates the Presidential Records Act, a law that requires presidential communications to be archived. The groups are also suing to require White House staff members to archive material sent through encrypted messaging apps, such as WhatsApp and Signal.",Trump Deletes Tweets Supporting Luther Strange,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/us/politics/trump-deletes-tweets.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Mr. Pence framed the issue as one of patriotism and respect.","While politicians from both parties concoct situations for political gain, some criticized Mr. Pence’s walkout as transparently premeditated. The vice president did not take a pool reporter traveling with him into the stadium; a member of Mr. Pence’s staff told the reporter, Vaughn Hillyard, that the vice president might be leaving the game early.

“Manipulation of faux patriotism took new turn today with VP Pence. Preplanned early exit from Colts game after 49ers kneeled, then tweets,” Norman Ornstein, a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, wrote on Twitter.

Others pointed out the expense involved: Mr. Pence flew to Indianapolis from Las Vegas, where he had attended a memorial service for victims of last Sunday’s mass shooting, and was immediately flying back to Los Angeles.

“After all the scandals involving unnecessarily expensive travel by cabinet secretaries, how much taxpayer money was wasted on this stunt?” Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, said in a tweet.

There was little doubt, given the presence of the 49ers, that Mr. Pence would be given an opportunity to make his political statement. The former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick began the dispute over the national anthem last year by taking a knee to highlight the plight of black Americans, particularly the killing of black men by police officers.

Mr. Kaepernick left the 49ers in March and has not been signed by any other team — a situation seen by many as a blacklisting by other team owners. But other 49ers have continued the protest in a show of solidarity with their former teammate.

Last month, Mr. Trump seized on the dispute over Mr. Kaepernick, declaring at a rally in Alabama that any “son of a bitch” who refused to stand for the anthem should be “fired.” His comments led hundreds of players to protest during the anthem, though last weekend the furor appeared to be subsiding a bit.

The White House seemed determined to whip it up again. In addition to Mr. Pence’s statement and tweets, the press office released a photo of Mr. Pence in a suit, standing with his hand over his heart for the playing of “The Star-Spangled Banner” at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis. He was standing next to Maj. Gen. Courtney P. Carr, a veteran of the Iraq war who now serves as adjutant general of the Indiana National Guard.

An earlier tweet by the vice president, in which he said that he and his wife, Karen Pence, were looking forward to the game, showed him wearing a Colts cap and casual clothing. He said he was there to honor Peyton Manning, the longtime Colts quarterback whose statue was unveiled in Indianapolis this weekend, and who was set to have his number retired into the team’s ring of honor at halftime.

The vice president’s office later said that the photo had actually been taken in 2014, when Mr. Pence was governor of Indiana.

In the West Wing, officials privately said they believed that Mr. Pence had sought the controversy, which is a favorite of the president’s and which he had voiced his approval of. It came less than two weeks after Mr. Pence’s chief of staff, Nick Ayers, told a group of Republican donors that there might need to be a “purge” of the party if people did not get behind the president.

Two weeks ago, Mr. Trump had called for fans to walk out of stadiums if players knelt. So Mr. Pence was doing what Mr. Trump had called for, though few fans seem to have followed his call.

Mr. Pence has found himself on the other side of this kind of protest. Shortly after the election, he attended a Broadway performance of “Hamilton,” the hit musical about the founding fathers, and received a polite lecture from a member of the cast, after the curtain call, on the need for the Trump administration to work on behalf of all Americans.

“We truly hope that this show has inspired you to uphold our American values,” Brandon Victor Dixon, the actor playing Vice President Aaron Burr, said from the stage.

Mr. Pence seemed unperturbed, but Mr. Trump reacted angrily, saying the cast had “harassed” the vice president-elect and owed him an apology.

In the weeks since Mr. Trump complained about players kneeling during the anthem, most have returned to standing, though some continue to kneel, particularly on the 49ers. While the 49ers knelt, the Colts locked arms as a team on Sunday.

In Detroit, the Lions stood arm in arm, including two players who had knelt the past two weeks. In New Jersey, the Giants defensive end Olivier Vernon, who was in street clothes, knelt while the rest of his team linked arms.

In Miami, three members of the Dolphins — Kenny Stills, Julius Thomas and Mike Thomas — stayed in the locker room while the rest of their team stood on the sideline during the anthem.

The Dolphins’ owner, Stephen M. Ross, who has backed the players’ right to protest, appeared to be changing his stance. He told The Miami Herald that while many players insisted that their protests were about raising awareness of social injustice, the president had “changed that whole paradigm of what protest is” by turning it into a proxy for respect for the flag and support of the military.

Mr. Kaepernick, meanwhile, has been working out privately in New Jersey in hopes of finding a team willing to take a chance on him, according to a CBS report.

Mr. Pence framed the issue as one of patriotism and respect.

“At a time when so many Americans are inspiring our nation with their courage, resolve and resilience, now, more than ever, we should rally around our flag and everything that unites us,” he said in a statement. “While everyone is entitled to their own opinions, I don’t think it’s too much to ask N.F.L. players to respect the flag and our national anthem.”",Trump Tells Pence to Leave N.F.L.

Mastodons, rhinoceroses and saber-toothed cats once roamed Southern California.

We know because of the bones and footprints they left behind in places like Rainbow Basin, in the Calico Mountains just north of Barstow.

Administered by the Bureau of Land Management, the area owes its name to the pink, green, orange and brown sediments that form the basin’s walls.

Over eons, tectonic forces and erosion have lifted the rock and exposed zigzagging strata, made colorful by differing stages of iron oxidation.

It’s a mecca for geologists.

“It’s quite spectacular,” said Robert Hilburn, a Barstow paleontologist. “People come from all over the United States and sometimes all over the world.”

Rainbow Basin was once a lush marshland populated by a unique array of prehistoric animals whose fossils remain scattered across what is now a parched desert.

“Everything that you have on the African savanna today, they had here — except one,” said Mr. Hilburn, who is also vice president of the Mojave River Valley Museum.

Which one? “No man,” he said.

Rainbow Basin is accessible to visitors at the end of a long dirt road. You can walk miles of trails or stay at nearby campsite.

In a telephone interview, Dan Brown said that he’s “always looking for big themes,” and when he first heard the mass performed in 2011 at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Mass., “it got me thinking about creationism and this sort of battle between science and religion.”

He followed the idea until it became “Origin,” a thriller — starring his signature protagonist, the Harvard “symbologist” Robert Langdon — about a brazen scientist whose discovery about the source of life on Earth and the future of humanity threatens to upend the world’s religious order.

“Missa Charles Darwin” appears late in the book, after a wild night for Langdon that begins with a clandestine encounter inside a Richard Serra sculpture and ends at a computing center that holds the key to life’s origins. He enters the center and hears Gregory’s “Christian-style mass,” in which devout voices take their place alongside a celebration of natural selection.

“This piece of art that fuses science and religion and makes them beautiful — I thought at that point in the novel, it was just this moment when you needed to rest and see that these two can intertwine,” Dan Brown said.

Spirituality and science often did overlap as the Brown brothers grew up. Their father, a math teacher, was an Escher obsessive who told them folk stories about clever mathematicians, and they turned pages for their mother, a church organist who provided Gregory’s first exposure to sacred music. He, in turn, began college as an aspiring scientist, and traveled to the Galápagos Islands, where he was awe-struck by a vermilion flycatcher and Lonesome George, the last known tortoise of his species.

“You get the sense that it hasn’t changed much since Darwin was there,” he said.

Studying geology also gave him a sense of the planet’s long, slow timeline. He ended up with “this feeling about time and our place on Earth that I’d never had before,” he said, which works its way into the “Credo” movement of “Missa Charles Darwin.”

Halfway through college, he had a change of heart and pursued music. He later sang at Westminster Choir College and wrote vocal works that put him in contact with the Grammy-nominated quartet New York Polyphony, which gave the mass’s first performance in 2011.

Craig Phillips, the group’s bass, first had the idea for “Missa Charles Darwin” and said he was inspired by “just how beautiful, lyrical and poetic” the prose is in “On the Origin of Species.”

Mr. Phillips culled the text from Darwin’s writings. “It’s almost built for a musical setting,” he said. “It’s so lofty and majestic.”

Dan Brown didn’t tell his brother that the mass had made its way into “Origin” until he finished writing the chapter. He said that when he asked Gregory to give it a read — they are often sounding boards for each other — “he came back sort of wide-eyed.”

Gregory gave his blessing, with a slight correction to how the music was described. Then he realized what kind of exposure this appearance in the novel could provide.

“Within 24 hours wheels started turning for what this might do,” Dan Brown said. In the end, any money his brother makes from New York Polyphony’s recently reissued recording of “Missa Charles Darwin” will be donated to music education programs.

While there were female journalists in Vietnam, Ms. Leroy was the only woman photographer after Chapelle’s death, and faced resistance from the military and male journalists.

She was also the only female photojournalist then working in Vietnam, after the death of Dickey Chapelle, who was killed by a grenade in 1965.

Now a selection of those letters are featured on a new website, accompanied by some of her archive and details from her life. It will be followed by the documentary “Cathy at War” by the writer and filmmaker Jacques Menasche.

Most of the letters are to her mother, Denise, focusing at first on topics that read like holiday postcards – gifts she hoped to send home, people she met, her tan. To her father, Jean, she wrote mostly about business — publications that bought her work, logistics and future plans. She frequently reassures them, noting in one letter to her mother that “if anything happens to me, you’ll be informed within 24 hours. So don’t worry if I sometimes leave you without any news.”

Her tone changed over time. In the early letters, she was unsure whether she should stay or go home, even as she felt less insecure about her technical skills. She spoke of the relationships she was forming with the military and about daily life. On Sept. 4, 1966, a few months after her initial arrival, she wrote to her mother:

I celebrated my 22nd birthday at the Da Nang press office in the company of lots of Marines. I had left Saigon a few days earlier with an AP reporter for an operation near the DMZ. On this occasion he opened a bottle of French champagne when we got back. I only got back last night, Saturday, very tired…I’m getting an iron reputation with the marines. I’m very proud of it. I’m leaving tomorrow, Tuesday, morning for the Delta. Subject: a village a few days from the election. The war seems to be calming down, as always happens just before political events. The Delta is the key region. I’ll stay there two or three days. After that, I don’t know. I’m preparing a few photos of me taken in various locations and will send them to you. I haven’t forgotten your wig, I’ll take care of it too. Don’t be angry with me. I’m always away: back in Saigon for two days, get something cleaned, tidy up, wash, everything is dirty.

As her confidence grew, she wrote about her professional successes. But the letters also showed low moments, like being unable to get the pictures she wanted in the field or leaving an envelope of her best prints in a taxi after fending off a robbery attempt from the driver.

The letters testify to the challenges women encountered in the field. While there were female journalists in Vietnam, Ms. Leroy was the only woman photographer after Chapelle’s death, and faced resistance from the military and male journalists. Robert Pledge, president of the board of the Catherine Leroy Fund, a not-for-profit organization in Paris dedicated to her work, said many prominent photojournalists questioned why a young woman wanted to cover war.

She wrote about how people were nice when they first thought she was an unintimidating, five-foot-tall, pigtailed girl. But when they realized she was a serious photographer, their opinions changed. “Many were very, very negative and very nasty with her,” said Mr. Pledge, who is also co-founder and director of Contact Press Images.

Writing to her father on May 13, 1967, after noting her successes in being published in leading magazines, she marveled how “I’m getting telegrams from people who I didn’t know existed for years, while at the same time I’m hated more than ever by known and unknown enemies in Saigon, American civilians, as well as servicemen in Saigon.”

One photographer told Mr. Pledge that the male photographers “were really nasty chauvinistic pigs.” That same photographer, who now is a filmmaker, called her late in life to apologize.

Still, she found the opportunities available to her in Vietnam surpassed anything back home in France. Like parachuting with the 173rd Airborne Brigade — the 85th jump she had taken in her life, after receiving her parachuting license as a teenager.

“I am the first woman to jump in Vietnam during this first operational jump by American parachutists since the war began,” she wrote to her father on Feb. 23, 1967. “I’m very proud to have jumped with the Americans here, it’s a big professional success in every way. I now know that I will be able to work in the United Sates one day without too much problem.” She wrote how she planned to submit her work to major competitions. “I’ve always thought I should succeed because I never gave in,” she continued.

Many consider Ms. Leroy as the most daring of all photographers in Vietnam, and she most likely spent the most time in combat because she needed the money. Being broke meant traveling with soldiers, sharing rations and sleeping in the countryside.

As Mr. Pledge noted, “If Robert Capa was saying that it’s not good enough because it’s not close enough — she was very close.”

THURSDAY PUZZLE — Do you ever feel your jaw immediately hit the ground the moment you look at a grid for the first time? Well, that was certainly the case for me today. Joe Krozel has been known to create some inventive puzzles in the past, and this one was no exception.

There’s a black square pattern resembling an animal in the grid’s center, and yet, the triple-stacked, nine-letter answers in the top-left corner make it appear to be themeless. And those orphaned five letters at 35A? What exactly is going on?

Today’s Theme

Turns out that Mr. Krozel wants us to put on our blindfolds to understand this theme. The revealer, 44D, indicates that the figure in the center is a PIÑATA. This also explains the black squares that connect to it; they represent the piñata’s thread.

Yet how are we supposed to nail 35A without any crossings to check? Take a look at the notepad accompanying the puzzle:

“Two letters of the alphabet are missing from the main, connected portion of the completed grid. What are they? The answer goes, appropriately, at 35-Across.”

A thorough scan of the grid conveys that every letter of the alphabet has been used at least once except for C and Y. Hold up. C. AND. Y. CANDY!

They sent the company scrambling to do damage control, with Bob Weinstein outlining the fallout in an email to Mr. Weinstein’s legal adviser, Lisa Bloom.

“The Democrats are giving Harvey’s money back,” he wrote on Friday morning, referring to politicians who were unloading political contributions they had received from Mr. Weinstein to women’s groups. “Women’s rights organizations are offended by his actions and are now calling for him to be fired. Actors and actresses in the community are appalled at Harvey and have gone on the record as such.”

The situation was complicated by Harvey Weinstein’s response to the Times article, swinging wildly between contrition and attack. In a statement on Thursday, he acknowledged that “the way I’ve behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologize for it,” while likening his personal flaws to those of the rapper Jay-Z, who apologized on his most recent album to his wife, Beyoncé, for cheating on her.

Mr. Weinstein said he was planning to get help, but within hours, he had threatened to sue The Times for defamation. And in her own statement released on Thursday, Ms. Bloom said Mr. Weinstein “denies many of the accusations as patently false.”

Ms. Bloom told the company’s board on Thursday that Mr. Weinstein was planning to follow through with a lawsuit, and that board members could expect “more and different reporting” that would include “photos of several of the accusers in very friendly poses with Harvey after his alleged misconduct.”

Mr. Maerov voiced anger in an email response to Ms. Bloom, saying her approach and public comments were “definitely fanning the flames and compounding the problem” and contending that she had a conflict of interest because Mr. Weinstein had agreed to turn a book she wrote into a TV series.

“This is not the time for Harvey or TWC to appear defiant or indignant,” he wrote, using an abbreviation for the Weinstein Company. “It is time to repair, heal, accept responsibility and recover.”

He wrote that “publishing pictures of victims in friendly poses with Harvey will backfire as it suggests they are exculpatory or negate any harm done to them through alleged actions.”

Bob Weinstein put it this way in his email to Ms. Bloom: “Perhaps, Harvey as he stated in the NY Times, to the world, should get professional help for a problem that really exists.”

On Saturday, Ms. Bloom resigned as an adviser to Mr. Weinstein. She offered no explanation, saying only that it was her understanding “that Mr. Weinstein and his board are moving toward an agreement.”

She said in an interview Saturday afternoon that there was a large team handling Mr. Weinstein’s defense and that she personally “did not release photos of accusers” to the news media. She also denied that her work with Mr. Weinstein created a conflict of interest.

Mr. Weinstein also parted ways with another adviser, Lanny Davis, a lawyer and crisis counselor who served as special counsel to President Bill Clinton. He and Mr. Weinstein had disagreed over how to handle the sexual harassment allegations, with Mr. Davis advising a more conciliatory approach than Mr. Weinstein seemed willing to adopt.

In recent days, other women have gone public with accusations of sexual misconduct by Mr. Weinstein, including a former news anchor who said he had trapped her in the hallway of a restaurant that was closed to the public and masturbated in front of her.

For decades, Mr. Weinstein had cultivated an image as a liberal power broker, raising money for Hillary Clinton, briefly employing Malia Obama as an intern and calling himself an advocate for women. President Trump, who has himself been accused of making unwelcome advances toward women, told reporters on Saturday that he had known Mr. Weinstein “for a long time” and was “not at all surprised to see” the reports.

For the past week, many women in Hollywood, frustrated with an industry that seems stuck perpetually sexualizing and mistreating women, had been watching closely to see where the Weinstein revelations would lead.

“I see this as a tipping point,” Jenni Konner, executive producer of the HBO series “Girls,” said on Sunday. “This is the moment we look back on and say, ‘That’s when it all started to change.’”

The firing of Mr. Weinstein by his own company, Ms. Konner said, “is going to scare any man in Hollywood using his power for anything but making movies and television.”",Harvey Weinstein Is Fired After Sexual Harassment Reports,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/08/business/harvey-weinstein-fired.html

At an appearance in New York that was also webcast, Mr. Hackett acknowledged that the company faced significant challenges. “The decision to change is not easy — culturally or operationally,” he said, adding that the approaches that have brought success in the past “are really no guarantee of future success” as the industry is reshaped.

An immediate area of emphasis will be connected vehicles, which collect data about their operations and surroundings that can be used to improve safety and provide new digital services. “Our vehicles will be smart and connected,” Mr. Hackett said.

By 2019, all new Ford models in the United States will be able to transmit data back to the company or its business partners, a step toward creating mobility services like ride-hailing and traffic avoidance. The company is planning a similar rollout in China. By 2020, 90 percent of all new models, regardless of market, will offer such connectivity.

As part of that push, Ford is developing software that will enable vehicles to communicate with one another and with sensors along roadways and in traffic lights.

Ford’s initiatives come as the industry’s incumbents are scrambling to match outsiders like Tesla, Google and Uber, who are making big advances in automotive technology. On Monday, General Motors presented a plan to introduce 20 all-electric models by 2023, including two in the next 18 months.

In addition to revisiting its development priorities, Mr. Hackett vowed that Ford would become more efficient, cutting billions in material costs and engineering expenses over the next five years. Ford has average profit margins of about 6 percent in recent years, short of its goal of 8 percent. “That’s not good enough,” Mr. Hackett said.

Mr. Hackett, a former chief executive of the office furniture manufacturer Steelcase, joined Ford’s board in 2013 and its executive ranks last year. His predecessor as chief, Mark Fields, had come under pressure because of a decline in profits and a sagging stock price.

While Mr. Fields was a polished salesman and marketer, the company struggled to plot a course as the industry was reshaped by electric vehicles, autonomous technology and ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft.

It was a reversal of fortune for Ford, which had been the only one of the three Detroit automakers to escape bankruptcy as the recession and financial crisis set in.

When he arrived, Mr. Hackett promised to review all of Ford’s businesses and operations, and prepare a plan within about 100 days for improving its “fitness” and strategic direction. Since then, he has said little in public.

In June, Mr. Hackett announced that Ford would import a new version of its Focus small car from China. Ford had planned to build a $1.5 billion plant in Mexico but canceled it in January after it met stiff opposition from Donald J. Trump, then the president-elect.

In the four and a half months since Mr. Hackett’s ascent, Ford has elevated its share price by 14 percent, including 2 percent in Tuesday’s trading session. But in the same period, G.M.’s shares have risen 33 percent, and Fiat Chrysler’s are up 71 percent.

Ford reported net income of $2.04 billion in the quarter that ended June 30, an increase of almost 4 percent from the same period a year ago. But the rise came mainly because of a big profit in its credit arm and a cut in its tax bill. Its auto operations in North America suffered a 19 percent drop in operating profit in the quarter.",Ford Chief Outlines Investment Shift Away From Passenger Cars,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/03/business/ford-chief.html

Among the hospital’s 937 forensic patients, there were 1,908 incidents of seclusion and restraint in 2014.","In 1996, when James was 20, the police responded to a frantic 911 call near the house where he lived with his mother. At the scene, the officers found a woman bloodied and in distress. She said that James had lured her inside for a housekeeping interview — and that he’d been screaming when he started ripping her clothes off and beating her. The cops later picked him up at his grandmother’s house, a few miles away. At the police station, James signed a statement saying he understood his rights. He waived the right to representation. He signed a confession. (He and his mother now claim that the confession was coerced and that he is innocent.) When doctors subsequently evaluated him, they found him so unstable that they ruled him incompetent to stand trial. He was remanded to a hospital for several months, then sent back to jail, where he regressed again, then sent back to the hospital for several more months, stabilized once again, then sent back to jail, where in preparation for his trial, he was returned to the hospital to be evaluated for mental illness. Doctors diagnosed borderline-personality disorder, his mother says — which enabled him to plead “not responsible by reason of insanity.”

James says that he understood the plea he took. In the abstract sense, he did. But the specifics of it were as mysterious to him and his family as they are to most people. Before he was arrested, James and his mother were set to move to Georgia, where they had relatives, and where Ann had friends and a job lined up. After his plea deal, Ann says, she “put everything on hold,” for what she thought would be a few years.

Instead, James, now in his 40s, has been in the hospital for almost two decades. This isn’t because he was sentenced to 20 years, or to 25. He was not sentenced at all; he is technically, legally, not responsible. The court believes beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed the act he was accused of, a prerequisite for the state to accept an insanity plea. The plea does not, however, prescribe or limit the duration of his stay. The laws that govern the practice of committing people who are acquitted because of mental illness dictate that they be hospitalized until they’re deemed safe to release to the public, no matter how long that takes.

James’s insanity acquittal placed him in an obscure, multibillion-dollar segment of domestic detention. According to a 2017 study conducted by the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors, more than 10,000 mentally ill Americans who haven’t been convicted of a crime — people who have been found not guilty by reason of insanity or who have been arrested but found incompetent to stand trial — are involuntarily confined to psychiatric hospitals. Even a contributor to the study concedes that no one knows the exact number. While seemingly every conceivable data point in America’s prison system is meticulously compiled, not much is known about the confinement of “forensic” patients, people committed to psychiatric hospitals by the criminal-justice system. No federal agency is charged with monitoring them. No national registry or organization tracks how long they have been incarcerated or why.

In 1992, the Supreme Court ruled, in Foucha v. Louisiana, that a forensic patient must be both mentally ill and dangerous in order to be hospitalized against his will. But in practice, “states have ignored Foucha to a pretty substantial degree,” says W. Lawrence Fitch, a consultant to the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors and former director of forensic services for Maryland’s Mental Hygiene Administration. “People are kept not because their dangerousness is because of mental illness. People stay in too long, and for the wrong reasons.”

Michael Bien, a lawyer who helped bring a successful lawsuit against the California prison system on behalf of prisoners with psychiatric illnesses, concurs. “Under constitutional law, they’re supposed to be incarcerated only if they’re getting treatment, and only if the treatment is likely to restore sanity,” he says. “You can’t just punish someone for having mental illness. But that’s happening.”

In the visiting room in New York that Sunday, as the hours went by, families came and went. Ann settled in. On James’s birthday, she brings a party: relatives, presents, a cake. And almost every week, on every visiting day, she and James try to make a life here together at the hospital — because it now seems possible that he could die there.

The insanity defense has been part of the American judicial system from its founding, carried over from our English forebears. British law has long reflected the moral sense that society has a duty not to punish people who can’t comprehend or control their crimes. But the insanity defense has always sat uneasily with the public, which tends to regard it as a means to escape justice. In the United States, such sentiments reached fever pitch in 1981, when a 25-year-old named John Hinckley Jr., hoping to win Jodie Foster’s heart, tried to assassinate President Reagan, wounding the president and three others, including James Brady, the White House press secretary, who was left permanently disabled. Hinckley was found not guilty by reason of insanity (N.G.R.I., as it is frequently abbreviated) and sent to St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington. The country was outraged. Dan Quayle, then a senator from Indiana, called the verdict “decadent” and said the insanity defense “pampered criminals.” His Senate colleague Strom Thurmond equated it to a free ride.

In fact, despite its reputation as a “get out of jail free” card, the insanity defense has never been an easy way out — or easy to get. After a defendant is charged, the defendant, her lawyer or a judge can request evaluation by a psychiatrist. A defendant may be found incompetent to stand trial and committed for rehabilitation if she isn’t stable enough or intellectually capable of participating in the proceedings. If she is rehabilitated, she may be tried; if she cannot be, she may languish in a psychiatric hospital for years or decades. But mental illness is not exculpatory in itself: A defendant may be found mentally ill and still competent enough to stand trial. At that point, the district attorney may offer an insanity plea — some 90 percent of N.G.R.I. verdicts are plea deals. If the district attorney doesn’t offer a plea, or the defendant doesn’t take it, the case goes to trial. The defendant may still choose insanity as a defense, but then her case will be decided by a jury.

If N.G.R.I. was always difficult to get, it became even harder after Hinckley. With the Insanity Defense Reform Act of 1984, Congress restricted the judicial definition of “insanity” to only the most severe cases. Some states — Idaho, Utah, Kansas and Montana — have eliminated the defense altogether. In trials in which it is attempted, doctors may disagree, and jurors are often influenced by emotional considerations. Today, only an estimated one-120th of 1 percent of contested felony cases end in a successful N.G.R.I. defense — that is, the prosecutor disputes the insanity defense, the case goes to trial and the jury finds the defendant not guilty by reason of insanity. In addition, the legal standards for “insanity” vary among states; some define it as a defendant’s inability to know the crime was wrong or the inability to act in accordance with the law, but most define it, post-Hinckley, as only the first of these. At the trial of James Holmes, who killed 12 people and injured 70 in a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., one psychiatrist testified that he was mentally ill but that he knew right from wrong and should be considered “sane.” Another testified that he was mentally ill and incapable of reason (and, by extension, guilt). All four who examined him agreed that he had some form of schizophrenia. Jurors rejected his insanity plea.

And when an N.G.R.I. defense does succeed, it tends to resemble a conviction more than an acquittal. N.G.R.I. patients can wind up with longer, not shorter, periods of incarceration, as they are pulled into a mental-health system that can be harder to leave than prison. In 1983, the Supreme Court ruled, in Jones v. the United States, that it wasn’t a violation of due process to commit N.G.R.I. defendants automatically and indefinitely, for the safety of the public. (Michael Jones, who was a paranoid schizophrenic, had been hospitalized since 1975, after pleading N.G.R.I. to petty larceny for trying to steal a jacket.) In almost all states, N.G.R.I. means automatic commitment to a psychiatric facility. In most states, like New York, there is no limit to the duration of that commitment. In the states that do have limits, like California, the limits are based on the maximum prison sentence for the offense, a model that belies the idea of hospitalization as treatment rather than punishment. As Suzanna Gee, an attorney with Disability Rights California (a protection and advocacy agency with counterparts in every state), points out, the law allows two-year extensions as patients approach a “top date,” the limit set on their confinement. And so, she says, “it can be extended in perpetuity.”

James’s mother, Ann, now knows the predicament of forensic confinement well. At some point during James’s stay at the state hospital, she became an advocate for mentally ill offenders. “It’s like a roach motel,” she says. “At least in prison, inmates know they’re leaving. Once you check into the hospital, it’s hard to check out.”

Though forensic detentions get little attention, they can range from ethically questionable to flagrantly unconstitutional and illegal. In 1983, a national study found that N.G.R.I. patients often lost their freedom for twice as long as those actually convicted of the same offense. A study of N.G.R.I. patients in seven states between 1976 and 1985 found that in four of those states, they were confined for less time than people who were found guilty, and that in three, they were confined for longer. Scant research, conducted decades ago, seems to constitute the most recent survey of the fate of the country’s forensic commitments.

“There’s not been a lot done,” Fitch says. The federal government doesn’t collect data on forensic patients’ lengths of stay, crimes or treatment. In some cases, neither do the state or local departments in charge of their custody. In 2015, I began collecting, via request or the Freedom of Information Act, all individual length-of-stay data by legal status that existed in each state and Washington. Colorado, Wyoming, Arkansas, Missouri, California, Maine, New Hampshire, Kentucky, Wisconsin, Delaware, New Jersey, Ohio and South Carolina said they simply didn’t have that information. Alabama may or may not: In response to repeated queries, it “decided not to release forensic data,” and hospital reports are excluded from its public-records law.

Many of the above states have reported legal status and average lengths of stay. In 2014, Fitch, on behalf of the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors, estimated, based on states’ self-reported average lengths of stay, that the national average for all N.G.R.I.s was around five to seven years. He says he finds that “horrendous,” given that civil commitments with the same diagnoses as forensic commitments can get out in under 30 days. There is no accepted body of research to suggest that lengthy institutionalization leads to better treatment outcomes. On the contrary, says Marthagem Whitlock, an assistant commissioner in Tennessee’s Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services, “The deeper penetration into the system usually means more complications for the individual.” There are, as Fitch acknowledges, “people who don’t respond to treatment or who refuse treatment.” But, he argues, “it should almost never be necessary to hospitalize people that long.”

According to the state records collected for this article, in 2015, Florida had 24 N.G.R.I. patients who had been hospitalized for longer than 15 years. Texas had 27. Connecticut had 40, and Georgia had 43. New York and Washington had around 60 apiece. That’s six of the 28 states from which such data can be extrapolated, along with the District of Columbia. In those states — which exclude thousands of N.G.R.I. patients — a significant portion of N.G.R.I. patients had been hospitalized more than two years. Nearly 1,000 had been hospitalized for five to 15 years. More than 400 had been in for longer than 15. Of these, more than 100 had been in longer than 25 years and at least 60 for more than 30. And those numbers don’t present the whole picture, either: Many factors, like hospital transfers or conversion to civil commitment, can start the clock over or obscure patients’ histories. In many cases, Gee says, when patients reach out to Disability Rights California to advocate on their behalf, “if they’d not pled N.G.R.I. and just gone to prison, they might have gotten out earlier.”

Which is not to say there aren’t protocols for release. Most states do have a formal review process to judge whether N.G.R.I.s no longer fit commitment criteria: They are no longer mentally ill or are no longer dangerous as a result of their mental illness. Some states review cases on a schedule — every year, say, or in the case of New Hampshire, every five years. In others, patients (or their lawyers) have to request the review. Doctors can recommend patients for discharge at any time. Patients’ lawyers can also file writs of habeas corpus or petitions for restoration of sanity to have their cases heard in court.

At the psychiatric facility where James is a patient, as at every New York state hospital, cases are reviewed every two years or so, in a joint process by the hospital and the Office of Mental Health (O.M.H.) in Albany. In 2002, when the hospital and O.M.H. review declared James unfit for release, James requested that the court appoint him an independent evaluator and grant him a hearing.

That doctor found that he wasn’t dangerous and was ready to be transferred. The judge agreed and ordered it.

But James didn’t leave.

“Even the mechanisms for getting out,” says Pat McConahay, communications director for Disability Rights California, “are not really mechanisms for getting out.”

James’s almost-transfer 15 years ago fell under the jurisdiction of Guy Arcidiacono, now 61, the district attorney in charge of the Suffolk County Forensic Psychiatric Litigation Unit, who has handled 130 N.G.R.I. cases over 25 years. After the judge approved James for transfer, Arcidiacono and the Suffolk County district attorney’s office, joined by the New York State attorney general’s office, which represents the hospital, appealed to have the transfer order overturned. Under another judge, it was.

James’s police files are terrible to read. There was never a trial, but the allegations are disturbing. They include a statement by the woman whom the police responded to near his house saying that James sexually assaulted her, beat her unconscious, then threw her down the basement stairs. She told the police that when she came to, naked, she realized she was locked in. This, you might presume, was the basis for the rape and kidnapping charges that James said put him in the state hospital.

“Well,” Arcidiacono clarified when I contacted him, “there were two cases, actually.”

Two months earlier, James had been arrested based on another woman’s statement, taken at the emergency room, that she was pinned by her throat and raped in an empty field. (In his statement, James said she had agreed to have sex with him in exchange for crack, and that he didn’t actually intend to make good on his promise.) Charges were filed, and James was released to his mother’s custody — Arcidiacono says there’s no record of why, but it could have been because James hadn’t been indicted yet. When James pleaded N.G.R.I. to the subsequent attack, the charges from the first incident were lumped together with the new ones: in total, second-degree kidnapping, second-degree assault, second-degree aggravated sexual abuse, first-degree sexual abuse, first-degree rape and third-degree robbery.

“You can see in his case,” Arcidiacono said, “that they were serious charges.”

Like most district attorneys, Arcidiacono has substantial discretion when an N.G.R.I. patient comes up for review. Any time a hospital wants to release or transfer an N.G.R.I. patient, his office can demand a hearing. In contesting transfer or release, Arcidiacono can compel the patient to be examined by a doctor he selects. Even if that doctor agrees that the patient is ready to leave, the district attorney can still contest the release. Arcidiacono has done this and won. If a patient does win release or transfer (in New York, a forensic patient is almost always transferred to a civil, less secure facility for another unspecified amount of time before release), the district attorney can appeal, as in James’s case. When you’re dealing not with facts but with opinions, Arcidiacono told me, “reasonable people can differ.”

He went on to explain: “There are two considerations here. What is good for the defendant, and also, the safety of the public. And that’s the difficult part of these cases, balancing those two interests.”

All this adds up to a difficult path to freedom for some N.G.R.I.s. In most states, as in New York, the courts have final review over forensic releases and transfers, and judges have the prerogative to side with the prosecution regardless of what doctors advise. Cas Shearin, director of investigations and monitoring at Disability Rights North Carolina, recalls a 1988 case in which, during an alcohol-related psychotic break, a man shot four strangers he thought were demons. “Year after year after year, his treating doctors went to the judge and said, ‘He’s ready to be released.’ ” The hospital where he was committed gave him increasing leave privileges, including reporting to a full-time job and visiting a girlfriend with whom he had children. After 21 years of incarceration and seven psychologists and psychiatrists testifying that he was no longer mentally ill and posed no threat to the public, he was released — though the judge still ordered that he submit to random drug tests for a year.

Politics, says Joel Dvoskin, a former New York State Office of Mental Health forensic director, can determine if “you’re going to stay locked up for a really long time, regardless of whether it’s safe to let you go.” Elected judges, fearing bad publicity, may be loath to release an offender into the community. As Ira Burnim, legal director of the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, a national advocacy organization based in Washington, explains the situation: “You have a mechanism to confine, for the protection of the public, these individuals when they’re mentally ill and dangerous, and the further you stray from that, the less it’s legally justified.”

John Hinckley Jr. became a famous example. Last September, Hinckley was released from St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, 35 years after being found not guilty. It had been two decades since his doctors declared his mental illnesses in full remission, which should have provided the basis for his release. “That anyone can justify keeping him in the hospital” for so long, Fitch says, “is just nuts.”

The question, according to Dvoskin, “becomes one of risk tolerance. America has become — to an extreme level that’s almost impossible to exaggerate — a risk-intolerant society.” Fears of people with mental illness persist, even though, according to the best estimates, only 4 percent of violent acts in the United States are uniquely attributable to serious mental illness. One study has found that those with mental illness are actually less likely to be seriously violent than the general population. (In addition, some N.G.R.I.s have been acquitted of nonviolent crimes, like public-order offenses, traffic offenses and prostitution.) Even if a mentally ill person has committed a crime, says Chris Slobogin, director of the criminal-justice program at Vanderbilt University Law School, “it doesn’t mean they’re going to do it again,” especially because their encounter with the forensic psychiatric system means they’ve received treatment. “This is a group of people that are incredibly stigmatized and misunderstood in terms of how dangerous they are.”

Recidivism for N.G.R.I.s is relatively low. Whereas, nationally, recidivism for released prisoners is above 60 percent, “people who are found N.G.R.I. tend to go back out into the community, and they tend to do really, really well,” Fitch says. The arrest rate for people in Maryland on conditional release, a kind of mental-health parole from the hospital, is less than half the arrest rate of the general population in the state. “If you provide treatment of illness and provide the supports they need, then they don’t reoffend,” Fitch says. As a 2016 study of N.G.R.I. recidivism in Connecticut — which has a post-release supervision program, too — also concluded: “The vast majority of individuals are not rearrested.”

It is not sober data analysis, however, that sticks in the public’s mind — or influences judges’ rulings. Hearing that a man in Nebraska whose most recent diagnosis was “cannabis abuse, unspecified” had been in the hospital for 37 years may evoke less sympathy or outrage when you learn that he killed six people, three of them children. Two of his victims he raped. One of them was dead when he did it. The other one, who was alive for the assault, was 10.

“It’s not an easy population to represent,” Bien says. “No one likes these people.”

On Nov. 21, 2011, after months of having delusions about aliens, conspiracies and poison, Houston Herczog, then 21, partly decapitated his father, Mark. Six days earlier, Mark Herczog had written a letter to God (“God — Help!”) asking him to save his newly unrecognizable son. After Houston was arrested in the bloodied family kitchen, he told the police: “The look in his eyes! I had to!”

I heard about the murder from my mother. Houston is my distant cousin, though I had never met him or his immediate family. During his trial, as psychiatrists testified about a psychotic break related to an onset of schizophrenia, his family — my family — prayed that he would be found not guilty by reason of insanity and sent somewhere for treatment. Charged with first-degree murder, Houston was facing 25 years to life. When he was found N.G.R.I. and sent to nearby Napa State Hospital, it was a relief.

It wasn’t until he was inside that any of us realized, from the mounting anxiety in his phone calls, the rules and restrictions that governed the possibility of his getting out.

Houston has now been in the hospital for four years. In 2015, I visited him there for the first time. After passing through a prison fence and four locked doors, I sat with him in an all-beige room. Schizoaffective disorder is the current diagnosis, and he is stable on medication, though he has periods of deep hopelessness. He struggles with what he has done; at the beginning of his incarceration, when, pharmacologically stabilized for the first time, he was suddenly lucid, he couldn’t do anything but lie in bed and cry. But he also struggles with the uncertainty of how long his confinement will last. Had he been convicted and received the minimum sentence, he would be out before his 50th birthday. His “top date,” according to his hospital paperwork, is Dec. 31, 2600 — 587 years after he was admitted.

Houston doesn’t dispute that he did what he did, but he does dispute the basis for his continued detention. “What are they rehabilitating?” he asked me that day, shaking his legs up and down when the caffeine from a Mountain Dew Code Red kicked in, his blue eyes wide behind wire glasses. He held his hand up, ticking the points off on his fingers. “Not a pattern of violent behavior, since I have no record of violent behavior before my crime. Is it my insanity? Because the treatment for my disease is medication, and I’m medicated and stable now.” And he is — high-functioning as you please. Before we began talking about his incarceration, he kept trying to engage me in a debate about feminist theory.

When he calls, Houston sometimes apologizes for not having much to say about his life — what would he have to say? — in limbo as it is. He would love to have a girlfriend, his first, but it seems unlikely to happen at the hospital. (“You know, I came here for the women,” he joked once.) He spends a portion of his unnumbered, many-numbered days arguing with staff about how many packets of sweetener he’s allowed to use at a time. (Patients are restricted to two at lunch; he likes his tea quite sweet.) His schedule consists of shuffling from group activity to group activity in a beige uniform, between feedings of institutional food three times a day, mind-numbing TV in the background, no internet or cellphones.

Houston’s plan is to wait until he has been hospitalized for at least five years before he bothers to file any writs or petitions for release. That number has nothing to do with what he thinks of his mental state but with comments his first social worker at Napa made: that because of what he did, he can’t possibly be let go for a long time. (When reached for comment about whether this was a plausible conversation, a spokesman for the hospital said, “A patient with a determinate sentence length of life for a high-profile crime might end up staying in the hospital for many years. It is reasonable and therapeutic for a treatment team to discuss these realities with patients.”)

Houston’s sister Savannah says that she gets it — the urge to confine forever someone who did something horrific. Savannah was home the night her brother killed their father. Only 17 at the time, she “had to walk past them to get the phone” to call 911. When she ran to her room to dial, Houston followed her, still holding a knife, but stopped when she shut the door on him. “Part of me thinks he should still have to pay in some way, whether he was in his right mind or not,” she says. “It’s hard though, too, because it is ‘not guilty.’ I have to remind myself of that a lot. I think that’s because I was there. I saw it happen.” But, she went on, “it’s my brother, and obviously I don’t want him to spend his whole life there, because even seeing what he has to eat makes me want to cry. Being there just deteriorates him more and breaks his spirit. He realizes what he did and where he is, and he’s depressed.”

Not everyone in the family is so sympathetic, says Houston’s half sister, Cameron McDowell, 43. “We have some family members who just hate him and will never forgive him. It was just such an awful thing. And I wish Dad were here every day. I can’t even imagine what he went through that night — oh, God, it was so awful.” But, she says, “he’s gone. And we have Houston now. We have to support him. This is going to sound strange, but I’ve not once been mad at him. I really, truly, passionately believe that it’s not the person that commits the crime. It’s the illness.”

At the same time, she understands why people are afraid. Cameron’s own husband isn’t yet comfortable with the idea of Houston’s hanging around their two young kids; though he loves Houston, he’s “a little bit freaked.” “I hope my husband will change his mind when Houston gets out,” she says. She, too, worries about what will happen after his release, though for entirely different reasons. “Is he going to be so institutionalized that he won’t know how to live? That’s what breaks my heart for him.”

Like Houston’s sisters, the judicial and medical systems struggle to find a balance between the blamelessness of N.G.R.I. patients and the gravity of many of their crimes. The rights of the patient are always weighed against the public good, a standard that may include a more or less explicit desire for retribution. Those who provide treatment for forensic patients, says Michael Norko, professor of psychiatry at Yale and director of forensic services for the Connecticut Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, “still have to answer to a court, or to the board, or to the court of public opinion. Every facility has people in it who have so violated a community, a community that is so angry, so hurt, that they’re basically pariahs.” He recalls one patient who shot a police officer; at hearings for his release, a crowd of uniformed cops repeatedly showed up and stood silently, facing the review panel. The question of a patient’s hospitalization can be “reduced to people’s grief, people’s anger, people’s fear — and the complexity of the patient’s rights and their recovery, all of those complexities get overshadowed very quickly.” When I asked Norko what happened to the patient who shot the officer, he said, “Well — well, eventually, he died.”

Because diagnoses and treatment assessments cannot predict future behavior, the standards for involuntary confinement — degree of mental illness and dangerousness — are necessarily subjective. Emotions and prejudice easily come into play, even from experts. A 2003 study in The American Journal of Forensic Psychology, for example, showed that doctors are more likely to find minorities incompetent to stand trial and more likely to diagnose psychotic disorders in African-Americans. At Napa, I spoke with a patient, a friend of Houston’s, who pleaded N.G.R.I. to a murder charge and had been hospitalized for nearly 20 years. When he was granted a hearing in which, according to court transcripts, multiple clinicians recommended his release, one doctor dissented — a doctor with whom he had had an ugly dispute and who, another doctor testified, wasn’t objective. The patient’s release was denied.

Stephen Seager, a 67-year-old psychiatrist who was at Napa for five years, writes openly about his own reactions to his patients in his 2014 memoir, “Behind the Gates of Gomorrah: A Year With the Criminally Insane.” He describes being in the hallway with a group of them heading to lunch as being “engulfed in a wave of hungry psychopaths.” When one of his patients tells him a story about his childhood, he writes, “I didn’t like thinking that some of the men even had childhoods.” Asked in court about a patient’s diagnosis, he gave the admitting diagnosis — bipolar disorder, manic with psychotic features — though he writes that he knew he wasn’t currently mentally ill. But he did think he was dangerous. When I asked him about this, he said: “The point is they’re supposed to be dangerous because they’re mentally ill, but if they get better and they’re still dangerous, what do you do?” He is well aware of the import of expert testimony in retention decisions. “Most of the time,” he said, “judges take our opinion on it.

“I look for the safety of the community,” he went on. “I live here. Sometimes you just have to say something for everybody’s best interest, regardless of whether they’re mentally ill or not.”

Of patients who “just never quite get better,” in doctors’ estimations, Seager said: “Oh, they’ll be here till they die.”

Napa State hospital’s vast, drought-dry campus is roamed by a pack of screeching peacocks. At 1,255 beds, it is one of the largest state psychiatric hospitals in the country. For most of his time there, Houston has been on what’s called a discharge unit, with one to three roommates, where it’s possible to get privileges like walking to the visitors’ center alone. After a bout of suicidal thoughts, he was moved, indefinitely, to a locked unit where all activities and access to the courtyard are supervised.

Houston’s treatment consists of up to 20 hours of group classes a week. His schedule at one point included Emotional Management, Substance Recovery, Current Issues in Mental Health, Self-Esteem, Fitness/Easy Exercise, Leisure Skills/Computer, Fitness/Weight Lifting, Discharge Planning, Wellness Recovery Action Plan, Coping Skills/Fitness, Leisure Skills/Journal and Conditional Release Prep. He says they watch a lot of videos. I once talked to a fellow patient of Houston’s on the phone who said he was heading to a class where the day’s lesson was learning to make cheesecake.

“Cheesecake!” he said. “Imagine that.”

State forensic hospitals vary widely in size — anywhere from just one ward to 1,500 beds — and they also vary in the activities and treatments they offer. Public psychiatric hospitals across the country may be accredited by an independent nonprofit called the Joint Commission. But it doesn’t require, for a start, the use of evidence-based therapies. One-on-one psychotherapy can be hard to get. (Houston began receiving such therapy only after his mother spent two years asking for it, his family says. Napa declined to comment, citing privacy laws.) State mental-health agencies may not be required to report what kind of care hospitals are giving, unless something goes so wrong that it attracts the attention of federal authorities. (Many do, however, voluntarily participate in national data-collection systems.)

The American archetype of bad mental-health practices is the movie “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest”: doped-up patients locked away from society to suffer and, ultimately, to perish. Some advocates argue that the conditions at psychiatric institutions aren’t always much better. Until recently, Oregon State Hospital, where “Cuckoo’s Nest” was filmed, may in ways have been worse.

In 2006, The Oregonian won a Pulitzer Prize for its exposé of the institution. It reported that there was a male staff member who worked on one ward for only a year in the late ’80s but still managed to sexually abuse six female patients; there was a wrongful-death suit in 2003; a rape lawsuit in 1995 that accused the hospital of what The Oregonian described as a “longstanding pattern of sex abuse,” some of it by a staff member who, the paper reported, had nearly been fired the year before, “after he and several other staff asphyxiated a patient while restraining him for refusing to take off his shoe.”

The problems weren’t unique to Oregon: Nebraska state psychiatric hospitals settled two major lawsuits, one in 1996 and another in 2006, which claimed that staff members and patients raped and sexually assaulted female patients; two lawsuits have been brought against Massachusetts in the last 10 years by families of forensic patients who were subjected to illegal restraining methods, one whose condition declined and another who died. Napa had more than 4,000 reported patient-on-patient or patient-on-staff assaults in 2014; in 2010, a staff member was killed.

Today Oregon State Hospital still has the towering 1883 brick face of the “Cuckoo” era, but inside, it’s all sparkling new facilities, yoga props and a physical-therapy pool — thanks, in part, to a state senator, Peter Courtney. On a 2004 tour of the hospital, Courtney was astonished to learn of 3,600 badly corroded cans of cremains in an outbuilding, still unclaimed. Around the same time, after the death of yet another patient, the Justice Department became involved. Oregon State is now the first state psychiatric hospital in the nation to use “collaborative problem solving,” instead of, say, automatic “seclusion and restraint” of patients who start to become difficult. Courtney pushed funding for the reforms through Oregon’s State Legislature and brought in a new superintendent, Greg Roberts.

“Very often when you find serious problems, the problem is one of three things: leadership, leadership or leadership,” Roberts says. (A notable problem of leadership was found at Napa: The man who was its executive director between 2007 and 2010, Claude Edward Foulk, is now serving 248 years in prison for sexually molesting children.) Before Roberts came to Oregon, he was the person New Jersey sent to take over “problematic” hospitals that had “a serious negative incident or series of negative incidents.” He revamped three there, one of them twice.

More than 10 years into its transformation, Oregon State has come a long way. But, Roberts acknowledges, it still has a long way to go. Among the hospital’s 937 forensic patients, there were 1,908 incidents of seclusion and restraint in 2014. And while Roberts’s reforms included securing timely releases for patients — between 2012 and 2015, the hospital discharged 90 percent of its “guilty except insanity” (Oregon’s N.G.R.I.) patients with “top dates” early — it still has several patients who’ve been in for more than 15 years, who it acknowledges long ago ceased to be dangerous. Staff recently discharged one patient who had been in for more than 30.

Unfortunately, there aren’t a lot of other places for forensic patients to go. When the push to deinstitutionalize psychiatric patients began in the 1970s, many inpatient facilities were shut down or downsized in favor of community integration and outpatient services, which never adequately materialized because of a lack of funding. But institutions have remained the preferred repository for forensic patients, who fill an increasing share of the remaining 42,000 state psychiatric hospital beds. In Pennsylvania, the proportion of forensic patients increased by 379 percent between 1988 and 2008. In California, some 90 percent of approximately 7,000 state-hospital patients are now forensic. Nationwide, nearly one-third of “consumers” in state hospitals in 2007 were forensic, and that number is “rapidly expanding,” according to the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (Samhsa). In the last 10 years, forensic patients’ costs jumped to $4.25 billion from $2.5 billion; forensic patients now account for 43.9 percent of total state psychiatric hospital expenditures. This means less room for others who might be seeking psychiatric care, while at the same time, states have cut billions from mental health, leaving even scantier outpatient systems. In Hawaii, as a 2015 Samhsa report notes, “There is no voluntary admission to the [state psychiatric] facility because of the volume of admissions from the court system.” The same lack of services that contributes to people’s reaching a mental-health crisis that ends in arrest also keeps people institutionalized longer afterward.

Whitlock, of Tennessee’s mental-health department, says that there are N.G.R.I. patients whom her state’s hospitals are trying to discharge but for whom they “just can’t find a provider.” Under her lead, Tennessee, more than any other state, has been trying not to commit forensic patients to begin with. Since 1974, it has done its pretrial competency evaluations on an outpatient basis, no insignificant matter given that elsewhere these can take six months or longer. In 2009, the state also started doing post-N.G.R.I. evaluations to see if N.G.R.I.s even needed hospitalization, also on an outpatient basis. “We did not think there was a need to spend 60 or 90 days in the hospital to determine if N.G.R.I.s fit the involuntary-commitment standard,” Whitlock says. “Once you get someone into the hospital, it’s hard to get the court to take them back out. We could probably determine it in a day.” Now only 55 percent of Tennessee’s N.G.R.I.s are committed. Their typical length of stay ranges between seven months and 4.5 years, and they get out, on average, in about two. The state’s new initiative adds to the body of evidence that less hospitalization doesn’t lead to higher crime rates. Since Tennessee stopped automatically committing N.G.R.I.s, says Jeff Feix, the state’s director of forensic services, “the recidivism rate we have is no different than it was before.”

Despite the clinical benefits and cost savings — in 2015, according to a Samhsa report, the average annual cost of one forensic patient, nationwide, was $341,614 — Tennessee’s model is still unusual. There is no outcry, from the public or politicians, for alternatives to indefinitely institutionalizing N.G.R.I.s. After 45 years of studying the issue and filing lawsuits on behalf of patients, Michael Perlin, an emeritus professor at New York Law School and an expert on mental-disability law, thinks he knows why: “Everybody except for people who take the Constitution seriously and people who are in the hospital are happy the patients are there. Prosecutors, police, they’re glad they’re not going anywhere. I believe that the disability rights community has never gotten substantially involved in the issue because some of the people have been charged with very horrific crimes.”

As he put it: “This is an area that everybody kind of wishes would go away.”

Nearly two decades into James’s confinement, it remains unclear if he will ever be considered fit for release. He says that currently his entire medication regimen consists of “fish oil twice a day, calcium, vitamin D and two Kool-Aids and prune juice and Metamucil.” In the 2004 appellate court overturning of his transfer, the hospital doctor testifying in favor of his continued retention pointed out that there was no medication for his diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder — just therapy, to which he was resistant. The hospital forensic committee said that they believed James was insufficiently willing to take responsibility for his actions. One of his doctors called him “sexually preoccupied”; the appellate court concluded that “the disorder will continue to cause him to be dangerous at least until such time as he decides he wants to change and begins working seriously with his treatment providers.”

The court-appointed psychiatrist at the hearing two years earlier, when James was ordered for transfer, said quite the opposite. In his opinion, James “acknowledged the wrongfulness of his actions, and although he does not show much remorse or regret for his actions as a result of limited insight, he certainly realizes that what he did was wrong and against the law.” He said that James “has benefited from [the state psychiatric facility] as much as he will benefit, and at this point he could be transferred to a civil hospital, where he will continue to benefit from the structured environment and continue to receive individual treatment, hoping that he will eventually gain further insight.” But in its appeal at that time, as in every review since, the hospital successfully petitioned to retain him.

How much James’s perceived dangerousness is due to his illness and how much to his extended hospitalization can be difficult to untangle. During a phone call last year, he confessed that lately he’d been “going through a lot of crap.” He was referring to recent fights on the ward. The 2004 appeal notes that he was assaulted twice in 2002 and “got into an altercation with another patient” that year; all of the incidents read as demerits against him. Such disputes are not uncommon for patients with personality disorders, says Norko, the Yale professor and clinician. A hospital is generally “not a good place for them,” he says. “Clinically you try very hard not to hospitalize people who have personality disorders. They can’t quite seem to ever get it right. To them it looks like: ‘The staff want me to do this, they want me to do that, they keep changing the rules,’ and they don’t understand the rules, and they get into arguments, they get into fights. It’s all part of their personality disorder, which in itself isn’t necessarily all that dangerous, but it’s kind of hard to move somebody along when their record is dotted with all of these altercations.”

Perhaps the most cleareyed view of the compromises inherent in N.G.R.I. commitments comes from Paul Appelbaum, professor and director of the division of law, ethics and psychiatry at Columbia University. Appelbaum acknowledges that some N.G.R.I.s are “unnecessarily detained for a longer period than what seems to be warranted by their mental disorder and its impact on their likelihood of being violent in the future.” But, he says, such exaggerated concerns about public safety may be necessary to the survival of the insanity defense. “There are injustices that are imposed on individuals,” Appelbaum says. “But I also see at a 30,000-foot level why the system works that way, and recognize perhaps the paradox that if it didn’t work that way, we might lose the insanity defense altogether, or at the very least have an even more restrictive system that we have to deal with.”

For many, Appelbaum says, an N.G.R.I. verdict is still superior to a conviction. “It exempts them from a formal finding of guilt, which can be important later in their lives. It enables them to serve their time of confinement in what is generally a much better and safer environment than an overcrowded state prison.” While one way to look at indefinite confinement is as an unbearable uncertainty, another is that it offers hope: “Compared to a life without the possibility of parole, you know, maybe that’s better.”

Yet for the insanity defense to live up to the moral imperative it was designed to embody — exculpating those with diminished responsibility for their acts — better mechanisms for evaluating release will need to be adopted, Slobogin says. In an attempt, in part, to protect N.G.R.I.s’ constitutional rights to be released when they don’t fit commitment criteria, the American Bar Association recently revised its criminal-justice mental-health standards, which were adopted in 1986. The association recommended that forensic patients be detained only if there is clear and convincing evidence — a standard that, if it had to be quantified, means about 75 percent certainty — that they’re mentally ill and dangerous; the current legal burden of proof in most jurisdictions is a “preponderance of the evidence,” or 51 percent certainty.

“It’s immoral to deprive someone of liberty because you’re mad at them for being found N.G.R.I.,” says Slobogin, who was on the task force. “Under our new standards, after a year you have to have very strong proof of dangerousness, or you can’t detain them.” But the standards are just recommendations, and some states didn’t even follow the ones from the ’80s. Slobogin concedes that in many jurisdictions, they may have no impact at all.",When ‘Not Guilty’ Is a Life Sentence,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/magazine/when-not-guilty-is-a-life-sentence.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

22A: “Change of locks?” had to be a pun, as indicated by the question mark. Looking back, I don’t know why I starred this clue as a toughie since NEW DO is such an apt entry, but that’s often a sign that a clue is just elegant.

95A: I don’t stay up on my Disney much, so when I saw “Big 2016 film set in Polynesia” I searched my recent memory for a serious movie. I figured out MOANA through a few crosses and had a “D’oh” moment because of course in New York you can’t go a day without hearing about some insane accomplishment by Lin-Manuel Miranda (who co-wrote this movie’s music). So really this should have rang a lyrical bell.

96A: I worked on “Cab alternative” by trying to think of rivals to Uber, with three letters. Instead I should have been looking for alternatives to Cabernet, similarly shortened — in this case, ZIN.

106A: I was misdirected by this clue, “Consider it done”; since the entry appeared in quotations, I took it for a theme answer and left it until later in the game to fill in. It finally finished as I SHALL, which almost made the grade since there is an actual state concealed in there (ALabama). But the other rules of this theme are broken here, and it’s actually pretty hard not to use any of the 50 two-letter state abbreviations in nonthemed answers in a puzzle. Pulling that off would’ve been pretty amazing.

15D: “Firmly in place” was one of a handful of straight clues I didn’t get, for some reason. I guess I gravitate toward more chicanery on a Sunday and managed to fixate on some variation of tongue in cheek, but this was simply ANCHORED. I struggled with the across clues that furnished the first two letters of this answer, and a couple of other crosses were a bit tricky (including TD BANK, one of those entries that makes sense but makes for an illogical fill until it’s completed).

42D: The radio led me astray when I got to this clue, “Part of a recovery effort.” Too many disasters at once — hurricanes and earthquakes — had me racking my brain for something like “search and rescue” that would fit the grid. Instead the puzzle was hinting at a more personal cataclysm, and it took a while for me to fill out “AA MEETING”; another example of a clue with gnarly, unusual twinned letters to make you doubt yourself when solving.

52D: I got this in its entirety only from crosses, and still looked at it skeptically until checking out its etymology; TOP HOLE just made no sense to me for “First-rate, in British slang.” Turns out that it’s very similar in origin to top notch, both of them finding their roots in horse-jumping, where the best horses soar over the highest bar or rail of a fence, which is held in place by pegs in either a hole or a notch, sort of. I mean, pish posh, folks. Maybe you use “top hole” every day, but in my defense this is only the third usage in the puzzle since 1965. If you knew it then top hole, old chap!

65D: I consider this clue, in retrospect, to be the yin to 42-Down’s yang. “Getting help getting clean” made me think of renting a power washer before being IN REHAB.

All that British slang research brought to mind this little gem from our own archives. If you haven’t seen it already there are some top-hole touches:

Tricky Clues

10A: It’s midweek, so read those clues carefully. “It’s found by the radius” sounds like it might be a math question, but it’s not; what other kind of “radius” exists? The radius we’re looking for today is a bone in the forearm. It is parallel to the ulna, a fabulous piece of osteocrosswordese (Yes, I made that up).

15A: A clue like “Brought home” evokes the childhood habit some of us might have had for bringing home stray animals and begging our parents to let us keep them. Not me, of course. But some of us.

30A: #TIL the word MANUMIT, and it’s very interesting. To manumit is not merely to SET FREE, but to set someone free from slavery. It’s derived from the Latin manus, or hand, and means to “set forth from one’s hand,” or release from control.

Let’s say hello to Evan Manhken:

Constructor Notes

I’m 20 years old, a junior at Brandeis University, majoring in Chemistry and American Studies. I started writing crosswords my freshman year of college. My school newspaper, the Justice, was using some very underwhelming syndicated crosswords, and I said to myself, “I could write better crosswords than that!” I couldn’t. At least, not at first. I still shudder to think of some of my very early crosswords. But, as I got more and more practice, I started to get decent at it. I continue to write a crossword for them each week. But when I write what I think is a really good puzzle, I send it off to The Times instead. This time, it seems Will agreed with me, and I got in. Not without a number of revisions beforehand, though. It’s a real honor to be in The New York Times for the first time, and I hope it won’t be the last! As for this puzzle’s construction, I don’t have all that much to say about it. The idea had been rattling around in my brain for a while before I got around to making it. I ended up brainstorming by thinking of all the spatial words I could muster, seeing which ones had phrases associated with them, and then seeing what I could come up with for words that fit those phrases. BENEATH ME was by far the answer I was most pleased with. I really learned a lot from the revision process, but I know I’ve got a lot left to learn about making crosswords.

Welcome to the party, Mr. Mahnken. I hope we get to see more from you soon, and 100 percent on your debut.

The price-cut agreement comes with a bonus: Top American oncologists will simplify complex cancer-treatment guidelines for underequipped African hospitals, and a corps of IBM programmers will build those guidelines into an online tool available to any oncologist with an internet connection.

Sea turtles, which take 25 to 30 years to reach reproductive age, lay their eggs in the open beach, under vegetation or at the base of a dune. The hurricane eroded key nesting beaches, washing away nests or flooding them with rainwater or seawater, Dr. Mansfield said.

Along two stretches of beach south of Cape Canaveral, more than 90 percent of incubating loggerhead nests were destroyed by the storm, representing about 25 percent of the season’s total.

Loggerheads have laid only eight new nests at the refuge since the storm, while green turtles have laid 466.

Green turtles typically lay more nests in alternate years. Last year, Hurricane Matthew wiped out many nests, but it was a light laying season for the greens, so there were fewer nests to destroy, Dr. Mansfield said.

This year, with record numbers of green turtle nests on the northeastern coast of Florida — with 12,000 north of Cape Canaveral and more than 15,000 a bit farther south — huge numbers were lost, Dr. Ceriani said.

Hurricane Nate, which is bearing down on Florida’s Gulf Coast, is unlikely to have a huge impact, because the loggerheads that are more common in that area have already laid their nests for the season.

There may be some impact on remaining green turtle nests on the Atlantic coast if the storm hits hard on those beaches, “but I don’t expect it would be bad,” Dr. Ceriani said in a follow-up email.

“The secretary has initiated an internal departmental review of the procedures and processes that we go through for official travel,” Ms. Oakley wrote.

In recent days, Mr. Price has defended himself by saying he has a busy travel schedule, and on Saturday, Mr. Price told Fox News that he would stop traveling on private jets until a review of his activities was completed.

“We’ve taken many, many trips in cars — sometimes four and five hours at a time,” he told the network.

According to the senior administration official, Mr. Trump is less perturbed by the actions of two other cabinet members who have fallen under recent scrutiny for their spending: Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.

Mr. Pruitt recently took the unusual step of installing a $25,000 soundproof booth in his office to conduct secure communications, and Mr. Mnuchin inquired about using a military plane for his honeymoon in Europe last month. He also took a government plane on a trip that included a viewing of the solar eclipse on Aug. 21 in Kentucky. That trip fell under scrutiny when Mr. Mnuchin’s wife, Louise Linton, took a stranger to task on Instagram for criticizing the couple’s luxurious lifestyle.

The president has publicly defended Mr. Mnuchin, whose trips came under an official review after the trip to Kentucky. Responding to an ABC News report that Mr. Mnuchin had taken a $25,000 trip to Washington from New York, accompanied by Elaine Chao, the secretary of transportation, the president told reporters to check their facts.

“Why don’t you check your records before you make a statement,” Mr. Trump said to reporters on Sunday. “As I understood it — I don’t know much about it — I haven’t heard about it, but I understand he never took that flight.”

On Wednesday, the House Oversight Committee launched an investigation into the travel of Mr. Trump’s senior administration members. The investigation, opened by Representatives Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, the committee’s chairman, and Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the panel’s ranking Democrat, will examine the use of private and government travel by senior officials, and will request passenger names, destinations and the source of payment for each trip, among other details. The committee is requesting all related documents by Oct. 10.

Ethics experts are critical of the spending activities of Mr. Trump’s cabinet members, many of whom were wealthy before they entered public service. Richard W. Painter, an ethics counsel in the George W. Bush White House and a frequent critic of Mr. Trump, said that his weekly jaunts to Trump-owned resorts have created a culture of entitlement in the administration.

“Every time they’ve gone to Mar-a-Lago, it’s a couple of million just to haul Air Force One down there,” Mr. Painter said, referring to Mr. Trump’s private club in Florida. “Those other guys say, ‘Gee, I’m important too, I ought to get a private jet. I shouldn’t wait to sit around and have Delta Air Lines kick me around.’”

Matthew Dallek, an associate professor at George Washington University’s Graduate School of Political Management who studies political history, said that accusations of overspending have plagued nearly every modern presidency: John H. Sununu, the chief of staff for President George Bush, came under fire in 1991 for taking a government limousine to New York from Washington to attend a stamp auction. (He later resigned.) In 1994, David Watkins, the White House director of administration for President Bill Clinton, resigned after taking a $13,129 trip aboard a Marine presidential helicopter to play golf in Maryland.

“The consequences have been swifter” in the past, Mr. Dallek said. “People have lost their jobs for lesser offenses.”

At least two cabinet members have publicly said that they foot the bill for their travel: Betsy DeVos, the billionaire education secretary, uses her own private jet in her travels around the country “at zero cost to U.S. taxpayers,” according to her spokeswoman, Elizabeth Hill.

Linda McMahon, the former chief executive officer of World Wrestling Entertainment and the current administrator of Small Business Administration — and another billionaire in Mr. Trump’s cabinet — covers the cost on private planes “out of her own pocket,” according to her spokeswoman, Carol Wilkerson.",Tom Price’s Spending Habits Catch Trump’s Attention: ‘I’m Not Happy About It’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/us/politics/trump-price-chartered-air-travel.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

The race in many ways presaged the campaign of Mr. Trump, whose prospects Mr. Miller soon eyed with excitement.
“Trump gets it,” Mr. Miller wrote to friends weeks later, forwarding a Breitbart interview with Mr. Trump, who concluded that Mr. Cantor’s defeat owed to “his softness on immigration.”“I wish he’d run for president,” Mr. Miller added of Mr. Trump.

In the years since, Mr. Miller has rocketed to the upper reaches of White House influence along a distinctly Trumpian arc — powered by a hyper-fluency in the politics of grievance, a gift for nationalist button-pushing after years on the Republican fringe and a long history of being underestimated by liberal forces who dismissed him as a sideshow since his youth.

Across his sun-kissed former home, the so-called People’s Republic of Santa Monica, they have come to regret this initial assessment. To the consternation of many former classmates and a bipartisan coalition of Washington lawmakers, Mr. Miller has become one of the nation’s most powerful shapers of domestic and even foreign policy.

“The 31-year-old?” Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, muttered to reporters earlier this year, despairing over who might be making decisions in Mr. Trump’s White House.

Yet on perhaps the president’s signature issue — immigration policy — Mr. Miller has emerged in recent days as the driving force behind the administration’s insistence on a wish list of hard-right proposals as part of any deal with Democrats to protect young undocumented immigrants from deportation. White House demands include a crackdown on unaccompanied children at the border, the construction of a border wall with Mexico and legislation to sharply reduce legal immigration.

As the surviving watchman on the president’s right flank since the removal in August of Stephen K. Bannon as chief strategist, Mr. Miller also remains a key craftsman in speechwriting at the White House. Mr. Trump, who has long prized Mr. Miller’s fierce loyalty, has embraced his instincts to sharply restrict the number of refugees admitted to the United States next year and to impose new travel restrictions on several predominantly Muslim countries and others deemed to be national security risks.

From the administration’s opening stanzas — when Mr. Trump let fly his “American carnage” inaugural address — to his swaggering turn last month before the United Nations, it is Mr. Miller’s worldview, as often as anyone’s, that the president projects on the grandest scale.

“We have this running joke,” said Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, “that if we were going to get key man’s insurance on anyone, Stephen would top the list.” She was referring to policies that companies take out on their most important employee.

The Beginnings in Santa Monica

Mr. Miller’s journey to this point, outlined over dozens of interviews with friends, classmates and current and former colleagues, is a triumph of unbending convictions and at least occasional contrivance. It is a story of beliefs that congealed early in a home that he helped nudge to the right of its blue-state ZIP code, and of an ideology that became an identity for a spindly agitator at a large and racially divided public high school.

These formative years supplied the template for the life Mr. Miller has carved out for himself in Washington, where he remains the hard-line jouster many of Mr. Trump’s most zealous supporters trust most in the White House — and many former peers fear.

“I can hear Stephen’s voice,” said a fellow Santa Monica student, Nick Silverman. “Even when Trump reads these statements, I know, ‘That’s Stephen.’”

Through Mr. Miller’s nearly nine months in the Trump White House, the question — how did he come from here? — has curdled across these eight square miles of progressive oceanside paradise, where a stroll near the beach can quickly produce images that border on a self-parody of limousine liberalism. Environmentalist stickers festoon a neighborhood pocked with gas guzzlers; a small dog, seated in a stroller, twitches in the sea breeze, rumbling past a homeless man sprawled across a sidewalk bench.

“It does have this tang of the seething id of Santa Monica,” another student, Jake Zambas, said of Mr. Miller’s nativist streak, noting that their high school, like the town, was largely self-segregating. “Everyone here is just a scared white person.”

In his time on this campus of roughly 3,000 students, Mr. Miller sculpted the brand of hard-charging conservatism that would deliver him to the president’s ear, tracing a pathway at once complicated and straightforward. Mr. Miller, the middle child in a financially comfortable Jewish family, plainly relished the attention and notoriety of being the city’s red-hued exception, according to classmates — some of whom recalled chuckling at, or at least shrugging off, the antics of their resident gadfly. The line between puckishness and principle blurred in due time.

Mr. Miller set off on a patriotic semi-striptease before the editor of the student newspaper, according to the editor, Ari Rosmarin, theatrically removing a button-down to reveal an American flag T-shirt in protest of an article he found inconsistent with the national interest. (The White House denied any symbolic unbuttoning, though officials confirmed Mr. Miller’s fondness for the T-shirt.)

He jumped, uninvited, into the final stretch of a girls’ track meet, apparently intent on proving his athletic supremacy over the opposite sex. (The White House, reaching for exculpatory context, noted that this was a girls’ team from another school, not his own.)

Most memorably, classmates say, Mr. Miller established a reputation for barreling eagerly toward racial tinderboxes, leaving some to wonder whether his words were meant to be menacing or hammy. Jason Islas, who had been friendly with Mr. Miller in middle school, has little doubt.

Shortly before the start of ninth grade, Mr. Islas said, he received a call from Mr. Miller informing him that the two could no longer be friends.

“He gives me this litany of reasons,” Mr. Islas said.

Most were petty, if mean, he recalled: an insult about his social awkwardness, a dig at his acne-specked face. But one stuck out.

“He mentioned my Latino heritage as one of the reasons,” Mr. Islas said. “I remember coming away from the conversation being like, ‘O.K., that’s that.’”

Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, called Mr. Islas’s account “a completely inaccurate characterization of their relationship, or lack thereof,” disputing his recollection and suggesting the two were more acquaintances than friends.

But several students said Mr. Miller’s trail of racially tinged comments amounted to a pattern. He railed against bilingual announcements, asking in a local editorial why there were “usually very few, if any, Hispanic students in my honors classes, despite the large number of Hispanic students that attend our school.”

Latino students remembered him engaging them outside group meetings, asking why they required a separate forum to discuss issues of identity, and chafing at Spanish being spoken in the halls.

“He tended to make some of the Spanish language stuff very personal,” said Moises Castillo, a classmate who described the exchanges as hurtful to this day. “There was a ‘if you’re not speaking English, perhaps you should go somewhere else.’”

He was asked whether Mr. Miller may have been leaning into a sort of provocative shtick, or crafting a character deliberately. In the campaign speech, after all — a portion of which was captured on video and published by Univision in February — Mr. Miller often appears to be smirking.

“It’s a character?” Mr. Castillo said. “When you hear it more than once, when you hear it in private, when you hear it in public, that ‘character’ kind of fades away. That benefit of the doubt is gone.”

Mentors on the Right

Mr. Miller’s defenders have argued that Mr. Miller’s high school persona — more merry prankster than fearsome bomb thrower, in their view — should not diminish the seriousness of his beliefs. Mr. Miller has attributed his conservative awakening, in part, to encountering right-leaning writings on gun policy and other issues, including a 1994 book, “Guns, Crime and Freedom” by Wayne LaPierre, the National Rifle Association leader.

Mr. Miller has said he was also shaped by his school’s response to the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when he confronted what he believed to be excess political correctness and insufficient support for American military efforts. Among his causes: pressing administrators to require the daily recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance. (He prevailed.)

Mr. Miller found mentors in David Horowitz, the onetime “New Left” Marxist who evolved into a conservative author, and a radio host, Larry Elder, who booked Mr. Miller as a recurring guest. He courted local controversy by inviting both to campus for speeches.

“He was already reading Ayn Rand. He was already reading the Federalist Papers,” Mr. Elder said, describing Mr. Miller as effectively a fully formed ideologue by the time he contacted the radio host’s show. “It’s not an act. He believes what he believes.”

News articles have often described Mr. Miller as the product of liberals whose politics changed through sheer force of their son’s arguments. Public documents do support this timeline: Mr. Miller’s parents, Michael and Miriam, changed their registration to Republican from Democrat after Mr. Miller left for college, according to Los Angeles County records.

But some who knew the family at the time have challenged the suggestion that he was raised in a classically hard-left Southern California home.

Ms. Miller’s brother, David Glosser, said the elder Mr. Miller, a real estate investor, had longed skewed conservative on some issues, describing him as a “responsible, thoughtful sort of economic Republican” that Mr. Glosser contrasted with Mr. Trump.

Messages left for Mr. Miller’s parents were not returned. Mr. Miller declined to be interviewed.

At Santa Monica Synagogue, the Millers proved an awkward fit in the largely liberal Reform congregation, according to people who knew them then. The younger Mr. Miller — true to form — established himself as the perpetually debate-ready boy who most enjoyed taking on all comers in 10th-grade confirmation class. A group photo, with Mr. Miller grinning from the back row in a prayer shawl, still hangs in the hall.

“We did our best here,” said Mr. Miller’s rabbi, Jeff Marx, “to teach Jewish ethics and talk about our need to reach out to the strangers, to those less fortunate than we are.”

By then, the Miller family had suffered its own notable reversal of fortunes. Earthquake-related property damage had upended Michael Miller’s real estate business, forcing the family to eventually abandon its stately home in the city’s exclusive North of Montana neighborhood.

Some classmates have speculated that the move, which found the family in a new house a short distance from the grittier and far more ethnically diverse Pico neighborhood, helped shape Mr. Miller’s still-developing views of race and class as he wended through his teens.

But others have dismissed this theory, suggesting that the family’s plight should not be overstated. A visit on a recent weekday found a succession of Mercedes-Benzes and Lexuses gliding down the block, with a team of Latino workers tending to landscaping along the sidewalk.

“They still moved to a two-story house in Santa Monica,” said Taylor Brinckerhoff, a family friend of the Millers’ who often attended Passover dinners with them.

For fellow students, the most credible origin story for Mr. Miller remains the simplest.

Surely he believed what he was saying, or at least most of it. But he also seemed to grasp quickly that contrarianism could be its own reward in an ecosystem of the like-minded, a way to stand out among the egos and trust funds of a singular American school district.

“Confrontation was his sort of modus operandi,” said Mr. Rosmarin, the former Santa Monica high school newspaper editor, who now works for the American Civil Liberties Union. “I think it’s why he came to school in the morning.”

And there is little doubt that he subscribed early to a future tenet of Breitbart-era conservatism: If you are upsetting liberals, you are probably doing something right.

“That was you?” Andrew Breitbart, the founder of the far-right website that bears his name, asked Mr. Miller in 2011, according to three people present for the exchange, during a gathering at the Breitbart townhouse beside the Supreme Court.

When Mr. Miller’s history was mentioned, these people said, Mr. Breitbart instantly recalled the California teenager who had become something of a cult figure in right-wing news media for laying verbal waste to his high school.

Duke, and on to Washington

The megaphones only got louder, a function of timing and gumption.

As a student at Duke University, when the school became a national political minefield in 2006 after a black woman accused three white lacrosse players of rape, Mr. Miller sensed an opportunity.

Where most students and professors sided quickly with the alleged victim, Mr. Miller became the players’ most vocal defender on cable television, appearing on Fox News to accuse the prosecutor of a witch hunt long before the case collapsed.

“We are at a terrible dearth of intelligent, common-sense, courageous voices on campus,” Mr. Miller, then a senior, told Bill O’Reilly on his Fox show, taking something of a victory lap.

After graduating, Mr. Miller moved to Washington to work as press secretary for Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota. By 2009, he found his way to Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama (Mr. Horowitz, the author, had introduced them), and he was eventually elevated to Mr. Sessions’s communications director.

In their years together, Mr. Miller positioned himself — and helped position Mr. Sessions, now the attorney general — inside the Republican Party’s burgeoning Breitbart wing, seizing on immigration as a central issue while bipartisan immigration legislation slithered through Congress in 2013.

Mr. Miller also found common cause with Mr. Bannon, who hoped to fashion the Breitbart News site into a battlefield for the so-called alt-right, a far-right fringe movement that often embraces an ideology of white nationalism. In 2014, the two helped propel a nearly anonymous House candidate in Virginia, Dave Brat, to a primary election victory over Eric Cantor, the majority leader at the time, in part by hammering Mr. Cantor as overly tolerant of illegal immigration. The race in many ways presaged the campaign of Mr. Trump, whose prospects Mr. Miller soon eyed with excitement.

“Trump gets it,” Mr. Miller wrote to friends weeks later, forwarding a Breitbart interview with Mr. Trump, who concluded that Mr. Cantor’s defeat owed to “his softness on immigration.”

“I wish he’d run for president,” Mr. Miller added of Mr. Trump.

When he did, Mr. Miller joined him early, before a vote had been cast in the primaries — and before Mr. Sessions became Mr. Trump’s most significant elected supporter. At rallies, Mr. Miller often warmed up crowds in his dark suits, his receding hairline slicked back. “We’re going to build that wall, and we’re going to build it out of love!” Mr. Miller promised.

Mr. Miller quickly grew comfortable with Mr. Trump’s impromptu style during the campaign, on more than one occasion ripping up a completed speech in the back of the candidate’s black S.U.V. because Mr. Trump had a change of heart on the way to an event.

And people close to both men say that more than anyone, Mr. Miller has grasped how to fuse the cadences of Mr. Trump’s own plain-spoken language with something loftier, at times scribbling notes on a piece of paper pressed to the side of a car window as he jotted down the president’s thoughts.

Occasionally, Mr. Miller has retained a public-facing role. In August, when the administration announced its support for a proposal to slash legal immigration, the White House briefing room belonged to him.

By the time the news conference was over, Mr. Miller had sparred with The New York Times, accused a CNN reporter of “cosmopolitan bias” and suggested that the poem associated with the Statue of Liberty (“Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses”) should not inform American immigration policy because it was not added to Liberty Island until 17 years after the statue’s unveiling.

As he spoke, Ms. Sanders, the press secretary, inched closer, sensing it was time to reclaim the microphone. But Mr. Miller seemed tickled by the combat.

“I think that went exactly as planned,” Mr. Miller said coyly, finally ceding the stage. “I think that was exactly what we were hoping to have happen.”","Stephen Miller, the Powerful Survivor on the President’s Right Flank",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/09/us/politics/stephen-miller-trump-white-house.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

Toward the end of Hope Jahren’s memoir, “Lab Girl,” the geobiologist author curses — twice in one paragraph — at a clump of moss. As soon as I read that page, I knew I’d give Ms. Jahren’s memoir to my friend, a cheerfully profane biology major.

Passionate readers love to buy books for their favorite people, using a mix of associative thinking and literary intuition. That same sense guides me when I make suggestions to those who write in to Match Book, The Times’s literary advice column, which has run online for the past six months.

Sleep-deprived new mothers are desperate for books they can read in short bursts. Readers have sent in itineraries for their upcoming road trips (one included driving times for each leg): They need audiobooks.

Ms. Leroy wrote over 100 letters home during her three years in Vietnam, one almost every 10 days, and they show how she was processing her experiences and navigating professional challenges.
It will be followed by the documentary “Cathy at War” by the writer and filmmaker Jacques Menasche.
While there were female journalists in Vietnam, Ms. Leroy was the only woman photographer after Chapelle’s death, and faced resistance from the military and male journalists.
“I am the first woman to jump in Vietnam during this first operational jump by American parachutists since the war began,” she wrote to her father on Feb. 23, 1967.","Catherine Leroy was 21 when she arrived in Vietnam in 1966 with only a hundred dollars, a Leica M2 and a limited professional portfolio. Over the next three years covering the war, she built an exceptional body of work: surviving and documenting a capture by the North Vietnamese Army, parachuting in combat operations with the 173rd Airborne, and being published on the covers of major magazines, including Life and Paris Match.

She was also the only female photojournalist then working in Vietnam, after the death of Dickey Chapelle, who was killed by a grenade in 1965.

Ms. Leroy wrote over 100 letters home during her three years in Vietnam, one almost every 10 days, and they show how she was processing her experiences and navigating professional challenges. They are candid and revealing, attesting to her resiliency, exposing insecurities, and showing her in moments of triumph, despair, optimism or courage.

Photo

Despite her many strong images, Ms. Leroy had remained relatively unknown, partly because she wasn’t a self-promoter, and partly because women photographers have often been excluded from the medium’s history, especially war photography. Now a selection of those letters are featured on a new website, accompanied by some of her archive and details from her life. It will be followed by the documentary “Cathy at War” by the writer and filmmaker Jacques Menasche.

Most of the letters are to her mother, Denise, focusing at first on topics that read like holiday postcards – gifts she hoped to send home, people she met, her tan. To her father, Jean, she wrote mostly about business — publications that bought her work, logistics and future plans. She frequently reassures them, noting in one letter to her mother that “if anything happens to me, you’ll be informed within 24 hours. So don’t worry if I sometimes leave you without any news.”

Her tone changed over time. In the early letters, she was unsure whether she should stay or go home, even as she felt less insecure about her technical skills. She spoke of the relationships she was forming with the military and about daily life. On Sept. 4, 1966, a few months after her initial arrival, she wrote to her mother:

I celebrated my 22nd birthday at the Da Nang press office in the company of lots of Marines. I had left Saigon a few days earlier with an AP reporter for an operation near the DMZ. On this occasion he opened a bottle of French champagne when we got back. I only got back last night, Saturday, very tired…I’m getting an iron reputation with the marines. I’m very proud of it. I’m leaving tomorrow, Tuesday, morning for the Delta. Subject: a village a few days from the election. The war seems to be calming down, as always happens just before political events. The Delta is the key region. I’ll stay there two or three days. After that, I don’t know. I’m preparing a few photos of me taken in various locations and will send them to you. I haven’t forgotten your wig, I’ll take care of it too. Don’t be angry with me. I’m always away: back in Saigon for two days, get something cleaned, tidy up, wash, everything is dirty.

As her confidence grew, she wrote about her professional successes. But the letters also showed low moments, like being unable to get the pictures she wanted in the field or leaving an envelope of her best prints in a taxi after fending off a robbery attempt from the driver.

The letters testify to the challenges women encountered in the field. While there were female journalists in Vietnam, Ms. Leroy was the only woman photographer after Chapelle’s death, and faced resistance from the military and male journalists. Robert Pledge, president of the board of the Catherine Leroy Fund, a not-for-profit organization in Paris dedicated to her work, said many prominent photojournalists questioned why a young woman wanted to cover war.

She wrote about how people were nice when they first thought she was an unintimidating, five-foot-tall, pigtailed girl. But when they realized she was a serious photographer, their opinions changed. “Many were very, very negative and very nasty with her,” said Mr. Pledge, who is also co-founder and director of Contact Press Images.

Writing to her father on May 13, 1967, after noting her successes in being published in leading magazines, she marveled how “I’m getting telegrams from people who I didn’t know existed for years, while at the same time I’m hated more than ever by known and unknown enemies in Saigon, American civilians, as well as servicemen in Saigon.”

One photographer told Mr. Pledge that the male photographers “were really nasty chauvinistic pigs.” That same photographer, who now is a filmmaker, called her late in life to apologize.

Still, she found the opportunities available to her in Vietnam surpassed anything back home in France. Like parachuting with the 173rd Airborne Brigade — the 85th jump she had taken in her life, after receiving her parachuting license as a teenager.

“I am the first woman to jump in Vietnam during this first operational jump by American parachutists since the war began,” she wrote to her father on Feb. 23, 1967. “I’m very proud to have jumped with the Americans here, it’s a big professional success in every way. I now know that I will be able to work in the United Sates one day without too much problem.” She wrote how she planned to submit her work to major competitions. “I’ve always thought I should succeed because I never gave in,” she continued.

Many consider Ms. Leroy as the most daring of all photographers in Vietnam, and she most likely spent the most time in combat because she needed the money. Being broke meant traveling with soldiers, sharing rations and sleeping in the countryside.

As Mr. Pledge noted, “If Robert Capa was saying that it’s not good enough because it’s not close enough — she was very close.”

Ms. Rigau was among three senior Catalan government officials who were recently found guilty of civil disobedience for helping coordinate the nonbinding vote on Catalan independence in 2014.","Those elections presented big tests of the bloc’s cohesion. The dispute over Catalonia instead presents a test of the cohesion of a member state itself. And it points to ominous storm clouds in other independent-minded regions, from Scotland to northern Italy.

Catalonia, which has its own language and culture, has long been an uneasy part of Spain, and aspirations for independence have surged and ebbed for generations. But Catalonia is also Spain’s economic engine, and Madrid is determined to hold onto it. The tug of war is now entering perhaps its most intense and unpredictable phase since the approach of the Spanish Civil War last century.

In 2014, the last time Catalonia held an independence vote, it, too, was declared illegal by Spain’s constitutional court. But Catalan officials described that vote as a straw ballot, and the government in Madrid and the police did not prevent it.

This time, sensing the growing seriousness of the Catalan referendum, which the regional government says will now be binding, Madrid is taking a far more aggressive tack.

The approach has left many Catalans bridling under what they say is a heavy hand by the government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy. The steps to intimidate people who back a vote not only may backfire, they argue, but also threaten to transform the conflict into a broad campaign of civil disobedience that could spiral out of control.

Tensions on the streets have mounted, along with political recriminations. While the separatists charge that Mr. Rajoy is taking Spain back to the dark days of Franco, Madrid warns that the separatists have shifted from violating Spanish law to encouraging civil strife.

In the interview, Mr. Puigdemont said the conflict would not turn violent, but he warned that Madrid would have to assume its share of the blame if things got further out of hand. “If you stop somebody from unfolding a banner that asks for more democracy, the problem is with the person who forces its withdrawal,” he said.

Even President Trump has weighed in, declaring that he supports a unified Spain after a meeting in Washington with the Prime Minister Rajoy. Mr. Trump took no position on whether the referendum should be held.

The swirl of competing pressures is perhaps nowhere greater than at the local level, among city and small-town mayors who must decide whether to host the voting.

On Monday, Joan Rabasseda, the mayor of Arenys de Munt, headed for a courthouse rather than his town hall because of his decision to ignore Spain’s government and constitutional court and help his residents vote. Mr. Rabasseda could be suspended from office if found guilty of civil disobedience — along with about 750 of the almost 950 mayors of Catalonia who have vowed to facilitate the referendum.

“Spain’s judiciary can go after me, but that’s only helping unite my town even more and increasing everybody’s determination to vote,” Mr. Rabasseda said defiantly.

Catalan officials who do not favor independence say that they, too, are facing intimidation — but from an increasingly aggressive pro-independence movement that wants them to go through with a vote declared illegal by Madrid.

With the referendum just days away, taking a side has become inescapable. In many ways, for Catalonia’s officialdom, it’s a case of be damned if you do and damned if you don’t.

“This conflict is forcing elected officials to walk into a cul-de-sac and then deal with very difficult consequences,” said Irene Rigau, a Catalan politician. “Whatever you do, you will be punished either by your citizenship or by the state.”

Separatist mayors must endorse the referendum, she said, because otherwise “nobody will vote for you again.”

“But if you stick to your promise,” she said, “the state could then never allow you to be a politician again.”

Ms. Rigau was among three senior Catalan government officials who were recently found guilty of civil disobedience for helping coordinate the nonbinding vote on Catalan independence in 2014.

This time, Spain’s judiciary is promising to punish anybody involved in organizing Sunday’s referendum. But for mayors like Mr. Rabasseda, the choice to go ahead with the ballot was simple, if potentially disastrous for him.

His was the first town in Catalonia to hold an independence straw ballot in 2009, at a time when secessionism had far less supporters than it now has. On Monday, a group of about 100 residents escorted their mayor to the courthouse in the nearby city of Mataró and sang the Catalan hymn as he entered the building. When he emerged, they repeatedly shouted, “We will vote!” and “Independence!”

A smaller number of mayors are complaining about suffering harassment and insults for refusing to turn their town hall buildings into polling stations. Their decision is forcing Catalonia’s separatist government to find alternative venues for a referendum whose logistics have already been seriously complicated by the Spanish police, who are seizing ballot papers and other election-related equipment.

While Mr. Rabasseda was in court, Josep Monràs, the mayor of the town of Mollet del Vallès, was filing a police complaint after a group of about 100 separatists surrounded his home last weekend and shouted insults. The protesters used a megaphone and also plastered secessionist posters on his house, Mr. Monràs said in a telephone interview.

He argued that Catalonia “isn’t viable as an independent state,” but that his opposition to the vote was in any case entirely justified by his duties as a Spanish mayor. “Every mayor takes office with a promise that includes respecting the Constitution,” he said.

Mr. Monràs, who has been mayor since 2004, said he had never before received such insults on his doorstep, including people calling him a fascist.

“There have always been people who defend different ideas using legitimate means, but there are now some who use instead coercion and insults,” he said. “It’s outrageous.”

Sunday’s referendum has widespread support in the smaller towns and villages of the Catalan hinterland like Arenys de Munt.

Photo

There, the owner of one fish distribution company had plastered a banner showing Josep Lluís Trapero, the head of the autonomous Catalan police force, who has become an icon of the region’s assertion of an independent identity since last month’s terrorist attacks in Barcelona, the region’s capital.

After a foreign journalist left a news briefing, frustrated that it was being held partly in Catalan, Mr. Trapero commented, “Well, very good, well, farewell.” His words have since been turned into a slogan by separatists who want to say the same to Spain.

But support for independence is far more limited in places like L’Hospitalet de Llobregat, the second-largest city in Catalonia, whose mayor, Núria Marín, has been leading the call for mayors not to be intimidated into hosting the referendum.

“I was elected to manage a city, not to provide ballot boxes,” she said in an interview. “Telling me that I should help people vote is a political and not a legal argument — and in this case it’s clearly not one that carries a lot of weight if made before a judge.”

Spain’s attorney general has warned Catalonia’s political leaders that they could be arrested at any time and face criminal charges for misusing public money to finance an illegal referendum.

The separatists, however, have lashed out at Madrid’s efforts to prosecute mayors and eventually, perhaps, thousands of other officials involved in their referendum. They say Mr. Rajoy is returning authoritarianism to Spain.

Mr. Rabasseda, the mayor of Arenys de Munt, said that Madrid’s clampdown has been disproportionate. He was prepared for a court battle, but acknowledged that his legal problems were worrying others, starting with his 86-year-old mother.

“She’s really upset and concerned,” he said. “For her, it’s a bit like returning to the past and the loss of all political freedom.”",Catalan Officials Are Squeezed as Madrid Tries to Stop Independence Vote,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/world/europe/catalonia-spain-referendum.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Angel Lazaro, 29, was hanging out with his friends (who call him Mayito) at Bar Roma , on the rooftop of a 1920s building in Old Havana. Mr. Lazaro hadn’t ended up at the bar from seeing it on the street. There was no sign outside indicating that a ride up in a rickety open-air elevator would lead him to one of the city’s most interesting watering holes.

Inside, the scene consists of creative types mingling with tourists over mojitos and rum cocktails. “To me, that was an indicator that Cuba was changing,” said Rose Cromwell, a photographer who has traveled to Cuba for over 12 years.

When Ms. Cromwell visited the bar, there was no bathroom. The residents living down the hall opened their homes to patrons for a small tip, a transaction in keeping with part of Cuba’s economy; many people run bed-and-breakfasts, restaurants and even clandestine clothing shops out of their houses.

In a country where clothing options are limited by a lack of imports, cultivating a singular style can be challenging. “People will bring clothes in bundles from Miami, Panama or Mexico and sell them up from their homes,” Ms. Cromwell said.

And when there is a particular trend, “you see it everywhere, it’s like wildflower,” Ms. Cromwell said. A few years back, she recalled, everyone was wearing the British flag: “It was just what they had made in China and had been manufactured on a large scale.”

Mr. Lazaro describes his style as “funk” and has tried to not follow these trends. He is one of the many Cubans who go to lengths such as making their own clothes, having relatives bring pieces from abroad or scouring local vintage spots.

“Often in Havana you will see people dressed in all white wearing multiple beads, covering their head and wearing socks,” Ms. Cromwell said. Here, Yairis, 19, is dressed in the traditional style of someone who has been “sainted” in Santeria, an Afro-Cuban religion with origins in the Caribbean. Part of the rite of passage is to wear all white for an entire year, which represents the process of rebirth and purification.

Alexis, 24, is a street vendor who sells odds and ends from a table in Old Havana. His sunglasses, fitted clothing, gold chains and fade haircut identify him as someone who listens to reggaeton, or “reggaetoneros,” as they are called in Cuba. “Men pay attention to detail in their grooming, from their beards or mustaches to their eyebrows and their haircuts,” Ms. Cromwell said. “You definitely see a high level of self-care, and barbershops are ubiquitous in Cuba.”

Some of those barbershops are in homes, like the one Roberto Alvarez, above, runs out of a rented space.

When he isn’t shaping men up, he is a rapper and goes by the stage name Robe L Ninho.

Don’t worry, be happy — it might make your flu shot more effective.

A new study suggests that older people who are in a good mood when they get the shot have a better immune response.

British researchers followed 138 people ages 65 to 85 who got the 2014-15 vaccine. Using well-validated tests in the weeks before and after their shots, the scientists recorded mood, stress, negative thoughts, sleep patterns, diet and other measures of psychological and physical health. They assessed their antibody response to the vaccine with blood tests at four and 16 weeks after their injections. The study is in Brain, Behavior, and Immunity.

Greater levels of positive mood were associated with higher blood levels of antibodies to H1N1, a potentially dangerous flu strain, at both four and 16 weeks post-vaccination. No other factors measured were associated with improved immune response.

The authors acknowledge they were not able to control for all possible variables, and that their observational study does not prove cause and effect.

The senior author, Kavita Vedhara, professor of health psychology at the University of Nottingham, said that many things could affect vaccine effectiveness, but most are not under a person’s control — age, coexisting illness or vaccine history, for example.

“It’s not there aren’t other influences,” she said, “but it looks like how you’re feeling on the day you’re vaccinated may be among the more important.”",An Upbeat Mood May Boost Your Flu Shot’s Effectiveness,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/25/well/live/an-upbeat-mood-may-boost-your-flu-shots-effectiveness.html

“We are doing everything we can to improve our efforts on the pedestrian ramps,” Ms. Trottenberg said.
She said that some curb ramps have crumbled or are too narrow, while others have such a steep incline that they could send a wheelchair flying into the street.
“Every single day, every move you make across New York City is limited by the city’s failure to take disability rights seriously,” Ms. Dooha said.
Other times, her wheelchair has been damaged by ramps that are uneven or have sharp edges.","The report recommends that the city complete a comprehensive survey within 90 days, and develop detailed plans for installing curb ramps that meet federal standards at all corners without ramps within five years, and for upgrading existing ramps within eight years. It also recommends that the court appoint a monitor to oversee the city’s progress.

Sid Wolinsky, a senior supervising attorney for Disability Rights Advocates, said that while many cities have inaccessible curbs, the problem is particularly bad in New York. He said that limiting the ability of those in wheelchairs to get around can lead to social isolation and fewer opportunities for jobs, education and civic participation. “New York City has a hostile environment for people with disabilities,” he said.

Disability Rights Advocates, representing a coalition of disability rights groups, has also challenged the accessibility of the city’s subway system in two discrimination lawsuits against the Metropolitan Transportation Authority over the scarcity of elevators and their frequent breakdowns. It has filed a lawsuit against Uber for providing scant access to wheelchair-accessible vehicles.

Polly Trottenberg, New York’s transportation commissioner, said that the city was committed to making every curb accessible and has made that a priority in its larger Vision Zero campaign to reduce pedestrian fatalities. But she added that it is a vast undertaking with 162,000 corners and more than 300,000 pedestrian ramps, and that the time frames recommended in the court-ordered report are unrealistic.

“We are doing everything we can to improve our efforts on the pedestrian ramps,” Ms. Trottenberg said. “We disagree on the timeline, but we agree on the goal of full accessibility of the sidewalks.”

Of the city’s 162,000 curb corners, only about 2,246 have no ramps, according to city officials. Most of them have complicating factors, such as catch basins, light poles, subway infrastructure or proximity to a historical property, which require extensive design and construction work that could take years to complete. For instance, the transportation department recently devised a temporary measure — an asphalt ramp — for a curb next to a subway entrance beside City Hall in Lower Manhattan until a permanent solution can be built.

In addition, about 116,000 of the corners with existing ramps require some work, ranging from minor repairs to a complete reconstruction, according to city officials.

Ms. Trottenberg said her department had already taken steps to improve its curb ramp program, including increasing funding by hundreds of millions of dollars and hiring dozens of workers. Later this year, the city plans to begin surveying every corner using the latest digital technology to create a comprehensive inventory that will be made publicly available on a website.

Susan Dooha, the executive director of the Center for Independence of the Disabled New York, said that while inaccessible curbs are a headache for many pedestrians — including parents with strollers and tourists with suitcases — they are particularly dangerous for those with disabilities. She said that some curb ramps have crumbled or are too narrow, while others have such a steep incline that they could send a wheelchair flying into the street. Other curbs lack any markers for the visually impaired to warn them that they are entering the street.

“Every single day, every move you make across New York City is limited by the city’s failure to take disability rights seriously,” Ms. Dooha said.

Monica Bartley, 62, a community outreach organizer for the independence center who uses a wheelchair, said that she had been late for appointments because she was unable to cross a curb and needed to retrace her path to find another place to cross. Other times, her wheelchair has been damaged by ramps that are uneven or have sharp edges.

“It’s frustrating because it creates problems,” she said. “Other people are able to go about their business without encountering any barriers.”","For the Disabled, New York’s Sidewalks Are an Obstacle Course",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/08/nyregion/new-york-city-sidewalks-disabled-curb-ramps.html

Read the latest on the Las Vegas shooting with Friday’s live updates.

The night began as a celebration. Thousands gathered in Las Vegas for one last night of song at a long-awaited country music festival. They had driven in from towns all over California. They had flown in from Alaska, Tennessee, West Virginia. They were teachers, police officers, secretaries, retirees.

Many had planned for weeks, even months, this weekend of relaxation. Some came with elaborate plans amid the music: a reunion with old friends, a wedding anniversary, even a marriage proposal.

Then came gunfire — sudden and rapid and seemingly endless. When it was over, 58 people had been killed and hundreds more injured, making the attack at the Route 91 Harvest Festival on Oct. 1 one of the deadliest mass shootings in American history.

The victims included 36 women and 22 men. The oldest was 67, the youngest 20. Here are their stories.

Hannah Ahlers

Hannah Ahlers, 34 and a mother of three, grew up listening to country music and was a huge fan. She went to the concert on Sunday with her husband, Brian Ahlers, whom she had met in high school. They had been married 17 years, and lived in Beaumont, Calif.

Her brother, Lance Miller, confirmed Ms. Ahlers’s death. Her family described her as having “loved life and people.”

“She was our sunshine,” they said in a statement.

She was a homemaker, an active member in her children’s schools and community, and was very involved with extracurricular activities, including her daughter’s volleyball team.

“She wasn’t too good for anybody,” Mr. Ahlers said. “Beautiful, inside and out.”

Heather Alvarado

Heather Alvarado, a wife and mother of three from Utah, had traveled with her family to attend the concert in Las Vegas.

“It is with heavy hearts that we acknowledge the passing of Heather Warino Alvarado, wife of Cedar City firefighter Albert Alvarado,” Sgt. Jerry Womack, a spokesman for the police department in Cedar City, Utah, said in a statement.

A GoFundMe campaign set up for Ms. Alvarado’s family described the 35-year-old as a wife, mother, sister, friend and “so much more.” She was “always the first to help out,” the page said, and “anyone she comes across she makes them feel like family.”

Dorene Anderson

Dorene Anderson, 49, of Anchorage loved ice hockey.

Or at least she loved the Alaska Aces, a minor league team whose fans were known for ringing cowbells painted with the Aces insignia to show their support during games.

“Dorene was our treasurer of the cowbell crew this past year and a wonderful, generous person who was a friend to many,” wrote Marie English, a fellow fan, on the fan club’s Facebook page.

She was also “the most amazing wife, mother and person this world ever had,” her husband, John Anderson, wrote in a statement issued by his employer, the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation.

He and his family members, Mr. Anderson wrote, are grieving.

So are Aces fans, who are holding a candlelight vigil for Ms. Anderson on Tuesday at the Sullivan Arena, where the Aces (who are moving to Maine) have played. “We ask you wear an Aces jersey, cowbell crew shirt, or anything cowboys-related,” read a post on the fan page. “Bring your cowbell.”

Carrie Barnette

With a small inheritance from her grandparents, whom she had helped care for during long illnesses, Carrie Barnette, 34, last year bought a home in Riverside, Calif. It was a personal milestone for the Disney food service employee.

A music festival aficionado of sorts, she had posted video of parts of this country music concert to Facebook, and noted that she was having more fun in Las Vegas than she had at Stagecoach, a California festival.

“That was Carrie,” a cousin, Janice Chambers, said. “She just liked to go out and do things.”

“We mourn a wonderful member of the Disney family: Carrie Barnette,” Disney’s chief executive, Robert Iger, said on Twitter on Monday night.

Ms. Barnette worked as a cook at the Pacific Wharf Cafe, a waterfront restaurant at a Disney park in Anaheim, and was the proud owner of a basset hound, Lucy.

“O.K. everybody I just entered Lucy in this,” she posted on Facebook last month, of a calendar contest to raise money for a local animal shelter. “I really hope she can win and make the cover.”

Jack Beaton

In the last photo that Jack Beaton posted on his Facebook page on Sunday evening, his companions can be seen lounging on the grass, holding beers and smiling at the camera, lights from the country music festival twinkling in the background.

“Day Three Route 91 Vegas!” he wrote in the caption.

Hours later, Mr. Beaton, of Bakersfield, Calif., was killed while shielding his wife, Laurie, from gunfire, his family said.

His father-in-law, Jerry Cook, told BakersfieldNow.com that Mr. Beaton had covered his wife’s body with his own, and was shot. “He told her he loved her,” he said. “Laurie could tell he was slipping. She told him she loved him and she would see him in heaven.”

Mr. Beaton, 54, was gregarious and always helping other people; a family man who adored driving his truck with his hat on sideways, Mr. Cook said.

Mr. Beaton’s son, Jake, paid tribute to his father on Facebook. “Lost my best friend,” he wrote. “I love you so much more than you could ever imagine. Please watch over our family. You will forever be remembered as our hero!”

Steve Berger

Whatever Steve Berger did, he always seemed to be at the top of his game.

He was an all-star high school basketball player in Wauwatosa, Wis., his father, Richard Berger, told MPR News, and went on to play for St. Olaf College in Minnesota. In 2007, his friend Josh Decker brought him to EFS Advisors, a company in Cambridge, Minn., where he would spend the last 10 years and earn accolades from Mpls.St.Paul Magazine and Twin Cities Business.

As a financial adviser, “Steve was able to touch thousands of lives, enhancing the ability of his clients to retire earlier and/or in a better financial position,” the company said in a statement.

Mr. Berger had three children, between the ages 8 and 15, and was in Las Vegas to celebrate his 44th birthday. The week before, he and his father had spoken about his bet on the Wisconsin-Northwestern football game, his father told The Las Vegas Review-Journal.

“I said, ‘Steve, be careful,’” his father recalled.

Candice Bowers

Photo

On Sunday night, Candice Bowers, 40, was taking a rare weekend away from her home and responsibilities in Orange County, Calif., listening to music with a friend at the Jason Aldean concert.

When the gunfire began, Ms. Bowers and her friend dove under a table, then became separated in the chaos, her grandmother, Patricia Zacker, told The Orange County Register. Ms. Bowers leaves behind three children and a large extended family, relatives said.

“Candice left this world doing what she loved, dancing to country music among loved ones,” a GoFundMe page begun for her children said. “She will be greatly missed by all who knew and loved her.”

Denise Salmon Burditus

Photo

Whenever Tony Burditus was away from Denise Salmon Burditus, his wife of 32 years, she sent him selfies, nearly always featuring one of her big, broad smiles.

“I can’t say enough — her smile,” Mr. Burditus, of Martinsburg, W.Va., said in an interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper. “If I was out of town or something I would get a selfie, on her way to the gym, or on her way to school. I would get a huge smile,” he said.

“If I didn’t get it, I would text her back and she would send me one back with a smile.”

That same smile beamed from a photo she and her husband took together in front of the music festival stage, not long before the shooting. She posted the photograph on Facebook.

As the shooting began, Mr. Burditus said the couple mistook the sound as pyrotechnics. “We stood there for a second and she asked me if it was gunfire and I told her, ‘No.’ And then it was during the second burst that we knew,” Mr. Burditus said. They tried to get away.

“I was leading her through the crowd,” he said. But she was shot, and Mr. Burditus said he “immediately knew her wound was fatal. She was unconscious from the time she was struck.” Ms. Burditus was 50.

Sandy Casey

Photo

Over the course of a carefree weekend in Las Vegas, they kept bumping into one another around the festival: at least a half dozen teachers, principals and school psychologists who worked for the Manhattan Beach School District in Southern California, taking a brief escape from their responsibilities to listen to live music.

The school district said on Monday that Sandy Casey, 34, a special-education teacher originally from Vermont, was killed in the shooting. The other staff members from the district were physically unharmed.

Ms. Casey taught middle school and had worked for the district for nine years, an energetic person who delighted in her students, the superintendent, Mike Matthews, said.

“She was a person who brings light wherever she is,” he said. “She has a classroom full of light and hope and caring.”

Ms. Casey’s fiancé, Chris Willemse, an instructional assistant for the district, was with Ms. Casey in Las Vegas. He wrote on Facebook: “As I sit and mourn such a beautiful life gone too fast, all I can say is look up and watch the birds fly high and free today, as that’s where I feel you smiling down upon all of us. I love you baby girl! Love you to pieces!”

Andrea Castilla

Photo

It seemed like the Route 91 Harvest Festival would be the perfect place for Andrea Castilla, a sales associate at Sephora in Huntington Beach, Calif., to celebrate her 28th birthday. Her sister, Athena, would be there with her fiancé, and Andrea and her boyfriend, Derek Miller, decided to join them.

And there was to be a surprise, according to People.com: Mr. Miller had been planning to propose.

He never had the chance. Ms. Castilla was killed in the attack, according to a text message from her aunt, Marina Castilla Parker, who posted photos to Facebook of Ms. Castilla beaming at the festival with her sister and their partners.

In an interview with People, Athena Castilla said she and her fiancé tried to keep Ms. Castilla from being stepped on after she fell. Athena said that strangers had helped put Andrea into the back of a truck for the drive to the hospital.

“I was holding onto her head and trying to keep her from losing so much blood, talking to her, kissing her, telling her she was going to make it,” Athena Castilla said. “We all did our best to help her get through it. We did the best we could.”

Denise Cohen

Photo

Denise Cohen was never bored, or boring. Ms. Cohen, 58, was the “life of the party,” her younger sister, Kristal Vogel, said: “the first one to be out and the last one to go to bed.”

She loved to be outdoors, whether on a beach or at a festival like Route 91, which she attended with her boyfriend, Derrick Taylor, who also died. She was particularly excited to see Jason Aldean, whom Ms. Vogel had seen live a few days before. “‘I can’t wait to see Jason Aldean’ — that’s all I heard all weekend,” Ms. Vogel said.

Ms. Cohen had two sons, both in their 30s, and lived in Carpinteria, Calif., near Santa Barbara. She had recently started working for Team HOA, a division of McFarland Financial that focused on homeowner association accounting.

Austin Davis

Photo

Austin Davis, 29, a pipe fitter from Riverside, Calif., made the trip to Las Vegas with Thomas Day Jr., a softball buddy who also died.

The two played “fast-pitch softball” together, Berta Garcia, the coed director for USA Softball of Southern California, told The Riverside Press-Enterprise. “Tom kind of guided him.”

A member of the United Association, the union representing pipe fitters, Mr. Davis “had a swing like no other,” another softball friend said.

After the shooting, Mr. Davis’ girlfriend, Aubree Hennigan, had posted urgent pleas for help on social media as she and his parents sought news of his whereabouts. Before receiving confirmation of his death, she wrote on Facebook: “My everything … Please come home to us.”

A “Homerun Derby” was being planned, in honor of Mr. Davis and Mr. Day. “I will be there for my man and I would love to see everyone,” Ms. Hennigan wrote.

Thomas Day Jr.

Photo

Thomas Day Jr., 54, was a contractor who worked in a branch of his father’s home-building business in Corona, Calif. He had traveled to Las Vegas to attend the concert with three of his grown children and a group of friends.

His father, Thomas Day Sr., said he received a call from his grandson late on Sunday: The three adult children and the friends were in hiding, the grandson said, but Mr. Day had been shot in the head.

The elder Mr. Day, who lives in Las Vegas, said his son, who was divorced, was a “great dad” who often attended concerts with his children.

He had not been able to see the body or bury his son. “They still have him,” he said.

Christiana Duarte

Christiana Duarte, 22, had a gorgeous singing voice. And she was much like her parents, a family friend, Danette Meyers, said. “She was very giving,” Ms. Meyers said.

Ms. Duarte had gone to the country music festival with her brother’s girlfriend, Ariel Romero. Both women were shot, Ms. Meyers said. Ms. Romero had been through surgery and was expected to recover, Ms. Meyers said.

Ms. Duarte’s father, Michael, is a longtime employee of the Los Angeles prosecutor’s office, where he has regularly consoled the victims of crimes and their families, she said. Now his own family was wrestling with loss.

“I can’t tell you how this has hit all of us,” Ms. Meyers said. “This is just unbelievable. This senseless, violent act is just killing us all.”

Stacee Etcheber

Photo

After the first round of shots, Stacee Etcheber’s husband, Vincent, told her to run, he told family members. An off-duty officer with the San Francisco Police Department, he stayed behind to try to help.

Then the second round came.

Mr. Etcheber’s father, Jean, who was babysitting the couple’s two children, 10 and 12, at their Novato, Calif., home, said the family was given confirmation of Ms. Etcheber’s death on Monday night.

Ms. Etcheber, 50, was a hairdresser whose Facebook profile picture shows her working on her beach handstand next to her daughter.

“Please pray for our family during this difficult time,” Ms. Etcheber’s brother-in-law, Al Etcheber, wrote on Facebook on Tuesday morning.

Brian Fraser

Brian Fraser, 39, was in his element at the Jason Aldean concert on Sunday night, his family said. He had just moved closer to the stage in the hopes that his favorite song, “Dirt Road Anthem,” was coming soon.

Moments later, he was fatally shot. His companions — his wife, Stephanie, and other family members and friends — survived.

“A bigger-than-life man taken far too soon,” his sisters-in-law wrote on a GoFundMe page. “Brian was a rock of love and support to his family.”

A vice president of sales for Greenpath, a mortgage firm, Mr. Fraser lived in La Palma, Calif., and graduated from California Polytechnic State University.

“Brian Fraser impacted everyone who crossed his path with his infectious positive energy, his tenacious will to succeed, and his willingness to help others,” his employer said in a statement.

Keri Galvan

Photo

Keri Galvan, of Thousand Oaks, Calif., had three children, and they were her world. On her Instagram page, she called herself a “super tired super mama of 3.” On Facebook, she posted a photograph of herself standing next to a new Lexus S.U.V., and wrote: “New baby to accommodate allllllllll the babies.”

“They always went to Disneyland together,” Isaac Galvan, her father-in-law, said. “She was just a great mother.”

The children are 10, 4 and 2, according to a GoFundMe page set up by Ms. Galvan’s sister, Lindsey Poole.

Ms. Galvan, 31, who had worked for a decade as a server at Mastro’s Steakhouse in Thousand Oaks, attended the music festival in Las Vegas with her husband, Justin Galvan, and some of their friends.

“Her days started and ended with doing everything in her power to be a wonderful mother,” Ms. Poole said.

Dana Gardner

Photo

Dana Gardner, the deputy recorder of San Bernardino County, Calif., began working for the county 26 years ago as a document clerk, a county spokesman, David Wert, said in an email. Ms. Gardner, 52, was “known for her ‘can-do’ attitude and vibrant energy,” Bob Dutton, the county’s assessor, recorder and clerk, wrote on Facebook.

“Everybody here is still in shock,” Mr. Dutton told The San Bernardino Sun. “They’re waiting for her to walk through the door.”

In a Facebook message, Kayla Gardner, Dana Gardner’s daughter, said: “She spent our whole childhood making sacrifices and doing anything and everything she could for us.”

She added later, “As we got older and became adults, for the first time in her life she stopped worrying about taking care of us and started to take care of herself. She started traveling, spending time with her friends, and enjoying her life the way she wanted. As her children, it was so enjoyable to see her so vibrant and full of life, and that is how we will always remember her.”

Angela Gomez

Photo

When the daughter of Angela Gomez’s cheerleading coach died four years ago, Ms. Gomez was quick to appear at the coach’s door to offer her sympathies. In an interview with The Press-Enterprise, her coach from Riverside Polytechnic High School, Lupe Avila, recalled Ms. Gomez, 20, as “one of the most genuine and loyal people you could ever meet.”

Ms. Gomez, a nursing student from Riverside, Calif. who was known as Angie, was in Las Vegas with her boyfriend when the shooting began.

Rocio Guillen

Rocio Guillen and her fiancé, Christopher Jaksha, left their two children with Mr. Jaksha’s parents for some rare time alone: a trip to Las Vegas to celebrate a friend’s birthday.

Each night they were away, they made video calls to say good night, blowing kisses at Sophia, 17 months, and Austin, who was born in August, said Mr. Jaksha’s mother, Donna.

“We Facetimed all weekend,” Ms. Jaksha said. “We would say ‘Look, it’s mommy and daddy. Look at the cowboy hats.’”

Ms. Guillen, 40, was shot in the thigh as she ran from the shooting with Mr. Jaksha. She was placed in a police car, and an officer applied a tourniquet, but she did not survive.

The couple met when they worked at a Chili’s restaurant as managers. They shared a home in Eastvale, Calif., and both worked at California Pizza Kitchen restaurants nearby as they planned for their wedding. Ms. Guillen has two sons from a previous marriage, according to Ms. Jaksha. “I already considered her to be my daughter-in-law,” Ms. Jaksha said.

Charleston Hartfield

Photo

Charleston Hartfield, 34, an off-duty Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department officer, had written a book not long ago. “Memoirs of a Public Servant,” was published in July and focused on his day-to-day work, his time on the force and his interactions on the streets of Las Vegas.

“Every time you talked to him, your life would be better,” Stan King, a friend whose son played football on a team, the Henderson Cowboys, that Officer Hartfield had coached. “You wished you were 10 percent of what that guy was.”

Officer Hartfield, who had served on the police force for 11 years, was memorialized in a candlelight vigil attended by hundreds.

Fellow officers and friends remembered the man they called Charlie or Coach Chucky, or even, occasionally, “Captain America” as knowledgeable and experienced, a patriot and a wit.

“I know that none of us here really planned on saying goodbye to Charlie so soon, but I’m glad we get to send him off in our way, not somebody else’s way,” said Steve Grammas, the president of the Las Vegas Police Protective Association.

Chris Hazencomb

Chris Hazencomb, 44, of Camarillo, Calif., had a modest birthday celebration with his mother, Maryanne Hazencomb, 69, last Wednesday. They ran errands, picked up fried chicken, and, as they did every Wednesday, watched an episode of “The Little Couple” that Mr. Hazencomb had recorded the previous day.

The mother and son had always lived together, and worked in tandem to care for Mr. Hazencomb’s father, who was ill for a decade before he died. Mr. Hazencomb had something to look forward to, as well: The Route 91 Harvest music festival, which he was attending with his best friend’s wife. (The best friend, it turned out, hated country music.)

Ms. Hazencomb got the news Sunday night. Mr. Hazencomb had been shot in the head. Ms. Hazencomb rushed to Sunrise Hospital, in Las Vegas, leaving Camarillo at 3 a.m. Mr. Hazencomb was on a ventilator, Ms. Hazencomb said, and officials told her he would not survive.

“He looked like he was sleeping,” Ms. Hazencomb said. Members of her extended family gathered in the hospital room. After getting last rites from the Catholic Church, he was taken off life support.

Ms. Hazencomb said her son had died shielding his best friend’s wife from bullets. “He’d give you the shirt off his back,” Ms. Hazencomb said.

Jennifer Irvine

Jennifer Irvine, 42, built her own legal practice in San Diego, specializing in family law. But there was also time for hobbies like snowboarding and Taekwondo — and for her friends and country music.

“She did go to a lot of concerts,” Jason Irvine, Jennifer’s brother, said, as he waited at the Las Vegas Convention Center to pick up her belongings.

Ms. Irvine had attended the festival in Las Vegas with a group of girlfriends, some of whom had posted pictures of their group, wearing jean shorts and cowboy boots, grinning in front of the festival banner.

“She was there with three other friends who were able to leave when it started, but unfortunately Jennifer was not one of those who was able to leave,” Mr. Irvine said.

Nicol Kimura

Nicol Kimura, 38, of Placentia, Calif., was part of a close-knit group of 16 friends who always spent time together, said Ryan Miller, one of the people in the group. To the children of those friends, Ms. Kimura was simply Auntie Nicol, he said — a playmate who was eager to host tea parties, color with them and craft.

“Just a beaming light,” Mr. Miller said in a telephone interview.

Seven of the friends went to the concert in Las Vegas; they had already been to several other concerts this year, but they were especially excited to attend the weekend’s Route 91 Harvest Festival, Mr. Miller said.

The group of friends was together when shots first rang out, Mr. Miller said. Soon, everyone had hit the ground.

As the gunfire continued, another friend, about 20 feet away, yelled out that Ms. Kimura had been hurt; she was bleeding from her side.

“We couldn’t pull her to safety,” Mr. Miller said.

Jessica Klymchuk

Jessica Klymchuk, 34, from the province of Alberta in Canada, had been visiting Las Vegas with her boyfriend, The Globe and Mail reported. She was a school librarian, a bus driver and the mother of four children.

Carly Kreibaum

Late Sunday afternoon, Carly Kreibaum’s Facebook page showed the smiling proof of a girls’ weekend in full swing: a picture of Ms. Kreibaum with two friends at the Venetian hotel in Las Vegas — a cafe, canal and gondolas in the background.

At the concert that evening, Ms. Kreibaum, 33, a mother of two from Sutherland, Iowa, was fatally shot, a family member said. Her friends survived.

Back in northwest Iowa, her small community of 600 has been in mourning for Ms. Kreibaum, who studied art education at Wayne State College in Nebraska and worked at Walmart.

She lived with her husband, Chris, and their children, Dalten and Cambri, on a farm just outside town, according to The Des Moines Register.

On Facebook on Tuesday, Mr. Kreibaum thanked family and friends for their support, saying he was en route to Las Vegas. A local church set up a fund for donations for the Kreibaum family, and on Wednesday evening, it opened up the church, inviting those who wanted to talk, pray or deal with their grief.

When Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans, Rhonda LeRocque flew down with other members of her church to help the victims.

At home in Tewksbury, Mass., her sister told The Boston Globe, she showed the same kindness and devotion to her husband, Jason, and their 6-year-old daughter. The three were together at the Route 91 festival when the shooting began.

Ms. LeRocque, 42, was active in her local Jehovah’s Witnesses church and worked for the design company IDEO, which confirmed her death in a Facebook post.

“For more than 10 years she cared for her work family at IDEO Cambridge with the same warmth, love and devotion she showed everyone in her life,” the company wrote. “Nobody helped us build community quite like Rhonda.”

Victor Link

When Victor Link, of Orange County, Calif., was struck by gunfire, he had his own rescue crew right beside him.

“Rob, his best friend, who is a firefighter and a paramedic, picked my son up and carried him to a safer place and tried to resuscitate him,” Mr. Link’s father, Loyd, said on Tuesday. “But it didn’t happen.”

Mr. Link, 55, worked in the financial services industry and lived with his partner, Lynne Gonzales. He had a son, Christian, from a previous marriage, his father said.

“My son took a bullet to the chest,” he said.

Jordan McIldoon, 22, a mechanic from Maple Ridge, British Columbia, was among the dead, a family member said. His parents described him to CBC News in Canada as outdoorsy, about to begin trade school, and on the trip to Las Vegas with his girlfriend. They were expecting him to return home on Monday evening.

“We only had one child,” they told CBC News. “We just don’t know what to do.”

Kelsey Meadows

There were two Ms. Meadows who were well known in the halls of Taft Union High School in Taft, Calif.: Stacy, who has worked at the school for 35 years, and Kelsey, her daughter, a substitute teacher.

Kelsey Meadows, who was 28, was killed in the shooting, leaving behind her parents, brother and sister-in-law, “along with an entire community that loved and respected her,” the school said in a statement.

The younger Ms. Meadows graduated from Taft Union High School in 2007 and returned in 2012 to work there as a teacher — alongside her mother, who worked in information technology. “Kelsey was smart, compassionate and kind,” Mary Alice Finn, the principal, said in an email. “She had a sweet spirit and a love for children.”

Brad Meadows, her brother, informed friends of her death on Facebook “with an absolutely shattered heart,” he wrote.

Calla Medig

Calla Medig could not stop chattering to her co-workers at Moxie’s Grill and Bar, a restaurant in Edmonton, Alberta, where she was a bartender and server, about her upcoming trip to Las Vegas.

“I even gave her a hard time because I don’t like country music,” said her boss, Scott Collingwood. “I told her, ‘You’re going to be out there two-stepping. And she said, ‘There’s nothing wrong with two-stepping!’”

Ms. Medig, 28, was a warm and funny presence in the restaurant, where she had worked for two years.

She was so dependable and levelheaded that when Mr. Collingwood couldn’t reach her by phone, text or Facebook in the aftermath of the shooting on Sunday night, he immediately feared the worst.

“Calla is super responsible,” he said. “I just knew.”

Ms. Medig was scheduled to fly back home on Wednesday. Thursday was important to her. It was to have been her first day at the restaurant after being promoted to manager.

Sonny Melton

When Sonny Melton and his wife, Heather Gulish Melton, heard the sound of gunshots in Las Vegas on Sunday night, he grabbed her and began to run.

“I felt him get shot in the back,” Ms. Gulish Melton told WCYB, a television station in northeast Tennessee. “I want everyone to know what a kindhearted, loving man he was, but at this point, I can barely breathe.”

Mr. Melton, 29, was described in Facebook tributes as a kind spirit, a registered nurse who worked for much of 2016 in the surgical unit at Jackson-Madison County General Hospital in Jackson, Tenn.

“He was a very kind, compassionate, genuine person who lived life to the fullest, and he took great care of our patients,” said Amy Garner, a spokeswoman for the hospital. Union University, a college in Jackson, Tenn., said Mr. Melton was a 2015 graduate of the school and worked in the emergency department at Henry County Medical Center.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a White House spokeswoman, said Mr. Melton and his wife had been married only a year and had traveled from Tennessee for the music festival.

“When the bullets began raining down from above, Sonny shielded her from danger, selflessly giving up his life to save hers,” Ms. Sanders said on Monday.

Pati Mestas

Not long before the shooting began, Pati Mestas posted a video on Facebook. It showed her jumping up and down in front of the stage at the Route 91 festival, having made her way up to the front of the crowd.

“That was the type of person she was,” her cousin Tom Smith said. “If you could do it and if it wasn’t wrong, she would do it.”

Ms. Mestas, 67, was partly retired from her job as a deli manager at a Shell convenience store in Corona, Calif., and was spending all the time she could with her three children, eight grandchildren and one great-grandchild, Mr. Smith said. He saw her in March, he recalled, and she had never seemed so happy.

“When she did something, she did it 100 percent,” Mr. Smith said. “She was faithful to her family, to her friends, a very strong Christian, and she couldn’t get enough out of life.”

Austin Meyer

Austin Meyer, 24, hoped to own an auto repair shop, his sister, Veronica Meyer, told KSBW, a television news station in Monterey, Calif.

Mr. Meyer had recently moved from his home near Monterey to Reno, Nev. to earn a degree in transportation technologies at Truckee Meadows Community College.

He was a fan of Bobby Bones and the Raging Idiots, one of the acts performing at the Route 91 festival, which he attended with his fiancée, Dana Getreu.

“He was a wonderful young man and my future son-in-law,” Ms. Getreu’s father, Gary Getreu, said in a statement released by the college. “The loss and grief his family and mine feel at this time is beyond belief.”

Adrian Murfitt

Adrian Murfitt, 35, had been working 16-hour days all summer as a commercial salmon fisherman in his home state of Alaska. It was time for a break.

He gathered up two of his childhood friends and booked tickets for a country music festival, just as he had done last year, according to his sister, Shannon Gothard.

“He had such a great time when he went before, and he wanted to treat himself for a successful fishing season,” Ms. Gothard said from Anchorage.

Mr. Murfitt was an Alaskan to the core. Since he was a toddler, he loved playing hockey, she said; he could fix almost anything mechanical; he was devoted to his dog, Paxson, a Western Siberian Laika.

Ms. Gothard said the family had pieced together her brother’s last minutes from Brian MacKinnon, a friend who was with him at the concert on Sunday night. “He was just having a good time, enjoying himself and got shot in the neck,” she said of her brother. A woman standing next to Mr. Murfitt was shot in the head, Mr. MacKinnon told the family. He watched as medics tried to resuscitate Mr. Murfitt, though the medics told Mr. MacKinnon to leave the scene for his own safety.

“Sadly, he died in my arms,” Mr. MacKinnon wrote on Facebook. “I don’t really know what else to say at this time. I’m really sorry.”

Rachael Parker

Rachael Parker, a police records technician from Manhattan Beach, Calif., was off duty when she was shot. She died in the hospital, the Manhattan Beach Police Department confirmed in a statement.

She was 33 and had worked at the department for 10 years.

Jennifer Parks

As children growing up in California, they were always together, so close that their names seemed to run together into one: Jenny-and-Bobby.

“She said, ‘I am going to marry Bobby,’” said Jennifer Parks’s aunt, Rhonda Boyle. “I guess she always had a little crush on him.”

They became high school sweethearts and later married. And they were together on Sunday night in Las Vegas, when Ms. Parks, 36, was fatally shot while attending the concert with her husband, Bobby Parks. Mr. Parks was wounded in the arm and a finger, her family said.

The Westside Union School District, where she worked, said Ms. Parks “will be remembered for her sense of humor, her passion for her work, her devotion to her students, and her commitment to continuing her own learning and to taking on whatever new projects came her way.”

Ms. Parks was a mother of two, a kindergarten teacher and a volleyball coach in Lancaster, Calif.

“She had a heart of gold,” Ms. Boyle said.

Carrie Parsons

Carrie Parsons, 31, a manager at the Seattle office of the employment firm Ajilon, was on a “girls trip” to the festival, a friend, Laura Cooper, told KOMO, a local television news station.

Ms. Parsons had posted photographs on social media and wrote “Night made,” after the performance of Eric Church, her favorite country music artist, KOMO reported.

Lisa Patterson

Photo

Lisa Patterson was determined that her three children, now 19, 17 and 8, would grow up to be fearless.

She pushed them to take part in school plays so that they would be confident taking risks. She drove them to softball practice so that they would learn teamwork. She made sure they performed community service, while juggling her own volunteer work and helping to run her husband’s small hardwood flooring business, without the aid of a housekeeper or nanny.

The trip to Las Vegas, with a group of mom friends from her church, was a departure for Ms. Patterson, 46, of Lomita, Calif., who was typically too occupied to take time out for herself. But her love of all types of music was well known to her friends and family, who would often be induced to sing with her in the car, loud enough to provoke looks from others sitting in traffic nearby.

The children, said her close friend, Deborah Beckman, learned to simply smile back.

“She has brought them up to really stand on their two feet,” Ms. Beckman said. “And I thank God because I think that will help them to be able to deal with it.”

John Phippen

When the gunfire began on Sunday night, John Phippen, and his son, Travis, followed the same urgent instinct: to try to save people.

John Phippen, 56, who ran a home remodeling company in Santa Clarita, Calif., and Travis, 24, an emergency medical technician, covered the bodies of strangers with their own. They crawled toward the wounded and used belts as tourniquets to try to stop their bleeding, his son said in a local television news interview.

Then John Phippen was shot.

“I got over there as fast as I could and I put my arm around him,” Travis Phippen said.

With the help of a bystander, they got John Phippen away from the area, but he did not survive.

“He told me that he loved me and he wanted everybody to know how much he loved them,” the younger Mr. Phippen said.

Melissa Ramirez

Photo

Melissa Ramirez, 26, grew up in California’s Antelope Valley amid a big and close-knit extended family that she often visited on weekends when she attended college, at California State University, Bakersfield.

Her love of country music drew her to the festival in Las Vegas, her cousin, Fabiola Farnetti, said on Tuesday. When the two were in high school, they spent summers working alongside Ms. Ramirez’s parents selling fruit and vegetables for a local farm company at flea markets in the area.

The daughter of Mexican immigrants who became United States citizens, Ms. Ramirez majored in business and had recently received a promotion at the car insurance company where she worked, her cousin said.

“She always helped her parents, and just wanted to be there,” Ms. Farnetti said.

The family had held out hope that she had survived the shooting, but her father identified her remains at the Las Vegas morgue early on Tuesday.

On her Instagram account, she posted photographs of her dog, a boxer, her young niece and, most recently, from her trip to Las Vegas.

Jordyn Rivera

Jordyn Rivera, 21, a health care management student at California State University, San Bernardino, spent part of last summer in London for the school’s study abroad program.

“We will remember and treasure her for her warmth, optimism, energy and kindness,” the university’s president, Tomas Morales, wrote in an email on Tuesday to employees and students.

A member of the health education honor society, Eta Sigma Gamma, Ms. Rivera was “a total sweetheart with piercing eyes & a beautiful smile,” a fellow student, Natasha Lavera, wrote on Facebook.

Ms. Rivera, of La Verne, Calif., had traveled to the concert with her mother, a friend told the Las Vegas Review-Journal.

She would have graduated next year.

Quinton Robbins

An aunt of Quinton Robbins, 20, who worked as a recreation assistant for the city of Henderson, Nev., wrote on Facebook that her nephew was among the dead.

“I can’t say enough good about this sweet soul,” the aunt, Kilee Wells Sanders, wrote of Mr. Robbins. “Everyone who met him loved him. His contagious laugh and smile.”

Outside of his job with the city of Henderson, a suburb of Las Vegas, Mr. Robbins coached flag football for 5-year-olds, his brother’s flag football team and softball teams. He also coached basketball along with his uncle at a high school, and was finishing certification to be a full-time coach for the Clark County School District.

Mr. Robbins had been thrilled to score tickets to the music festival. “He was a big country music fan and he and his girlfriend were excited to go,” said James DiNicola, Mr. Robbins’s friend and colleague at the Henderson recreational department. “It was a last-minute thing.”

Cameron Robinson

Cameron Robinson, 28, had taken Monday off from his job as a management analyst for the city of Las Vegas to attend the country music festival with his boyfriend, Bobby Eardley.

The creator of a smartphone app that eased navigation for attendees of the city government’s annual conferences, Mr. Robinson was a frequent volunteer at city events, and had been given a promotion last summer, according to Brad Jerbic, the city attorney for Las Vegas and a family friend.

“He was driven, but not so driven that he didn’t know how to enjoy life,” Mr. Jerbic said.

Mr. Robinson was shot in the neck, Mr. Jerbic said. He died shortly after 10 p.m. Sunday night, in Mr. Eardley’s arms.

Tara Roe Smith

Tara Roe Smith, 34, of Alberta, an educational assistant, was separated from her husband during the attack, according to The Edmonton Journal.

“Tara was an aide in my granddaughter’s preschool class,” wrote Viola Anderson, a resident of Okotoks, where Ms. Roe Smith lived, on a GoFundMe page set up by a friend. “She will be missed.”

The mother of two young sons, she grew up in Manitoba, where the community is “heartbroken,” a family friend told CTV Manitoba.

“It is with sadness, shock, and grief that we confirm the loss of a Foothills School Division staff member,” John Bailey, superintendent of the school district where Ms. Roe Smith worked, wrote in a statement posted on the district’s website. “Our thoughts are with the family and friends of those affected by this unimaginable attack.”

Lisa Romero-Muniz

Last year, Lisa Romero-Muniz’s husband, Chris, forgot their wedding anniversary. This year he was determined to make it up to her.

So he made a grand gesture, planning a four-day weekend in Las Vegas and buying tickets to see her favorite country singer, Jason Aldean. Mr. Muniz, who worked long hours at a refinery, and Ms. Romero-Muniz, 48 and a high school secretary in Gallup, N.M., left on Thursday for Las Vegas, more than a six-hour drive away.

“She was beyond excited,” said Rosie Fernandez, her friend and supervisor at the high school where they worked. “For her husband to remember her anniversary and do all of that, this was a big thing for her.”

Ms. Romero-Muniz’s death, confirmed by officials at the school where she worked, left her colleagues and community shaken, her co-workers said.

Born and raised in the small city of Gallup, she was a mother of three grown children and a secretary at Miyamura High School, where she was responsible for disciplining students who got into trouble. Ms. Romero-Muniz had a warm personality and a big laugh, always teasing her co-workers, Ms. Fernandez said.

“We were known as the two loudmouths of the office,” Ms. Fernandez said. “She knew 90 percent of the kids at this school. She would talk to them like she was talking to her own children. I’d hear her saying, ‘I know you can do better than this.’”

On Monday morning, administrators put up posters around the school so that students could write on them how they were feeling. A candlelight memorial is planned for Monday evening.

Christopher Roybal

Christopher Roybal went to the concert with his mother, Debby Allen, to celebrate his 29th birthday.

The two had become separated at the event, Ms. Allen told local television stations, and when the gunfire started, she ran but then tried to return to the festival grounds to look for him.

“I just kept saying, ‘My son, my son, where is my son?’” Ms. Allen said. “This guy wouldn’t let me go back in. He goes: ‘You have to run away from the gunfire, not towards the gunfire.’”

Mr. Roybal had recently moved to Denver from Colorado Springs, where he was the general manager at a Crunch gym, which announced his death on its Facebook page.

He was a Navy veteran who had served stints in Afghanistan. In a Facebook post in July, he had recalled the emotions of battle: “The anger stays, long after your friends have died, the lives you’ve taken are buried and your boots are placed neatly in a box in some storage unit.”

Brett Schwanbeck

Growing up in Arizona with five siblings, Brett Schwanbeck, 61, was a brother who loved to joke around and have fun. He had the most beautiful smile ever, his sister, Robin Martin, said. “He was very, very full of life,” she said.

Mr. Schwanbeck had gone to the Route 91 festival with his fiancée, Anna Orozco, who he had been planning to marry in January. Photographs of the couple on Facebook show them posing on the concert grounds, the gleaming Mandalay Bay resort in the background.

Mr. Schwanbeck, a retired truck driver who lived in Bullhead City, Ariz., had met Ms. Orozco in high school in Ash Fork. Their romance blossomed much later.

Ms. Martin said she tried to speak to her brother after the shooting while he was on life support in the hospital, hoping that he could hear her.

“Family meant everything to him,” she said.

Bailey Schweitzer

At Infinity Communications and Consulting, the Bakersfield, Calif., company where Bailey Schweitzer worked as a receptionist, Ms. Schweitzer “was always the ray of sunshine in our office on a cloudy day,” Fred Brakeman, the company’s president, said. “No one could possibly have a bad day when Bailey was around. If you have ever called or visited our office, she was the perky one that helped direct you to the staff member you needed.”

Before graduating, Ms. Schweitzer was a cheerleader at Centennial High School in Bakersfield and a frequent volunteer at the Bakersfield Speedway, which her family owned, The Bakersfield Californian reported. A co-worker, Katelynn Cleveland, told the newspaper that Ms. Schweitzer, 20, had been looking forward to the Route 91 music festival for weeks.

Laura Shipp

The staff at the Chili’s restaurant in Arroyo Market Square in Las Vegas knew it was Friday when Laura Shipp, 50, took her seat by the bar and ordered her favorites: Smoked wings and a Presidente Margarita.

“Like clockwork she would be there Friday night, first seat at the bar,” said Chris Atkinson, a manager at the restaurant, over a Facebook message.

The wings were not the only draw. Ms. Shipp’s son, Corey, 23, a marine reservist, was a bartender and server there, and she liked to be around him. She was so well-liked, Mr. Atkinson said, that he and Corey’s other friends took to calling her “Mama Shipp.” And Corey Shipp liked having her around.

“These two seemed like, even if they weren’t family, they would still be best friends,” Mr. Atkinson said.

Corey Shipp moved to Las Vegas first, and Laura Shipp followed. “Corey was her only and Laura was his only,” said Steve Shipp, 47, Ms. Shipp’s brother, who confirmed her death.

They loved the Dodgers and country music, which is what brought them to the festival. Corey Shipp was not harmed, but he could not find his mother despite a frantic search that involved many members of the Chili’s staff.

“It took about 28, to 30 hours, just even to figure out that she had passed,” Mr. Shipp, the brother, said.

Erick Silva

Photo

The security staff working at the Route 91 festival were the first to help, and Erick Silva, 21, of Las Vegas was one of them. Mr. Silva, who was assigned to a position near the front of the stage, began trying to help audience members escape over a barricade.

As he worked to usher others away, he was shot, and was later pronounced dead in the hospital, Jay Purves, the Nevada vice president of Mr. Silva’s employer, Contemporary Services Corp., said in an email.

Two other C.S.C. employees were also shot, but they survived, Mr. Purves said. “Watching the many video clips on YouTube and social media, you see our men and women in the yellow shirts jumping right into the middle of the chaos as it started to help those who were shot.”

Mr. Silva worked long hours on the job. “When he wasn’t helping me, he would always go where he was needed the most to help out in any way possible,” James Garrett, a co-worker, wrote in a Facebook tribute.

“He never complained about anything.”

The company will name one of its training centers after Mr. Silva, Mr. Purves said.

Susan Smith

Susan Smith, 53, was a lover of country music, a devoted mother to a son and daughter, a wife and a popular office manager at an elementary school in Simi Valley, Calif.

“A wonderful person,” said her father, Tom Rementer, through tears.

She had gone to Las Vegas with friends. They survived the shooting.

Brennan Stewart

Photo

A year ago, Brennan Stewart posted on Facebook a video of himself performing the country song “You Should Be Here.” It has gone viral in recent days. Grieving families and friends — and not just his — have seen it as a touchstone after the Route 91 shooting.

In his original post on Oct. 4, 2016, Mr. Stewart wrote that he had taken a “slower approach” to the song, written by the musician Cole Swindell in 2015 after the death of his father. “Thoughts on this one!?” Mr. Stewart asked.

“Solid performance. Rest in peace, Brennan,” read one of dozens of recent replie+s on the old thread.

A tribute to the love of country music that propelled Mr. Stewart, 30, of Las Vegas, and so many others to the music festival, the video has been shared over a thousand times.

“This is one of those moments that’s got your name written all over it,” Mr. Brennan sings. “You know that if I had just one wish, it’d be that you didn’t have to miss this.”

“You should be here.”

Derrick Taylor

A California corrections officer in charge of inmates who volunteer to fight forest fires, Derrick Taylor, 56, of Oxnard, Calif., had been stationed in the northern tip of the state last month, where a fire had been burning for weeks.

He made it home just in time to leave for the trip he had planned with his girlfriend, Denise Cohen, to attend the music festival in Las Vegas. The couple both died in the attack. In his job and in his personal relationships, Mr. Taylor, his younger son Kyle, 31, said, was kind, generous — and honest.

When he was in college, the younger Mr. Taylor recalled, his father sometimes called to make sure he was in class. He also insisted that his grandchildren leave video games behind while he escorted them to the park or on hikes. Friends the younger Mr. Taylor had not heard from since high school contacted him after hearing about his father’s death. They remembered him as a kind of “second dad.”

“He was someone who cares enough to hold you accountable,” Mr. Taylor said, “for who you could be and who you should be.”

Neysa Tonks

Neysa Tonks, 46 and a mother of three from Las Vegas, had brought “so much joy, fun and laughter” to her workplace, according to her employer, Technologent.

Her father, Chris Davis, told The Las Vegas Review-Journal that Ms. Tonks was a devoted parent to her sons, Kaden, Braxton and Greysen, and a generous member of her community, every year delivering hundreds of backpacks with supplies to people who needed them.

Michelle Vo

Michelle Vo was one of those people who didn’t waste time.

In the last few months, she was a whirlwind of new hobbies — paddle boarding, golf, even surfing, said a close friend, Casey Lubin. She had already been all over Europe and Southeast Asia. Next on her list was Iceland — she was determined to travel there by herself.

Ms. Vo and Ms. Lubin had met through a mutual friend. “He was like, ‘You have to meet this girl, the two of you are meant to be friends,’” Ms. Lubin said. “She’s like a shark. She’s a go-getter. She’s so inspiring.”

Ms. Vo, 32 and an insurance agent from Los Angeles, was by herself at the concert on Sunday when she befriended a stranger, Kody Robertson, of Ohio. Ms. Vo was standing next to Mr. Robertson when she was shot.

Kurt Von Tillow

Kurt Von Tillow, 55, was “the most patriotic person you’ve ever met,” his brother-in-law, Mark Carson, told KCRA, a local NBC News station for Cameron Park, Calif., the small town in the Sierra foothills near Sacramento where Mr. Von Tillow lived.

Mr. Von Tillow had traveled to Las Vegas for the concert with family members. His wife and daughter escaped unharmed, Mr. Carson said. Mr. Von Tillow’s sister was shot in the thigh and his niece in an ankle. Both were expected to recover.

Mr. Von Tillow’s wife told family members she was herded out of the area by the authorities amid the chaos of the shooting scene, Mr. Carson said. “That was probably the hardest part for her — having to leave him there,” he said.

On Monday, friends and family gathered at the Cameron Park Country Club, where Mr. Von Tillow was a member. At his home, family members set up a memorial with an American flag, and played the national anthem.

“Guarantee you, he’s covered in red, white and blue right now, with a Coors Light in his hand, smiling with his family and listening to some music,” Mr. Carson told the television station.

Bill Wolfe Jr.

Bill Wolfe Jr., a wrestling and Little League coach in Shippensburg, Pa., went to Las Vegas with his wife, Robyn, to celebrate their wedding anniversary. Only Robyn came home.

“It is with the most of broken hearts, the families of Bill Wolfe Jr. and his wife Robyn share that Bill has been confirmed to be among the deceased as a result of the mass attack in Las Vegas,” the Shippensburg Police Department said on Facebook. “Please continue to hold our entire family as well as those affected across the nation in your unending prayers.”

Mr. Wolfe, 42 and a coach at Shippensburg Greyhound Wrestling, was also an employee of the engineering consulting firm Dewberry and a former president of the Shippensburg Wrestling Booster Club.

“He was just a good guy,” the current president of the booster club, Cory Forrester, told Penn Live. “He was a go-to kind of guy, a guy you could depend on, a kind of guy you could be proud to be around.”",The Victims of Las Vegas: Remembering Their Lives,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/02/us/vegas-victims-names.html

That’s where Plenaster craigi could prove to be useful as an indicator species because of its abundance, she says.
“Every animal you collect from the seafloor seems to be a different species,” Dr. Vanreusel said.
“For three years we were calling them sponge species A,” Dr. Glover said.
Then in 2015, Dr. Lim participated in the second expedition to the area allocated to Singapore and began working with Dr. Glover to identify and classify the sponges.","Stace Beaulieu, a deep-sea biological oceanographer at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, who was not involved in the study, said: “This is exciting because it is not only a new species but a new genus.” That is akin to discovering not just dogs, but a larger group that includes wolves, coyotes and jackals.

For small organisms in the C.C.Z. like Plenaster craigi, “pretty much everything collected is new,” said Diva Amon, a deep-sea biologist who also participated in Dr. Smith’s expeditions but was not involved in the study. Dr. Amon has reported several new species from the expeditions. But this discovery is “incredibly important,” she said. “This is one of the most abundant animals found living on the nodules and we didn’t even know it existed.”

In the last 40 years, over a hundred scientific expeditions have visited the C.C.Z. where metal-containing nodules lie half-buried on the seafloor. The nodules are lumps of rock that contain various metals including iron, copper, nickel, manganese and cobalt. “They range in size from golf balls to big potatoes,” says Mark Hannington, a marine geologist at Geomar Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel in Germany. “Because they are loose, you can just scoop them up with a grater.”

The International Seabed Authority governs the seafloor outside of sovereign waters and has allocated 15 areas for exploration in the C.C.Z. to several companies affiliated with nations that include China, Japan, Singapore, Tonga and those in the European Union. A few dozen exploration licenses have been granted, but none for actual mining yet.

Plenaster craigi grow on the nodules and are vulnerable if mining for nodules commences. “We have collected a few hundreds of this sponge species and they were only found attached to the nodules,” Dr. Lim said.

“The C.C.Z. is a soft sediment habitat so the hard surfaces are limited,” Dr. Beaulieu said. While almost nothing is known of Plenaster craigi – what they eat, how they reproduce, where they are distributed – most sponge species, like corals, have to find hard surfaces to settle down on and grow while they are young, she said.

But the C.C.Z. is so vast, Dr. Glover believes that it is more likely large areas would be left undisturbed. The International Seabed Authority has already reserved wide swaths of seafloor for protection and commissioned large-scale exploration studies to establish life on the seafloor. “To get to the point where you can make informed decisions, you need to know what animals live there,” Dr. Glover said.

More pressing are the huge sediment plumes that mining activities will generate, says Ann Vanreusel, a marine biologist at Ghent University in Belgium. That’s where Plenaster craigi could prove to be useful as an indicator species because of its abundance, she says. “Every animal you collect from the seafloor seems to be a different species,” Dr. Vanreusel said. An organism that will clearly be disturbed from the plumes and abundant enough to count such as Plenaster craigi could help researchers figure out the effects of deep-sea mining and perhaps even the possibilities for recovery, she said.

“They can almost act like a canary,” Dr. Amon said.

But the key, Dr. Hannington said, is that deep-sea mining may not be economically viable. “Nobody has proved it can be done,” he said. Many details, like whether the metals can be extracted from the marine ore, still need to be worked out, he said. “If it turns out that marine mining is not economically feasible, all of the other problems go out the window.”

Dr. Glover’s team first noticed Plenaster craigi while on the 2013 expedition to the exploration area allocated to the United Kingdom. “For three years we were calling them sponge species A,” Dr. Glover said. Then in 2015, Dr. Lim participated in the second expedition to the area allocated to Singapore and began working with Dr. Glover to identify and classify the sponges. Now, Dr. Lim has begun work on a second sponge species growing on the nodules, while Dr. Glover is preparing an extensive study on deep sea mollusks.

The researchers are racing against time to study life on the seafloor while being limited not only by sample collection, but also a lack of scientists with the expertise to characterize and classify new species, Dr. Beaulieu said. “It takes a lot of time, one by one by one, to describe a new species,” she said, “and there are still so many to go.”",New Species of Sponges Found on the Pacific Seafloor,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/science/sponges-species-pacific-ocean.html

The busy hurricane season of 2017 has given fresh purpose to a president who, until now, made most of his own weather inside the West Wing. On Tuesday, he said he would visit Puerto Rico and the storm-ravaged Virgin Islands next week. The White House issued photos of a grave-looking Mr. Trump being briefed in the Situation Room.

But the hurricanes are yet another reminder of this president’s rare capacity for self-congratulation — a trait that seems particularly ill-suited to the aftermath of deadly disasters, when the plight of people who lost homes or even family members would seem to take precedence over testimonials to FEMA.

From the start, Mr. Trump has had trouble separating himself from the story. On his first visit to Texas after Hurricane Harvey swamped Houston, the president went to a firehouse in Corpus Christi, nearly 220 miles away, for a briefing with federal, state and local officials that stopped just short of being a pep rally. “We’ll congratulate each other when it’s all finished,” he told the group.

Outside, he greeted a crowd of about 1,000 who had gathered by saying, “What a crowd! What a turnout!”

Four days later, Mr. Trump returned to the state — this time, to meet actual victims of the storm. He handed out cardboard boxes with hot dogs and potato chips to residents in Houston, and talked about the love he had seen in the NRG Center, a convention center converted into a shelter for nearly 1,200 people. But he could not resist a victory lap.

“They’re really happy with what’s going on,” he told reporters traveling with him. “It’s something that’s been very well received. Even by you guys, it’s been very well received.”

In Florida, after Hurricane Irma roared up the Gulf Coast, Mr. Trump seemed more at ease in his role as a consoler. At a ruined mobile home park in Naples, he handed out encouragement along with hoagies. But when one man yelled, “Where was Obama during the last hurricane? On a golf course,” Mr. Trump stopped and asked whether he had voted for him.

“Best vote of your life?” the president said, with a grin.

Puerto Rico, unlike Texas and Florida, is not Trump country. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida trounced him in the Republican primary there in March 2016. And Mr. Trump has been noticeably less vocal about the damage from Hurricane Maria. Over the weekend, as Puerto Ricans ran perilously low on food, water and fuel, he posted nothing about the crisis.

Yet he posted 17 tweets about sports — from the dispute he single-handedly revived over the N.F.L. and the national anthem to his withdrawal of an invitation for Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors to visit the White House. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump denied that he had neglected Puerto Rico in favor of his feud with professional athletes.

“I’ve heard that before: ‘Was I preoccupied?’” he said. “Not at all, not at all. I have plenty of time on my hands. All I do is work.”

Some residents of the Virgin Islands, parts of which were leveled by Irma, feel similarly overlooked by Washington. Kenneth E. Mapp, the governor, assured them that Mr. Trump had told him he “loves the Virgin Islands.”

When the president finally did get around to addressing Puerto Rico, on Monday, he led off with some unsympathetic observations about the territory’s well-publicized fiscal problems.

“Texas & Florida are doing great but Puerto Rico, which was already suffering from broken infrastructure & massive debt, is in deep trouble,” he said in a series of tweets. “It’s old electrical grid, which was in terrible shape, was devastated. Much of the Island was destroyed, with billions of dollars owed to Wall Street and the banks which, sadly, must be dealt with. Food, water and medical are top priorities – and doing well.”

On Tuesday, Mr. Trump said he had deployed Navy ships to Puerto Rico. His homeland security adviser, Thomas P. Bossert, and the FEMA administrator, Brock Long, traveled there to meet with officials. But even then, Mr. Trump said less about the resilience of the people than about the territory’s problems. The federal government, he said, had to take over some security because police officers, having lost their homes, had gone off duty.

After his news conference, Mr. Trump tweeted, “America’s hearts & prayers are with the people of #PuertoRico & the #USVI. We will get through this — and we will get through this TOGETHER!”

To the extent that Mr. Trump lauded Puerto Rican officials, however, it was for their praise and gratitude for his administration’s efforts.

“We have had tremendous reviews from government officials, as we have in Texas and Louisiana, and as we have in Florida,” Mr. Trump said, singling out Greg Abbott of Texas and Rick Scott of Florida as “great governors.”

For a moment, it looked like he would pay a similar tribute to the governor of Puerto Rico, Mr. Rosselló.

“The governor has been so incredible in his,” Mr. Trump said, pausing a beat, “in his statements about the job we’re doing.”",Trump Rates His Hurricane Relief: ‘Great.’ ‘Amazing.’ ‘Tremendous.’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/26/us/politics/trump-puerto-rico-hurricane.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

How the Cowboys perform when they return, on Oct. 22 against the winless 49ers, will help reshape their season.","And yet, the Cowboys’ defense has not forced a takeaway in three consecutive games, and it has yielded scores on 14 of 18 possessions – six touchdowns, eight field goals – excluding the Rams’ kneeldown at the end of that game. Dallas’s offense has scored on seven of its last eight first-half possessions across these past two losses but has sputtered after halftime, managing two touchdowns and a field goal. Even when Dallas did score in the second half Sunday, going ahead late by 31-28, it mismanaged the clock.

Given 73 seconds and a timeout to guide Green Bay into field-goal range, Rodgers thought it better just to keep on going, to throw for a touchdown and finish the darn thing, and because he is Aaron Rodgers, that is what he does.

“Can I say the F word?” said Dallas defensive lineman David Irving, when asked to convey the difficulty of defending Rodgers. Quickly adding, with a chuckle: “That guy is awesome at what he does. It takes everybody to stop one guy.”

That is both a platitude and a keen bit of insight. As precise a passer as Rodgers is when throwing from the pocket, all the Cowboys wanted Sunday was to contain him there. The danger he poses when he scrambles, when he improvises, can be measured by his absurd 35-yard sideline completion, on third and 20, that set up the winning field goal in last season’s divisional playoff round.

But that was then, and the Cowboys are loath to discuss last season. It’s behind them, and all that. If they were destroying teams instead of getting clobbered by Denver and blowing halftime leads to Green Bay and the Rams, and if their offensive line were creating those same wide creases for Elliott instead of being manhandled across the first three quarters Sunday, and if they were zipping toward 13-3 again instead of explaining three defeats in five games, they might be more likely to elaborate on those comparisons.

Since they are not, the Cowboys were left to address less appealing things, such as how their offensive highlight of the game – the go-ahead drive that took 17 plays and consumed 8:43 of the fourth quarter – came to unmoor them. It was the last two plays of that drive that seemed to haunt Jones afterward.

On second and 2 from the Green Bay 11 with 1 minute 24 seconds left, Prescott threw an incomplete fade to Dez Bryant. Had the Cowboys run, they would have forced Green Bay to take its final timeout or, at the least, drained another 35 or 40 seconds off the clock.

Prescott then faked a handoff and ran for a touchdown. He could have slid at the 1-yard line, wasting more time and giving Dallas first and goal and four chances to breach the goal line.

Passing up a touchdown in that situation would have run counter to Prescott’s instincts – “it’s important to get in the end zone and put the pressure on them,” he said – and Coach Jason Garrett said afterward that he agreed with Prescott’s decision.

Jones appeared less certain.

“What we all wanted to do was to keep the ball away from him, but obviously we need to score a touchdown,” he said, referring to Rodgers. “We’ll be second-guessing those last two calls – and I know you will, as well – for a long time.”

The clock showed 1:13. As expected, the Packers said afterward they were confident that they would score, and the Cowboys said they were confident that they would prevent Rodgers from scoring. But had the fans been polled, they almost certainly would have deemed the outcome as inevitable.

“It looked really easy,” said receiver Davante Adams, who caught two of Rodgers’s three touchdown passes. “Sometimes it’s not always as easy as it looks, but he makes it look that way.”

The best players display their brilliance in ways overt and subtle, and on third and 8 from the Cowboys’ 30 and with the pocket collapsing, Rodgers slipped free from Benson Mayowa and rolled left, where he felt Irving’s arms around his ankles.

In the past, that effort might have been enough to bring down Rodgers. But he has been ever more cognizant of his running style – how, sometimes, he does not pick his knees up, which leaves him susceptible to getting tackled from behind. High-stepping out of the tackle, Rodgers scampered for 18 yards, to the Dallas 12.

On the next play, Rodgers couldn’t connect on a fade to Adams, covered by Jourdan Lewis, but he and Adams shared a glance. “Let’s do it, again,” Adams told Rodgers. The quarterback amended the formation, and the ball was over Lewis’s head and into Adams’s hands before Lewis could even turn.

“He threw it exactly where it had to be,” Lewis said.

Lewis, a rookie, had three pass deflections in an otherwise excellent game. But in tone and in substance, his lament was familiar.

Once again, the Cowboys could not stop Rodgers. Once again, they staggered in the second half. Once again, they scored 30 points and gained more than 400 yards and still lost. According to the N.F.L., the rest of the league combined has two such losses.

Dallas has yet to play Atlanta, Kansas City, Oakland or Seattle. Or division rivals Philadelphia and Washington – twice. Next week, the Cowboys get a reprieve.

The bye allows teams to reflect and assess all that has gone wrong and right. The Cowboys are bound to examine a running attack whose early struggles have put more of an onus on Prescott, and a defense that buckles at the game’s pivot points.

Mr. Mueller was appointed in May, after the firing of the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, and was given broad latitude to investigate Mr. Trump and his associates. But the statute under which he was appointed affords Mr. Mueller, or other future special counsels, few formal job protections. If he wished, Mr. Trump could order top Justice Department officials to fire Mr. Mueller.

Supporters of the Judiciary Committee measures repeatedly alluded on Tuesday to comments and actions made by Mr. Trump about the investigation that they said made their work necessary. Most saliently, in a late-July interview, Mr. Trump told The New York Times that Mr. Mueller’s team was rife with conflicts of interest and warned that investigators would be crossing a red line if they began to look at Trump family finances beyond any relationship to Russia.

Separating themselves from the Republicans, committee Democrats said those comments, and Mr. Trump’s repeated hostility toward investigators, made the need for action urgent.

“Simply put, I have strenuous concern about President Trump’s respect for the rule of law,” Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the committee’s ranking Democrat, said in an opening statement. “The president must know that Congress will not stand idly by if he attempts to undermine independent criminal investigations.”

The committee’s chairman, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, did not make his leanings toward the bills known, but he made clear in his opening statement that he saw an important role for Congress to oversee special counsel investigations.

The Judiciary Committee is one of several congressional committees investigating Mr. Trump’s links to Russia. The committee’s particular interest stems from Mr. Comey’s firing, but it has outlined a broad investigation into several other matters, from the Obama Justice Department’s handling of the Hillary Clinton email case to Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign.

Tuesday’s discussion frequently returned to a 1988 Supreme Court case that weighed the constitutionality of the now-expired independent counsel statute, put in place after the Watergate scandal. In the ruling, the court voted 7 to 1 that the counsel statute did not violate the separation of powers doctrine and was therefore lawful.

But the decision came with a powerful dissent from Justice Antonin Scalia, which in the years since has gained a widespread following.

Independent counsels, such as Kenneth W. Starr, had considerably broader powers and more latitude than today’s special counsels, but the constitutional scholars and members of the committee repeatedly used the decision and the dissent to make arguments for and against the constitutionality of the proposed protection bills.

Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah, both Republicans, appeared most skeptical that the bills were constitutionally supportable.

“The overriding concern I have whenever we are talking about this area is that bad things happen when we depart from the three-branch structure of the federal government,” Mr. Lee said.

But, he added, Amtrak had long regarded disrupting weekday service as anathema, and that practice hampered its ability to carry out station improvement projects. “We just got to a point this year,” he said, referring to the summer shutdown of multiple tracks, where Amtrak “needed to accelerate the work inside the station, and that’s exactly what we did.”

Amtrak executives said that the summer repairs were a success — accomplishing in weeks what otherwise might have taken months or years — and hinted that the railroad might try that method again.

After full service at Penn Station was restored early last month, the chairman of Amtrak, Anthony R. Coscia, said a backlog of repairs might mean future shutdowns and disruptions. “We’ve got a lot more work to do, and there’s a lot to catch up on,” he said at a business gathering. “The work we’ve done is hardly the cure for everything that ails Penn Station.”

But the railroad will still have to balance competing demands. Because only a limited number of tracks can be taken out of service at once in Penn Station, any priority given to one project affects what can be accomplished on another.

Amtrak, which owns the station and leases space to other transit operators, regularly granted priority shutdown time in recent years for work on the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s $10.1 billion effort to connect the Long Island Rail Road with Grand Central Terminal — a project that would ease the burden on Penn’s tracks. Amtrak also gave track time to Brookfield Properties, a private development company, as it erected a high rise.

On the west side of the station, the largest amount of shutdown time went to the conversion of the James A. Farley Post Office Building, near Penn, into the Moynihan Station passenger hall.

Contractors for the project were not working on the tracks themselves, but rails had to be taken out of service as they reinforced columns and girders for a new concourse and completed other tasks over or near the tracks. The project received about 2,200 weekend hours of track time affecting that area, a thicket of intensely used rails, from December 2013 to March 2017, according to a Times analysis of previously undisclosed Amtrak records. Amtrak’s crews got about 1,800 weekend hours.

Experts say the heavy repair jobs that keep a complex station operating smoothly require longer shutdowns — 24 to 55 hours during which crews of up to 20 work continuously. In the past three years, Amtrak got half as many of those work periods as the hall renovation did.

An Amtrak spokeswoman, Christina Leeds, said that the amount of track time given to the Moynihan project did not prevent Amtrak from working on Penn Station’s west side and that the railroad chose to focus instead on repairing other areas of the station.

Development Took Priority Over Major Repairs

At the same time, wooden ties at two key intersections on the station’s west side were becoming weaker. On April 3, one set of ties gave way under New Jersey Transit No. 3926, sending three 130,000-pound cars hurtling off the tracks, injuring three people and causing nearly $1 million in damage. The timbers that caused the accident had been flagged for replacement in September last year, Amtrak acknowledged. Ms. Leeds said Amtrak workers installed plates and fasteners — short-term fixes — to shore up the tracks, but did not anticipate that the ties would fail so soon.

On July 6, another set of ties broke under New Jersey Transit No. 3276, just north of where the April derailment occurred, disrupting traffic yet again and cementing the impression among commuters that Penn Station was falling apart. Records show that in November 2016, Amtrak had known that the steel and timbers in the intersection were worn and had planned to begin replacing the intersection on July 14 — eight days after the accident.

Representatives of the Moynihan renovation blamed Amtrak for not keeping up with maintenance.

“As Amtrak owns Penn Station, they are solely responsible for its tracks and platforms — and the failure to complete necessary and critical work is the symptom of decades of underinvestment and neglect, not the result of any one project,” said Amy Varghese, spokeswoman for Empire State Development, which is overseeing the Moynihan project.

‘Like No Other Place’

Penn Station is notoriously difficult to maintain. “It is like no other place I have ever seen,” said Mr. Moorman, the Amtrak co-chief executive. “It is the most complex and difficult place to work that you can imagine.”

Clearances are minimal around the 107-year-old track system, making it a challenge to replace worn timbers and steel. Some of the switches that route trains from one set of tracks to another must be custom made, taking a year or more. And the number of New Jersey Transit, Long Island Rail Road and Amtrak riders who pass through Penn Station each weekday — more than 600,000 on about 1,300 trains — is triple the number it was designed for.

No part of Penn Station is harder to maintain than the snarl of tracks between the Hudson River tunnel and the station’s 11 platforms, an area known as Interlocking A. With a series of switches that guide trains between the station and New Jersey, the area is “basically a track maintainer’s job security or nightmare, depending on how you look at it,” said David B. Clarke, a veteran rail engineer who runs the Center for Transportation Research at the University of Tennessee.

After Joseph H. Boardman took over as Amtrak president in 2008, three derailments in Interlocking A and delays caused by other infrastructure failures led him to institute a program aimed at preventing future accidents. Beginning in 2014, workers cataloged the locations and replacement dates of hundreds of track parts in Penn Station and identified jobs that needed to be done, according to records and interviews.

“I didn’t want any defect that could derail a train,” Mr. Boardman said.

Crews had begun working through the list by the time he retired in September 2016, but had yet to replace major sections of track in Interlocking A.

The work would require four huge chunks of intersecting tracks to be removed and their replacements to be assembled outside the station, hauled in and installed using heavy machinery. The work would take much longer than the typical Amtrak repair job, but it was much needed, maintenance officials said. The engineering department planned to begin the work in January this year.

As contractors were finishing a new concourse in the former post office’s basement, Mr. Cuomo was intent on moving ahead with the project’s next phase: transforming the main level into a shop-filled atrium for riders of Amtrak and the Long Island Rail Road.

Ms. Leeds, the Amtrak spokeswoman, said the Moynihan project was also important to Amtrak. “Our responsibility — after ensuring safety — is to do more than simply renew our assets; it is also to improve them,” she said. “And that the experience at Penn Station must be improved is one of the few universally held opinions of all New Yorkers.”

Mr. Boardman, who signed the original agreement prioritizing the renovation, said Amtrak officials had gone along with the project over the years but were “never that excited about it.”

He said he agreed to the work because it was pushed by the federal Department of Transportation under the Obama administration. Amtrak, with its quasi-public status and reliance on congressional appropriations, must remain attuned to politics, he said. “We understood we were beholden to everybody as Amtrak: the states, the federal government. If we didn’t work with them, we wouldn’t get the support we needed.”

In recent years, a high priority for Amtrak has been finding funding for the Gateway program — an infrastructure plan that would add a Hudson River tunnel into Penn Station and cost tens of billions of dollars — and the railroad has sought to enlist Mr. Cuomo’s help in securing the money. (The governor met with President Trump last month to push for the project and afterward described the session as “productive” but “inconclusive.”)

Tensions Simmer

The first of the four major replacement jobs in Interlocking A wrapped up in late February. Before crews could begin on the second, Amtrak executives told them the work might have to wait. Managers overseeing the Moynihan project had asked for a significant amount of priority track time, the executives said, and Amtrak was thinking about giving it to them.

Amtrak’s engineering managers bridled, according to Mr. Holt and other former employees. The chief engineer, Rodrigo Bitar, argued with officials and vented his frustrations to his staff, Mr. Holt said. Mr. Bitar, who resigned in June, declined to comment.

In March, Mr. Keefe, the head of the track department, voiced his concerns to executives.

Mr. Moorman said no final decision had been made about delaying the track work for Moynihan before the derailments started on March 24. But he acknowledged the tensions with the engineering department. “I think they were concerned that at some point it would impede their ability to do safety-critical work,” Mr. Moorman said of the Moynihan project. “Which turned out not to be the case, but I think that was their concern, and a legitimate concern.”

It was a worry born of frustration, Mr. Holt said. “You can go back years and say the track department didn’t get what it needs to keep things up to snuff,” he said.

Competition for track time at Penn was sometimes so fierce it devolved into shouting matches, according to former employees who regularly attended weekly scheduling meetings. Engineering supervisors jockeyed for time for electrical, signal and track repairs, while also competing with contractors seeking time for development projects.

The officials who schedule trains are supposed to make the final decision. But sometimes the outcome is decided by a call from Washington. Scot Naparstek, Amtrak’s chief operating officer, said it was not unusual for managers of different projects to call Amtrak’s headquarters and plead their cases with him or other top executives. Representatives of the Moynihan project said that Amtrak executives rarely objected when pressed for more track time. Ms. Leeds said Amtrak “aggressively pushed back” on requests that the railroad considered unreasonable.

Photo

“Everybody believes that their project is priority,” Mr. Naparstek said. “Our goal is to try to do our best to satisfy everybody. In the end, we’re balancing.”

By January, the engineering department had scheduled station maintenance around the Moynihan project on 116 weeks. A Times analysis of weekend track usage records from the past three years showed that Moynihan contractors got about 400 more hours on the west side of the station than Amtrak engineering crews did. Contractors also did work affecting Interlocking A on at least 27 occasions when Amtrak did no work there at all.

During that time, records show, some maintenance tasks were not completed in the area until long after they were first identified. One document from February 2016 listed steel parts that were years past their initial replacement dates. Two were assessed as 5s on an Amtrak rating system described in internal engineering documents, meaning that they were in critical condition and at “risk of imminent failure.” Ten were assessed as 4s, meaning that they were in poor condition.

Ms. Leeds said inspectors often examine such parts and decide they are less worn than was expected, so their use is extended.

Early last year, after planned work on a complicated switch in Interlocking A was delayed, a manager in the track department, Tim Cochran, expressed frustration to Mr. Keefe and others. “If we don’t start getting work done in the station, we’re going to wreck,” he said, two people in the meeting recalled. Mr. Cochran, who left Amtrak this year, declined to comment.

Ms. Leeds acknowledged that contractors spent many hours working on the Moynihan project but added that the engineering department had other priorities than working in Interlocking A in recent years, such as fixing the East River tunnels that were damaged by Hurricane Sandy.

Citing the derailments caused by broken tracks, Augustine F. Ubaldi, a railroad engineering expert who began his career inspecting Penn Station for the Penn Central railroad in the 1970s, said it was clear that Amtrak did not spend enough time working in Interlocking A. “There’s no way to deny that,” he said.

Persistent Pressures

Amtrak wrapped up the emergency repairs to Penn Station on Sept. 5, but much work remains to be done, and the pressure to share time and work space is not going away. As the Moynihan project enters its second phase, maintenance crews at the transit hub will have to schedule work around it for at least the next two years.

Ms. Leeds, the Amtrak spokeswoman, said that the railroad was planning its repair work through next year and that it hoped to accomplish most of it during weekend shutdowns. Still, Amtrak executives have said that they would close tracks during the week as needed. “Amtrak will assume a much greater aggressive posture to address critical reliability issues at Penn Station at all times,” Ms. Leeds said.

Looking back, Mr. Boardman, the former Amtrak president, said the railroad probably tried to do too much at once inside Penn Station, juggling multiple development projects and the railroad’s repair work.

The stabbings — and the presence of a switchblade in the school — stirred complaints from some parents that the school did not have metal detectors and prompted questions from reporters to the mayor and police officials about whether the school should have had them. Eighty-eight of the city’s roughly 1,300 school buildings have metal detectors that are used either full time or part time.

Among students and faculty, though, the talk was of the lives changed.

“Fashion photography is a most fantastic barometer of the time,” Ms. Shinkle said.","With so many exhibits and monographs devoted to fashion photography and its leading practitioners, it’s hard to imagine that it wasn’t that long ago that the genre was seldom the focus of highbrow studies. Yet, that’s what Eugénie Shinkle discovered when she began researching it almost a decade ago.

“My fascination for fashion photography emerged because of my complete disbelief at how widely ignored the genre was in academia,” said Ms. Shinkle, a reader in photography at the University of Westminster, London. “Apart from a handful of exceptions, there was a real reluctance amongst scholars to engage with it in a serious way,” she said. “Unapologetically commercial, it had been reduced to ‘only advertising.’ And, until recently — that is until it started appearing in galleries — it was considered to be ephemeral. Because it wasn’t meant to last and because it wasn’t created with any kind of critical or artistic intent, people didn’t believe its history should be approached in that way.”

After publishing “Fashion as Photograph: Viewing and Reviewing Images of Fashion” in 2008, which examined why the genre deserves intellectual scrutiny, she’s now releasing “Fashion Photography: The Story in 180 Pictures,” a compendium of important figures who help chart the genre’s evolution. From Camille Silvy, a diplomat turned studio photographer in the 1850s, to the contemporary creative couple of Maurice Scheltens and Liesbeth Abbenes, who specialize in abstract still lives, the volume published by Aperture chronicles various movements and turning points.

“The history of fashion photography is the history of a growing confidence in its ability to comment explicitly on the wider world,” Ms. Shinkle noted. “Initially, it was reluctant to engage explicitly with politics, but since the end of the ’60s it has become more openly, overtly and unabashedly political.”

After World War II, photographers like Henry Clarke subtly alluded to the changing role of women in society by portraying them as “independent and in control,” writes Ms. Shinkle. Artists like William Klein parodied fashion conventions and encouraged his peers to engage in self-criticism. Even Richard Avedon proved to be a revelation: “I learned to appreciate his depth and talent by seeing how he was able to reinvent himself halfway through his career and noticing how ardently he campaigned for the use of models of color. Creatively, and politically, he’s one of the most important fashion photographers of the 20th century.”

By the ’90s, thanks in no small part to the nonconformist British magazine “The Face,” the grunge movement — which challenged gender norms, capitalism and the ideals of social respectability — appeared in mainstream publications and paved the way for today’s more cerebral work. Collier Schorr’s images, for example, question gender fluidity, notions of desire and how identity is constructed, while Chen Man speaks up creatively about China’s complexities.

Looking at the people in the volume, it also become more apparent how conservative the industry has been. Most photographers listed are Western-educated white men. This is due in part to the author’s and publisher’s decision to keep close reins on what was considered a primer. “We focused on the West because that’s where the major fashion houses and publications have historically been located,” Ms. Shinkle said. “I had to make that decision early on. Did I want to include more vernacular practices like that of Cameroonian photographer Samuel Fosso, who has been doing amazing fashion-inspired work since the ’70s? Or, did I want to restrict it to so-called pure fashion photography?”

In doing so, she revealed how difficult it has been for traditionally marginalized groups to be taken seriously. Case in point: Women, in the early 20th century, were rarely behind the camera. Yva, Madame D’Ora and Toni Frissell were trailblazers working “at a time when that was not what a well-bred women did, because photography was seen as a technical job.” To showcase them and highlight their technical prowess and unique perspectives is to revise history, which too often ignored them. Similarly, the inclusion of the Harlem Renaissance photographer James Van Der Zee, well known in the African-American community, but virtually unknown at the time outside of it, “points out how exclusive and white-centric the industry was in those years.”

While there’s now a more diverse roster, there’s still a long way to go. “Fashion photography is a most fantastic barometer of the time,” Ms. Shinkle said. “It’s representative and it popularizes certain tendencies in ways that no other type of photography can because it’s so ubiquitous.”

Correction: Sept. 27 2017:

An earlier version of this article misstated the academic title held by Ms. Shinkle. She is a reader in photography, not a professor of Photographic Theory and Criticism.

Those anxieties became all the more serious late last month when Roy Moore, a conservative firebrand, defeated Senator Luther Strange, a McConnell ally, in an Alabama Republican primary.

The Prince campaign, if it materializes, would be just the kind of race that Mr. Bannon hopes to replicate across the country. With financing from the Mercers and their network of other conservative donors, Mr. Bannon is looking to build a political coalition that recruits people to run against Republican incumbents from Maine to Montana.

He has set his sights most immediately on states like Arizona, Nevada and Mississippi, where he believes a more populist, maverick-style conservative could threaten a sitting Republican senator. But he is also eyeing candidates to run for the Senate in Tennessee, where the retirement of Bob Corker leaves an opening, and in Nebraska, where he believes that Senator Deb Fisher, a first-term Republican, is vulnerable.

Mr. Prince, 48, has strong ties to the Trump administration. He served as an informal adviser during the transition, and he is the brother of Betsy DeVos, the education secretary. He has told his sister that he would like to run against Mr. Barrasso, a person with knowledge of the conversation said.

In 1997, Mr. Prince founded Blackwater as a private, for-profit force to aid the military, and he is wealthy enough to self-finance his race. For months this year, Mr. Prince — with Mr. Bannon’s support — pushed a plan to replace soldiers with contractors in Afghanistan. The proposal, which would have radically changed the way the fight in that country is conducted, was vehemently opposed by the national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, and the defense secretary, Jim Mattis.

Beyond his support of the use of contractors in war zones, Mr. Prince’s views on political issues are less widely known. He has been described as a libertarian. In 1992, he supported Pat Buchanan’s run for president.

Mr. Prince is emblematic of the type of parallel government apparatus that Mr. Bannon built inside the administration during his time as Mr. Trump’s chief strategist. Mr. Bannon, with help from the Mercer family, is now trying to build the same kind of parallel structure inside the Republican Party. And Mr. Prince is not the only candidate on his wish list.

Mr. Bannon is expected to throw his support behind Chris McDaniel, a conservative state senator from Mississippi who is considering a primary challenge to United States Senator Roger Wicker, who has served since 2007 and is close to Republican leaders.

Mr. Bannon is also hoping to persuade Ann LePage, the wife of Maine’s outspoken governor, Paul LePage, to run for the Republican nomination to challenge Senator Angus King, an independent who is up for re-election in 2018.","Erik Prince, Blackwater Founder, Weighs Primary Challenge to Wyoming Republican",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/08/us/politics/erik-prince-blackwater-wyoming-senate.html

In rock ’n’ roll’s energy and excitement, he recognized music’s future, especially as a fuel for adolescent rebellion.

“It’s easy to call rock ’n’ roll vulgar, but to adolescents it is a release,” he told The New York Times in 1965. “Rock ’n’ roll, if it is anything, is pure joy in sound.

“I willingly embrace vulgarity,” he continued. “I prefer vulgarity, that is, to the excessive refinement that has long stifled British society. Like St. Paul, I’m a convert, but my conversion was to rock ’n’ roll.”

A job as a trainee producer at the BBC led to his first experiment in transforming what he had seen onscreen into a live show. On “Six-Five Special,” which had its premiere in 1957 (it was named for its 6:05 p.m. start-time), he filled the studio floor with young fans bopping to the music. The formula worked: Millions watched. But he chafed at the BBC’s demands that he add sports and comedy segments.

Forced out by the network, Mr. Good resurfaced at its commercial rival, ITV, where he produced “Oh Boy!” with much greater freedom. Performers followed one another quickly, giving the show a breakneck pace. British rock stars like Cliff Richard, Marty Wilde and Billy Fury were said to have received their first national exposure there.

“The aim was hypnosis and excitement — blitzkrieg time!” Mr. Good said in “A Good Man … Is Hard to Find,” a 2005 documentary about his life made by Greg Wise. “Jumping up and down, the adrenaline, the wildness. Yes, the danger of it all!”

Nik Cohn, the British rock journalist, wrote that Mr. Good had an understanding of rock music’s importance that was rare at the time.

“Everyone else saw pop as a one-shot craze and rushed to cash in on it fast before sanity returned and everything returned to normal,” Mr. Cohn wrote in “Awopbopaloobop Alopbamboom: The Golden Age of Rock” (1969). “By contrast, Good realized it clearly as a major phenomenon. I suppose he was the first pop intellectual.”

Mr. Good was born in West London on Aug. 7, 1931. His father, Bob, sold pianos at Harrods, where his mother, Amy, was a secretary. After serving in the Royal Air Force, Mr. Good graduated from Balliol College, Oxford, where he studied philology and was president of the drama society.

“Six-Five Special,” “Oh Boy!” and two other music shows in Britain did not end Mr. Good’s dreams of acting. He left for the United States, hoping to succeed in Hollywood. But he landed only a few parts, including one in “Father Goose” (1964), with Cary Grant, and another in “Clambake” (1967), with Elvis Presley.

One day in 1962, soon after moving to the United States, while lazing around in his pajamas, he had an epiphany.

“I saw this so-called special done by a bloke, Dick Clark, and I’d already come to the conclusion that Dick Clark’s shows were hopeless and I could do better,” he said in the documentary. Mr. Clark was, at the time, the host of the long-running “American Bandstand.”

“I said to myself, like the prodigal son in the pigpen, that I’d go back to my father’s house” — referring to Mr. Haley, whom he saw as his muse — “and I devised a show, filmed it, taped it and sent it around to the networks,” he said.

That was the pilot for “Shindig,” which was picked up by ABC, but not until 1964.

“Shindig” was unlike “Bandstand” or “The Ed Sullivan Show.” It had a fast rhythm, like “Oh Boy!,” with rapid cutting and extreme close-ups. The dancers frugged, swam and twisted furiously. The house band featured Glen Campbell, Billy Preston and Leon Russell. And the guests — among them Aretha Franklin, Tina Turner, the Righteous Brothers, Roy Orbison, Johnny Cash, Bobby Sherman, the Isley Brothers, Sam Cooke and the Everly Brothers — covered a broad musical range.

The Beatles, taped in Britain, were guests on the show several months after Mr. Good produced a special with them there. The Stones appeared several times, once with the bluesman Howlin’ Wolf, one of their idols.

NBC countered with its own pop music show, “Hullabaloo,” which made its debut a few months after “Shindig.”

Donna Loren, a featured singer on “Shindig,” described Mr. Good as “the Norman Lear of rock ’n’ roll” for his insistence on booking African-American artists, against the objections of at least one executive at ABC. She said Mr. Good had resisted efforts by the network to limit the number of black performers on the pilot.

Mr. Mallet, his former assistant producer, agreed. “He was insulted by it,” he said in a telephone interview, “because at least 50 percent of his favorite people were people like Little Richard.”

Mr. Good said in the documentary that he told ABC that he would limit the number of black artists on the show if the network sent him a memo outlining its rules. (He also threatened to send it if he got it to Robert F. Kennedy, the attorney general.) He never got the memo.

He left “Shindig” after a year, exhausted by the demands of producing it but with something else in mind: a rock musical based on “Othello.” It became “Catch My Soul,” with William Marshall in the title role and Jerry Lee Lewis playing an unlikely Iago. When it played at the Ahmanson Theater in Los Angeles, Martin Bernheimer of The Los Angeles Times wrote that it was “an utterly brilliant and utterly maddening experience.”

Mr. Good also wrote the screenplay for the 1974 movie version.

In the early 1970s, Mr. Good moved to New Mexico with his family and continued to produce television programming for a few more years. But he had already begun to alter his life dramatically — mostly in service to his Roman Catholic faith.

Inspired by Rubens’s “The Descent From the Cross,” he learned to paint. And, after his divorce from the former Margit Tischer, he built a chapel beside his home in Cordova, N.M., where he lived alone and painted religious murals and icons.

One mural shows a wild-eyed, fanged devil — his head in the shape of a television set — playing an electric guitar.

In addition to his daughter, Mr. Good, who lived in Oxfordshire, is survived by another daughter, Andrea; a son, Alexander; 10 grandchildren; and a brother, Robert.

Mr. Good expressed regrets about the direction rock took in the post-“Shindig” years. He wrote in The Los Angeles Times in 1967 that the music had been “ironed into one vast, hairy, paisley-patterned uniformity.”

But Mr. Mallet said that his cheeky former boss remained dedicated to the era he helped to influence.

Harvey Weinstein Harassment Allegations

3. Weinstein’s statement about the ’60s and ’70s is correct, as far as it goes.

Such behavior was certainly considered rude, even caddish and the decent men I knew wouldn’t do it.

However, it was not then considered sexual harassment; it certainly was not regarded as anything that you could lose your job over, or be prosecuted over. It was widely regarded as a matter of internal restraint on the man’s part and a matter of lack of internal restraint on the part of the occasional woman who would slap a man in the face.

That said, that was then, this is now. And it’s been “now” for a couple decades. It’s long past time for Harvey to have gotten with The Program. He certainly should know that the ’60s and ’70s aren’t going to excuse anything now.

For many Saudi women, gaining the right to drive is not the end of the struggle.","Built on an alliance between a royal family and the descendants of an ultraconservative Muslim cleric, Saudi Arabia has struggled throughout its history with how to reconcile modernization with loyalty to religious heritage.

That debate heated up as oil wealth enriched the state, bringing in unfamiliar customs and technologies like television, public education and automobiles.

Over time, competing camps dug in around women and the right to drive.

For liberals, the driving ban was a blot on the national brand that was hampering modernization and weakening the economy.

Conservatives, including powerful clerics employed by the state, thought that allowing women to drive would be a crack in the dam that would allow secularism to flood in, washing away the kingdom’s unique Islamic identity.

The royal decree announced on Tuesday handed victory in that battle to the reformers, who had gained an advantage in recent years because of demographics, economics and the country’s young leadership, analysts said.

Saudi leaders, who have been criticized for the war in Yemen, the blockade of Qatar and a range of human rights issues, clearly hoped the step would help the kingdom’s reputation.

“There is no wrong time to do the right thing,” Prince Khalid bin Salman, the Saudi ambassador to Washington and a son of King Salman, told reporters after the change was announced.

The government also worked behind the scenes to control the message.

At least eight prominent women’s activists received calls and text messages from Saudi security officials warning them not to tweet or speak to the news media about the issue, according to three Saudi activists.

They presumed the government did not want to give credit to activists for prompting the change and spoke on condition of anonymity so as not to jeopardize the women — or themselves.

Many women cheered the decision, calling it a final victory in a long campaign for social change.

Manal al-Sherif, who was jailed for having posted videos of herself driving and who wrote a book about her activism, said her life had tracked the wider social changes in the kingdom.

Born into a poor conservative family in Mecca, Ms. Sherif, now 38, was taught that women were to remain at home and that good Muslims were to avoid “infidels” who did not share their faith, she said by phone from Australia, where she now lives.

Her worldview changed when as a university student in the Red Sea port city of Jidda, she saw women who did not cover their faces in public and even had boyfriends, though covertly.

Then she got a job with the state oil company, Saudi Aramco. On its sprawling compound women enjoy greater freedoms than elsewhere in the kingdom, including the ability to drive.

She said that the status of women in Saudi Arabia had been used by the government over the years to placate conservatives.

“Our rights as women were always used in a political game, and that is what we wanted to stop,” she said. “That really kept the country behind.”

She credited King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, another of the king’s sons, with making the decisions necessary for the kingdom to advance.

“The government took the right decision,” she said. “Finally, they had the guts to say, ‘We were wrong.’”

It was difficult to immediately gauge reactions to the rescinded ban among more conservative Saudis. The government recently arrested more than two dozen people, including prominent clerics, some of whom had criticized government policies.

Three clerics employed by the government declined to comment when asked for their thoughts on the rescinded ban.

“Hahahahahahaha,” one responded on Whats App, offering no further comment.

Social media provided a glimpse.

By midafternoon on Wednesday, the Arabic hashtag “The people reject women driving” had appeared on 335,000 tweets, while the hashtag “The king is victorious for women driving” had appeared in only 33,700 tweets, according to Twitter.

But many users used the hashtags to join discussions, even if they disagreed with their message.

Even longtime campaigners said they expected some resistance.

“We’re a religious country,” said Fawziah Al-Bakr, a professor who has been campaigning for the right to drive for nearly three decades.

But religion had nothing to do with the issue, she said, noting that women in other predominately Muslim countries like Egypt, Sudan and Pakistan have been driving for a long time.

“All these women are Muslim and yet they are driving,” she said. “Not being able to drive has nothing to do with Islam.”

Previous reforms have been met with great resistance in the kingdom. Conservatives campaigned against the introduction of television, fearing it would fill Saudi homes with un-Islamic images.

Now many Saudi clerics have their own shows and are enthusiastic users of social media.

They also tried to prevent girls’ education.

Now many of their daughters are studying in Saudi universities, and even in the United States.

For many Saudi women, gaining the right to drive is not the end of the struggle. Many hope the government’s next step will be to lift its so-called “guardianship laws,” which require women to have the permission of a male “guardian” in order to get a passport, travel abroad or undergo certain medical procedures.

That could take time, but Ms. AbuSulayman, the television presenter, said the trajectory was clear.

About two thirds of the kingdom’s 22 million citizens are under 30 and they will grow up seeing women differently than their elders, she said. Many will not remember when women could not drive.

“I actually hate driving,” she said, laughing, but still planned to get a Saudi license.",Saudis Wonder What’s Next After the King Allows Women to Drive,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/world/middleeast/saudi-women-drivers.html

“It was torture for us,” she said. “For us, this was a time of suffering.”

As Latin America remembers Guevara’s death, the region also faces a larger reckoning with the same leftist movements that drew on him for inspiration.

The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the region’s largest remaining guerrilla group, came out of the jungle and gave up its arms this year in a war where no one won but Colombia lost more than 220,000 people.

The Socialist-inspired movement of the late President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela led to gains in education and health care, but the country has sunk into hunger, unrest and dictatorship.

Even Cuba, which for years proudly lived under the revolutionary banner hung by Guevara, now faces an uncertain fate as a détente reached with the United States unravels under the Trump administration.

Bolivia is one of Latin America’s last democracies where leftists remain in control, and it is difficult for political movements to thrive in such a vacuum, one of the country’s leaders said. “You cannot prosper or sustain yourself over time if you do not have the victories and struggles in other places,” said Álvaro García Linera, the vice president of Bolivia.

Jon Lee Anderson, who wrote a biography of Guevara and was key to discovering his remains — they were hidden by soldiers until the 1990s — says both Guevara and the left hit such low points before.

BILOXI, Miss. — As Hurricane Nate cut a path through the central Gulf Coast overnight with roaring winds and a rush of storm-surge flooding, a limb snapped from a tree and landed on the windshield of Terry Gentry’s convertible, cracking the glass and bending the hood.

His reaction? Intense relief.

“I feel blessed. My dog’s still good,” Mr. Gentry said on Sunday. “All my family is good.”

With the devastating wounds left by three monster hurricanes in six weeks still raw from Texas to Florida to Puerto Rico, the impact of an ordinary Category 1 storm like Nate felt gentle by comparison.

As it sped northward, the storm brushed over the mouth of the Mississippi River in southern Louisiana, skipped to the east of New Orleans and drove ashore again near Biloxi, the first hurricane to make landfall in Mississippi since Hurricane Katrina in 2005. It ripped trees from the ground, flooded low-lying areas, and sprayed the beaches with debris and the roads with sand and tree limbs. Part of Highway 90, the main road along the beachfront, was still closed on Sunday afternoon, and tens of thousands of customers in Mississippi and Alabama were without power.

Officials in Mississippi and Alabama said they were still assessing the full scope of the damage on Sunday. But according to preliminary reports, the storm mainly left an inconvenient mess, with widespread debris but only small pockets of more serious problems.

“We are very fortunate this morning,” said Gov. Phil Bryant of Mississippi, a Republican, though he was quick to warn against minimizing the harm caused by the storm’s 10-foot surge, strong winds and heavy rains. “Some damage has been done, particularly into some of the individual homes that are on the bay,” Mr. Bryant said.

The storm ground a large stretch of the Gulf Coast to a halt, and led President Trump to approve emergency declarations for the states of Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana, though Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana, a Democrat, said his state had been spared major damage.

“Hurricane Nate moved at an unprecedented speed towards the Gulf Coast,” Mr. Edwards said in a statement. “Because it moved so quickly, the damage was minimal in Louisiana.”

Col. Michael Clancy, commander of the New Orleans district of the Army Corps of Engineers, said the city, whose flawed hurricane defenses were overwhelmed by Katrina, had dodged a bullet this time. “God was on our side,” Colonel Clancy said.

For many in New Orleans, the hurricane barely registered as a blip on the radar. “A Category 1 is just like a little storm for us here,” said Brandon Garrett, 24, a construction worker. “In a way, I was disappointed that we got nothing at all. I barely got any days off.”

The storm weakened rapidly as it sped inland, first to a tropical storm and then to a tropical depression. By late Sunday afternoon, as the center of the system was crossing into Tennessee, its maximum sustained winds had slowed to 35 miles an hour. The main threat it poses now is flash flooding: Forecasters said the storm could drop as much as 10 inches of rain in parts of its path through the South and the Ohio Valley toward the Appalachian Mountains.

“We’re not seeing widespread areas with major structural damage,” Yasamie Richardson, a spokeswoman for the Alabama Emergency Management Agency, said on Sunday morning. “Some counties are reporting a few homes, a few structures here and there.”

Still, there were hair-raising moments during the storm. Kayleigh Terrell, 29, of Orange Beach, Ala., got a tornado warning on her phone on Saturday night, and then saw the wind tear the screen door off her house. “It hadn’t quite touched down,” Ms. Terrell said of the funnel cloud. “It hit the tree, pulled the door, and we have one shingle left.”

In Biloxi, the storm surge, which made landfall near a time of high tide, inundated some streets and the ground floors or parking garages of some of the city’s low-lying casinos overnight. Residents and workers set about cleaning up on Sunday and marveled at their luck that the storm had not been worse.

Beckey and Saul Sampson plucked a broken plastic chair off the beach and filled a bag with other detritus left by the storm. An engineer used an enormous pump to pull water out of the bottom of the elevator shaft at Harrah’s Gulf Coast hotel and casino. And onlookers flocked to a large sailboat, the Reliance, that had been blown on to the beach and was leaning precariously on its side on the sand.

Everyone’s first thought seemed to be to compare the storm with Hurricane Katrina, which wrecked this area in 2005 even as it was flooding New Orleans.

“It’s not that bad at all,” said Eva Karnes, 53, as she returned to her home to find little more wrong than a pool of water in the yard and a piece of sheet metal flapping off a trailer next to her house. “Katrina took the whole house and everything,” she said.

As with many of the structures built or rebuilt here after Katrina, the living space in Ms. Karnes’s house is now elevated high above the ground, and officials said that was one reason Hurricane Nate’s damage was not worse.

“We did not dodge a bullet,” Lee Smithson, the executive director of the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency, insisted on Sunday. “If Nate would have hit us 15 years ago, the damage would have been much more extensive, we would have had loss of life. But we have rebuilt the coast in the aftermath of Katrina higher and stronger.”

None of that, though, could have prevented another kind of damage suffered in Pass Christian, west of Biloxi: The storm surge snatched thousands of pumpkins from a patch where they had been arrayed for a church fund-raiser, and scattered them over the highway and the shore.

“It’s like searching for Easter eggs,” said Jeanne Tagge, a school librarian who had organized the pumpkin patch. “It’s very disheartening to see all those beautiful pumpkins strewn all up and down the beach.”

Still, Ms. Tagge said she was relieved. “Everyone’s safe,” she said. “Just a few pumpkin casualties.”","In a Season of Monsters, Gulf Coast Feels Lucky All It Got Was Nate",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/08/us/hurricane-nate-biloxi-storm.html

Health care innovation can have direct benefits for health, well-being and longevity.
In fact, some question whether the innovation incentive offered by the health care market is too strong.
So it’s also reasonable to debate whether it’s fair for the United States to be the world’s subsidizer of health care innovation.
This is a different debate than whether and how the country’s health care system should be redesigned.","Perhaps most important, this country offers a large market in which patients, organizations and government spend a lot on health and companies are able to profit greatly from health care innovation.

The United States health care market, through which over one-sixth of the economy flows, offers investors substantial opportunities. Rational investors will invest in an area if it is more profitable than the next best opportunity.

“The relationship between profits and innovation is clearest in the biopharmaceutical and medical device sectors,” said Craig Garthwaite, a health economist with Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management, and one of the judges in our tournament. “In these sectors, firms are able to patent innovations, and we have a good sense of how additional research funds lead to new products.”

High brand-name drug prices, along with generous drug coverage for much of the population, fuel an expectation that large biopharmaceutical research and development investments will pay off. Were American drug prices to fall, or coverage of prescription drugs to retrench, the drug market would shrink and some of those investments would not be made. That’s a potential innovation loss.

This is not mere theory, economists have shown. Daron Acemoglu and Joshua Linn found that as the potential market for a type of drug grows, so do the number of new drugs entering that market. Amy Finkelstein showed that policies that made the market for vaccines more favorable in the late 1980s encouraged 2.5 times more new vaccine clinical trials per year for each affected disease. And Meg Blume-Kohout and Neeraj Sood found that Medicare’s introduction of a drug benefit in 2006 was associated with increases in preclinical testing and clinical trials for drug classes most likely affected by the policy.

Health care innovation can have direct benefits for health, well-being and longevity. A study led by a Harvard economist, David Cutler, showed that life expectancy grew by almost seven years in the second half of the 20th century at a cost of only about $20,000 per year of life gained. The vast majority of gains were because of innovations in the care for high-risk, premature infants and for cardiovascular disease. These technologies are expensive, but other innovation can be cost-reducing. For instance, in the mid-1970s, new dialysis equipment halved treatment time, saving labor costs.

Even with those undeniable improvements, there are questions about the nature of American innovation. Work by Mr. Garthwaite, along with David Dranove and Manuel Hermosilla, showed that although Medicare’s drug benefit spurred drug innovation, there was little evidence that it led to “breakthrough” treatments.

And although high prices do serve as incentive for innovation, other work by Mr. Garthwaite and colleagues suggests that under certain circumstances drug makers can charge more than the value of the innovation.

The high cost of health care, an enormous burden on American consumers, isn’t necessarily a unique feature of our mix of private health insurance and public programs. In principle, we could spend just as much, or more, under any other configuration of health care coverage, including a single-payer program. We spend a great deal right now through the Medicare program — often held out as a model for universal single-payer.

Despite the fact that traditional Medicare is an entirely public insurance program, there’s an enormous market for innovative types of care for older Americans. That’s because we are willing to spend a lot for it, not because of what kind of entity is doing the spending (government vs. private insurers).

In fact, some question whether the innovation incentive offered by the health care market is too strong. Spending less and skipping the marginal innovation is a rational choice. Spending differently to encourage different forms of innovation is another approach.

“We have a health care system with all sorts of perverse incentives, many of which do little good for patients,” said Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute and the other expert panelist who favored the U.S. over France, along with Mr. Garthwaite. “If we could orient the system toward measuring and incentivizing meaningfully better health outcomes, we would have more innovations that are worth paying for.”

Naturally, the innovation rewarded by the American health care system doesn’t stay in the U.S. It’s enjoyed worldwide, even though other countries pay a lot less for it. So it’s also reasonable to debate whether it’s fair for the United States to be the world’s subsidizer of health care innovation. This is a different debate than whether and how the country’s health care system should be redesigned. We can stifle or stimulate innovation regardless of how we obtain insurance and deliver care.

“We have confused the issue of how we pay for care — market-based, Medicare for all, or something else — with how we spur innovation,” Dr. Jha said. “In doing so, we have made it harder to engage in the far more important debate: how we develop new tests and treatments for our neediest patients in ways that improve lives and don’t bankrupt our nation.”",Can the U.S. Repair Its Health Care While Keeping Its Innovation Edge?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/09/upshot/can-the-us-repair-its-health-care-while-keeping-its-innovation-edge.html

“Let them know you’re waiting.”In an apparent nod to the harsh political realities the tax plan faces, Mr. Trump made an explicit overture to Democrats to support the plan.
“Democrats and Republicans in Congress should come together, finally, to deliver this giant win for the American people,” Mr. Trump said.
Studies of similar plans produced by Mr. Trump and House Republicans have been projected to cost $3 trillion to $7 trillion over a decade.","On the individual side, the plan would collapse the tax brackets from seven to three, with tax rates of 12 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent, the president said. The current top rate is 39.6 percent and the lowest rate is 10 percent. The framework also gives Congress the option of creating a higher, fourth, rate above 35 percent in the tax plan to ensure that the wealthy are paying their fair share.

The plan aims to simplify and cut taxes for the middle class by doubling the standard deduction to $12,000 for individuals and to $24,000 for married couples filing jointly. That would allow people to avoid a complicated process of itemizing their taxes to claim various credits and deductions. It would increase the child tax credit from $1,000 to an unspecified amount, and create a new $500 tax credit for non-child dependents, such as the elderly.

Provisions such as the alternative minimum tax and the estate tax, a levy on inherited wealth that Mr. Trump has derided for years, would be gone under the Republican proposal.

The proposal calls for reducing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, a shift that supporters say is needed to make American companies more competitive with their counterparts around the world.

A new tax rate of 25 percent would also be created for so-called pass-through businesses, such as partnerships and sole proprietorships, which are currently taxed at the rate of their owners. About 95 percent of businesses in the United States are structured as pass-throughs and they generate a majority of the government’s corporate tax revenue.

“This will be the lowest top marginal income tax rate for small and midsize businesses in this country in more than 80 years,” Mr. Trump said.

While Republican leaders claim to be united on the tax plan, they must now sell it to lawmakers who have been deeply divided this year. The push began at a House Republican retreat on Wednesday at Fort McNair in Washington, where Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the Republican chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, walked members through the blueprint and talked about the importance of coming together to fix the tax code.

Later, in a hopeful sign for Republican leaders fretting privately about keeping their rank and file together, the conservative Freedom Caucus, whose members have derailed the party’s initiatives with hard-line demands, issued a statement of support calling the plan “forward looking” and pledging to back the party’s budget designed to ensure its passage.

The political stakes are high for a president who is desperate to score a legislative win before his first year in office draws to a close. Mr. Trump, who has eschewed the advocacy tours that his predecessors have used to build support for their top domestic priorities, made a rare direct appeal to voters during his speech, imploring them to call their representatives and senators and demand action on the tax proposal. “Let them know you’re watching,” Mr. Trump said. “Let them know you’re waiting.”

In an apparent nod to the harsh political realities the tax plan faces, Mr. Trump made an explicit overture to Democrats to support the plan.

“Democrats and Republicans in Congress should come together, finally, to deliver this giant win for the American people,” Mr. Trump said.

But behind the scenes, Republican congressional leaders and senior White House officials have discussed bypassing Democrats and using special budget rules that would allow them to get the bill through Congress on a simple majority vote. And Mr. Trump paired his scripted talk of bipartisanship with an impromptu threat to Senator Joe Donnelly, Democrat of Indiana, saying he would personally work to defeat the senator’s re-election bid next year if he does not fall into line on the tax plan.

“If Senator Donnelly doesn’t approve it — because, you know, he’s on the other side — we will come here, we will campaign against him like you wouldn’t believe,” Mr. Trump said as Mr. Donnelly looked on from the audience.

Conservatives cheered the plan as a bold and long-awaited step to spur economic growth, while Democratic leaders condemned it as an irresponsible boon to the rich. And some budget watchdogs expressed worry about the long-term impact of a plan they said could cost more than $2 trillion over a decade.

Mr. Trump, who has broken with precedent for modern American presidents by refusing to release his tax returns, insisted that wealthy people like him would not benefit — an assertion that seemed improbable for a man who runs a family-owned real estate empire and whose children stand to inherit vast sums.

“Tax reform will protect low-income and middle-income households, not the wealthy and well-connected,” Mr. Trump said, framing a proposal that would affect hundreds of millions of Americans in terms of his own self-interest. “I’m doing the right thing, and it’s not good for me, believe me.”

Democrats scoffed. “If this framework is all about the middle class, then Trump Tower is middle-class housing,” said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee. “It violates Trump’s tax pledge that the rich would not gain at all under his plan by offering sweetheart deals for powerful C.E.O.s, giveaways for campaign coffers and a new way to cheat taxes for Mar-a-Lago’s loyal members.”

As with the individual side, some of the thornier business tax issues remain unaddressed. It will be left to Congress to create safeguards that prevent wealthy individuals from incorporating as pass-through businesses, which would tax their income at a lower rate.

Most itemized deductions, including those widely used for state and local tax expenses, would also be eliminated, along with most of the tax credits that businesses use. However, the plan would preserve the deductions for mortgage interest expenses and charitable giving and keep incentives for education and retirement savings plans, as well as preserve the tax credits for research and development and low-income-housing on the business side.

Another big change for companies would be a limitation of the deductibility for corporate interest expenses, in exchange for the opportunity to immediately expense business investments. The ability to immediately write off these expenses would last only five years, and the limitations for deducting interest have yet to be determined.

Perhaps the most significant, yet murky, shift is the move from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system for multinational corporations. In theory, this means that companies would not be taxed on their overseas earnings. But to prevent erosion of the tax base, Republicans plan to impose some form of tax on foreign profits. The transition to the new system would also include a one-time repatriation tax at yet-to-be-determined rates to encourage companies to bring offshore profits back home.

Administration officials did not provide a cost estimate for the plan. Members of the Senate Budget Committee have agreed on a budget resolution that would allow for a $1.5 trillion tax cut over 10 years. Studies of similar plans produced by Mr. Trump and House Republicans have been projected to cost $3 trillion to $7 trillion over a decade.

Republicans say economic growth will compensate for lost revenue. Senator Patrick J. Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican who sits on the Finance Committee, said he was confident that a growing economy would pay for the tax cuts.

“This tax plan will be deficit reducing,” Mr. Toomey said.",Trump Proposes the Most Sweeping Tax Overhaul in Decades,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/us/politics/trump-tax-cut-plan-middle-class-deficit.html

The Necks could be said to do versions of — to improvise on — their past (entirely improvised) performances.
If they are all on good form, it still does not necessarily mean that it will be a great gig by the Necks.
A performance by the Necks is all about band and audience being utterly absorbed in the process of creation.","The Necks are not careerists. “Hanging Gardens” was followed by “Aether,” a whole album consisting entirely of variations on four shimmering chords. “Drive By,” with its potential to become a crossover hit, was followed shortly by a difficult double CD (“Mosquito/See Through”). By now I knew how foolish it was to try to guess what they might do next, but “Chemist” broke the molds of expectation in several ways. There were three tracks, each clocking in at a mere 20 minutes, on at least two of which the drummer (Tony) overdubbed surf guitar. The last of these tracks, “Abillera,” didn’t just swing; it rocked. The influence of Krautrock, of Neu! in particular, was unmistakable, but as often happens when the critic spots an unmistakable influence, it turns out that Tony hadn’t ever listened to Neu! The Necks had moved far from the minimalist grooves of the earlier records, from post-jazz to a kind of post-rock, but they were in the midst of a deeply creative groove, releasing masterpiece after masterpiece. The live album “Townsville” had none of the narrative trajectory that made “Drive By” and “Chemist” so enthralling — and that, I realized eventually, was its beauty. To experience “Townsville” properly is to give way entirely to the oceanic sense.

“Silverwater” (2009) followed, an epic reminder that they both were and were not the band that recorded “Sex.” Featuring further evidence of the drummer’s guitar prowess, “Silverwater” succeeded in being both fragmented and cohesive. After about 50 minutes, you could be forgiven for thinking that the record was coming to an end. Everything subsides to a series of low electronic beeps, like a faint message from a stricken space station, picked up randomly, so long after transmission as to serve as evidence of its doom. Except records by the Necks change radically according to the system on which you’re hearing them.

Scientists are still poring over this discovery, trying to establish if, in the last phases of its existence, a section of the space station was given over to a party.

I was about to start listening to the four tracks of “Unfold” when I was struck by how long it had been since I looked forward to a band’s new album the way I look forward to each new offering from the Necks. This was how I felt waiting to hear “London Calling,” by the Clash, “Slow Train Coming,” by Bob Dylan, or, going even further back, “Electric Warrior,” by T. Rex. So intense was the anticipation generated by the prospect of hearing “Unfold” that I kept putting off playing it. And then there was the nonoptional wait to get into the Lab in San Francisco for the opening gig of the American tour. Just as the experience of listening to an eagerly awaited record by the Necks varies from system to system, your experience of a performance depends a lot on where you sit. So, as we stood in the long and lengthening line, I delivered a rousing address to my troops — five of them — on the need to act decisively once we were inside, how we had to seize the very best nonassigned seats: as near to the front as possible, but not too close to the potentially overwhelming drums, and not to one side. This anxiety threatened to turn what for everyone else was supposed to be a fun night out — going to a gig — into its opposite, but I knew, with the unshakable conviction of the believer whose devotion is a sign not of gullibility but of superior powers of discernment, that we were potentially on the brink of one of the greatest musical experiences currently available on the planet. (In the unlikely event that it didn’t quite happen that night, I was booked in for another two-set helping the following evening.)

We scored great seats, three rows from the front, and I was able to make sure, without anyone noticing (even though everyone noticed), that I got the best seat of all, with the clearest view — of the resting instruments — of any of us. Ever since I went to my first rock concert, Family in Oxford in about 1972, the thrill of what was about to happen was symbolized by the dormant power of the vacant drum kit, the way it sat there like a throne to its imminent rhythmic might. That sense of the instruments lying in wait is even more pronounced with a gig by the Necks as we wait for music to come into existence for the first time.

The gigs the band played immediately before this tour were in large venues, opening for Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, in Australia. This brought the Necks to the attention of a new audience, but it’s in places like the Lab that they really come into their own: 150 people, ready to focus on every moment, every note. Typically, bands “tour” an album, showcasing its contents, advertising it. The Necks do not do this, of course, but one track from the new album, “Blue Mountain,” bears a sufficiently close resemblance to some of the performances from the recent tour to permit me to conflate the transient experience of a live performance with repeated exposures to the documentary evidence of the record.

They take the stage at the Lab, Lloyd looking like a tall backwoodsman with balding head and full beard; Chris, bald, bespectacled, austerely professorial; Tony, white-haired and dressed, by comparison, quite fashionably in a polka-dot shirt. Chris sits with his back to the other two as if cutting himself off, but it’s a setup that enables them to hear one another better — and responsiveness to one another is at the heart of the performance. Tennis players, by the time they come on court, are already halfway into the realm of intense concentration required by the coming sets. Preparation for the Necks involves shutting their eyes for five seconds, waiting to see who will serve. Chris touches the piano keys.

Instead of the band gradually stretching out and easing into a groove, there is a steady creation and increase of internal pressure. From Tony there tends, at the outset, to be a lot of shaking, rattling, scraping and shuffling. It’s easy to hear this as aimless — a sonic bush through which it will be necessary to beat a path rhythmically. Gradually the impediments to rhythm emerge as its formative parts. Insistently repeated press rolls on the snare generate the need to break out — rhythmically — while simultaneously incarcerating this need. The same thing is happening with the tidal moan of Lloyd’s bowed bass, a sublimated pulse that manifests itself as a refusal to fully express itself. At some point the yearning is answered, at first chthonically, by the bass drum, later by the insistent jump of the high-hat. But the forward momentum remains contained.

So there is a piling up of forces, like the roiling storm clouds of a weather system, already in our midst but continuing to approach. The pressure continues to mount, to bear down and, partly through the immense shimmer of cymbals, to expand. The piano suggests what might remain of the lyrical after all else — including much of what constitutes lyricism — has been corroded. Think of all that aural starlight in jazz (“Stella by Starlight”!). The glimmer, here, is of ruined starlight. Contained in the piano is a scattered residue of jazz, traces of a lost blues. You focus on what Chris is doing, and then your attention is drawn to the drums, then over to the bass and back to Chris, who has jabbed the piano into an off-the-cuff Reichian lockdown. There are no solos, but the ball is being passed back and forth constantly. At some point it becomes impossible to tell who is doing what.

And not only that. There appear, through some weird alchemy of harmonics, phantom instruments. A cello? A human voice? A violin? Hearing such things, wanting to have the source of these auditory hallucinations verified, you look to see what is happening, but there are just these three middle-aged blokes, playing piano, bass and drums, conjuring things that do not exist. There are also moments that make you aware that your attention has wandered. Is this just about refocusing as a listener, or has the band, having drifted into a comparatively slack interlude, done something deliberately to pull you back into the trance? The Necks, these days, do not swing, but there is a constant swelling, an abundance of lateral movement that is manifest also as its opposite: a tightening of the screw, locking you inside the music, becoming part of its rise, its eventual fall and final fade.

At the end of the first set, Lloyd introduces the band and mentions that CDs are for sale. With their minimalist packaging and discreet information (the recent ones don’t explain who’s playing what), the CDs and the new double LP are consummately cool, eminently desirable, but the economic aftermath and interlude are relatively modest given the profundity of the experience that has preceded it. While the merchandise is being shifted, the band is more than ready to mingle, all the while displaying a distinct lack of any wish to be revered. At the Blue Whale in 2016, Lloyd came up to say hello. I was talking to a guy sitting in the row in front who had seen the band the last time they played in Los Angeles. He wasn’t sure when that was.

“But too long,” he said.

“Right,” Lloyd agreed.

“He was actually referring to the length of the set,” I said.

“Yeah?” he said. “I thought he meant your last book. Pretty surprising, since it was only about 150 pages.” In my book, so to speak, this represents the ideal behavior of the artist: You create this very serious work, and then you shoot the breeze as though the whole world is a pub in the Outback where no one cares what you do as long as you get your round in. Until it’s time for the second set.

The Necks are not improvising from existing tunes but creating from scratch, every night. Except now, in their 30th year, they are able to draw on their own history the way jazz musicians have relied on the history of the form, on what has been done — sometimes composed — by others. The idea in this classic jazz situation is not to copy or emulate but to distinguish yourself, to establish your individual identity by reference to what has gone before. The Necks could be said to do versions of — to improvise on — their past (entirely improvised) performances. In other words, they improvise on their own history. Each night is a slightly more familiar exploration or mapping of the unknown. Their career is therefore expressed in miniature in each piece, and each piece is a condensation of their career. The foundations have to be endlessly re-established, otherwise they collapse (into chaos) or cement themselves into cliché or convention.

It goes without saying that this way of proceeding cannot produce amazing results every time. Were they able to produce a miracle every night, the feeling of the miraculous would be lost. The only way to guarantee a superlative gig each and every time is to rehearse and rehearse, to get everything down pat. The Necks, of necessity, do not rehearse; nor are they locked into a monogamous musical relationship. They meet up, play gigs, tour and record, but each band member pursues other projects with other bands. Chris and Lloyd still live in Australia. Tony moved to Tokyo in 1990, then to Amsterdam in 1994, until 1998, when he moved — or, in a very Necksian way, “cross-faded” — to Berlin, where he is still based. So even after 30 years, making music has the feel of a special occasion — a get-together. And despite what was just said about the impossibility of routine miracles, the standard of the average — the frequency of the exceptional — is surprisingly high. At a gig some years ago at the Vortex in London, they were flooring it, going flat-out, and the next instant they stopped so suddenly that it was like being thrown through a windshield into silence. “How did you do that?” my friend asked them afterward. Well, Lloyd said, there were a few little signs we all picked up on. So are there some moves or tricks to which they resort when the alchemy does not occur? Or, as I said when I went to see them at their Airbnb, “Can a great performance result when one of you is having a bad night?”

“It depends what you mean by a bad night,” Tony said.

“Like a heart attack?” Chris said.

Lloyd mentioned a gig in Perth at the start of last year. The commitment to improvisation extends even to the instruments — he travels without a bass, preferring, like a piano player, to put himself at the mercy of what the venue provides. (Two weeks later, when I bumped into him at a noodle bar near the Blue Whale, he looked slightly stressed because, an hour before the show, he still had nothing to play.) The bass provided for the gig in Perth was diabolical. “The variability of the instrument is one of the things I try to get excited about. As long as the bass is playable, that’s quite exciting. But this one was an absolute dog. I said to the others, ‘There’s about five notes that work on this, so I’m not going to be contributing a whole lot.’ My bass part was really disciplined because I didn’t have a lot of options. And it was an amazing piece of music.”

“But you have made whole records where you’ve only played one note,” Tony said. “So you were spoiled for choice.”

“It’s actually remembered as a virtuoso performance,” I said (sitting in, as they say in the jazz world, improvising with the Necks!). “O.K., I get what you’re saying. But how about if two of you are having a bad night? You can see where I’m going with this. How about if all three of you are?”

“You could get a perfect storm of negative elements,” Lloyd said, before it occurred to me that there was a corollary to my line of questioning. If they are all on good form, it still does not necessarily mean that it will be a great gig by the Necks. And needless to say, what they do is not to everyone’s taste. I reminded them of a gig in Brighton, England, in 2002 — the second time I saw them, before my conversion — when, the moment the first set ended, a member of the audience leapt to his feet and started hurling abuse, telling them and us what a bunch of crap it had been. (The guys took it with surprisingly good grace, seemed entirely unperturbed.) For the record, and to prove that I am not a mindless devotee, their discography contains a few duds: “Silent Night,” “Photosynthetic” and “Vertigo” do nothing for me. And a member of my little group at the Lab, having prepared for our evening out with a noseful of cocaine, was less than enthusiastic. “He does everything with those drums except play them,” he remarked of Tony, rather wittily. I was unsure, when he went on to say that seeing the Necks was just like seeing the Grateful Dead, whether he was joking, trying to make a serious point or testing the limits of my tolerance. Either way, coke is a wretchedly inappropriate drug for experiencing the Necks.

Impatience prevents you from seeing — hearing — that what you are waiting for is already happening (not a bad test-definition of the avant-garde). But there is scope for anxiety on behalf of the participating listener, because the gathering intensity is underwritten by the potential for dissipation. And any given performance makes you wonder how any part of it could be different. This is the possibility that the performance has to raise on the way to becoming that which it was. So the answer is always, Yes, it could have been very different, at almost every stage. Could it have been better? In retrospect maybe, but there are long interludes — sometimes lasting the entire length of the set — when you are left to reflect instead on how much was latent in that first note or chord or rattle of percussion. To what extent did that note — by Chris, say — determine what they all went on to do? The sense, in this genealogy of the moment, is of unanticipated inevitability.

Each set of the San Francisco gigs was extraordinary, as were the two closing sets of the tour at the Blue Whale a fortnight later. But how would these shows sound if they were released on CD? I’ve no idea. Some kind of bootlegged video of part of the previous year’s gig at the Blue Whale exists, but I’ve avoided watching or listening to it. I don’t want to have to measure my experience of being there — superlative! — against a transcript of what occurred. Setting the record straight can sometimes distort it. A performance by the Necks is all about band and audience being utterly absorbed in the process of creation. Whether to release recordings of live performances is therefore a fundamental conceptual issue. In the course of any performance of continuous improvisation lasting for the best part of an hour there are going to be lulls — substandard stretches that are left behind, that evaporate and are forgotten as a show progresses, but that can fatally contaminate an entire recording. And as Lloyd points out, the orgiastic bits — which are so intoxicating live — can seem crude. More broadly, a record becomes a statement or template — this is what the Necks do — whereas it is merely a record of what happened that one night. Even without the problem of releasing live albums, it’s important that the band is not overly concerned with analyzing their live shows; the quality of performance depends on this relative indifference. The kind of post-mortems they go in for after a show typically amount to something along the lines of “That was pretty good wasn’t it?”

They have to feel uninhibited, to be free of the judgments that we listeners often feel bound to make. Was the first set on Saturday in San Francisco better than the second? (My little group of six was split straight down the middle, three and three.) Was Sunday better than Saturday? This is not a problem for the band; they have trouble remembering what they did on a given night.

In the course of thinking about — which means listening to — the Necks and their recent concerts, I’ve often remembered that idea of John Berger’s in “The Moment of Cubism”: “The moment at which a piece of music begins provides a clue to the nature of all art.” But it’s the moment after each piece of music, each set from the Necks, that I think of now. As the music faded into silence, instead of a rush to applaud, the audience waited, respectfully acknowledging that the altered silence was itself still a part of the performance. The silence meant that, on behalf of the performers, the audience wrapped the gift of the music they had received. Only then could the applause begin. That’s when we stood up and applauded.","My Obsession With the Necks, the Greatest Trio on Earth",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/04/magazine/my-obsession-with-the-necks-the-greatest-trio-on-earth.html

And while he was a prodigious chronicler of vernacular American culture, his own roots were hardly common. Born Walker Evans III, the scion of a prominent family, he grew up in privilege, attending Phillips Academy and then Williams College, dropping out after one year.

A turning point for Evans was his decision — like many young men of means — to go to Paris in 1926 to study for a year at the Sorbonne. His stay filled his head with ideas gleaned from Flaubert and Baudelaire, but it was another Frenchman — Eugène Atget — whose work affected him the most, leading to the dry, observational style that became his visual signature.

Clément Chéroux, a French curator, organized a massive Walker Evans retrospective at the Centre Pompidou in Paris, which recently traveled to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, (where he is now the head of the photography department). He said Evans tried to emulate in America what Atget did in Paris.

“Atget has tried to define, through his photographs — what is the Parisian vernacular? What is the visual spirit of Paris? And Evans has done exactly the same with America,” Mr. Chéroux said. “What is so interesting for me, in this exchange between American and French culture, is that he has tried to define the American vernacular culture, but with the method and style of French culture.”

Evans embodied a paradox: a member of the American elite drawn to unfussy places, urban workers and desperate farmers, becoming best known for his seminal project with James Agee, “Let Us Now Praise Famous Men,” about America’s poor and downtrodden during the Great Depression.

For Mr. Chéroux, this paradox was an interesting way to understand Evans. The curator has done scholarly research into the vernacular, which he defines as “useful, domestic and popular” in an essay in the exhibition catalog. “Maybe one of the reasons why I’m fascinated with Evans is because there is so much paradox in his work,” he said. “There is this dialectical tension between Europe and the U.S., and there is also this very strong dialectical tension between an aristocratic or elite point of view, and a subject which is definitely popular culture, and workers.”

The specific nature of the Atget-Evans vision, with its emphasis on large format, razor sharp, perfectly observed, almost preternaturally quiet moments, allows the photographs to impress viewers nearly a century later. Evans had a simple explanation: Atget’s photographs had a transcendent quality, which he tried to emulate.

Photo

In an interview with Lincoln Kirstein, who wrote an essay for Evans’s 1938 book “American Photographs,” Evans said, “Take Atget, whose work I now know very well. In his work you do feel what some people call poetry. I do call it that also, but a better word for it, to me, is, well – when Atget does even a tree root, he transcends that thing. And by God somebody else does not.”

By looking at things previously unobserved, or subjects once thought beneath the purview of art, Evans created a vision of America that is still inextricable from our national identity. And while his initial exposure to Atget’s work might have been coincidental — his friend Berenice Abbott showed him a trove of the Frenchman’s work — his subsequent choice of subject matter was not.

In another essay in the exhibition catalog, Evans said his early work was influenced by his feelings about the United States. “I was really anti-American at the time,” he said. “America was a big business and I wanted to escape. It nauseated me. My photography was a semi-conscious reaction against right-thinking and optimism; it was an attack on the establishment. I could just hear my father saying, ‘Why do you want to look at those scenes, they’re depressing. Why don’t you look at the nice things in life?’ Nothing original about that though.”

This might be the key to understanding his role in the history of photography, as he heavily influenced subsequent generations, including the famed “New Topographics” movement of the 1970s. (When asked via email whether Evans’s work had inspired him and his colleagues, Stephen Shore simply replied, “Yes.”)

According to Mr. Chéroux, Evans was able to adopt a neutral stance and let the magic, or inherent tension, of a scene speak for itself. He notably contrasted this style against the showy, artsy technique employed by contemporaries like Alfred Stieglitz and the Modernists.

“He wants to disappear in front of his subject, to let this emotion transfer from the subject to the viewer,” he said of Evans. “I think this is really what he understood. It’s the reason why he is so close to Atget. All the photographers who think that the subject is more important than themselves are in this position.”

The retrospective, while focusing on the past, and including selections from Evans’s personal collection of vernacular art, also allows viewers to appreciate how photography, a slice out of time, relates to the present. In particular, his 1937 photographs showing people displaced by floods in the South are just as relevant today.

“That’s the power of art,” Mr. Chéroux said, “to address some historical questions, but to address them in the present time. To create a kind of effect that is both present and past, and I think this is something photography is really great at.”

LAS VEGAS — The slot machines and blackjack tables are filling up again at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, a golden tower on the southern end of the Vegas Strip. It’s taken days for any sense of normalcy to return to the place where last Sunday, an itinerant gambler, Stephen Paddock, used assault rifles to rain bullets down on a country music festival, killing 58 and injuring more than 500, one of the deadliest mass shootings in United States history.

I arrived in town a little more than 12 hours after Mr. Paddock’s deadly rampage, which ended when he fatally shot himself in the head. The Mandalay Bay, which I’ve visited several times as an off-and-on boxing writer, was as quiet as I’d ever seen it. Barely anyone was gambling. People were milling about the lobby, some trying to get back into rooms they had been evacuated from the night before. Others waited to check in for what was supposed to be a fun-filled trip.

Along with more than a dozen other New York Times journalists dispatched here, I immediately hopped into what has become an all too familiar routine of covering mass shootings. We had to piece together everything we could about what had happened that night. That meant interviewing people who were in the hotel or at the country music concert. And trying to chat up hotel employees, who might be able to offer any details about Mr. Paddock and his stay here: How did he sneak in around two dozen rifles? Did any housekeepers clean his room? Anyone carry his bags? What did he order from room service? What did his hotel suite look like?

This is difficult information to get in the aftermath of a tragedy. For one, many people were traumatized and found it hard to discuss what had transpired. One man from Massachusetts said he was cutting his trip short, and I heard many others echo his feeling of being shaken up.

While we do visit the Kerrigans’ small cluttered apartment and the Styleses’ grand home, Egan’s book is far less interested in domestic relationships than in those of the workplace. By the early 1940s, the stability of American urban domestic life had been under threat for years. Families had been strained by the economic dislocation of the Depression, by the ethnic, religious and class divisions stemming from large-scale immigration and, finally, by the war. Add to these generational forces of entropy the more timeless problems of pride, shame, ambition and wanderlust, and no family unit in Egan’s novel seems particularly secure. “Her life was a war life; the war was her life,” Egan writes of Anna at one point. “There had been another life before that — her family, the neighborhood — but everyone from that time had died, or moved, or grown up.”

Yet what stability the central characters fail to find at home, they discover at work. Eddie, Dexter and Anna all form profound bonds on the job — whether with fellow shipmates, henchmen or divers. While in their personal lives the three struggle with the limitations prescribed by their gender, class and family roles, their intimate professional units provide them with human connections that supersede prejudice and presumption. On the job, the three can ultimately be themselves.

Perhaps it is to be expected that a story of intertwined fates should be laden with secrets. Virtually all of the characters here have them. In the course of the novel, meetings take place that are never to be spoken of again. Money changes hands with provenance suppressed. Misrepresentations of paternity and identity are engineered right alongside the more mundane deceits that spring from infidelity and murder. As Dexter’s white-shoe banker of a father-in-law observes: “Every man has his secrets, his costs of doing business.” We could elaborate by noting that secrecy can also be the cost of having relationships. In this broader context, Egan nimbly explores two of the central paradoxes inherent in the keeping of secrets. First, while a secret is a piece of information that we bury, it can quickly become the prevailing force shaping our identity and governing our actions in the world. Second, while we fashion most secrets to preserve some form of liberty, they inevitably constrain us by inhibiting self-knowledge and self-proclamation.

But for all of their asymmetric influence, secrets are ultimately mortal. What is done cannot be undone through dissemblance. The hidden fact bides its time in obscurity waiting to be revealed by a slip of the tongue or a chance encounter. And in the context of Egan’s novel, it is only when secrets unravel that the business of personal liberty can begin.

“Manhattan Beach” is principally a novel of New York. As such, it inevitably pays tribute to the city’s iconography: its crowded tenements and highbrow retreats and quasi-legitimate nightclubs. But these familiar landmarks are not the focus of Egan’s narrative. Refreshingly, Egan and her characters turn their backs on a Manhattan interior defined by subways and skyscrapers, Broadway and Wall Street, to look outward to sea. After all, from New York’s founding until not long ago, the city was chiefly a port — busy with the daily movement of goods onto and off ships. In addition, because New York was America’s gateway for immigration, by 1940 a significant percentage of the city’s population had crossed the sea to get here. The very title of the novel, “Manhattan Beach,” points to this fact of history that in modern times seems almost oxymoronic. Egan also gestures to this paradox by choosing as her epigraph a quote from Herman Melville, who spent most of his life not on the island of Nantucket but on the island of Manhattan.

In the New York of Egan’s novel, freighters are docked the length of the West Side piers and battleships are being built in the Brooklyn Naval Yards. The local fisheries and oyster beds are still thriving. By extension, the book is teeming with those who earn their living on the water: sailors, stevedores, lobstermen, shipbuilders and that particular maritime specialist prized by the underworld, the boatman who sinks bodies to the bottom of the sea. Anna principally comes of age in the Naval Yards as one of the pioneering divers who performed underwater repairs and salvage. And it is in a remote boathouse at the far reaches of Manhattan Beach that the destinies of Anna, Eddie and Dexter ultimately come to fruition — albeit at three different moments in time.

The prevalence of the ocean in this story is not simply atmospheric; it is central to the symbolism. As the Melville epigraph affirms, “meditation and water are wedded for ever.” For Anna the sight of the sea provides an “electric mix of attraction and dread” while for Eddie it’s “an infinite hypnotic expanse” and for Dexter it’s “never the same on any two days, not if you really looked.” Egan really looks, and so do her characters. Turning their backs on the crowded constraints of their urban lives, all three look to the ocean as a realm that while inherently dangerous also promises the potential for personal discovery and an almost mystical liberty. This is a novel that deserves to join the canon of New York stories.","In ‘Manhattan Beach,’ Jennifer Egan Sets a Crime Story on the Waterfront",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/03/books/review/jennifer-egan-manhattan-beach.html

Coronary artery disease, it seemed then, was mainly a plumbing problem, demanding a plumber’s toolbox of solutions (to be fair, there’s a cosmos of biology behind cholesterol metabolism and its link to heart disease).

Cancer, by contrast, was an exterminator’s problem — a poisoner’s dilemma. Cancer-causing agents unleashed abnormal cellular proliferation by mutating genes involved in regulating growth. These cancer cells, occupying tissues and spreading, demanded a cellular poison — chemotherapy — that would spare normal cells and kill the malignant ones.

Cardiologists and oncologists — plumbers and poisoners — lived in different medical realms. We spoke different languages, attended different conferences, read different specialty journals. If our paths intersected, we considered the crossing coincidental, the unavoidable convergence of two common age-related illnesses on the same body.

I was a medical resident in Boston in the early 2000s when I heard a theory that would, in time, force these separate worlds to collide. Two cardiologists, Peter Libby and Paul Ridker, were thinking about plaque formation in a different way. Libby and Ridker acknowledged the role of cholesterol and lipids. But just as important was another variable, seldom discussed: inflammation — the recruitment and activation of certain immune cells. These activated immune cells infiltrated blood vessels early in the course of coronary disease and enabled plaques to grow and rupture. “Bad” cholesterol was a necessary part of the equation — it was these lipid deposits that may incite the immune cells, they proposed — but it was not sufficient.

If inflammation triggers coronary disease, might targeting it directly — beyond simply reducing cholesterol — decrease the risk of heart attacks? Over the course of a decade, Libby and Ridker found themselves focusing on a molecule involved in inflammation called interleukin-1 beta. By the mid-2000s, they heard of a new drug — an interleukin-1-beta inhibitor — that was used to treat exceedingly rare inflammatory diseases. In April 2011, Ridker’s team started enrolling 10,000 patients who carried signs of inflammation and were at very high risk for coronary disease in a randomized study to determine the effects of the inhibitor on heart disease and strokes.

The results, published this August, are provocative: Despite no change in cholesterol levels, there was a demonstrable reduction in heart attacks, stroke and cardiovascular death, particularly at higher doses of the drug. But what caught my attention was a separate analysis that asked a seemingly unrelated question: Might the drug also reduce the risk of cancer? In a paper published in The Lancet, Ridker and his colleagues found that drug-treated patients had a drop in all cancer mortality. More striking still was a stark decrease in the incidence of and deaths from lung cancer. Some element of inflammation that drives plaque formation in coronary disease is also driving cancer progression. It’s a study that needs careful replication; the analysis was designed to suggest a hypothesis, not to prove it. There are questions about drug pricing and the risks of infections and low blood counts. But if the benefit holds up in future trials, interleukin-1-beta inhibition could eventually rank among the most effective prevention strategies in the recent history of cancer.

Inflammation at the nexus between cancer and heart disease? But of course, some of you must be thinking, with an exasperated nod. You’ve had your third serving of blueberries; you’ve drunk your green tea. Wasn’t it obvious all the while?

It isn’t so simple. An avalanche of studies has implicated inflammation as a central player in many diseases — but there are inconsistencies. Consider an inflammatory illness like lupus: The risk of most cancers (except some virally related cancers and lymphomas) in lupus patients is only marginally higher. Rheumatoid arthritis increases the risk of lymphomas — but oddly lowers the risk of breast cancer. Tuberculosis, an inflammation-inducing disease, appears to promote lung-cancer risk, but in an animal study, eczema, weirdly, reduces the risk of skin cancer. Meanwhile, an alternative-medicine industry daily peddles “anti-inflammatory” diets — but which of these reduce inflammation, or what types of inflammation are affected, remains far from known.

“Inflammation,” in short, is a concept in flux — “a wastebasket word,” as Padmanee Sharma, an immuno-oncologist at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, told me. There isn’t one inflammation: Lupus, tuberculosis and influenza all cause “inflammation,” but each might provoke different or overlapping wings of immune responses. I asked James Allison, who pioneered cancer immunotherapy, to define “inflammation,” and he paused, considering the definition. “It’s a response to injury, mediated by immunological cells. But there are dozens of cell types communicating through even further dozens of signals.”

We might imagine inflammation, then, as a fuse box that you chance upon in a new house. You are looking for the switch that turns the light on in the living room, or one that turns the alarm off (just as we’re hoping to throw the switch that disables cancer growth or plaque formation). But the circuitry baffles you. Some knobs are marked in crimson: Do Not Touch. Some carry no labels. Some do, but the writing is in a foreign language.

“Inflammation, an umbrella term, is now being broken up into many different categories,” Sharma told me. Is it chronic or acute? Is there a “right” kind of inflammation that protects us from infections and a “wrong” kind that precipitates disease? Is it mediated “adaptive” immunity — the type of immunity involving B and T cells that adapts to infections? Or “innate” immunity, the more ancient phalanx of immune responses that is preprogrammed to fight certain pathogens?

When doctors read trials like Ridker’s, we generally ask two sets of questions. The first might be loosely described as: Is it good science and good medicine? Was the concept proposed in the study proved by the trial? Were the conclusions accurate, the adverse effects acceptable? Cardiologists and oncologists I spoke to agreed on the technical accuracy of the study. One of them noted the modest benefit for heart disease; Ridker and Libby counter that the drug is at least as effective as some cholesterol-reducing medicines.

But there’s a second kind of inquiry that’s harder to put a finger on, for it lives in a nearly aesthetic realm. Does the study illuminate something strange and wonderful about human physiology? A trial might be “good”— but is it, well, “beautiful”? This study is: It links disparate arenas of medicine through a common pathological mechanism. It’s hard to know whether the illnesses in the man I met were driven by inflammation, but Ridker and Libby forced me to view his case — and a thousand other cases I’d seen previously — under new clinical lights. I will never think about patients with cancer and coronary disease in the same way.

There’s another twist of wonder, though. What are the chances that one molecule, sitting at one corner of the immune response, acts as a switch for two utterly different diseases? It must be a quirk in our design, a barely visible chink in physiology that allows us to target inflammation in a manner that doesn’t kill or maim but acts just so, disabling two terrifying illnesses. It’s as if we had walked into the basement of the new house, found the fuse box, learned to read the coded language of the labels and — in the partial darkness — pulled just one switch. And, miracle of miracles: Upstairs, only the living-room lights went on.","What We Learn When Two Ruthless Killers, Heart Disease and Cancer, Reveal a Common Root",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/magazine/can-heart-disease-shed-light-on-cancer.html

Driving rain, withering heat and sawdust storms come with the job. This used to be men’s work. Not anymore.



Making charcoal for sale out of the refuse from nearby sawmills, work for the desperate and destitute, has become almost exclusively women’s work in San Pedro. It may have started with one widow from Bogart, a desperately poor slum, who ventured into one of the three charcoal fields in San Pedro, the Parc Du Pont, intent on making a dollar to feed her family.

Ms. Choumali, a freelance documentary and fine art photographer from Abidjan, was on an assignment in San Pedro when she first spotted the phenomenon.



Three years later, Ms. Choumali’s project, “Sissi Barra (The Work of Smoke),” illustrates the harsh reality for women with few choices, the poorest of the poor, in the Ivory Coast. While the country is enjoying an economic revival and now boasts Africa’s fastest growing economy, the charcoal producers of San Pedro live like paupers. Her conversation with Evelyn Nieves has been condensed and edited.

Q.

What drew you to this topic?

A.

I was passing by this park at the entrance of the town, an immense expanse of coal-black soil, and hundreds of busy people around smoke-filled ovens. I then noticed that they were mostly women. I was intrigued by the contrast between the harshness of the place and the presence of these women, adolescents and little children.

Q.

Do you know why the industry has gone from all male to almost all female?

A.

At first, this work was exclusively masculine. Women began to become interested when Makandjé, the oldest of these women and leader of the Women Coal Producers Association of the Parc du Pont, dared to venture into this field. She first started assisting male producers, then started her own oven. Today, she has inspired hundreds of women follow her example. Men progressively deserted the charcoal field. Now, most of the men we meet around these fields are wood sellers or carpenters. Charcoal fields are usually near wood manufacturers.

Q.

What did you witness in your three years of documenting the “work of smoke” that stands out?

A.

Some women, like Makandjé, are widows; some are part of a polygamous marriage or have been repudiated. Except for one, Awa, they have no other qualifications, and have no choice but start to work in this field to survive.

All the decisions are made together. I was impressed by the solidarity and unity between the women. They support each other. They have a joint financial arrangement where they contribute equally to save money. I was inspired by the strength, the resilience and the dignity they have.

Q.

What are they made of? Who builds them?

A.

The ovens are made of wood and sawdust left by the carpenters and wood manufacturers. The women build them themselves. The last day of my stay one of the women invited me to work with them. I collected the trash wood from manufacturers that they sometimes use because they can’t afford to pay for good wood. Then we placed the wood in a very specific way to make the oven. It takes a whole day or more to build an oven, depending on the size, and each oven is made for only one time. They can’t be reused.

Photo

Q.

What are some of the hazards?

A.

The sawdust is very light and it is a powder and as the place is very windy, this sawdust enters the eyes and the nose, and sticks on the skin. The eyes are irritated. My eyes and nose were irritated the first day, so I had to wear glasses and a mask to avoid the smoke and the wind with sawdust.

Then there is a lot of heat on the floor from all these ovens which are on fire underneath.

After when the charcoal is ready, they break the oven and collect the hot charcoal and put into bags with their hands. The charcoal is sharp and hot. They need gloves.

So they need masks, proper work shoes, boots for example, and gloves. They do not have enough tools to work, since it’s too expensive for them to buy one for each of them. They share their tools. During the rainy season, the mix of mud and sawdust becomes a sort of moving mud. They also need boots. And as they do not have raincoats, some of them protect themselves with pieces of plastic they find or go without protection from the rain.

After trying to work with them for a day I got sick. The work is physically hard. I couldn’t do it for more than two hours. Everything is done by hand.

Q.

What do you plan to do with this project?

A.

This project, made possible with the support of the Magnum Foundation Emergency Grant in 2016 and the Prince Claus Fund, is finished. I am very happy because next month, I will go back to San Pedro to introduce the team of “The Poplin Project,” a socially responsible brand of artisanal textiles that wants to empower women and to create a future for underprivileged kids by working with small local organizations and cooperatives. This year, 33 percent of their profit will go to the women’s cooperative of charcoal producers of “Sissi Barra” in San Pedro. The aim is to finance a drinking water system, to build a safe recreation room for the women and children and to help the young girls get an education.

People who live in densely populated areas are all too familiar with sensory bombardment — the continuous light and noise pollution that has come to practically define the urban environment. Over time, most city dwellers grow so accustomed to this intense stimulation that they cease to notice it. Their perceptual thresholds, we might say, shift upward.

Others, though, see the need for a bulwark against this sensory pollution. In Idaho, where a good amount of pristine earth and sky still exists, officials are proposing the first “dark sky reserve” in the United States (a few smaller areas are already certified as dark sky parks and sanctuaries). If approved, it will strictly limit the use of artificial light to preserve the unique conditions that make the interstellar dust clouds of the Milky Way visible in Central Idaho on a clear night.

Of course, vision and hearing aren’t the only senses subject to pollution; so are smell and taste. Just as the glow of city lights causes twinkling stars to recede from sight, so sugar- and salt-laced foods prevent the palate from experiencing subtler flavors, and strong scents can also overwhelm and confuse our olfactory register.

Even touch, which philosophers since Aristotle have typically treated differently from “distance senses,” can be compromised. Consider that we drastically narrow the field of what can or should be touched, as we spend much of our time caressing the smooth and glassy bodies and touchscreens of our cellphones. It remains to be seen (or touched upon) what this phenomenon might do to our sense of touch.

I don’t mean to depict our sensorium — the entire range and capacity of our sensory experience — as a pure state that has been defiled by light, noise, flavor and scent pollution; that would just be another version of the original-sin-and-fall narrative. I would argue rather that we have managed to turn the senses against themselves by pitting overwhelming light against lights, overpowering sound against sounds, intense flavor against flavors, penetrating aroma against aromas.

The stabbings — and the presence of a switchblade in the school — stirred complaints from some parents that the school did not have metal detectors and prompted questions from reporters to the mayor and police officials about whether the school should have had them.

Foster City, Calif. — The tax cut framework recently put forward by President Trump relies on a central claim: that reducing taxes on corporations and wealthy individuals will open the wellsprings of entrepreneurship and investment, turbocharging job growth and the American economy. Were this premise true, reasonable people might countenance giving a vast majority of benefits to the very rich, as Mr. Trump’s plan does, in exchange for greater prosperity for all. But it’s not.

I am what certain politicians call a “job creator.” Two recessions ago, in 2001, five partners and I founded a software company in Silicon Valley. After great difficulty and great good fortune, that company grew to serve customers in over 30 countries, generating over $500 million in annual revenue and employing more than 2,000 professionals in high-skilled, high-paying jobs — a large majority of them in the United States. Today I am the chief executive of that company, Guidewire Software, valued on the New York Stock Exchange at over $5 billion.

As an entrepreneur myself and a friend to many others, I know that lower tax rates will not motivate more people to start companies. People start companies for many reasons: a compelling idea, ambition for fame and fortune, a desire to be one’s own boss, frustration with one’s employer. I have never heard someone say, “I would have started a company, but tax rates were too high” or “I wouldn’t have started this company, but then George W. Bush cut tax rates, so I did.”

While I can imagine tax regimes that would create disincentives for entrepreneurship, we don’t have that situation today in America, where tax rates on capital gains (the primary way that founders of successful start-ups make money) are already far lower than rates on ordinary income. Indeed, some of the most admired entrepreneurs — Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos — started their companies under significantly higher tax regimes. This is consistent with empirical research; the economists Robert Moffitt and Mark Wilhelm, for example, found that the large cuts in marginal tax rates in 1986 did not induce high-income men to work longer hours.

The job-creation reasoning is equally specious when applied to the behavior of existing companies.

Mr. Iger may not ultimately run into the political storm.","The first slogan for Disneyland, coined by Walt Disney himself, was “The Happiest Place on Earth.” As the company grew into a global brand, it maintained its association with fantasy and fun by avoiding political turbulence whenever possible.

This is the company that fired the comedian Bill Maher from his late-night television slot after the uproar he caused for arguing in 2001 that the Sept. 11 terrorists weren’t “cowardly” the way the United States was when it lobbed cruise missiles at targets from afar. The company refused to distribute its Miramax Film division’s Michael Moore film, “Fahrenheit 9/11,” because of its criticism of President George W. Bush and his prosecution of the Iraq war.

Yet when Jemele Hill, a host on the Disney-owned ESPN cable network, called President Trump a “white supremacist” in a tweet after Mr. Trump’s equivocal comments on the white nationalist march in Charlottesville, Va., in August, ESPN called it “inappropriate” but made no move to discipline her.

After Mr. Trump scolded the National Football League and its owners for some players’ protests during the national anthem, ESPN commentators like Rex Ryan didn’t hold back. “I supported Trump, and I’m appalled at these comments,” he said.

No less surprising has been the leeway the company has given the talk show host Jimmy Kimmel, who holds down the 11:30 p.m. time slot at the Disney-owned ABC, to go after Mr. Trump and the Republicans.

Having won over his audience with an average-guy demeanor, Mr. Kimmel found his inner firebrand when Mr. Trump led the fight to repeal the Affordable Health Care Act, a failed gambit that coincided with the late-night host’s learning that his infant son had been born with a heart defect. Mr. Kimmel, who grew up in Las Vegas, returned to political commentary with an emotional critique of the Republicans’ failure to address gun violence in the wake of the mass shooting that tore apart his hometown last week.

Before his attacks on ESPN and the late-night crew, Mr. Trump singled out ABC News anchors for nasty criticism, calling its chief anchor George Stephanopoulos “Little George” and telling the ABC News weekend anchor Tom Llamas, “You’re a sleaze.”

So it made for fascinating viewing when Mr. Iger showed up in Beverly Hills last week to sit for a question and answer session at Vanity Fair’s annual New Establishment Summit, a two-day schmoozefest for the machers of Hollywood, Silicon Valley and Wall Street.

Ordinarily at these sorts of events, it’s a chief executive’s job to say just enough to promote his brand — but not enough to offend shareholders, board members, employees and customers.

For Mr. Iger, who looked tall and fit in a crisp white shirt and navy blue cardigan, the talk was as much about hot-button politics as it was about how he intended to navigate cord-cutting and the rise of Netflix.

Speaking on the stage of the Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts, he defended the decision to refrain from disciplining Ms. Hill by saying, “I felt we needed to take into account what other people at ESPN were feeling at this time, and that resulted in not taking action.”

On gun control, after the Las Vegas massacre — in which one Disney employee was shot dead and another was shot in the lung — Mr. Iger said, “In this day and age, we get outraged when an athlete doesn’t stand for the national anthem — where’s the outrage here?”

Then there was the presidential question, which his inquisitor, the Vanity Fair writer Nick Bilton, posed while noting that he had been asked to avoid the subject.

Wincing a bit, the executive mentioned that his wife, the journalist Willow Bay, didn’t love the idea, before saying of his post-Disney future, “I’ll figure it out when I have to figure it out.” (Mr. Iger is scheduled to step down from Disney in 2019.)

It wasn’t a “yes,” but it wasn’t a “no,” either.

I had the chance to catch up with Mr. Iger at a Vanity Fair after-party at the Bouchon Bistro, an outpost for the media and show business elite in Beverly Hills.

I cornered Mr. Iger while he was sitting on a couch drinking a glass of white wine, as waiters delivered trays of lamb sliders and shrimp cocktail to a crowd that included Monica Lewinsky, the HBO chief Richard Plepler and Walter Isaacson, the Aspen Institute president and Steve Jobs biographer.

Brooklyn-born and Long Island-bred, Mr. Iger started out as a production assistant and worked his way up the Disney ladder, with a compensation package of $43.9 million last year. He has a slight New York accent that could help offset his otherwise polished presentation, if he were to run for public office.

I told him I had never seen Disney, or a Disney chief executive, so deep in the political mix. Mr. Iger himself, after all, quit his post on a White House advisory council, in protest of Mr. Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris climate accords. In September, he called the president’s decision to rescind the Obama-era program allowing the children of undocumented immigrants to remain in the United States — officially called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA — “cruel and misguided.” (Adding to the sense that Mr. Iger has politics on the brain, records show he switched his party registration from Democrat to no party preference last year.)

He didn’t necessarily agree with me, though he didn’t quite deny it.

He told me he had his limits, including with Mr. Kimmel, whose passion regarding guns and health care Mr. Iger said he appreciated. “That show is to entertain and, frankly, I understand him talking about Vegas, because that’s where he grew up,” Mr. Iger told me. “But I think he should be careful.”

His own positions, he said, were mostly about business during these “highly charged times.”

“I took a position on immigration and DACA because of how it affected the company,” he said. “And I took a position on climate change, actually the Paris accords, for the same reason.”

Mr. Iger’s name has been bandied about for months by those who track politics, as my colleague James B. Stewart noted in March, when he mentioned Mr. Iger as one of the chief executives who seemed like potential White House material given Mr. Trump’s success running as a business person with no political experience.

Mr. Trump was the head of a private company who had himself for a boss. Mr. Iger runs a public company, with shareholders and a board to answer to. That makes a run a trickier proposition, though the Disney stock price, four times higher than it was when Mr. Iger took over in 2005, could give him some leeway.

And as the overseer of such a sprawling company, Mr. Iger could see any number of unexpected issues pop up during a campaign. For instance, for many years Disney owned Miramax, the film company, and one of its founders, Harvey Weinstein, is now accused of having sexually harassed several women (Mr. Iger took over as the Disney chief executive after Mr. Weinstein broke from Disney).

• China’s slowing economy has opened the door to “business cults” — essentially pyramid schemes that have lured in tens of millions of people with promises of riches or advancement.

Despite a crackdown that began last month, after a 23-year-old college graduate was found dead in Tianjin, the government has warned that the schemes are spreading faster and growing larger. Above, suspected members of one scheme detained in Guangxi province in June.

For the authorities, a key concern is the intense loyalty some groups inspire, which could threaten the Communist Party’s own grip on society.

Early this morning at Confucius temples across Taiwan, robed officials performed elaborate ceremonies. The reason: Teacher’s Day, a day of honors for those who impart knowledge on what is believed to be the 2,567th birthday of Confucius, the ancient Chinese sage.

Many other countries designate a special day to celebrate the teaching profession. India commemorates the birthday of Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, a philosopher and the country’s president in the 1960s.

The U.S. celebrates National Teacher Appreciation Week in May.

Many countries have their Teacher’s Day next Thursday, thanks to a global effort started in 1994 by Unesco, the United Nations cultural organization, meant to spread respect for the profession.

The world body says that teachers remain underappreciated: “Strangely one of the most central, vital professionals to society does not receive the respect it deserves in some parts of the world.”

So here’s a timeless essay by an American teacher with tips on how to thank a teacher. The gesture won’t be forgotten, she wrote.

For many Saudi women, gaining the right to drive is not the end of the struggle.","Built on an alliance between a royal family and the descendants of an ultraconservative Muslim cleric, Saudi Arabia has struggled throughout its history with how to reconcile modernization with loyalty to religious heritage.

That debate heated up as oil wealth enriched the state, bringing in unfamiliar customs and technologies like television, public education and automobiles.

Over time, competing camps dug in around women and the right to drive.

For liberals, the driving ban was a blot on the national brand that was hampering modernization and weakening the economy.

Conservatives, including powerful clerics employed by the state, thought that allowing women to drive would be a crack in the dam that would allow secularism to flood in, washing away the kingdom’s unique Islamic identity.

The royal decree announced on Tuesday handed victory in that battle to the reformers, who had gained an advantage in recent years because of demographics, economics and the country’s young leadership, analysts said.

Saudi leaders, who have been criticized for the war in Yemen, the blockade of Qatar and a range of human rights issues, clearly hoped the step would help the kingdom’s reputation.

“There is no wrong time to do the right thing,” Prince Khalid bin Salman, the Saudi ambassador to Washington and a son of King Salman, told reporters after the change was announced.

The government also worked behind the scenes to control the message.

At least eight prominent women’s activists received calls and text messages from Saudi security officials warning them not to tweet or speak to the news media about the issue, according to three Saudi activists.

They presumed the government did not want to give credit to activists for prompting the change and spoke on condition of anonymity so as not to jeopardize the women — or themselves.

Many women cheered the decision, calling it a final victory in a long campaign for social change.

Manal al-Sherif, who was jailed for having posted videos of herself driving and who wrote a book about her activism, said her life had tracked the wider social changes in the kingdom.

Born into a poor conservative family in Mecca, Ms. Sherif, now 38, was taught that women were to remain at home and that good Muslims were to avoid “infidels” who did not share their faith, she said by phone from Australia, where she now lives.

Her worldview changed when as a university student in the Red Sea port city of Jidda, she saw women who did not cover their faces in public and even had boyfriends, though covertly.

Video

Then she got a job with the state oil company, Saudi Aramco. On its sprawling compound women enjoy greater freedoms than elsewhere in the kingdom, including the ability to drive.

She said that the status of women in Saudi Arabia had been used by the government over the years to placate conservatives.

“Our rights as women were always used in a political game, and that is what we wanted to stop,” she said. “That really kept the country behind.”

She credited King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, another of the king’s sons, with making the decisions necessary for the kingdom to advance.

“The government took the right decision,” she said. “Finally, they had the guts to say, ‘We were wrong.’”

It was difficult to immediately gauge reactions to the rescinded ban among more conservative Saudis. The government recently arrested more than two dozen people, including prominent clerics, some of whom had criticized government policies.

Three clerics employed by the government declined to comment when asked for their thoughts on the rescinded ban.

“Hahahahahahaha,” one responded on Whats App, offering no further comment.

Social media provided a glimpse.

By midafternoon on Wednesday, the Arabic hashtag “The people reject women driving” had appeared on 335,000 tweets, while the hashtag “The king is victorious for women driving” had appeared in only 33,700 tweets, according to Twitter.

But many users used the hashtags to join discussions, even if they disagreed with their message.

Even longtime campaigners said they expected some resistance.

“We’re a religious country,” said Fawziah Al-Bakr, a professor who has been campaigning for the right to drive for nearly three decades.

But religion had nothing to do with the issue, she said, noting that women in other predominately Muslim countries like Egypt, Sudan and Pakistan have been driving for a long time.

“All these women are Muslim and yet they are driving,” she said. “Not being able to drive has nothing to do with Islam.”

Previous reforms have been met with great resistance in the kingdom. Conservatives campaigned against the introduction of television, fearing it would fill Saudi homes with un-Islamic images.

Now many Saudi clerics have their own shows and are enthusiastic users of social media.

They also tried to prevent girls’ education.

Now many of their daughters are studying in Saudi universities, and even in the United States.

For many Saudi women, gaining the right to drive is not the end of the struggle. Many hope the government’s next step will be to lift its so-called “guardianship laws,” which require women to have the permission of a male “guardian” in order to get a passport, travel abroad or undergo certain medical procedures.

That could take time, but Ms. AbuSulayman, the television presenter, said the trajectory was clear.

About two thirds of the kingdom’s 22 million citizens are under 30 and they will grow up seeing women differently than their elders, she said. Many will not remember when women could not drive.

“I actually hate driving,” she said, laughing, but still planned to get a Saudi license.",Saudis Wonder What’s Next After the King Allows Women to Drive,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/world/middleeast/saudi-women-drivers.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

MONDAY PUZZLE — Happy Monday, all! Sam Ezersky here again. You may remember me from my “big break” two weeks ago or my diagramless in yesterday’s Magazine. Either way, I’ll be sticking around through Friday, and I promise I don’t bite. [Can confirm. — D.A.]

Let me start by sharing a little secret from my constructing perspective: A solid Monday puzzle is surprisingly hard to create. The theme should not only be exciting on its own, but must also appeal to solvers with widely varying backgrounds and skill levels. On top of this, the surrounding fill should not only be squeaky clean, but largely familiar. Thus, I’m always excited to see Bruce Haight’s byline early in the week, as I know he can produce a top-notch crossword given these criteria. Today’s offering was no disappointment.

Today’s Theme

Bruce has treated us to five, rhyming _ _ _ _ Y - _ _ _ _ Y phrases that cross at the middle letter:

17A/3D: “Useful” = HANDY-DANDY 19A/11D: “Snobbish” = HOITY-TOITY 39A/29D: “Sophisticated” = HOTSY-TOTSY 58A/48D: “Affectionate” = LOVEY-DOVEY 60A/51D: “Weak and indecisive” = NAMBY-PAMBY

Themes don’t get much more straightforward than this, but this is cute and well-crafted, especially since all answers are adjectival phrases as opposed to, say, HOKEY POKEY or LAFFY TAFFY.

It’s also a testament to how helpful the theme can be for getting toeholds elsewhere in the puzzle. Having trouble in the bottom-left corner, where there isn’t an easy three- or four-letter answer in sight? Well, if you’ve caught on to the theme in other areas of the grid, then filling in LOVEY/DOVEY shouldn’t be a problem, and boom! You may have just enough letters to grok answers like SILTS, SAY-SO and perhaps even HONEY-DO.

HONG KONG — Kim Jong-un has promoted his younger sister to North Korea’s most important political body, a rare public gesture of confidence by a leader whose dealings with family members are often opaque and sometimes deadly.

The sister, Kim Yo-jong, who heads the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea’s propaganda department and is the only one of Mr. Kim’s siblings active in his government, was made an alternate member of the Politburo on Saturday. Her promotion was announced Sunday by the state-controlled Korean Central News Agency.

Ms. Kim is believed to be 28 to 30 years old, which would make her the youngest member of the powerful but secretive decision-making body. Her promotion took place during a gathering of senior party members a day before the 20th anniversary of when the Kims’ father, Kim Jong-il, was named general secretary of the Workers’ Party.

Mr. Strange lost his primary runoff to Roy Moore, a provocative former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, who made attacking Mr. McConnell a central feature of his campaign.

“McConnell has become synonymous with gridlock,” said Richard C. Fording, a political scientist at the University of Alabama who followed the race closely. “I think people here are frustrated, and they have bought into this narrative that Mitch McConnell is to blame, that he’s incompetent, that he’s part of the establishment, that he’s controlled by special interests and synonymous with the status quo.”

Allies of Mr. McConnell poured millions into the runoff contest, painting Mr. Strange as a reliable Trump loyalist and Mr. Moore as a lifelong, untrustworthy politician.

But that story line never broke through. In fact, the race spotlighted growing divisions between establishment Republicans personified by Mr. McConnell and his allies and Trump Republicans, even though it was Mr. Strange who had the president’s endorsement.

The gap was so wide that when Mr. Trump campaigned for Mr. Strange, he tried to distance the senator from the Republican leader.

“They say he’s friendly with Mitch — he doesn’t even know Mitch McConnell,” Mr. Trump told a raucous crowd of several thousand people.

That was not quite true. The Senate Leadership Fund, a “super PAC” that Mr. McConnell helped found, spent nearly $9 million trying to elect Mr. Strange, said Steven Law, its president and chief executive. Mr. Law, like Mr. Holmes, attributed the outcome of the campaign to “dissatisfaction with the sluggish pace of change in Washington,” adding that “Republican primary voters are just as angry in 2017 as they were in 2016.”

With Democrats across the country energized by the election of Mr. Trump, some analysts say Democrats now have an outside chance to pick up the seat — even in a deeply conservative state like Alabama. But if Mr. Moore wins, he will almost certainly be a wild card in the Senate, where Mr. McConnell is already struggling to keep the 52 Republicans in line.

“The stakes here are high,” said Scott Jennings, a Republican strategist who is close to Mr. McConnell. “His majority of 52 is slim, and it’s even slimmer when you consider at any given time there are four to six of them who are contrarians. So if you take out a Luther, who is not a contrarian, and you throw in a Roy Moore, who’s going to be a contrarian, that makes the majority even less effective and productive.”

And it could get worse — much worse. Buoyed by Mr. Moore’s victory, conservatives like the former Trump strategist Stephen K. Bannon and Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska, now speak of separating “Trumpism” from Mr. Trump, and they are throwing themselves behind insurgent populists around the country.

Already, Trumpist candidates have emerged to challenge Senators Dean Heller of Nevada and Jeff Flake of Arizona in Republican primary races next year.

In Mississippi, Mr. Bannon is courting another firebrand, State Senator Chris McDaniel, to challenge Senator Roger Wicker, who embodies low-key country-club Republicanism.

And Mr. Bannon and allies are looking for a populist candidate to run for Tennessee’s Senate seat, which opened up Tuesday when Senator Bob Corker, a Republican, announced that he would not run for re-election.

Victories by such candidates would drastically remake the Senate, and could threaten Mr. McConnell’s leadership. Already, conservatives are smelling blood.

“If this was a football team and you lost this many times, you’d start firing the coaches,” said David Bozell, the president of For America, a conservative advocacy group.

Richard A. Viguerie, the conservative direct-mail guru, called Mr. Moore’s victory “a stunning rejection of Mitch McConnell’s corrupt and incompetent leadership.”

But in the Senate, Mr. McConnell has a deep well of support within his conference, in part because he is so effective a raising money to re-elect his fellow Republicans. He also has a thick skin.

“Senator McConnell is not a hot personality,” said Ralph Reed, the chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, an organization of social conservatives. “He doesn’t have real high highs, and he doesn’t have real low lows, and he’s been at this a long time, and he’s smart enough and wise enough to know that there are good days and not so good days in this business.”

Senate Republicans are clearly frustrated by the legislative gridlock that has gripped the chamber, especially the on-again, off-again effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The latest attempt ended Tuesday when Mr. McConnell concluded that he did not have the votes to pass the so-called Graham-Cassidy bill, which would have taken money spent under the law and given it to the states in the form of block grants.

“I wasn’t sent up here to sit around and talk,” complained Senator John Kennedy, a freshman Republican from Louisiana. “I was sent up here to make ordinary Americans’ lives better.”

But Mr. Kennedy said he did not blame Mr. McConnell.

By Marlon James

When I was 14, in 1984, I played Prince’s “Purple Rain” album so much that both parents would sing along, turning the whole house into a lyric-misreading protokaraoke. Their never getting the words was why I could play it in front of them, but I would never play the fifth song on the album, “Darling Nikki,” and it wasn’t because of the lyrics. This was perhaps Prince’s only song about sex that gave neither redemption nor relief, but I skipped to Side 2 because of the scream. The scream was mine, and I wasn’t about to share it.

There’s a story I can’t confirm that whenever Coltrane became overwhelmed by what he had to say, and frustrated that his sax could not say it, he would put it down and scream. The “Darling Nikki” scream was actually the third time Prince screamed on the record. But this time, the music dropped out, leaving nothing but this loud, unhinged, panicked, hopeless screech. It was the most electrifying seven seconds of my entire year.

In 1984, there was an awful lot for me to scream about, even if until “Darling Nikki,” I never knew screaming was an option. I knew I liked boys, and I knew I was going to hell for it, which was enough, but Earth wasn’t so hot either, trapped as I was in the endlessly repeatable boredom of suburbia, prefab houses, two cars, all the way down the street. Teenage boys think in teenage ways, and one of the few options for what I could do with my life was end it.

Or scream about it. The “Darling Nikki” scream defies paraphrasal. It was not cool; I was discovering an abyss in myself that somehow made me feel better for connecting with it. This was not easy in a house of six, but because I had few friends I was at home alone more than anybody else. And paradoxically, I discovered that screaming and volume did not have to be related. A lip-synced scream was loud enough. A whispered scream was better; a pillow-dampened scream was even better than that. It was strange how it made me feel afterward, not bolder or more at peace so much as more indifferent to taking a verbal punch, like the cool kids’ calling me homo.

Punks recognized this several years before: A scream was an invitation. We couldn’t all sing, but we could all scream, and in punk it wasn’t worthy if we couldn’t all do it. And because at 14, half of what you are experiencing you can’t even name, so what better way to respond than getting yourself alone and doing something equally nameless? But that was 1984. Why is a 46-year-old man still putting on “Darling Nikki” to karaoke a seven-second scream?

Because nowadays I find myself needing catharsis even more than antacid. On TV there’s much to scream about, but as with road rage, there’s no release. I play “Darling Nikki” loud enough to drown out my own voice. I ignore the song’s context, though its descent into psychosexual hell can apply to any personal or political torment. And when the music drops out and it’s just me and Prince, I let my voice rip so hard, even my eyes scream. This is 2017. There is more than enough to scream about.","Letters of Recommendation: ‘Twin Peaks,’ Screaming Karaoke and More",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/magazine/culture-issue-letters-of-recommendation-twin-peaks-get-out-screaming-karaoke.html

The batter required a trip to an Indian grocery for ingredients, then 24 hours to soak, grind and ferment. But it was easier than making bread dough since I didn’t have to knead.

After my batter puffed up into a glorious pale froth, I pulled out my favorite nonstick pan and started frying.

Kitchen wisdom says that, when it comes to frying crepes, the first few should be fed to the dog.

When I turned 60, I decided to see what color I am underneath. I started dyeing my hair a very light blond and then I let it grow out. I cut it very short.

When did you first start modeling?

At 15. I was a science nerd. I have two science degrees. I enjoyed the sciences, nutrition, so I always modeled part time, thinking it would end. And it hasn’t, of course. “Just getting started” is my hashtag. I had three kids in three years, so that slowed me down somewhat. I was 28 and the oldest model in the city.

What advice would you give to young models today?

Be nice to everybody. Keep your brain active. Read a lot.

Did you ever involve your kids in your modeling work?

When I didn’t have a nanny, the shows weren’t long, so they would have their books and sit in the front row. I tried to get them to model, but they found it boring. They didn’t have iPads back then. When you’re on set you stand a lot and you wait, wait, wait. Tosca was doing runway with me and she was about 11, and they did her hair in a style she hated and she refused to step on the runway. And I said, “That’s the end of your modeling career.” And that was fine with me, too.

What do you love about makeup?

For me, it makes a huge difference because my face is pretty plain, and I’m very fair with very few eyebrows and very short eyelashes. Makeup transforms me. I feel like I’m in disguise when I walk my dog without makeup on.

I was 12 or 13 when I started experimenting. At 15, I was modeling. I had to do my own hair and makeup. I also made my own clothes because I grew up in South Africa, where fashion was six months behind because of the seasons.

We wore a lot of makeup. It took us an hour to get ready. The eyelashes on top, the black eyeliner in the crease of the eye that you can see in photos from the ‘60s, the beehive hairstyle.

The modeling industry has a lot of issues with eating disorders and underweight workers. What’s your perspective on that as someone who studies nutrition?

There are models who are naturally skinny, but the thing is that many of them are emaciated. You can tell because they have hirsutism. There’ll be some hair on their face. It’s to protect their body and keep it warm because they’re too skinny. They also don’t have good energy. I’m surprised how many of them can do so many shows.

Some of the most skilled cooks I know — people who confidently roast, grill and fry — balk at the notion of braising. They think it’s more mysterious or fussy than other cooking methods. The opposite is true: Braising is extremely flexible, and it follows a formula.

There is an art to it. But since a good braise is so utterly, deliciously succulent, learning how is painless.

You need only to understand the process. It involves gently simmering vegetables, fish, fowl or meat (or a combination) with a small amount of liquid, usually in a covered pot. Braising chicken is a good place to start, and it’s a lot easier than you think.

Indisputably, the best part of the bird for this project is the thigh: It is the most succulent cut. Though a whole chicken chopped in pieces can be braised, skip the heartache of overcooked breast meat and stick to thighs; your fellow diners will thank you.

A chicken thigh is nearly impossible to overcook. There is forgiveness — 10 minutes longer in the oven simply means a little more tenderness. Thighs can also be cooked ahead and successfully reheated, often gaining juiciness and depth in the process. I am not, however, referring to skinless, boneless thighs. You want skin-on, bone-in meat.

But it has also prompted criticism of Brussels, which has been accused of unfairly targeting United States businesses, claims European officials deny.

Still, technology has been a focus of Margrethe Vestager, the European Union’s competition commissioner. Along with other investigations into Google, the commission has also opened inquiries into tax avoidance, data privacy and abuse of market position, affecting American household names like Amazon, Apple and Facebook.

In the case of Google, rivals had long complained that the company gave itself an unfair advantage by automatically putting some of its services at the top of so-called specialized search results. Such search products, like restaurant and business reviews, are increasingly lucrative.

Under the plan presented Wednesday, Google will create a stand-alone unit for its shopping service. That unit will remain part of its overall business, but will operate separately and will be subject to regular monitoring by the European Commission. Rival price comparison services, like Germany’s Idealo and a Dutch comparison site called Vergelijk.nl, would earn money from merchants whose products, from refrigerators to electronic gadgets, they are advertising. But they would also pay Google to take up those spaces.

Customers across the 28 members of the European Union, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, will be able to see those price comparison sites taking up the spots at the top of a search page where only Google Shopping had previously appeared.

“Google Shopping will compete on equal terms and will operate as if it were a separate business, participating in the auction in the same way as everyone else,” said Mr. Verney.

The commission has said that Google met its deadline to offer concessions, but has not commented on whether the moves would actually bolster competition. Fines for failing to meet the Thursday deadline could have been as high as 5 percent of the average daily global revenue of Alphabet, Google’s parent company. Google presented its plans to the commission at the end of August, but did not make them public until Wednesday.

Google would like the measure it’s implementing this week to apply narrowly to price comparison shopping services. But it faces complaints from rivals in other sectors as well, and they may see an opportunity for prying open Google’s formidable search platform.

Google already is facing two separate cases in Europe related to Android, its software for mobile devices, and to some of its advertising products. The company denies the accusations.

But even as Europe has pushed ahead with a series of antitrust charges against Google, the company has not faced the same scrutiny from regulators at home, giving cover to United States lawmakers and lobbyists accusing Europe of unfairly targeting American companies.

Still, Silicon Valley tech giants are facing shifting political winds at home, too.

American lawmakers increasingly worry about the expanding power of technology behemoths and, in particular, the role they may have played in the 2016 election. This shift has opened Google to attacks from both sides of the political spectrum on a wide range of issues, ranging from antitrust to privacy and public disclosure.

The risk of a regulatory crackdown is a significant one facing the company. It maintains a dominant position in online search, making the advertisements that run alongside its search results an indispensable part of marketing on the internet.

Consulting with Gardiner Harris, who covers international diplomacy for The Times and has written several articles about this case, I learned there was not even an official medical report.

I decided to try to draw some boundary lines for all the speculation swirling around the story. Is the idea of a sonic attack plausible, based on what scientists know about sound and the human body?

I wound up perusing a massive 2009 book called “ ‘Non-Lethal’ Weapons,” with a chapter summarizing research on using sound to incapacitate people at a distance.

But there’s less than meets the eye. There’s a lot of wild rumor about secret weapons that can make brains explode or make people think there’s a voice inside their head. And while medical researchers have studied the effects of sound for decades, they’ve done so sporadically, leaving us with a very patchy understanding.

So I hit the phone. I didn’t want to talk with just anyone — I looked for people with lots of experience in research that had direct bearing on this question. I started with Timothy Leighton, whose job title at Southampton University is, literally, professor of ultrasonics and underwater acoustics. Better yet, Dr. Leighton has published the only thorough recent scientific review of the effects of environmental ultrasound that I’m aware of.

When I interviewed Dr. Leighton and others, I made clear I didn’t expect them to solve this mystery; I just wanted them to reconcile the question with what we know through science. Everyone I spoke with had been following the news, too, so in each interview we hit the ground running.

Spoiler alert: The consensus was that it was extremely unlikely the diplomats were the victims of a sonic weapon. It would be necessary to rule out less exotic possibilities before taking that one seriously. The notion has ricocheted like mad around the press, making it possible for readers to assume that it has been generally accepted by experts. But it most certainly has not. I’ll be curious to see if articles like mine can put the brakes on the speculation.

If the United States government ever does release the results of a detailed investigation, I would love to report on the case again. But, as the retired acoustics professor Steven L.

“Let them know you’re waiting.”In an apparent nod to the harsh political realities the tax plan faces, Mr. Trump made an explicit overture to Democrats to support the plan.
“Democrats and Republicans in Congress should come together, finally, to deliver this giant win for the American people,” Mr. Trump said.
Studies of similar plans produced by Mr. Trump and House Republicans have been projected to cost $3 trillion to $7 trillion over a decade.","On the individual side, the plan would collapse the tax brackets from seven to three, with tax rates of 12 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent, the president said. The current top rate is 39.6 percent and the lowest rate is 10 percent. The framework also gives Congress the option of creating a higher, fourth, rate above 35 percent in the tax plan to ensure that the wealthy are paying their fair share.

The plan aims to simplify and cut taxes for the middle class by doubling the standard deduction to $12,000 for individuals and to $24,000 for married couples filing jointly. That would allow people to avoid a complicated process of itemizing their taxes to claim various credits and deductions. It would increase the child tax credit from $1,000 to an unspecified amount, and create a new $500 tax credit for non-child dependents, such as the elderly.

Provisions such as the alternative minimum tax and the estate tax, a levy on inherited wealth that Mr. Trump has derided for years, would be gone under the Republican proposal.

The proposal calls for reducing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, a shift that supporters say is needed to make American companies more competitive with their counterparts around the world.

A new tax rate of 25 percent would also be created for so-called pass-through businesses, such as partnerships and sole proprietorships, which are currently taxed at the rate of their owners. About 95 percent of businesses in the United States are structured as pass-throughs and they generate a majority of the government’s corporate tax revenue.

“This will be the lowest top marginal income tax rate for small and midsize businesses in this country in more than 80 years,” Mr. Trump said.

While Republican leaders claim to be united on the tax plan, they must now sell it to lawmakers who have been deeply divided this year. The push began at a House Republican retreat on Wednesday at Fort McNair in Washington, where Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the Republican chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, walked members through the blueprint and talked about the importance of coming together to fix the tax code.

Later, in a hopeful sign for Republican leaders fretting privately about keeping their rank and file together, the conservative Freedom Caucus, whose members have derailed the party’s initiatives with hard-line demands, issued a statement of support calling the plan “forward looking” and pledging to back the party’s budget designed to ensure its passage.

The political stakes are high for a president who is desperate to score a legislative win before his first year in office draws to a close. Mr. Trump, who has eschewed the advocacy tours that his predecessors have used to build support for their top domestic priorities, made a rare direct appeal to voters during his speech, imploring them to call their representatives and senators and demand action on the tax proposal. “Let them know you’re watching,” Mr. Trump said. “Let them know you’re waiting.”

In an apparent nod to the harsh political realities the tax plan faces, Mr. Trump made an explicit overture to Democrats to support the plan.

“Democrats and Republicans in Congress should come together, finally, to deliver this giant win for the American people,” Mr. Trump said.

But behind the scenes, Republican congressional leaders and senior White House officials have discussed bypassing Democrats and using special budget rules that would allow them to get the bill through Congress on a simple majority vote. And Mr. Trump paired his scripted talk of bipartisanship with an impromptu threat to Senator Joe Donnelly, Democrat of Indiana, saying he would personally work to defeat the senator’s re-election bid next year if he does not fall into line on the tax plan.

“If Senator Donnelly doesn’t approve it — because, you know, he’s on the other side — we will come here, we will campaign against him like you wouldn’t believe,” Mr. Trump said as Mr. Donnelly looked on from the audience.

Conservatives cheered the plan as a bold and long-awaited step to spur economic growth, while Democratic leaders condemned it as an irresponsible boon to the rich. And some budget watchdogs expressed worry about the long-term impact of a plan they said could cost more than $2 trillion over a decade.

Mr. Trump, who has broken with precedent for modern American presidents by refusing to release his tax returns, insisted that wealthy people like him would not benefit — an assertion that seemed improbable for a man who runs a family-owned real estate empire and whose children stand to inherit vast sums.

“Tax reform will protect low-income and middle-income households, not the wealthy and well-connected,” Mr. Trump said, framing a proposal that would affect hundreds of millions of Americans in terms of his own self-interest. “I’m doing the right thing, and it’s not good for me, believe me.”

Democrats scoffed. “If this framework is all about the middle class, then Trump Tower is middle-class housing,” said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee. “It violates Trump’s tax pledge that the rich would not gain at all under his plan by offering sweetheart deals for powerful C.E.O.s, giveaways for campaign coffers and a new way to cheat taxes for Mar-a-Lago’s loyal members.”

As with the individual side, some of the thornier business tax issues remain unaddressed. It will be left to Congress to create safeguards that prevent wealthy individuals from incorporating as pass-through businesses, which would tax their income at a lower rate.

Most itemized deductions, including those widely used for state and local tax expenses, would also be eliminated, along with most of the tax credits that businesses use. However, the plan would preserve the deductions for mortgage interest expenses and charitable giving and keep incentives for education and retirement savings plans, as well as preserve the tax credits for research and development and low-income-housing on the business side.

Another big change for companies would be a limitation of the deductibility for corporate interest expenses, in exchange for the opportunity to immediately expense business investments. The ability to immediately write off these expenses would last only five years, and the limitations for deducting interest have yet to be determined.

Perhaps the most significant, yet murky, shift is the move from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system for multinational corporations. In theory, this means that companies would not be taxed on their overseas earnings. But to prevent erosion of the tax base, Republicans plan to impose some form of tax on foreign profits. The transition to the new system would also include a one-time repatriation tax at yet-to-be-determined rates to encourage companies to bring offshore profits back home.

Administration officials did not provide a cost estimate for the plan. Members of the Senate Budget Committee have agreed on a budget resolution that would allow for a $1.5 trillion tax cut over 10 years. Studies of similar plans produced by Mr. Trump and House Republicans have been projected to cost $3 trillion to $7 trillion over a decade.

Republicans say economic growth will compensate for lost revenue. Senator Patrick J. Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican who sits on the Finance Committee, said he was confident that a growing economy would pay for the tax cuts.

“This tax plan will be deficit reducing,” Mr. Toomey said.",Trump Proposes the Most Sweeping Tax Overhaul in Decades,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/us/politics/trump-tax-cut-plan-middle-class-deficit.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Don’t worry, be happy — it might make your flu shot more effective.

A new study suggests that older people who are in a good mood when they get the shot have a better immune response.

British researchers followed 138 people ages 65 to 85 who got the 2014-15 vaccine. Using well-validated tests in the weeks before and after their shots, the scientists recorded mood, stress, negative thoughts, sleep patterns, diet and other measures of psychological and physical health. They assessed their antibody response to the vaccine with blood tests at four and 16 weeks after their injections. The study is in Brain, Behavior, and Immunity.

Greater levels of positive mood were associated with higher blood levels of antibodies to H1N1, a potentially dangerous flu strain, at both four and 16 weeks post-vaccination. No other factors measured were associated with improved immune response.

The authors acknowledge they were not able to control for all possible variables, and that their observational study does not prove cause and effect.

The senior author, Kavita Vedhara, professor of health psychology at the University of Nottingham, said that many things could affect vaccine effectiveness, but most are not under a person’s control — age, coexisting illness or vaccine history, for example.

“It’s not there aren’t other influences,” she said, “but it looks like how you’re feeling on the day you’re vaccinated may be among the more important.”",An Upbeat Mood May Boost Your Flu Shot’s Effectiveness,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/25/well/live/an-upbeat-mood-may-boost-your-flu-shots-effectiveness.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

All three at some point were down in the polls, and they staged comebacks by radicalizing. Radicalization meant adopting the very same policies the opposition feared the most: anti-secularism in Turkey, anti-Europeanism in Hungary and anti-pluralism in Venezuela. But it also meant spewing epic insults against key figures in their countries, including respected public figures and celebrities. The rationale behind these attacks was to get the opposition to become extreme too.

When the opposition adopts extreme positions, paradoxically, it can expand the president’s electoral base because it provokes a merger of die-hard supporters and ambivalent moderates. The hard-liners respond by saying: As bad as our president’s flaws might be, they are nothing compared with the excesses of the other side. Moderates, witnessing the excesses within the opposition, begin to agree with them.

Whereas a non-polarizing president might tell his most extreme supporters to chill, a polarizing president needs them to freak. That’s how he can offer himself as protection for his base. It’s important, therefore, to always associate his targets with the enemy’s ideology. So when Mr. Trump attacked Mayor Cruz, he made sure to add that she was taking cues from Democrats.

Mr. Trump has discovered the benefits of making the opposition scream. And because he knows that his base, at its core, is an anti-elite coalition, he understands that he has a green light from his base to become America’s leading iconoclast. The more he disparages people and institutions of repute, the more his core will feel satisfied politically. That’s the diet you feed every anti-elite populist coalition.

Polarization, of course, produces intense animosity from the other side, and this is risky for any president. Facing this risk, a president can either make a change in policy course or cultivate anti-dissentism. Mr. Trump is choosing the latter.

Anti-dissentism requires exaggerating how groundless dissent is. That is why the president, in his hate-tweets, likes to invoke the how-dare-you argument. With Mayor Cruz, Mr. Trump wondered how dare she criticize him with all that federal employees were doing for Puerto Rico. With N.F.L. players, he made sure to remind them of their “privilege of making millions” in the N.F.L.

Given that Mr. Trump’s survival strategy is to polarize, his critics need to learn to play his war of words carefully. They must take a stand, while still avoid emulating the president’s escalation tactic, so as not to validate the image that the president wants to portray of them.

“We’ve tried attacking property taxes in all different ways,” he said.
“But you need structural changes on the local and county level if you’re going to make a real difference in property taxes.
Nonetheless, some county officials still viewed the initiative with skepticism, even cynicism.","The new statute, enacted into law when the state budget passed in April, laid out a timeline by which leaders in every county outside New York City had to appoint a panel of local elected officials, brainstorm ideas for sharing services, draft a plan and hold a vote. As an incentive, the state said that in 2018, the first full year of implementation, it would match any savings the towns and counties achieved.

Nearly three dozen counties approved such plans earlier this month, for a total savings to taxpayers next year of $220 million, state officials said. The other counties decided to punt the initiative to next year, when they will have to follow a similar timeline. If panels reject a shared-services plan, the law requires any members who cast nay votes to explain their decisions to constituents.

The goal of leaders in Albany is to reduce taxes — a formidable task, given that New York State makes up a taxable kingdom. There are county, city, town and village governments, along with school districts, each with their own budgets and taxing authority. Then there are fire districts, water districts, sewer districts, park districts and on and on.

The layers of services, and taxes, have made the tax bill an object of dread, particularly in suburbs like Westchester and Nassau, which frequently top rankings for the nation’s highest property taxes. Yet historically, the push to consolidate by regionalizing a high school, say, or merging two police departments has been anathema to many residents who are loath to even share their snowplows.

In announcing passage of the state budget, Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, called high property taxes “the single greatest problem in this state,” pointing out that the median state income tax was $1,800, compared to the median property tax of $4,700. In 2011, the governor and the Legislature approved a cap on property taxes in an effort to limit the annual growth to 2 percent or the rate of inflation.

“We’ve tried attacking property taxes in all different ways,” he said. “But you need structural changes on the local and county level if you’re going to make a real difference in property taxes. This budget empowers citizens to say to their local governments, ‘Enough is enough. We need you to make structural changes and we need you to do it now.’”

The new statute stopped short of making local governments combine village halls or even municipal departments, avoiding the unpopular term “consolidation” altogether. Nonetheless, some county officials still viewed the initiative with skepticism, even cynicism.

Steve Bellone, the Suffolk County executive, saw it as an opportunity.

A few years ago, Mr. Bellone oversaw the merger of the county comptroller and treasurer departments. “It’s human inclination to want to keep things the same,” he said. “These were two departments within county government and that was a massive challenge. So getting separate and distinct governments working together is a monumental task.”

Mr. Bellone immediately appointed Mr. Kaiman to become the shared-services czar; Mr. Kaiman, a former supervisor of North Hempstead, had managed to swap services and streamline government functions in that sprawling town, which has no fewer than 30 incorporated villages and 11 school districts.

“This wasn’t a volunteer scenario,” Mr. Bellone said from his 12th-floor office in the county government complex here. “But I viewed it as an opportunity to have leaders in our region communicate and collaborate in a way that we never have before, with the idea that positive things could come from that.”

Getting a majority of the 48 mayors, supervisors and school leaders on the shared-services panel to a yes vote was not easy, however.

In fact, in the days before the shared-services statute became law, the Suffolk County Village Officials Association passed a resolution opposing it. In a letter to Mr. Bellone, the association said the initiative “poses a serious threat to home rule, restricts village budgets and jeopardizes the ability of local municipalities to adequately govern.”

Mr. Kaiman’s first priority was to meet with mayors and town supervisors to reassure them that the state initiative was more about sharing than consolidating.

“It’s about identity,” said Mr. Kaiman, explaining the resistance. “I identify with my local school and my local village or town. People don’t want to lose that. But we can still come up with ways to benefit from our common resources, our excess capacity.”

After meeting throughout the summer, the panel drafted a plan that is projected to save a potential $37 million over two years.

As an example, Mr. Kaiman said that if one municipality had a graffiti-cleaning truck, but only used it part of the year, officials could rent the truck to towns and villages that don’t have one. “I can call up Islip and ask to rent their graffiti truck,” he said. “Otherwise, I would have to hire some company or dedicate 10 workers to scrape off graffiti. The town with the resource is making money. The town that’s getting the resource is saving money by not going to the private sector.”

When Mr. Kaiman led North Hempstead, the town’s sign shop made 2,000 signs for local schools and governments. “Villages and schools were getting estimates of $1,250 for one sign, so we did it for $450,” he said.

Robert Mujica, the state budget director, praised Suffolk’s plan. “It’s robust,” he said. “They took it very seriously. They looked at not only sharing services but using technology and auditing processes to make sure the savings are there. All the things you should be doing — it looks like they did.”

State officials said that some 400 initiatives were included in the plans approved by counties this year. In Montgomery County, changes to the way records are retained is expected to yield $1.5 million in taxpayer savings. Nassau County’s plan included more than a dozen ideas for sharing services among villages, from pothole repair to code enforcement. The initiative should save $130 million over a number of years.

Virtually all of the savings in the Nassau plan — $128 million — would result from the conversion of Long Beach’s antiquated sewage treatment plant to a pump house, diverting the city’s wastewater to a county plant.

In Suffolk, its shared-services plan was passed unanimously on Sept. 12. Mr. Kaiman believes the key to securing the panel’s support was the emphasis on autonomy. In other words, no one will be forced to share or buy or barter.

“If it’s not exactly the product you want, go use the local sign shop,” he said. “You never lose your independent authority as a municipality. We believe in local government too. We don’t believe in waste and inefficiency.”","New York Towns’ New Deal: We’ll Make Your Signs, You Sweep Our Streets",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/08/nyregion/new-york-consolidation-shared-services.html

When the Clean Power Plan was unveiled in 2015, it was expected to cut power sector emissions 32 percent by 2030, relative to 2005. While many states are already shifting away from coal power for economic reasons, experts say scrapping the rule could slow that transition.

Environmental groups and several states plan to challenge the repeal proposal in federal courts, arguing against Mr. Pruitt’s move on both scientific and economic grounds.

Industry groups cheered the announcement, but have also indicated that they would prefer that Mr. Pruitt replace the Clean Power Plan with a new, more modest regulation on power plants in order to blunt any court challenges. The E.P.A. is still required to regulate greenhouse-gas emissions because of a 2009 legal opinion known as the endangerment finding.

“We have always believed that there is a better way to approach greenhouse gas emissions reductions,” Karen A. Harbert, the president of the Chamber of Commerce’s Global Energy Institute said in a statement. “We welcome the opportunity for business to be at the table with the E.P.A. and other stakeholders to develop an approach that lowers emissions, preserves America’s energy advantage, and respects the bounds of the Clean Air Act.”

How does Trump plan to roll back the Clean Power Plan?

In order to regulate pollution from existing power plants, the E.P.A. has to set goals for each state based on what’s technically feasible and cost-effective. Under the Clean Power Plan, the Obama administration set targets by assuming utilities could improve the efficiency of their coal plants, shift from coal to cleaner natural gas, and add more renewable energy to their grids.

But Mr. Obama’s approach was controversial, because the E.P.A. assumed utilities could reduce emissions at individual plants by taking actions outside of those plants — say, by replacing coal plants with wind farms elsewhere. Industry groups and more than two dozen states challenged this move in court, arguing that the E.P.A. can only look at cleanup measures that can be undertaken at the plants themselves.

Mr. Pruitt is proposing to repeal the Clean Power Plan on this basis. He also argued that the Obama administration overstated the benefits of its rule by factoring in the gains from curbing global warming in other countries as well as from reducing harmful air pollutants other than carbon dioxide.

If Mr. Pruitt does end up pursuing a replacement rule, it would almost certainly be confined to inside-the-fenceline measures, like upgrading coal-plant boilers. Previous E.P.A. analyses found that such upgrades would lead to a roughly 4 percent increase in efficiency at coal plants.

What does this mean for emissions?

While the repeal of the Clean Power Plan offers a reprieve for America’s coal industry, it is unlikely to halt the decline of coal altogether. Even in the absence of the rule, many utilities around the country have opted to shift to natural gas, wind and solar, driven by cost concerns and state-level policies. Many states, like California and New York, are already moving ahead of the targets set by the Clean Power Plan as they develop their own climate policies.

Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado, a Democrat, noted that his state has plans to exceed the goals that had been set under the Clean Power Plan because the state is closing coal plants early and developing jobs in wind and other renewables.

“We have dramatically cleaner air and we are saving money. My question to the E.P.A. would be, ‘Which part of that don’t you like?’ ” Mr. Hickenlooper said.

A new analysis by the research firm Rhodium Group estimated that United States electricity emissions are currently on track to fall 27 to 35 percent below 2005 levels by 2025, roughly in the range of what the Clean Power Plan originally envisioned, even if the regulation is repealed.

But John Larsen, the author of the Rhodium Group analysis, estimated that if Mr. Obama’s policies had remained in place, as many as 21 states would have had to make deeper reductions than they are currently expected to do without the rule — including Texas, West Virginia, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — and emissions most likely would have fallen further than the 32 percent originally envisioned.

“So for certain states,” Mr. Larsen wrote, “today’s announcement is a big deal.”

Experts also note that the Clean Power Plan would have prevented a rebound in coal use in case natural gas unexpectedly became more expensive or various policies to promote renewable energy were blunted. The repeal comes on the heels of a proposal by the Department of Energy to subsidize coal and nuclear plants by revamping electricity markets.

Jody Freeman, director of the environmental law program at Harvard Law School, said the Energy Department proposal combined with the Clean Power Plan repeal signals the Trump administration is putting its thumb on the scale in favor of fossil fuels.

“You see a pretty powerful message. Disavow any effort to control greenhouse gases in the power sector, and instead, intervene in the market to promote coal. It’s a wow,” she said.

What happens next?

Mr. Pruitt’s proposal for repeal will now have to go through a formal public-comment period before being finalized, a process that could take months. Mr. Pruitt will also ask the public for comment on what a replacement rule should look like, but the E.P.A. has not offered a timeline.

Environmental groups and Democratic-controlled states are expected to challenge these moves on multiple fronts.

“Every step of this, from the repeal to the replacement, will involve a lot of time-consuming litigation, and we could ultimately see this end up in the Supreme Court,” said Richard L. Revesz, a professor of environmental law at New York University.

That raises the question of whether the Trump administration can craft and finalize a replacement rule by the 2020 election. Failure to do so, some industry groups worry, could allow a new administration to start over and impose a more stringent climate plan on power plants.

Partly for that reason, many states are already preparing for the prospect of tougher carbon regulations down the road.

Consider Arkansas, one of the states that challenged the Clean Power Plan in court. Ted J. Thomas, the chairman of the Arkansas Public Service commission, says that his state is nonetheless in the process of shifting from coal to cheaper natural gas. The initial rule also convinced the state to start exploring clean-energy options, like expanding wind power, promoting the use of smart meters, and developing a working group to look at carbon capture technology for coal plants.

“Even if they repeal the Clean Power Plan, or replace it with something that doesn’t require us to do very much, you still have to reckon with the fact that ultimately regulations on carbon are coming,” Mr. Thomas said. “So we need to develop options to deal with that other than sticking our heads in the sand and hoping we can just file lawsuits forever.”

“You can either be prepared or unprepared,” he added, “and that’s a pretty simple choice.”",E.P.A. Announces Repeal of Major Obama-Era Carbon Emissions Rule,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/09/climate/clean-power-plan.html

They preferred the one on the lower floor, for $2,350. The relatively large living room faced the back, away from street noise. And even with outdated cabinets, limited closet space and a small bathroom, the apartment seemed well worth the money.

Still, they happily signed on. The broker’s fee was 12 percent of a year’s rent, or $3,384.

With time, in fact, she assumed a style that had hitherto been the exclusive province of men: a charisma that comes from dispensing with the need to be liked. And in featuring her, Fox News was doing more to break female stereotypes than any of the more mainstream networks.

It’s true that Ms. Kelly developed her signature style while perfectly coifed, with obligatory blond streaks. And it’s true that she developed her brand of magnetic unlikability while outfitted in Fox’s ubiquitous jewel-toned dresses, her legs exposed beneath the obligatory glass table. But Megyn Kelly’s power came not from her beauty but from her sharp-wittedness, her familiarity with the issues, and her willingness to ask tough questions and demand answers — the same traits that were on full display in the infamous Republican debate when she took on Candidate Trump.

She certainly had viewpoints that liberals found unsavory. There was the time she insisted to all the children watching that Santa Claus is white. She also seems to be in the All Lives Matter, “what about black-on-black crime?” corner. But over the years she also became increasingly interested in women’s issues, and remained utterly unflappable in the face of Republican male hysteria, as when she told Newt Gingrich to work on his anger issues.

Watching Ms. Kelly make minced meat of men and insist on her right to eschew likability, I — a liberal — admired her. I often found myself thinking that if she could do this kind of work from behind that glass Fox News desk, imagine what she could do if she were freed from it. When she left Fox News for NBC and a reported $23 million yearly contract, it looked as if I was going to get my wish.

Oh, the irony.

Instead of unleashing her, NBC has attempted to transform Megyn Kelly into one of the nice girls of mainstream media, another Kelly Ripa, Savannah Guthrie or Katie Couric. The results have been predictably awkward. The glee at her stumble has been swift and vicious.

Why was Megyn Kelly’s transition into the mainstream accompanied by this kind of neutering? Why did Fox News have more room for this charismatic, difficult woman than NBC? It’s hard to say. Mainstream talk shows — morning shows in particular — have never had much of an appetite for difficult. And at a time when our country is so divided, it was always likely that a network like NBC would try to cast as broad a net as possible, meaning that politics would be off the table for someone like Ms. Kelly.

Whatever the reason, however, her descent into banal harmlessness operates as a cautionary tale to all women: You will have to be likable if you want to go mainstream.

National Parks Struggle With a Mounting Crisis: Too Many Visitors

The rocky shorelines, shifting deserts and winding canyons of the country’s 59 national parks have been hallmarks of American vacations for generations.

But the number of park visitors has reached an unprecedented level, leaving many tourists frustrated and many environmentalists concerned about the toll of overcrowding.

Image Credit

In 2016, the National Park Service tracked a record 331 million visits, and after a busy summer, the system is likely to surpass that number this year. In August alone, some 40 million people came through park service gates.

Image Credit

Shuttle buses at Zion National Park, in southwest Utah, filled like sweaty subway cars. Selfie-takers clogged the slender path through the Narrows slot canyon, one of the park’s best-known attractions. And at the top of Angels Landing, an iconic trail of switchbacks on the east side of the park, some portable toilets were marked off with a sign: “Due to extreme use, these toilets have reached capacity.”

Zion is among the most visited parks in the system and is particularly prone to crowding because many of its most popular sites sit in a narrow six-mile canyon. In 2016, about 4.3 million people visited, up 60 percent from a decade ago.

So this year, park managers announced they were considering a first for any national park: requiring reservations for entry. A final decision is expected in 2018.

“We don’t have a choice,” said Jack Burns, who has worked in Zion since 1982. “We have to do something. If this going to remain a place of special importance for generations, we have to do something now.”

The National Park Service was created in 1916 to protect the country’s growing system of parks and monuments. Its mandate is to conserve scenery and wildlife while also protecting visitor enjoyment for generations to come. For years, the lack of a reservation system for park entry aligned with the service’s ethos of democracy and discovery: Anyone could come, pretty much anytime. (The service has long required permits for hiking in more remote areas.)

But lately, both visitors and nature are suffering. Mr. Burns, who is on a team that is considering a reservation system, said some people showed up for a vacation they had planned for months, spent a day in the gridlock and turned around. Rangers, stressed by the frustrated masses, have started a monthly meeting to discuss “visitor use” that some say has turned into a group-therapy session.

And Zion’s delicate desert ecosystem has been battered by tourists, some of whom wash diapers in the Virgin River, scratch their names into boulders and fly drone cameras through once quiet skies. The park has about 25 miles of developed trails. But over time, rangers have mapped about 600 miles of visitor-made paths, which damage vegetation and soil and take a toll on wildlife.

The story is similar at parks from Yosemite in California to Acadia in Maine. And the crowding problem comes as the system faces the dual threat of a funding shortage and climate change.

The park system has a maintenance backlog of more than $11 billion and President Trump has proposed a 13 percent cut to the service.

At the same time, park officials have identified the heat and floods of climate change as one of the system’s greatest perils. In Zion, as maximum temperatures in the summer have risen, the heat-intolerant American pika , a tiny mammal related to rabbits, has disappeared. Rangers call it a sign of what is likely to come : smaller streams, more frequent droughts and other shifts in the ecosystem.

This summer, administrators at Zion submitted three proposed visitor plans to the public.

One option would require people to make an online reservation before arrival, and would set a yet-to-be-specified limit on visitors. The second option would require reservations only for certain areas. The third option would be to make no changes.

About 1,600 people sent in comments, and the park plans to send out a revised round of proposals for public review. Superintendent Jeff Bradybaugh will make the final decision.

Some have expressed opposition to the reservation idea, including a group that founded the website stopzionreservations.org .

Mr. Burns said he favored a reservation policy. He recalled the days when he would jump in a car and pull up to parks across the West with no plans.

When he first came to the park in the 1980s, he was a young employee at the lodge, and he wrote a letter home. “I’m living in no-man’s-land,” he told his parents. He could hike for hours, even days, without seeing a soul, and he remembered a constant sensitivity to the changing light on the canyons, the brilliant green of the trees, the emerald water of the Virgin River.

Today, he said, when he finds solitude, it is usually accompanied by the distant rumble of the shuttle bus.

“There is only one Zion National Park,” he said to those struggling to see a need for limiting access. “And it’s sacred. Its beauty is sacred.”

Jurich met with members of the university’s board Wednesday morning but left after only five minutes. Pitino met with the trustees soon after Jurich. His meeting, too, was short; one reporter waiting outside noted that the driver of the vehicle that delivered Pitino did not turn off its engine while he was inside.

On Tuesday evening, Pitino denied any knowledge of, or responsibility for, the accusations detailed in the federal charges, saying in a statement: “These allegations come as a complete shock to me. If true, I agree with the U.S. Attorney’s Office that these third-party schemes, initiated by a few bad actors, operated to commit a fraud on the impacted universities and their basketball programs, including the University of Louisville.”

Pitino was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2013, recognition for a four-decade coaching career in college basketball and the N.B.A. With 770 wins over parts of 32 seasons, Pitino ranks 12th on the Division I career victories list — although that figure could change pending the appeal of the N.C.A.A. penalties announced in June. He is also the only college coach to win national titles with two different colleges, Kentucky and Louisville — although that distinction, too, could change if Louisville is forced to vacate its 2013 championship.

The reasons for the potential erasure of dozens of his wins at Louisville, and his second N.C.A.A. championship, are allegations, some of which Louisville has accepted, that a former basketball staff member who had played under Pitino hired prostitutes to entertain recruits and players in an on-campus dormitory.

While the N.C.A.A. has vacated victories and even Final Four appearances, it has never stripped a championship from the winner of its signature annual tournament.

While in that case the N.C.A.A. accepted Pitino’s explanation that he had no knowledge of the actions of the assistant found to be responsible, it nonetheless found that he had failed in his broader obligation to monitor his staff. Pitino and Louisville have disputed that conclusion, which led to his suspension, pending appeal, for the first five games of Atlantic Coast Conference play this season.

Tuesday’s federal charges, which also implicated the global marketing director for Adidas basketball, four assistant coaches at other Division I programs and several other men involved in college basketball, detailed a scheme to funnel money to two prospects in order to attend a university whose description matches Louisville, and of doing so with the knowledge of two unidentified coaches at the school. It was not clear whether the man the complaint calls Coach-2, who is characterized as having significant leverage at Adidas (which sponsors Louisville), is Pitino.

Born in New York City and raised on Long Island, Pitino never lost the thick accent he earned during a childhood in the region, and first made his name with an improbable Final Four run with Providence in 1987. His career also included less successful stints in the N.B.A., with the Knicks and the Boston Celtics.

Most notably, he revived the two beloved college programs in the Bluegrass State, first leading the University of Kentucky, starting in 1989, out of heavy N.C.A.A. sanctions and to three Final Fours, including the 1996 national title, and then leading the Cardinals to three Final Fours and another national title.

The fact that Pitino was not fired outright could be financial. Pitino, according to a USA Today database, is the nation’s highest paid college basketball coach, at more than $7.7 million a year, and his contract includes language that gives him 10 days to contest a firing for cause.

And while he was a prodigious chronicler of vernacular American culture, his own roots were hardly common. Born Walker Evans III, the scion of a prominent family, he grew up in privilege, attending Phillips Academy and then Williams College, dropping out after one year.

A turning point for Evans was his decision — like many young men of means — to go to Paris in 1926 to study for a year at the Sorbonne. His stay filled his head with ideas gleaned from Flaubert and Baudelaire, but it was another Frenchman — Eugène Atget — whose work affected him the most, leading to the dry, observational style that became his visual signature.

Clément Chéroux, a French curator, organized a massive Walker Evans retrospective at the Centre Pompidou in Paris, which recently traveled to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, (where he is now the head of the photography department). He said Evans tried to emulate in America what Atget did in Paris.

“Atget has tried to define, through his photographs — what is the Parisian vernacular? What is the visual spirit of Paris? And Evans has done exactly the same with America,” Mr. Chéroux said. “What is so interesting for me, in this exchange between American and French culture, is that he has tried to define the American vernacular culture, but with the method and style of French culture.”

Evans embodied a paradox: a member of the American elite drawn to unfussy places, urban workers and desperate farmers, becoming best known for his seminal project with James Agee, “Let Us Now Praise Famous Men,” about America’s poor and downtrodden during the Great Depression.

For Mr. Chéroux, this paradox was an interesting way to understand Evans. The curator has done scholarly research into the vernacular, which he defines as “useful, domestic and popular” in an essay in the exhibition catalog. “Maybe one of the reasons why I’m fascinated with Evans is because there is so much paradox in his work,” he said. “There is this dialectical tension between Europe and the U.S., and there is also this very strong dialectical tension between an aristocratic or elite point of view, and a subject which is definitely popular culture, and workers.”

The specific nature of the Atget-Evans vision, with its emphasis on large format, razor sharp, perfectly observed, almost preternaturally quiet moments, allows the photographs to impress viewers nearly a century later. Evans had a simple explanation: Atget’s photographs had a transcendent quality, which he tried to emulate.

Photo

In an interview with Lincoln Kirstein, who wrote an essay for Evans’s 1938 book “American Photographs,” Evans said, “Take Atget, whose work I now know very well. In his work you do feel what some people call poetry. I do call it that also, but a better word for it, to me, is, well – when Atget does even a tree root, he transcends that thing. And by God somebody else does not.”

By looking at things previously unobserved, or subjects once thought beneath the purview of art, Evans created a vision of America that is still inextricable from our national identity. And while his initial exposure to Atget’s work might have been coincidental — his friend Berenice Abbott showed him a trove of the Frenchman’s work — his subsequent choice of subject matter was not.

In another essay in the exhibition catalog, Evans said his early work was influenced by his feelings about the United States. “I was really anti-American at the time,” he said. “America was a big business and I wanted to escape. It nauseated me. My photography was a semi-conscious reaction against right-thinking and optimism; it was an attack on the establishment. I could just hear my father saying, ‘Why do you want to look at those scenes, they’re depressing. Why don’t you look at the nice things in life?’ Nothing original about that though.”

This might be the key to understanding his role in the history of photography, as he heavily influenced subsequent generations, including the famed “New Topographics” movement of the 1970s. (When asked via email whether Evans’s work had inspired him and his colleagues, Stephen Shore simply replied, “Yes.”)

According to Mr. Chéroux, Evans was able to adopt a neutral stance and let the magic, or inherent tension, of a scene speak for itself. He notably contrasted this style against the showy, artsy technique employed by contemporaries like Alfred Stieglitz and the Modernists.

“He wants to disappear in front of his subject, to let this emotion transfer from the subject to the viewer,” he said of Evans. “I think this is really what he understood. It’s the reason why he is so close to Atget. All the photographers who think that the subject is more important than themselves are in this position.”

The retrospective, while focusing on the past, and including selections from Evans’s personal collection of vernacular art, also allows viewers to appreciate how photography, a slice out of time, relates to the present. In particular, his 1937 photographs showing people displaced by floods in the South are just as relevant today.

“That’s the power of art,” Mr. Chéroux said, “to address some historical questions, but to address them in the present time. To create a kind of effect that is both present and past, and I think this is something photography is really great at.”

tl;dr: Mondays are the easiest and they get harder as the week goes on.

This is probably a beginning solver’s most common mistake.

You know what it’s like: You have some downtime on a Saturday and you look around for something to pass the time. Your officemate keeps bragging about his ability to finish The New York Times Crossword. You hate your officemate.

So, not to be outdone, you pick up the paper or download our app and turn to the Saturday puzzle. How hard could it be?

Fun Fact: The Saturday crossword is actually the hardest puzzle of the week. Contrary to popular belief, the Sunday puzzles are midweek difficulty, not the hardest. Mondays have the most straightforward clues and Saturday clues are the most vague or involve the most wordplay. Some later-week puzzle clues may require specialized knowledge.

Just to drive the point home, let’s take a look at the difference between a Monday clue and a late-week clue for a popular crossword entry. OREO cookies (answers in puzzles are generally written in all capital letters) are such a popular entry in crosswords that they have been dubbed by some as the “official” cookie of the crossword. A typical Monday clue for OREO will be very straightforward and drive you almost directly to the answer.

“Nabisco cookie”

“Cookie with creme filling”

“‘Twist, Lick, Dunk’ cookie”

And here are some late-week clues, which might require more specialized knowledge about these delicious treats:

“Snack since 1912”

“It has 12 flowers on each side”

“Sandwich often given a twist”

We weren’t kidding you. There is a big difference between a Monday puzzle and a Saturday puzzle.

That doesn’t mean that you can’t work your way toward solving a late-week puzzle – and we recommend that you do, because they’re fun – but it takes experience and patience.

If you’re just getting started, though, make your life easy and solve as many Monday puzzles as you can. Eventually, you’ll be ready for more of a challenge, and that’s when you move on to Tuesday puzzles.

From mid-June through mid-August, the North Korean pair of Ms. Ryom, 18, and Mr. Kim, 25, trained in Montreal, refining their attempt to claim one of five Olympic spots available here at this week’s Nebelhorn Trophy competition.

The skaters, their coach and a North Korean skating official spoke frequently about the Olympics, said Bruno Marcotte, a prominent French Canadian coach who worked with the pair.

“All the time they would ask me: ‘Do you think we have a chance to qualify? Are we good enough? What do we need to qualify?’” Mr. Marcotte said of the pair, who aspire to become one of the world’s top 10 teams.

“They didn’t want to talk about politics,” said Mr. Marcotte, who is also here assisting the North Koreans. “It was all about sport and being the first ones in the Olympics and breaking barriers and doing their best.”

It is a widely held feeling among South Korean politicians and Olympic officials, as well as some international athletes, that the Games would be safer with North Korea’s participation, lessening security concerns and perhaps spurring slow ticket sales.

In that view, Kim Jong-un, the unpredictable North Korean leader, would be less likely to act provocatively if athletes from his country were competing in the Olympics, alongside those of China, North Korea’s benefactor.

“It’s kind of an insurance policy to have them there,” said Ted Ligety, a two-time gold medalist in Alpine skiing from the United States.

Of course, there is no way to predict what the political situation will be on the Korean Peninsula in four months, when the Olympics take place about 40 miles from the demilitarized zone that separates North and South.

And there is no guarantee that North Korea will participate. It is not a winter sports power and did not compete at the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, Russia. It also boycotted the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, the South Korean capital.

A general wariness seems to be encroaching on these Games. France has said its Olympic team will not travel to South Korea if its safety cannot be guaranteed.

Still, Thomas Bach, the president of the I.O.C., has said there is “so far not even a hint” that security concerns related to North Korea threaten the Games. In any case, officials say it is too late to move the Olympics.

“There is no Plan B,” said Anita DeFrantz, a vice president of the I.O.C. from the United States.

Mr. Chang, the I.O.C. delegate from North Korea, has said its athletes will also attempt to qualify for the Games in short-track speedskating and Nordic skiing, which includes cross-country events. According to Reuters, North Korea has formally complained that international sanctions have interfered with its ability to purchase skiing equipment needed for training.

In April, North Korea sent its women’s hockey team to play in South Korea. In June, it sent a taekwondo team. That month, South Korea’s sports minister mentioned the possibility of fielding a combined hockey team in the Olympics and permitting North Korea to host an Alpine skiing event.

Those prospects seem unlikely now, South Korean Olympic and government officials said last week in New York.

“North Korea is my biggest worry,” Choi Moon-soon, the governor of Gangwon Province in South Korea, where the 2018 Olympics will take place, said in a recent interview. “It’s not because of North Korea making an impact on the Olympics, it’s that if North Korea can participate, then it will make a great contribution for our goal of hosting a Peace Olympics, and it will be a great selling point.”

If North Korea does compete, perhaps its most visible — and only — athletes will be Ms. Ryom and Mr. Kim. They finished 15th at the 2017 world figure skating championships in March with a style influenced by classic Russian efficiency and precise placement of the arms and head.

Dressed in silver and black costumes at training on Wednesday, the pair skated to an instrumental version of the Beatles’ “A Day in the Life,” as performed by Jeff Beck, which will provide a musical backdrop for Thursday’s opening performance.

The issue can be culturally sensitive. At the world championships, the North Koreans ended a brief interview with The Associated Press when asked how they had chosen the Beatles’ music.

On Wednesday, Ms. Ryom and her partner, Mr. Kim, appeared smiling though slightly nervous during practice. (“Trying to be too much,” Mr. Marcotte said.) Still, they received polite applause from the four dozen or so people who watched them train at the Eissportzentrum in this Alpine village with bell cows in the pastures and snow dusting the highest peaks.

It is not uncommon for pairs skaters to have an artistically stressed relationship, and as Mr. Marcotte put it, a coach can sometimes be more of a marriage counselor. But the North Koreans remained unfailingly upbeat during their summer training, he said. And they even made kimchi, a staple dish, for a South Korean pair that he also trained.

“I think there is a will for friendship, a will for peace,” Mr. Marcotte said of the skaters. “They were so driven and so positive. I didn’t expect that. They were sponges. They wanted to learn so badly.”

Ms. Ryom and Mr. Kim will be under enormous scrutiny and pressure this week to qualify for the Olympics. But they also appear confident, Mr. Marcotte said.

National Parks Struggle With a Mounting Crisis: Too Many Visitors

Image Credit

The rocky shorelines, shifting deserts and winding canyons of the country’s 59 national parks have been hallmarks of American vacations for generations.

But the number of park visitors has reached an unprecedented level, leaving many tourists frustrated and many environmentalists concerned about the toll of overcrowding.

Image Credit

In 2016, the National Park Service tracked a record 331 million visits, and after a busy summer, the system is likely to surpass that number this year. In August alone, some 40 million people came through park service gates.

Image Credit

Shuttle buses at Zion National Park, in southwest Utah, filled like sweaty subway cars. Selfie-takers clogged the slender path through the Narrows slot canyon, one of the park’s best-known attractions. And at the top of Angels Landing, an iconic trail of switchbacks on the east side of the park, some portable toilets were marked off with a sign: “Due to extreme use, these toilets have reached capacity.”

Zion is among the most visited parks in the system and is particularly prone to crowding because many of its most popular sites sit in a narrow six-mile canyon. In 2016, about 4.3 million people visited, up 60 percent from a decade ago.

So this year, park managers announced they were considering a first for any national park: requiring reservations for entry. A final decision is expected in 2018.

“We don’t have a choice,” said Jack Burns, who has worked in Zion since 1982. “We have to do something. If this going to remain a place of special importance for generations, we have to do something now.”

But if the president’s tweets are the Digital Age version of quips at the Rose Garden podium, what then are we to make of the deletions?

The president regularly deletes tweets with typos and misspellings. Less frequently, but not unheard-of, are erasures that pertain to more significant topics. In March, he posted and deleted a tweet that read: “Meeting with Generals at Mar-a-Lago in Florida. Very interesting!”

At least two government watchdog groups, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and the National Security Archive, believe that when Mr. Trump deletes a tweet he may be breaking the law.

The groups filed a lawsuit in June against Mr. Trump and the Executive Office of the President, claiming that deleting social media posts violates the Presidential Records Act, a law that requires presidential communications to be archived. The groups are also suing to require White House staff members to archive material sent through encrypted messaging apps, such as WhatsApp and Signal.",Trump Deletes Tweets Supporting Luther Strange,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/us/politics/trump-deletes-tweets.html

Valedictions are few, and after a long and brilliant career, it is surely churlish to begrudge the need for one. But when Philip Roth revealed, in 2012, that he had written his last novel — with multiple interviews, the preparation of papers for his biographer and later a documentary — it was hard not to compare his exit style to that of his contemporary, Alice Munro. The Nobel laureate simply slipped her intention into her last story collection, “Dear Life,” writing in a preface to the final four “not quite stories” that they were “the first and last — and the closest — things I have to say about my own life.” What followed had the quality of something long distilled but freshly reconsidered. It was a return to origins, to the fox farm and the mother who wanted more, recounted with the ambiguity and the long-view-down-the-telescope temporal shifts characteristic of Munro’s work. If it was the end, it was a fitting one, the kind that makes you want to begin reading her all over again.

Film actors, preserved whole body at specific ages and available on instant download, have an especially complex relationship with public memory. Most of us do not know Daniel Day-Lewis, nor is he the sort of person to be photographed at the Malibu Country Mart, but we have an impression of him from his choice of characters and what he brings to them: a puckish charisma and a scene-devouring devotion to craft, but also, in his less adrenalized performances, something finer. I will remember especially his Cecil Vyse, the pompous, pince-nezed aesthete wrongly engaged to Lucy Honeychurch in “A Room With a View,” the Merchant Ivory adaptation of E.M. Forster’s novel, and the vulnerability he found in a comic and deeply coded character.

Forster himself stopped publishing novels at the peak of his career, after “A Passage to India” came out, in 1924. Only 45, he must have been weary, one can’t help but think, of all the coding. He died in 1970, leaving behind the manuscript for “Maurice,” a love story between two men. “Publishable — but worth it?” read a note found attached to the manuscript. The novel, with its happy ending, found its own a year later.

WRITING IS THE MOST private performance of all, and while we respect the productive literary recluse, the Pynchons and Dickinsons, we are troubled by those who seem to crumble under the weight of their own success, such as Harper Lee, who never finished a book after “To Kill a Mockingbird.” Art doesn’t come without great effort, and it’s easy to underestimate the burden of expectation. Stephen King has found retirement so relaxing he’s written more than a dozen novels since he announced he would stop in 2002.

For some authors of the 20th century, narrating a self was a mode of survival. I think of Edna O’Brien’s extraordinary 2012 memoir, “Country Girl,” which is both a celebration of a life vibrantly lived, filled with legendary love affairs and photographs of her backlit in diaphanous skirts — and also a horror story about the personal costs involved in pursuing her work. It ends with the image of a room “readying itself for a last banquet,” a promise she’s lived up to, publishing a novel at 84, as well as an edition of her collected stories, reminding us, not that we needed to be reminded, of her greatness.

To announce a retirement is on some level a way of stage-managing one’s own legacy; it’s not unlike attending your wake and getting to hear what everyone has to say. Of course, many retirements don’t stick. Generally there are no hard feelings about this, because the only thing we love more than a “new voice” is a comeback, especially when it’s someone like David Lynch, returning for more “Twin Peaks” wizardry after 10 years without a feature film. Some retirements are transparently hiatuses-as-publicity-stunts — Quentin Tarantino, Jay-Z — while others are a blatant critique of the industry the leave-takers have made their career in, like Steven Soderbergh, who has turned to less studio-dependent projects.

For women in Hollywood, retirement is rarely of their own choosing. Here I think of the Amy Schumer sketch in which Tina Fey and Patricia Arquette toast Julia Louis-Dreyfus’s “last f-able day,” sending her off in a rowboat with a cigar. That they are, in fact, the exceptions who have managed to keep working made it easier to laugh.

To flee the spotlight at the height of one’s powers takes a certain kind of courage. Even Greta Garbo, that genius of myth creation, a recluse at 36 in the wake of “Two-Faced Woman,” the 1941 film she referred to as “my grave,” seemed to find retirement a little lonely.

In the art world, pulling a Garbo may be especially risky. It can fall a little flat, as when Marcel Duchamp gave up art for chess, only to baffle everyone with “Étant Donnés,” an elaborate secret final piece two decades in the making that involved a heavy antique door and a diorama of a nude holding a lamp sprawled on a bed of twigs. Lee Lozano broke into the 1960s New York art scene with phallocentric paintings of tools and machinery, but began to withdraw in 1970, the year of her solo show at the Whitney — rare for a woman artist of her time — retiring for good with “Dropout Piece.” “Artist, critic, dealer and museum friends, in fact, almost everybody: I still smell on your bad breath the other people’s rules you swallowed whole so long ago,” she had written in her journal. She faded into obscurity. The influential contemporary sculptor and installation artist Cady Noland, who effectively dropped out of the art world in 1999, has taken to writing disclaimers that she does not approve of the exhibition of her work when it occasionally appears in galleries and at art fairs. Disavowal is the purest commentary, but it’s not a very satisfying one.

And yet creativity isn’t always in infinite supply. Some rage on against the dying of the light, like Iris Murdoch or Willem de Kooning, despite diminishing returns. For every Lucian Freud, who painted his pending mortality into his late portraits of friends, creating masterpieces through his 80s, there’s a Norman Mailer, the author who claimed that the inner lives of great novelists were comparable to those of heavyweight boxing champions, and perhaps himself went a few rounds too many.

Perhaps we could all take a page from our master of solitude, Annie Dillard, who stopped writing in the last decade and took up painting when she no longer could carry the book around in her head, as she told David Remnick in a 2016 interview: “We’re here under conditions, and you either accept them or fight them, but the conditions aren’t going to change at all . . . so you might as well accept them.”

Art freezes time. Day-Lewis’s repressed Edwardian, Munro’s young women too smart for their own good. Immortality is, perhaps, what every artist wants.

I have never been one to blindly uphold any single figure as the representative of all things Italian-American, since all individuals are flawed, and all monuments represent just a snapshot of our history, now measured against 21st-century sensibilities. Some undoubtedly require re-evaluation, but that process should not include violence, vandalism and destruction of property. The “tearing down of history” does not change that history. In the wake of the cultural conflict that has ripped us apart over these months, I wonder if we as a country can’t find better ways to utilize our history to eradicate racism instead of inciting it. Can’t the monuments and holidays born of our past be reimagined to represent new values for our future?

There are many monuments to Franklin Roosevelt, and although he allowed Japanese-Americans and Italian-Americans to be interned during World War II, we as an ethnic group are not demanding that his statues be destroyed. Nor are we tearing down tributes to Theodore Roosevelt, who, in 1891, after 11 falsely accused Sicilian-Americans were murdered in the largest mass lynching in American history, wrote that he thought the event “a rather good thing.”

It was in reaction to these tragic killings that the early Italian-American community in New York scraped together private donations to give the monument at Columbus Circle to their new city. So this statue now denigrated as a symbol of European conquest was from the beginning a testament to love of country from a community of immigrants struggling to find acceptance in their new, and sometimes hostile, home.

Respect for historical monuments should not signify blind acceptance of the values and judgments of past societies; rather, they should be instructive tools in our quest to understand our history and use it to better meet the challenges of the present. If we allow uncontrolled tearing down of memorials or unilateral reinterpretation of American history, then we will be damaging our democracy by limiting vigorous debate on our history, with all its beauty and blemishes. In his first inaugural address at the onset of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln called on Americans to allow a national dialogue led by the “better angels of our nature.” I think his counsel remains as wise and essential today as it was then.

We at the National Italian American Foundation strongly condemn the defacing of historical monuments and expect elected officials and law enforcement to protect our public memorials from further damage so that a true conversation on their place in modern society can be organized. We believe Christopher Columbus represents the values of discovery and risk that are at the heart of the American dream, and that it is our job as the community most closely associated with his legacy to be at the forefront of a sensitive and engaging path forward, toward a solution that considers all sides.

American ingenuity is built on the continuous re-examination of technology, and today, we have the technology to build interactive monuments out of thoughts and not just of stones. We believe our foundation, and the Italian Americans community, can lead the effort to reimagine America’s monuments and memorials in a new light, and tell our story, the American story, in innovative and thoughtful ways. If we can do that, perhaps the legacy we leave will be one that doesn’t face any controversy among future generations.",Tearing Down Statues of Columbus Also Tears Down My History,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/09/opinion/christopher-columbus-day-statue.html

On Thursday, Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said Ms. Yingluck was in Dubai, where her elder brother Thaksin Shinawatra, another former prime minister, has a home. Her lawyers have said they do not know where she is; one recently said he had not heard from her since she fled the country.

Ms. Yingluck became Thailand’s first female prime minister in 2011, having had no prior experience in politics. She was widely considered a proxy for Mr. Thaksin, a controversial but popular former telecommunications tycoon who served as prime minister for five years before he was ousted in a coup in 2006. Mr. Thaksin was later convicted in absentia on conflict of interest charges, after having fled the country himself.

Since 2001, every nationwide election in Thailand has resulted in victories for Mr. Thaksin or political forces loyal to him. But judicial actions and a pair of army coups have unseated each of these governments.

Mr. Thaksin’s sister was removed from office in May 2014, after the Constitutional Court found her guilty of abuse of power. The same month, the army orchestrated its latest coup, one of a dozen successful putsches carried out since Thailand abandoned absolute monarchy in 1932.

Thailand’s politics are cleaved, roughly, between the rural poor, who have supported the populist policies of politicians aligned with Mr. Thaksin’s family, and a traditional ruling class that has dismissed the Shinawatra clan as corrupt, power-hungry and dangerously divisive.

A security crackdown on street protests by Mr. Thaksin’s supporters in 2010 resulted in more than 90 deaths in downtown Bangkok.

Since then, Thailand has experienced periods of martial law, and its economic growth has trailed that of other Southeast Asian nations. The country’s current Constitution, drafted under the oversight of a junta that calls itself the National Council for Peace and Order, curtails democratic institutions. It stipulates that the upper house of Thailand’s Parliament, for instance, is appointed, rather than elected.

The junta, led by Mr. Prayuth, has promised elections next year. But with Ms. Yingluck and her brother in self-imposed exile, and many in the top echelons of Pheu Thai sidelined by various legal rulings, it is unclear how effectively the party’s supporters will be able to campaign.

Last month, a former commerce minister who served in Ms. Yingluck’s cabinet was sentenced to 42 years in prison in connection with the rice program.

At the courthouse on Wednesday, some of Ms. Yingluck’s supporters sounded philosophical about both the verdict and the exile of the Shinawatra siblings.

“Maybe it is good that they both aren’t here, because now the other side can stop saying we are Shinawatra slaves,” said Rungrawee Chaloenpol, a market vendor, breaking down in tears. “Now we can fight for true democracy without having the Shinawatra name attached to us.”","Yingluck Shinawatra, Ex-Leader Who Fled Thailand, Gets 5-Year Sentence",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/world/asia/thailand-yingluck-sentence.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

It immediately confirmed Europe’s role as the Western world’s toughest regulator of digital services. But it has also prompted criticism of Brussels, which has been accused of unfairly targeting United States businesses, claims European officials deny.

Still, technology has been a focus of Margrethe Vestager, the European Union’s competition commissioner. Along with other investigations into Google, the commission has also opened inquiries into tax avoidance, data privacy and abuse of market position, affecting American household names like Amazon, Apple and Facebook.

In the case of Google, rivals had long complained that the company gave itself an unfair advantage by automatically putting some of its services at the top of so-called specialized search results. Such search products, like restaurant and business reviews, are increasingly lucrative.

Under the plan presented Wednesday, Google will create a stand-alone unit for its shopping service. That unit will remain part of its overall business, but will operate separately and will be subject to regular monitoring by the European Commission. Rival price comparison services, like Germany’s Idealo and a Dutch comparison site called Vergelijk.nl, would earn money from merchants whose products, from refrigerators to electronic gadgets, they are advertising. But they would also pay Google to take up those spaces.

Customers across the 28 members of the European Union, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, will be able to see those price comparison sites taking up the spots at the top of a search page where only Google Shopping had previously appeared.

The commission has said that Google met its deadline to offer concessions, but has not commented on whether the moves would actually bolster competition. Fines for failing to meet the Thursday deadline could have been as high as 5 percent of the average daily global revenue of Alphabet, Google’s parent company. Google presented its plans to the commission at the end of August, but did not make them public until Wednesday.

Google would like the measure it’s implementing this week to apply narrowly to price comparison shopping services. But it faces complaints from rivals in other sectors as well, and they may see an opportunity for prying open Google’s formidable search platform.

Google already is facing two separate cases in Europe related to Android, its software for mobile devices, and to some of its advertising products. The company denies the accusations.

But even as Europe has pushed ahead with a series of antitrust charges against Google, the company has not faced the same scrutiny from regulators at home, giving cover to United States lawmakers and lobbyists accusing Europe of unfairly targeting American companies.

Still, Silicon Valley tech giants are facing shifting political winds at home, too.

American lawmakers increasingly worry about the expanding power of technology behemoths and, in particular, the role they may have played in the 2016 election. This shift has opened Google to attacks from both sides of the political spectrum on a wide range of issues, ranging from antitrust to privacy and public disclosure.

The risk of a regulatory crackdown is a significant one facing the company. It maintains a dominant position in online search, making the advertisements that run alongside its search results an indispensable part of marketing on the internet.

The other, centered on movies and television shows from Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm, would debut in late 2019.

“We’re going to launch big, and we’re going to launch hot,” Mr. Iger promised at a subsequent investor conference.

Disney had experimented with building a streaming platform on its own, to mixed results. It also toyed with the idea of buying Twitter.

But Mr. Iger was impressed with BamTech. Based in Manhattan’s Chelsea Market, a former factory for the National Biscuit Company, the 850-employee company has a strong track record — no serious glitches, even when delivering tens of millions of live streams at a time. BamTech also has impressive advertising technology (inserting ads in video based on viewer location) and a strong reputation for attracting and keeping viewers, not to mention billing them.

“BamTech really is as good as it gets,” said Mike Vorhaus, president of Magid Advisors, a media and technology consultant.

BamTech grew out of Major League Baseball Advanced Media, or Bam for short, which was founded in 2000 as a way to help teams create websites. By 2002, Bam was experimenting with streaming video as a way for out-of-town fans to watch games.

Soon, Bam developed technology that attracted outside clients, including the WWE, Fox Sports, PlayStation Vue and Hulu. HBO went to Bam in 2014 after failing to create a reliable stand-alone streaming service on its own. Could Bam get HBO up and running — in just a few months?

Bam built HBO Now for roughly $50 million, delivering it just in time for the Season 5 premiere of “Game of Thrones,” which went off flawlessly. “They were nothing short of herculean for us,” said Richard Plepler, HBO’s chief executive.

In 2015, Bam decided to spin off its streaming division, calling it BamTech. With an eye toward its own direct-to-consumer future, particularly with ESPN, Disney paid $1 billion in 2016 for a 33 percent stake and an option to buy a controlling interest in 2020. To run the stand-alone company, M.L.B. and Disney recruited Michael Paull, 46, from Amazon, where he oversaw Prime Video and the introduction of Amazon Channels.

Disney started talking about the inevitable shift toward streaming in 2006, according to Kevin Mayer, Disney’s chief strategy officer. But the world’s largest entertainment company had to be careful: It could not embrace a new business model at the expense of its still highly profitable existing one — at least not until it saw a tipping point.

So Disney, along with other television companies, first tried something called TV Everywhere. Introduced in 2010, it allowed people to watch television shows on mobile devices as long as they “authenticated” themselves as current cable or satellite subscribers. But that cable bundle-saving effort proved cumbersome and never completely caught on.

About three years ago, Disney started to look at streaming more aggressively. Disney experimented with going it alone, quietly developing an app called DisneyLife. Introduced in November 2015 in Britain, DisneyLife offered old Disney movies and television series, children’s e-books, games and music. Subscriptions cost about $13 a month.

The lesson from that was without new movies, or at least exclusive content, interest was limited. Disney soon cut the subscription price in half. After two years, analysts estimate that DisneyLife has only about 437,000 subscribers. (It was never introduced outside Britain.)

Disney also weighed a bid for Twitter. “We thought Twitter had global reach, a pretty interesting user interface and a compelling way that we might be able to present and sell the content that our company makes to the consumer,” Mr. Iger said at a Vanity Fair conference last Tuesday. Ultimately, though, Disney passed. Twitter’s growing reputation as a platform where hate speech can be disseminated would have posed a problem for the Disney brand.

So when Mr. Iger decided in June that the time had come to reposition Disney’s television division for growth by offering its sports, movies and television programming directly to consumers, he asked BamTech to accelerate Disney’s option to take a controlling interest. By early August, Disney had agreed to spend an additional $1.58 billion to bring its BamTech stake to 75 percent.

Most analysts cheered Disney’s streaming plans, but some investors seem to be taking a wait-and-see approach. One reason is cost.

Start-up expenses are unknown, but Disney has signaled that they will be huge. (Analysts estimate that marketing alone could easily run $150 million annually.) Disney has also not announced how much it will charge for subscriptions to the still-unnamed services. (Analysts are guessing $5 to $9 a month.) What is certain: To stock its own offerings, Disney plans to pull content from other services — Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm movies will eventually disappear from Netflix — eliminating an enormous, reliable revenue stream.

Michael Nathanson, a media analyst, estimates that Netflix, for instance, pays Disney $325 million annually to license those films. Also moving to one of the services will be reruns of Disney Channel shows, which generate roughly $500 million annually in third-party licensing fees, according to Doug Mitchelson, an analyst at UBS.

At the same time, Disney has pledged to make original movies and series for its nonsports service, easily adding $150 million in costs.

There has also been some sniping about how much Disney paid for BamTech. Speaking at a Goldman Sachs conference last month, Leslie Moonves, chief executive of CBS, boasted that his company’s All Access and Showtime streaming services had been built internally.

“We didn’t go buy BamTech for a zillion dollars,” he said.

Disney contends that a big part of BamTech’s value has been overlooked. Down the road, as other media companies move toward streaming, BamTech intends to sign them up as clients.

“That’s going to be a massive business, and BamTech is going to be a massive winner in it,” Mr. Mayer, Disney’s chief strategist, said in an interview.

Still, by the end of next year, BamTech will lose one important customer: HBO, which is moving to a global platform built by its own tech team. “They understood from the very beginning that eventually we would grow our way to independence,” Mr. Plepler said.

For some, Disney’s track record with digital acquisitions is the biggest concern.

Whenever the company has wandered away from content-related mega-purchases (Pixar, Marvel), results have been disappointing. Misfires include the social media-focused game maker Playdom, purchased for $563 million in 2010, and the online video network Maker, bought for $500 million in 2014.

Disney.com has also given the company headaches, with managers trying a series of redesigns and strategic retrenchments.

This time may well be different, in part because failing isn’t an option. And, in a contrast to those smaller acquisitions, Mr. Iger has pledged to devote much of his time over the next 21 months — he insists he will retire in July 2019 — to the twin streaming initiatives. BamTech’s remaining minority owners, M.L.B. and the National Hockey League, also have an interest in the effort succeeding.

Mr. Paull, a Harvard M.B.A. with experience at Sony Music, will report to Mr. Mayer, who joined Disney in 1993 before leaving in 2000 to run Playboy.com. He soon returned to Disney to work on Go.com, a web portal that eventually failed, and other Disney websites, including ESPN.com, before moving to strategic planning.

Though BamTech has proved its streaming bona fides, it still lacks the algorithms and the personalization skills that have helped propel Netflix to success. To fill that gap, Mr. Paull recently hired the former chief technology officer of the F.B.I. to be the head of analytics.

BamTech’s headquarters are a massive sprawl. Inside the darkened “transmission operations center” on a recent afternoon, walls of monitors displayed hundreds of live events — baseball, golf, hockey, boxing, a speech by President Trump — being streamed to somewhere at that moment.

Outside the operations room, in a series of alcoves, including one that used to house an oven where Oreos were baked, employees monitor games and are the first line of defense if something goes wrong with a stream. They’re nicknamed the Night’s Watch, from HBO’s “Game of Thrones.”

The level of engineering required for that enormous volume of content is no small matter. Each bit of streamable content has to be made to fit a dizzying number of requirements. Start with web browsers, ranging from Safari to Chrome or Explorer, all of which have slightly different demands. It also has to fit every iPhone and Android phone. And then there are connected living room devices like Apple TV.

“The complexity there is incredible,” Mr. Paull said during a tour. “It’s thousands and thousands of different applications we need to build to support that entire ecosystem. Then you add in international and the complexities of languages, currencies, payment mechanisms.”

He added, “That’s one of the big, big barriers to entry if you want to have a scaled digital video service.”",Disney’s Big Bet on Streaming Relies on Little-Known Tech Company,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/08/business/media/bamtech-disney-streaming.html

In nontheme news, I have to say that the long Downs made me smile. I loved SHOT TO HELL for its unexpectedness, and “FROST/NIXON” is a nice, Scrabbly entry to write into the grid.

Tricky Clues

49A: “Strands in a cell?” looks like it refers either to the microscopic type of cell or a jail cell, although strands in a jail cell doesn’t make much sense. The answer refers to microscopic cells and the strands of genetic material within. If you are not sure whether the answer is RNA or DNA, fill in the “NA” and work that first crossing. 40D is AUDI, so the answer is DNA. See? You don’t have to be a scientist to do the crossword.

59D: I thought this one might bring out some of my fellow vegetable gardeners, because I’m sure I’m not the only one who believed that yams were tubers, not ROOTs. Apparently, “all tubers are root crops, but not all root crops are tubers,” and there are many ways to distinguish the part of a plant that grows underground. The main point you should take away from all this is that they’re good for you and you should eat your vegetables.

Constructor Notes

This idea for this theme came from thinking about Schrödinger puzzles, and wondering if I could potentially create one so that entries that contain more than one distinct stand-alone letter, for example, VITAMIN which can be followed by A, B, C, D, E, or K, intersect another such entry. Ideally, the shared possible letters for each pair of theme entries would be some combination of A, B, C and D, so that the revealer MULTIPLE CHOICE could be used. This didn’t end up panning out, but it did lead me, through a somewhat stream-of-consciousness manner of contemplating crossword themes, to come up with the one you see here. The first version of this puzzle had the theme entries VITAMINS, MUSICAL NOTES, CHEMICAL SYMBOLS, GREEK LETTERS and ALPHABET, and was rejected on the basis that ALPHABET was too obvious, and GREEK LETTERS was inconsistent. It was tough to find a new set of symmetrical theme entries, but I’m pleased with the current set. In each case, the category contains other members besides the ones that are composed of a single letter, and the letters are the members of the category themselves rather than being abbreviations, unlike something such as L M S for SHIRT SIZES. I spent a decent amount of time trying to remove the black square between TILE and GREEK and its symmetrical partner to allow for two pairs of long parallel downs, but I didn’t like the compromises on the fill, so I decided to stick to 78 words. Given that this ended up as a Monday (I had expected it to be a Tuesday) and the importance of smooth fill for Monday puzzles, I stand by this decision, and though there aren’t a ton of bonuses here, I’m fond of SHOT TO HELL and some of the mid-length fill like U.S. NEWS and HANSEL (he’s so hot right now). I don’t have a lot to say as far as the clues go, but a few of mine I’m glad to see survive the edit are 49-Across, 9-Down, 31-Down and 56-Down. Though I’m not sure it will be particularly applicable to this puzzle, I like the inside nod in the clue that Will and Joel came up with for AHA. In any case it’s great to be back, and I hope (fingers crossed) that my puzzle will be a pleasant start to everyone’s week.

The decision by Senate Republican leaders may prove to be a milestone in the decades-long fight over health insurance in the United States, suggesting that the Affordable Care Act had gained at least a reprieve and perhaps a measure of political acceptance.

Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and the chairman of the Senate health committee, and Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the senior Democrat on the panel, have been working on legislation to stabilize insurance markets and hold down premiums in the next couple of years. Both said on Tuesday that they hoped to resume those efforts.

Millions of people who buy insurance on their own face sharp increases in premiums next year, and Trump administration officials have taken a number of steps that have already undermined the operations of the health law.

And health care is sure to be an issue in next year’s midterm elections.

Senator John Thune of South Dakota, a member of the Senate Republican leadership, said the concept behind the Graham-Cassidy bill would help Republicans define their differences with Democrats in the campaign season.

“Single payer, socialism — or federalism, returning power to the states to make decisions,” Mr. Thune said. “I think that’s a great contrast for us, and I think that’s an argument eventually we can win.”

For their part, Democrats have tried to use health care as a bludgeon against the few Senate Republican targets they have next year, mainly Senators Dean Heller of Nevada and Jeff Flake of Arizona.

“We know Republicans like Dean Heller and Jeff Flake won’t stop until they force Americans to pay more for less, and we will make sure voters hold them accountable for it,” the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee said in a statement this week.

The Graham-Cassidy bill would have taken money provided under the Affordable Care Act for insurance subsidies and the expansion of Medicaid and sent it to states in the form of block grants.

The bill’s demise was welcomed by consumer groups, doctors, hospitals and insurance executives who mobilized opposition to the proposal. The Congressional Budget Office said Monday that the bill would have reduced projected federal Medicaid spending by $1 trillion over a decade, added millions of Americans to the ranks of the uninsured and eliminated consumer protections for some people with pre-existing conditions.

Senate Republicans tried in July to approve a repeal bill, but that attempt ended in defeat when Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, gave a thumbs-down, killing that version of the legislation.

This time, Senate Republicans were trying to pass a different proposal, and a deadline was fast approaching: They had only until the end of this week to pass a repeal bill using special budget rules that shield it from a Democratic filibuster.

Mr. McConnell had planned for a vote before that deadline, but he could afford to lose only two Republicans. By Tuesday, three members of his party had already gone public with their firm opposition: Ms. Collins, Mr. McCain and Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky.

None of the three senators seemed likely to change their minds. Mr. McCain detested the hasty, partisan process used to push the bill; Ms. Collins had broad concerns about the legislation’s effects on health care; and Mr. Paul objected to the fundamental architecture of the bill, which in his view constituted “fake repeal.”

Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said he saw no reason for the Senate to vote.

“If you don’t have the votes,” he said, “I don’t see why we would waste the time of the Senate.”

And other Republican senators might have opposed it had party leaders moved forward. In a statement released after Senate Republicans decided not to do so, Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who voted against the last repeal attempt in July, denounced what she described as “a lousy process.”

“The U.S. Senate cannot get the text of a bill on a Sunday night, then proceed to a vote just days later, with only one hearing — and especially not on an issue that is intensely personal to all of us,” Ms. Murkowski said, without saying which way she would have voted.

Mr. Cassidy was blunt: “We don’t have the votes,” he said, adding, “Am I disappointed? Absolutely.”

And Senator David Perdue, Republican of Georgia, was left fuming.

“I am kind of disgusted that after nine months, the self-interest is still outweighing the national interest in our caucus in some ways,” he said.

But Mr. Graham still held out the hope that the repeal proposal would pass — just later, after Republicans tackle taxes, and when Republicans can consider the repeal plan in a more deliberative fashion.

“There are 50 votes for the substance,” Mr. Graham said. “There are not 50 votes for the process.”

But that could be months away — if not years.

The tax effort will probably occupy Congress through the remainder of this year, and into next year.

After tackling the tax overhaul, Republicans could make another attempt at passing a health bill without needing any Democratic votes. But such an undertaking would require passing yet another budget blueprint, in order to protect the bill from a Democratic filibuster, and it would put health care front and center as lawmakers head into the midterm elections.

Even as Republicans shift their focus to taxes, pressure is building for a bipartisan response to the problems of the health care system. The Alexander-Murray stabilization package has two main elements: money for subsidies paid to insurance companies, to reimburse them for reducing out-of-pocket costs for low-income people, and more freedom for states to revamp their insurance markets.

Democrats see the cost-sharing subsidy payments as essential. But many Republicans, including Mr. Trump, have described them as a bailout for insurance companies that would prop up the Affordable Care Act.

“I think most of the members would suggest they really don’t know that they can stabilize the product at this stage of the game,” said Senator Mike Rounds, Republican of South Dakota. “I think there’s a number of them that are going to be very hesitant to try to put more money into a system that they are convinced is going south.”

Earlier Tuesday, with little hope of success in the Senate, Mr. Trump expressed his displeasure.

“At some point there will be a repeal and replace, but we’ll see whether or not that point is now or will it be shortly thereafter,” he said at the White House. “But we are disappointed in certain so-called Republicans.”

The failure in the Senate was also a disappointment to Republicans in the House, who managed to pass a repeal bill in May after their own struggles.

“We’re a little frustrated that the Senate has not acted on a seminal promise,” said Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin.

Then he returned to talking up the need for a tax overhaul.",Senate Republicans Say They Will Not Vote on Health Bill,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/26/us/politics/mcconnell-obamacare-repeal-graham-cassidy-trump.html

The cathedral peacocks’ residence since 2002 has been a rather unstylish wooden structure on the south side of the cathedral.
Kevin Seymour, an architect from Ennead who is the project manager for the firm’s work at the cathedral, told Father Daniel that a step would be installed to make it easier for the peacocks to enter and leave their new home.
“Semi,” Father Daniel said, “especially if you have an almond in your hand.”Not this time, though.
“He’s too full of kale,” Father Daniel said.","“They give a slight magical quality to our gardens,” said Bishop Andrew M.L. Dietsche, who lives on the grounds of the cathedral.

They also give the gardens a squawking quality in mating season. They can be “very, very loud,” he said, adding that he and the other church officials who live on the grounds “are very familiar with it.”

Jim was named for the Very Rev. James A. Kowalski, who stepped down as the dean of the cathedral several months ago. Harry was named for a former dean, the Very Rev. Harry H. Pritchett Jr., and Phil for Phillip Foote, the former head of the Cathedral School.

But they can be elusive. For an inspection of the new structure on Friday, Robert Flynn, the manager of the cathedral’s soup kitchen, ended up doubling as a peacock wrangler, luring Harry with a handful of kale.

The interim dean, the Rev. Clifton Daniel III, arrived for the inspection with a handful of almonds for the peacocks and a dry sense of humor for the people trailing along.

“There’s a pigeon named for me,” Father Daniel said.

It turned out that he was not kidding — there really is. Lisa A. Schubert, the cathedral’s vice president for programming and external affairs, produced a cellphone with a photo.

So the obvious question was asked: Does Clifton the pigeon get along with the peacocks?

“You would have to ask them about that,” Father Daniel said, almost straight-faced.

But Clifton was not available for an interview. Ms. Schubert said the reason was medical: He was in isolation at an avian center after treatment for lead poisoning, a vitamin B deficiency and an inner ear problem. She said she had rushed him off in August after noticing that he was having trouble walking.

The cathedral peacocks’ residence since 2002 has been a rather unstylish wooden structure on the south side of the cathedral. The competition for the new shelter began in 2015 and was open to the 140 architects of the firm Ennead, itself a descendant of Polshek Partnership Architects, which had worked on large-scale projects at the cathedral since the 1990s.

The jury included Susan T. Rodriguez, who heads the firm’s design process on cathedral projects; Guy Maxwell, a lifelong birder who is the managing partner for the firm’s projects at the cathedral; Dr. Christine Sheppard of the American Bird Conservancy; Lorelei Tibbetts of the Center for Avian and Exotic Medicine in Manhattan; two real-estate developers, Dean Amro and Thomas Brodsky, who had overseen the new apartment building on the north end of the cathedral grounds; and three officials from the cathedral.

“We spent a few hours actually deliberating, if you can believe that,” Mr. Amro said. “Architecturally, the feeling was that this was respectful of the cathedral, for giving a nod to the shape of the windows.” He said that the lightweight plastic walls of the structure were “reminiscent of feathers.”

The two winners, Mr. Lewandowski and Paul Scrugham, worked together to marry form and function in the final design.

“We were given basic parameters,” said Ryan Lewandowski, one of the winners. “My design focused on referencing the cathedral architecture. The other design focused on functional aspects — how you clean it out.” The tubular frame “allows adaptability for where you place perches,” he said.

Kevin Seymour, an architect from Ennead who is the project manager for the firm’s work at the cathedral, told Father Daniel that a step would be installed to make it easier for the peacocks to enter and leave their new home.

“Because they have arthritis,” Father Daniel said.

They are not so young anymore — they probably have more yesterdays than tomorrows. But what about encounters in the present: Are they friendly?

“Semi,” Father Daniel said, “especially if you have an almond in your hand.”

The quote, reprinted in the June 10th issue of The New York Times of that year, still rings true today, especially as a Canadian like myself goes through thousands of images of Canada from the newspaper’s archives.

Earlier this year, the Ryerson Image Center in Toronto received a donation of 24,804 images from a collector, Chris Bratty, who had purchased the collection with the intention of donating it. Selected by a team led by two gallerists, Steven Kasher and Stephen Bulger, the pictures range from World War I to the late 1990s, from hockey players to lumberjacks. A selection is currently on view in an exhibition at the center and in a book, both entitled “The Faraway Nearby.”

“When I heard of the collection, I immediately wanted to acquire it,” said Paul Roth, an American who is the center’s director. “For all the strengths of our holdings — including the Black Star and the Berenice Abbott archives — we don’t have a tremendous amount of Canadian photojournalism. This helps us fill that gap. And, since it comes from a major U.S. newspaper, it brings up the question of how one country covers another, which fits within our mandate of interrogating different aspects of the medium.”

The expected tropes are there: Canada as a winter wonderland; as a safe, polite neighbor who reveres hockey. But there are also images that challenge them: Canada the diplomat having lighthearted meetings with America’s foes. In one photo, Nikita S. Khrushchev laughs at a joke told by Mr. Pearson — the opposite of the famous “Kitchen Debate” moment by Elliott Erwitt, in which then-Vice President Richard Nixon castigates the Soviet leader. In another, Fidel Castro holds Prime Minister Pierre-Elliott Trudeau’s youngest son, Michel Charles-Émile, during a four-day state visit. Or, Canada the troubled young nation deploying the Army to confront Quebec’s sometimes-violent calls for independence.

“The type of coverage we see speaks of a dual fascination between how familiar Canada feels, and yet how unfamiliar it sometimes appears,” Mr. Roth surmised. “I suspect that The New York Times had to ponder how to cover a country that was so close. Should they concentrate on the differences or highlight the similarities? When stories involved people or goods crossing the border, which was often the case, were they to be considered national or international news?”

Besides snow and hockey, evidence of Canada’s subordination to the British monarchy seemed of particular interest. The New York Times dedicated space daily to Princess Elizabeth’s first tour of Canada in 1951 (Slide 9) and continued to chronicle the royal family’s subsequent visits.

Mr. Trudeau also drew a lot of attention, more than any of his predecessors and successors, that is, until his son Justin ran for the same office and won in 2015. A reproduction of a spread published during the 1972 election is revealing. Within “The World” section, the article isn’t under a rubric with the country’s name, as is customary, but simply “Trudeau,” and a headline declaring “A Swinger Shows His Sober Side.” A full column is dedicated to a collage of images showing the candidate dancing, riding a motorcycle, playing hockey and pedaling a unicycle before concluding with a somber close-up portrait.

Mounting the exhibition, Denise Birkhofer — an American who recently settled in Toronto and co-curated the show with Gerald McMaster, an Indigenous Canadian of Plains Cree and Blackfoot descent — pondered how The New York Times’s fondness for certain subjects and visual archetypes might have shaped a national identity. That’s hard to answer, partly because of the variety of photographers who contributed to the paper’s Canadian coverage.

“There’s a multiplicity of voices that came together to shape the perception of Canada that The New York Times then shared with its readers,” she said. “Not all were Americans. Sometimes staff photographers were sent to cover a story, but other times it came from local publications or freelancers. There were also images made by Canadian agencies or corporations, such as the National Film Board and the Canadian Pacific Railway.”

Photo

Most surprisingly, during World War I, the images the paper used to showcase Canada’s participation in the war effort were supplied by Canadian entities, whose work had to be vetted by the nation’s official censors. Its goal was to avoid criticism of military endeavors by showing the conflict in a romanticized light. In other words, said Gaëlle Morel, the Ryerson Image Center exhibitions curator, “The New York Times — a private commercial enterprise — obeyed the censorship requirements of a foreign country.” In other words, the country’s image, as seen in The Times, reflected an official, sanitized perspective.

Mr. Roth said the collection has greater meaning given Canada’s sesquicentennial this year. “More than a time for celebration and patriotism, it is an occasion to think about complicated questions relating to the identity of the nation,” he said. “All countries should be interested in how they’re viewed by other states. We should strive to get past the mythologies that are created to promote tourism or to reinforce patriotic values, especially nowadays. Doing so requires unpacking widely held cultural assumptions. And that’s exactly what we can do thanks to this archive. While it doesn’t tell a single story, it does help us understand what the Canadian mythologies are.”

5A: Hi, kids! I wasn’t around for ADLAI Stevenson’s presidential campaign either, but I got this and I’ll explain how I did it.

In the mid-20th century, it was apparently fashionable among campaign slogan writers to try to make their slogans rhyme, primarily because it would have been considered laughable at the time to suggest that the candidate might want to have a beer with anyone who wasn’t at least a governor. Slogan writers would sit in small, smoke-filled offices with long lists of words that rhymed with their candidate’s name (“Badly for Adlai?” “No. ...” “Sadly for Adlai?” No!”), and they were released only when they hit on something that was not terrible and could fit on a campaign button. My point is, if you see a clue like “‘Madly for ___’ (1952 campaign slogan),” you have enough information to know that you should be thinking about a midcentury candidate whose name rhymed with “madly.”

67A: “Even Homer NODS” is an idiom that means that even people who are the best at something can make mistakes during a momentary lapse in concentration. It’s an allusion to the epic poet Homer’s work, which apparently contains errors in continuity.

6D: I got my friends from college into crosswords last year, and a common struggle they had was deciphering exactly which exclamation answered a clue like this. AHA? OHO? Perhaps GEE or WOW? Nope. Despite the plausibility of these guesses, you must check your crossings.

54D: While “going ape” means “losing one’s cool,” this is a cutesy clue inspired by “Tarzan of the Apes.” Love it. Although it’s not the easiest, especially when GO APE looks so odd in a grid.

Constructor Notes

Joy Behar: I started doing The New York Times puzzle right after college, when I found myself working a job that had a lot of down time. It was difficult at first, and still is, especially on Saturday, when the puzzle is very challenging. I found that if I stuck with it, I could finish it. This proved to be a good lesson for other chores and projects. In recent years, I found my name used in the puzzles. I figured they needed the vowels. Even so, it was a thrill. As far as construction, once we landed on a theme (comedians), it was not too difficult to come up with puns for comedians’ names. The grid’s restrictions didn’t allow as many names as I would have liked, but that’s life in the crossword world. The best part of doing the puzzle every day is that it provides a distraction like no other: From politics, the phone and the refrigerator. So thank you. Lynn Lempel: This collaboration was something of a blind date set up by Will, and it was all done via email. We both decided from Day 1 that the theme would be comedians, but it took a while to get from there to this puzzle. At first we thought of using names like (Lucille) BALL, (Bob) HOPE, and (Chris) ROCK that could be used in everyday phrases — and we batted around some possibilities. We also considered a few ideas that included revealers. But then, among ideas for those themes, Joy included PRYOR COMMITMENT … and I knew immediately that she’d come up with something different and perfect. She’d found our theme angle for sure, and her example was even 15 letters for a terrific central grid-spanner. After emailing back and forth, we decided on this set. Three of the five theme entries (PRINZE, PRYOR, and IDLE) were Joy’s ideas, and all but one of the theme clues were hers (all but BARR). Unfortunately, BARR HOPPING didn’t fit. A few names that didn’t work were Chaplin/chaplain, Marx/marks, and Bee/be. I did the grid, which Joy approved. And I wrote clues that she then went through and edited, preferring to make them more challenging. Will changed very few of them. If you guessed that Joy wrote the great clue for GO APE, you’d be right. Also the ones for RESCUE DOG and HELIX, just to name two that I especially liked. Working on this with Joy was great fun. Her emails were guaranteed to include some funny choices I never would have thought of. I loved the way the puzzle turned out. I hope all of you solvers do, too.

Thank you, Ms. Behar and Ms. Lempel, for such a lovely Tuesday puzzle. Truly hope to see more from you, whether it be on television or in print.

Mr. Adams purchased the 64-acre farm in Jeffersonville in 1976 intending to convert it into a center for photography.
While it is a great way “to jump-start your career, it is not the only way,” she said.","Thirty years ago, Tim Rasmussen wore a mullet to the photojournalism version of Woodstock on a small upstate New York farm. He had traveled from his small town in Utah to the Catskill Mountains, to a celebration of photography where he studied with such masters of photojournalism as Mary Ellen Mark, Greg Heisler and Jodi Cobb.

A local high school band in Jeffersonville was playing a thunderous welcome as he entered a large, partly built barn. Inside he was greeted by the festival’s mastermind: Eddie Adams, the Pulitzer Prize-winning war photographer.

“Everybody who was anybody was there and I didn’t even know they existed,” said Mr. Rasmussen, now the director of photography for digital and print media at ESPN. “I went to this small agricultural college in Utah and didn’t know anybody, but in less than a week I left there with four or five lifelong friends. Sometimes you spend your whole life seeking your community and for me that was the moment that I found it.”

Mr. Rasmussen will return to Jeffersonville this weekend for the 30th Eddie Adams Workshop, which has since become one of the most important stops for up-and-coming photojournalists.

Mr. Adams died in 2004, but the workshop continues under the aegis of his wife, Alyssa Adams, and the assistance of around 150 volunteers. Some things have changed since the first session — Kodak slide film gave way to digital imagery in the late 1990s and audio and video have been added. Some sponsors have fallen away as the industry has withered, and while tuition is still free, students pay $375 for lodging.

The workshop is structured much as it was 30 years ago, with 10 groups of 10 students managed by a well-known photographer as team leader, a photo editor and a producer. This year, all the teams are led by photographers who were once students in the workshop.

For Jimmy Colton, a well-traveled photo editor who will be attending his 27th consecutive session this week, the workshop is about family. He calls himself Uncle Jimmy, and considers all 2,700 students he has worked with to be his nieces and nephews. The barn is also a place of family ghosts for Mr. Colton, whose brother Jay, and father, Sandy, both volunteered as photo editors before their deaths.

The core values of the workshop continue to be “a level of ethics beyond reproach, having great concern for your subjects and treating everyone as you would like to be treated,” Mr. Colton said.

Mr. Adams purchased the 64-acre farm in Jeffersonville in 1976 intending to convert it into a center for photography. But progress on rebuilding the ramshackle structures was slow as assignment work kept him busy. It was after he met Alyssa in 1983 that the plans for a free, merit-based workshop came together. They married shortly after the first workshop.

“This workshop is not a ‘how to,’ it’s more inspirational and aspirational,” Ms. Adams said. “This is a place where you can let your hair down and experiment a little as a student.”

The workshop does not romanticize photojournalism, and it acknowledges the price many photojournalists have paid while covering conflict. An annual memorial service for photographers who have died during war recognizes friends of Mr. Adams who were killed in Vietnam, like Henri Huet and Larry Burrows, as well as more recent casualties like Chris Hondros, who attended the 1993 workshop. An annual Award is given to a student by the Chris Hondros Foundation.

Recognizing colleagues who have been killed emphasizes that “the truth matters, pictures matter, and you can make a difference with your pictures not just in war,” said Nancy Andrews, who attended the first workshop in 1988 and has volunteered as a photo editor and will be a team leader this year. She returns for the sense of community and generosity, she said.

“I’m actually improved when you, my colleague, or you, my student, make a great picture” said Ms. Andrews, who was a Washington Post staff photographer and director of photography at The Detroit Free Press. “It’s not like there are finite numbers of great pictures out there and you stole one of them so now I can’t get one. It elevates the profession and I might be better as a result.”

Admission to the workshop, for students and professionals with less than three years’ experience is through portfolios judged by a panel of photo editors.

Not being included can be a difficult blow.

Ruth Fremson was among those young photographers who did not make the cut in the late 1980s. She remembers the rejection well, though she has since been part of three Pulitzer Prize-winning teams as a staff photographer for The Associated Press and starting in 2000 at The New York Times. While it is a great way “to jump-start your career, it is not the only way,” she said.

She has been a team leader at the workshop the last two years and is returning this weekend as a kitchen volunteer to help prepare food for the students.

“It’s such a gift to be able to participate in it because the team leaders and volunteers get as much out of the workshop as the students,” she said. “I’ve had the benefit of many great mentors who have championed my career and this is a great place to pay it forward.”

Weegee,” features vintage prints — many previously unseen — that captures Weegee’s singular point of view.
These prints, Mr. Blau wrote in the book, changed his mind, as he saw pictures vastly different from those he had encountered 30 years earlier in some badly reproduced volume.
Mr. Blau deftly connects the man and his era to how we and Hollywood — to which Weegee decamped in 1947 to try his hand at acting — now perceive it.
“Our reference points to these mysterious words can be found in Hollywood entertainment such as ‘The Sopranos’ or ‘Boardwalk Empire,’” Mr. Blau wrote.","To those among us fortunate enough to have known old-timers who regaled us with tales of tabloid derring-do, New York was once a place of outrageous characters both in front of and behind the camera. Like players in “The Front Page,” hordes of cigar-chomping, fedora-wearing men plied their trade as a contact sport that was not above recreating scenes or putting a prop or two — like a lonesome looking doll — into everyday moments of tragedy.

In this cast of characters, Weegee was the Dante of New York’s nighttime demimonde. His photos, of swells and speakeasies, crime and crowds, or perps and play, are a singular record of New York City in the 1930s and ’40s. And just when you thought you had seen all of his work, a new book, “Extra! Weegee,” features vintage prints — many previously unseen — that captures Weegee’s singular point of view.

Photo

Daniel Blau, the book’s editor, admitted that he had “never really liked Weegee.” Obviously, he has since come to his senses, putting together an impressive volume that captures the many sides of New York as it approached World War II. The images were found in the archives of the Newspaper Enterprise Association, a syndicate founded at the turn of the last century by Edward Willis Scripps. The photos — which had been taken for the association’s Acme Newspictures service — passed through the hands of several owners, and were discovered in storage in 2012 by Ryan Adams.

These prints, Mr. Blau wrote in the book, changed his mind, as he saw pictures vastly different from those he had encountered 30 years earlier in some badly reproduced volume. And in a nod to the current daily torrent of images, these photos had an air of mystery, he said, and the mark of a master.

Weegee, born Ascher Fellig in 1899 in what is now Ukraine, lived a spartan existence down by the old New York Police headquarters in Lower Manhattan. That’s not surprising, since his realm was the streets. And the images he shot revealed not just a knowledge of people and places, but an appreciation for the ironic, odd or absurd.

A car dangles off the roadway that encircles Grand Central Terminal, with a “ONE WAY” arrow pointing at it, while two men stand under an awning, not oblivious, but not impressed, either. In another, an overturned vehicle rests on its side, with a sign reading “SLOW DOWN” hovering behind it like an unheeded warning.

Photo

Working crowds, you have images of a sweaty, packed throng in Coney Island and people celebrating the end of World War II. A jubilant sailor is surrounded by four women, flanking a sign he held declaring: “$2,000 In Bank Now I’m Looking for a Wife,” with “18-40” added at the bottom. An image of gawkers at a murder scene is a collage of mostly children’s faces, some goofy, arrayed around one woman whose grief is etched on her face.

He also found the lighter side, showing teenaged bobbysoxers jitterbugging in the aisles of a theater, dogs and cats, and even a gorilla. The book is divided into chapters that all start with “EXTRA!” and are devoted to topics like Crime, Cool, Friends, Characters and more.

Of course, the main character on this sidewalk stage is Weegee himself. Mr. Blau deftly connects the man and his era to how we and Hollywood — to which Weegee decamped in 1947 to try his hand at acting — now perceive it.

“Our reference points to these mysterious words can be found in Hollywood entertainment such as ‘The Sopranos’ or ‘Boardwalk Empire,’” Mr. Blau wrote. “Weegee made these possible. He was a game changer — breaking new ground in both photography and photojournalism. Using a camera to tell a story as others used their pen or speech.”

Mr. Blau concludes that while Weegee may have left to be a movie actor, he had long been on that path.

“By then he had already made all the films he wanted,” he wrote. “All films made of a single frame. All telling a story in one take. Today I love these short films.”

The cathedral peacocks’ residence since 2002 has been a rather unstylish wooden structure on the south side of the cathedral.
Kevin Seymour, an architect from Ennead who is the project manager for the firm’s work at the cathedral, told Father Daniel that a step would be installed to make it easier for the peacocks to enter and leave their new home.
“Semi,” Father Daniel said, “especially if you have an almond in your hand.”Not this time, though.
“He’s too full of kale,” Father Daniel said.","“They give a slight magical quality to our gardens,” said Bishop Andrew M.L. Dietsche, who lives on the grounds of the cathedral.

They also give the gardens a squawking quality in mating season. They can be “very, very loud,” he said, adding that he and the other church officials who live on the grounds “are very familiar with it.”

Jim was named for the Very Rev. James A. Kowalski, who stepped down as the dean of the cathedral several months ago. Harry was named for a former dean, the Very Rev. Harry H. Pritchett Jr., and Phil for Phillip Foote, the former head of the Cathedral School.

But they can be elusive. For an inspection of the new structure on Friday, Robert Flynn, the manager of the cathedral’s soup kitchen, ended up doubling as a peacock wrangler, luring Harry with a handful of kale.

The interim dean, the Rev. Clifton Daniel III, arrived for the inspection with a handful of almonds for the peacocks and a dry sense of humor for the people trailing along.

“There’s a pigeon named for me,” Father Daniel said.

It turned out that he was not kidding — there really is. Lisa A. Schubert, the cathedral’s vice president for programming and external affairs, produced a cellphone with a photo.

So the obvious question was asked: Does Clifton the pigeon get along with the peacocks?

“You would have to ask them about that,” Father Daniel said, almost straight-faced.

But Clifton was not available for an interview. Ms. Schubert said the reason was medical: He was in isolation at an avian center after treatment for lead poisoning, a vitamin B deficiency and an inner ear problem. She said she had rushed him off in August after noticing that he was having trouble walking.

The cathedral peacocks’ residence since 2002 has been a rather unstylish wooden structure on the south side of the cathedral. The competition for the new shelter began in 2015 and was open to the 140 architects of the firm Ennead, itself a descendant of Polshek Partnership Architects, which had worked on large-scale projects at the cathedral since the 1990s.

The jury included Susan T. Rodriguez, who heads the firm’s design process on cathedral projects; Guy Maxwell, a lifelong birder who is the managing partner for the firm’s projects at the cathedral; Dr. Christine Sheppard of the American Bird Conservancy; Lorelei Tibbetts of the Center for Avian and Exotic Medicine in Manhattan; two real-estate developers, Dean Amro and Thomas Brodsky, who had overseen the new apartment building on the north end of the cathedral grounds; and three officials from the cathedral.

“We spent a few hours actually deliberating, if you can believe that,” Mr. Amro said. “Architecturally, the feeling was that this was respectful of the cathedral, for giving a nod to the shape of the windows.” He said that the lightweight plastic walls of the structure were “reminiscent of feathers.”

The two winners, Mr. Lewandowski and Paul Scrugham, worked together to marry form and function in the final design.

“We were given basic parameters,” said Ryan Lewandowski, one of the winners. “My design focused on referencing the cathedral architecture. The other design focused on functional aspects — how you clean it out.” The tubular frame “allows adaptability for where you place perches,” he said.

Kevin Seymour, an architect from Ennead who is the project manager for the firm’s work at the cathedral, told Father Daniel that a step would be installed to make it easier for the peacocks to enter and leave their new home.

“Because they have arthritis,” Father Daniel said.

They are not so young anymore — they probably have more yesterdays than tomorrows. But what about encounters in the present: Are they friendly?

“Semi,” Father Daniel said, “especially if you have an almond in your hand.”

Not this time, though. Harry was not interested in Father Daniel’s almonds.

“He doesn’t just say he’s going to do this,” Mr. Mowery said. “He gets thrown out of office over it. And then he gets re-elected.”

In order to fill the Senate seat that Attorney General Jeff Sessions held for 20 years, Mr. Moore must pass one more test: a special election in December against the Democratic candidate, Doug Jones, a former federal prosecutor who is a formidable rival, especially by the diminished standards of Alabama Democrats.

Although Mr. Trump said on Friday that Mr. Moore “has a very good chance of not winning” in December, strategists in both parties expect the state’s voters to choose Mr. Moore, who was one of the public figures who stirred doubts about the birthplace of Barack Obama.

If he is elected to the Senate, Mr. Moore will have gotten there as a rare retail politician with a penchant for reciting Blackstone’s Commentaries on common law. At the same time, and to greater political benefit, Mr. Moore, a former professional kickboxer, exhibits traits that many Alabamians see in themselves and seek in their elected officials: He is outwardly pious and prone to political pugilism, self-assured and satisfied with standing alone.

“Roy Moore is Huey Long with religion,” said Jim Zeigler, a Republican who is the state auditor. “Huey Long would tell it like it is. He ran against the establishment, he defeated the establishment, he would not compromise with the establishment. Roy Moore does all those things, but he has a biblical worldview.”

Yet Mr. Moore, who twice ran unsuccessfully for governor, is far from universally beloved in this state. For many people in Alabama, he remains part novelty, part demagogue and part embarrassment, his reputation marred not by bribes or sex scandals but by his brand of stubborn populism. More than once, Mr. Moore has found himself rebuffing comparisons to George C. Wallace, the governor who said in 1963 that he wanted “segregation now, segregation tomorrow and segregation forever.”

Mr. Moore is “a one-issue man, and all of the other things fall to the side,” said Joel Sogol, a lawyer from Tuscaloosa who has tangled with Mr. Moore. “Either you accept those issues from his position or you don’t, and there’s a lot of folks here who accept them.”

Mr. Moore’s fame stems almost entirely from years of pitched legal battles over Ten Commandments displays on public property and over the authority of the federal courts to recognize same-sex marriages. Cast aside, even by some in his own party, as a bigot and a hatemonger, Mr. Moore has turned high-decibel clashes with his critics — he blamed “atheists, homosexuals and transgender individuals” for one conflagration — into opportunities.

In Alabama politics, Mr. Sogol said: “He’s an outsider who has a flag to hold on to. His flag is Christianity, the Bible. There are a lot of people in this area who think that is the No. 1 thing in the world.”

During his periodic exiles from public office, Mr. Moore helped to steer public debate using a nonprofit organization called the Foundation for Moral Law, which says it “exists to restore the knowledge of God in law and government and to acknowledge and defend the truth that man is endowed with rights, not by our fellow man, but by God!”

The organization, which Mr. Moore’s wife now leads, was the subject of a complaint filed to the Internal Revenue Service last week, accusing the group of “repeatedly and expressly” advocating Mr. Moore’s election to the Senate, in conflict with its tax-exempt status. Mr. Moore says the criticism of the organization is politically motivated.

Though he has done little to excise himself from the clamor of evangelical politics, Mr. Moore sometimes complains about being regarded solely as a culture warrior.

“They put me in a religious thing because I acknowledge God,” he said in an interview. “I regret voters don’t hear me talk about laws and all the things I do otherwise in government. When I was on the court, I dealt with everything.”

Service in the Senate presents similarly sweeping challenges, and the Capitol Hill establishment is not likely to roll out a welcome mat for Mr. Moore. He said throughout the campaign that he would be a gadfly, not an obedient follower of the party line laid down by Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, whose allies spent heavily in Alabama trying to help Mr. Strange keep his seat.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

“McConnell and all of those people in Washington know I’m not to be controlled,” said Mr. Moore, whose campaign won the support of Stephen K. Bannon, the executive chairman of Breitbart News and Mr. Trump’s onetime chief strategist. “I’m not going to be managed, I’ve never been,” Mr. Moore said.

Though he is dismissive of his party’s leadership, he is no one’s idea of a centrist, and would probably vote the same way as Mr. McConnell on most issues. Like nearly every Southern Republican running for a statewide office this year, he has campaigned on repealing the Affordable Care Act, protecting gun rights, increasing military spending and toughening immigration enforcement.

Yet longtime observers of the man whom many know simply as Judge Moore sometimes struggle for a neat, overarching description of his approach to public policy, beyond simple populism. In his years on the bench, he stayed at something of a remove from the pro-business orthodoxy of the Republicans who have won near-absolute power in Alabama in recent years, and for an array of reasons, business leaders have chronically kept their distance from him.

“He’d probably be considered conservative by some standards, less so by others,” said Jere Beasley, a trial lawyer who once served as a Democratic lieutenant governor and who donated to Mr. Moore’s campaign.

Mr. Beasley praised Mr. Moore for a ruling he handed down on arbitration, but other decisions give his judicial record a texture that surprises both supporters and critics. In occasional dissents, for instance, Mr. Moore voiced support for overhauling sentencing laws that some say are too harsh and too rigid. Writing in a robbery case last year, Mr. Moore said, “There is a difference between justice and overkill.” In another case, he argued that a life sentence for a nonviolent drug crime had shown “grave flaws in our statutory sentencing scheme.”

“He is a populist,” Mr. Zeigler said of Mr. Moore, whose campaign had a fraction of the financial support that Mr. Strange attracted. “I don’t think he intends to be. He just is.”

It is a model that has long proved politically effective. And on Tuesday, at least, it overcame more than $10 million in advertising spending by Mr. Strange’s allies.

“It’s almost the same appeal that Trump has, but it comes from a totally different place,” Mr. Mowery said. “The state’s motto is, ‘We dare defend our rights.’ It kind of starts right there: A lot of people feel Roy Moore is the guy who’s done that.”","Alabama Republicans Bet on Roy Moore, a Familiar Rebel, for Senate",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/us/politics/roy-moore-alabama-senate.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Mr. McConnell could be an anchor around incumbents in the same fashion as Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, who is routinely used to undermine Democratic candidates. The loudest applause Mr. Moore received during an election-eve rally came when he declared, “Mitch McConnell needs to be replaced.”

In a memo about the Alabama election that circulated among Republican donors, Steven Law, president of the Senate Leadership Fund, a “super PAC” closely allied with Mr. McConnell, said primary voters were intensely angry and inclined to blame Republicans for dysfunction in Washington.

“The Republican Congress has replaced President Obama as the bogeyman for conservative G.O.P. primary voters,” Mr. Law wrote, cautioning that the president was helping to amplify that point of view: “This narrative is driven by Trump himself, and it resonates with primary voters who believe the Republican Congress ‘isn’t doing enough’ (as we frequently heard in focus groups) to advance the president’s agenda.”

Mr. Law, whose group spent more than $10 million to prop up Mr. Strange, said in the memo that Republicans had been damaged by “the Obamacare repeal fiasco,” and said they should expect to fight hard-right primary candidates in Mississippi and Nevada, among other states. Mr. Law derided Mr. Bannon for being focused mainly on “promoting his own brand,” and discounted him as a major force in Alabama.

The convulsive mood on the right has considerably reshaped the political map for 2018, making a favorable list of Senate races somewhat less hospitable to Republicans. Two Republican senators, Dean Heller of Nevada and Jeff Flake of Arizona, have seen their poll numbers collapse after clashing with Mr. Trump and embracing unpopular legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act.

In Tennessee, Senator Bob Corker, a well-liked lawmaker from a traditional Republican mold, on Tuesday became the first Senate Republican to announce that he would not seek re-election in 2018. His departure is likely to yield a contentious Republican primary, much like the one just concluded in Alabama.

The Alabama race “is going to inspire a lot of people,” Mr. Bannon said in an interview in Montgomery on Tuesday night.

Mr. Bannon said he had held discussions about the Tennessee race with Mark E. Green, a state senator who was nominated to be Mr. Trump’s Army secretary before withdrawing after facing scrutiny for his past statements about gay and transgender people. Tennessee could be the site of the next major populist-versus-establishment conflagration if Gov. Bill Haslam responds to entreaties to enter the race.

Mr. Bannon also said he aimed to oust Mr. Heller, Mr. Flake and Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi. Ed Martin, a former chairman of the Missouri Republican Party, said Mr. Bannon had also inquired about the state’s Senate race, in which the Republican establishment has rallied around Josh Hawley, the state attorney general, as an opponent for Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat.

After leaving the White House last month, Mr. Bannon returned to his perch at Breitbart News, and has been using the hard-right website and his close ties to the Mercer family, New York-based conservative donors, to create a new, insurgent power base.

It remains unlikely that Republicans will lose control of the Senate next year, because the playing field of races is tilted so strongly in their direction. The party is defending just eight seats, mostly in strongly conservative states, compared with 25 seats held by Democrats or independents who caucus with them.

Yet the pitfalls Republicans have encountered so far have created unexpected opportunities for Democrats, and the party is assessing even long-shot races where there is the possibility of an upset. In Tennessee, a solidly Republican state, several new Democrats are considering the race for Mr. Corker’s seat: Mayor Andy Berke of Chattanooga said in a statement that he would explore a bid “in the coming weeks,” and State Senator Jeff Yarbro, a Nashville legislator, is also eyeing the race. One Democrat, James Mackler, a lawyer and Iraq war veteran, is already running.

And in conservative Alabama, both Democrats and Republicans believe Mr. Moore’s nomination may put the seat at risk in a Dec. 12 general election, when he faces Doug Jones, a former federal prosecutor who is the Democratic nominee.

Mr. Jones is scheduled to campaign with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. next week, and said in an interview on Tuesday that he would seek support from Republican and independent voters who may be repelled by Mr. Moore, who was removed from the bench for defying Supreme Court rulings and has called in the past for banning homosexuality.

In a sign of Mr. Moore’s vulnerability, Mr. Law’s memo described him as off-putting to “business-oriented Republicans,” who “recoil at Moore’s grandstanding.”

It is not only Republican senators who could find themselves cast out by conservative challengers next year. A parade of candidates, aligning themselves explicitly with Mr. Trump, is lining up to take on House Republicans whom they view as insufficiently loyal to the president. If enough Republican lawmakers are ousted in primaries, or forced to spend millions just to secure renomination, it could give Democrats a better chance to pick up the two dozen seats they need to take a majority.

“I think incumbents are extremely vulnerable,” said Barry Moore, an Alabama state representative challenging Representative Martha Roby, a Republican who called on Mr. Trump to withdraw from the presidential race late last fall. “The American people are sending a message that there’s nothing getting done in D.C., and we’re going to have to replace a lot of those people.”

A spokesman for Ms. Roby, Todd Stacy, noted that she and “her House colleagues have voted to repeal Obamacare, roll back Obama regulations, repeal Dodd-Frank, fund border wall construction, rebuild the military, reform the V.A. and tax reform got rolled out today.”

Still, the alarm is most acute in the Senate. Party strategists have seen private polling in a number of states that shows Mr. McConnell deeply unpopular with his fellow Republicans. In Arizona they have found Mr. Flake trailing his primary challenger, Kelli Ward, a former state senator, by a significant margin.

This month, Senator John McCain, Mr. Flake’s Arizona colleague, staged something of a gentle intervention, urging Mr. Flake to move more aggressively to repair his standing in the party, according to two Republicans briefed on the conversation.

Mr. Bannon taunted Mr. Flake on Tuesday night, suggesting that if the Arizona senator “doesn’t get a better poll in the next 30 days, you’re going to see him step down or the establishment is going to make him” — a possibility Mr. Flake’s campaign spokesman discounted.

“He is running,” said Will Allison, a spokesman for Mr. Flake.

In Mississippi, Mr. Wicker, a former chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, has been gearing up early in anticipation of a revolt on the right, hiring a veteran campaign manager, Justin Brasell, and branding himself on social media as a fierce ally of Mr. Trump.

But Chris McDaniel, a Mississippi state senator who nearly toppled Mr. Wicker’s colleague, Thad Cochran, in a 2014 primary, said that Mr. Moore’s victory made a challenge against Mr. Wicker “more compelling” and that he would decide by the end of October. He said he had spoken multiple times with the Mercers in recent months and had received assurances of support.

Mr. Wicker, he charged, had become “Mitch McConnell’s yes-man.”",Roy Moore’s Alabama Victory Sets Off Talk of a G.O.P. Insurrection,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/us/politics/republican-senate-alabama-mcconnell.html

“You will lose coverage,” our waitress told us later that night in the hotel’s restaurant when we described our plans.","Painting didn’t pay the bills, and so she ran a boardinghouse where her tenants ranged from “inanimate, mincing ninnies” to “door slammers.” The house, which is on Simcoe Street, is around the corner from the Emily Carr House, with its small rooms crammed with books, prints, old china, furniture and, in high season, Emily Carr fans.

In cooler months, the house is closed, but do walk by; in the yard, you might glimpse the “Elephant,” the trailer-like caravan that Carr acquired in 1933 for sketching trips.

But inspiration was also nearer at hand: Beacon Hill Park, the subject of many Carr paintings. Western red cedars, Douglas firs, ponds, peacocks, frothy fountains and stone bridges (one is named for Carr): It is an enchanting park, and, occasionally, a place of high drama. As we strolled, a terrible screeching arose. It was nesting season, and dozens of great blue herons burst from the mid-reaches of some tall trees. The reason for their frenzy: a bald eagle circling overhead patiently, menacingly. It was a drama that showed no signs of abating by the time we left.

Photo

When Emily was a teenager, her mother died, and she became mysteriously distant from her father. Though she would remain close to her older sisters and had a few friends, loneliness remained a constant theme in her journals; marriage and a life of afternoon tea at the Empress seemed unlikely and undesirable. She once compared herself to “a lone old tree.”

But she also took pleasure in solitude, writing stories deep into the night, and sketching during the day. Though her work received praise, she trusted none of it. Success for her was a complex, spiritual matter; the business of melding art and godliness was an unending quest.

And, of course, she had her animals for company: a Javanese monkey who got into all sorts of trouble, multiple dogs and a white rat.

Photo

And then there was the forest. “I sought my companionship out in the woods and trees rather than persons,” she wrote. “It was as if they had hit and hurt me … so that I went howling back like a smacked child to Mother Nature.”

And so, with the aid of the Elephant, she began producing some of her best work as she entered her 60s. “Nothing ever, ever stands still,” she wrote, “and we never, never catch up.”

It doesn’t take long to find wilderness on Vancouver Island. On yet another overcast afternoon, we pulled into a parking lot about 10 miles outside Victoria, and walked down a wide trail. This was Goldstream Provincial Park, more than 900 acres of Douglas fir, cedar, hemlock and other trees; through it all runs a river where salmon spawn each fall.

Photo

Emily Carr loved to anthropomorphize; after reading about brown-eyed lilies and screaming trees, it was easy to imagine that the giant fern fronds on the trail weren’t just brushing against our legs, but reaching out beseechingly, or at least curiously, trying to get as much a visceral sense of us as we were of them.

In 1933, Emily had the Elephant towed to the Goldstream River flats, and there she settled down for a lengthy visit. It wasn’t her first. A few years earlier she had been there, producing sketches in which, say, a cedar branch was not a static thing, but a moving wave of foliage. (One of her most famous works, “Red Cedar,” illustrates this effort.)

No doubt she expected to experience the same productivity two years later, but a parade of parkgoers wasn’t helping. “They started early this morning — the Public,” she wrote. “The air is riled up with motor snorts, dog parks and children’s screechings.” Add to that the antics of Woo, her monkey — who consumed her green paint and had to be treated with Epsom salts — and the rain and the darkness. “I am not afraid, but it’s creepy,” she wrote, before leaving.

Photo

To us, nothing seemed creepy, and there were few people. We arrived at the visitor’s center, which smelled of damp, fragrant wood. Everything inside, it seemed, had been made either by or for visiting school children: Nature paintings hung on the walls, and exhibits — most of them handmade — focused on things like bald eagle counts and the salmon life cycle. Outside, a deck overlooked the river; in the distance, three eagles soared above the trees.

A volunteer with a lined, sunny face expressed enthusiasm for our driving trip to the island’s western side — a trip I was nervous about after reading online warnings about the dangers of washed-out roads, aggressive logging-truck drivers and frequent rain. She brushed it all aside. “Nothing but ocean till you get to Japan!” she said of the views from the wild western coast, then gave us directions to a nearby waterfall, advising us to ignore the high safer path, and to walk instead along the dry riverbed. It was a precarious walk on slippery stones, and rain was beginning to fall, but finally, the waterfall appeared. I saw my friend far ahead of me, her jacket a tiny red smudge below the trees and the falls. Everything here was big.

We drove on, toward Albert Head Lagoon, located in a populated area where the prospects of transformative beauty weren’t promising. As it turns out, Albert Head, its beach edged with trees and strewn with driftwood, is an understated arc of paradise on this developed shore. Here and nearby, Carr found fodder for luminous sky and sea paintings such as “Strait of Juan de Fuca” and “Lagoon at Albert Head,” in which she unleashed an incredible range of colors.

Photo

Our goal was to reach the artsy resort town of Sooke before night fell, but we decided to backtrack in hopes of finding Esquimalt Lagoon. On the way, we stumbled upon the Royal Roads Forest, a hauntingly beautiful woodland where some of the largest Douglas firs on the island are found. We wandered in the cool, dark forest, forgetting about our schedule.

The lagoon itself is a fragile place, a bird sanctuary protected by a wisp of land. Carr, seduced by the “wide sweeps of sea and sky,” arrived here on a beautiful spring day in 1934. Her caravan was deposited on a field of daisies. “Woo rolls among the daisies with her four hands in the air,” she wrote happily. But that night, an epic storm rolled in: “Everything inside blew out and outside things blew in till in and out were all mixed up.” Soon enough, the caravan was hauled to higher ground on a farmer’s field.

A few years later she would return to this area off the coast, and find inspiration in something that was basically ugly: gravel pits. Paintings called “Above the Gravel Pit,” show scenes of denuded land and tree stumps, all beneath a brilliant, rippled sky. There would be more paintings of bare landscapes, some with spindly second- or third-growth trees struggling upward beneath a blue sky.

Photo

In this period, Maria Tippett writes in her biography, Carr approached the sketching or painting process ritualistically: Sitting on her camp stool, she might light a cigarette, sing a hymn, then “raise her gaze slightly above and just beyond her subject, so that it was out of focus. Then, with her sketching-board on her lap and brush or charcoal in her hand, she would strike out with her arm and wrist and with curved or slashing motions make great sweeping strokes.…”

Michelle Jacques, the chief curator at the Art Gallery of Greater Victoria said that the environmentally themed exhibition, “Picturing the Giants: The Changing Landscapes of Emily Carr” — which includes Carr’s two gravel pit paintings — is based on “the hypothesis that Carr was thinking about logging and environmental issues in a real way.” In British Columbia, Ms. Jacques noted, there are currently many concerns: debates over an oil pipeline and increased shipping, salmon farming, land and resource rights for indigenous groups and, of course, protection of forests.

“There’s a torn and splintered ridge across the stumps I call the ‘screamers,’ Carr wrote. “These are the unsawn last bits, the cry of the tree’s heart, wrenching and tearing apart just before she gives that sway and the dreadful groan of falling, that dreadful pause while her executioners step back with their saws and axes resting and watch.”

Photo

Later on our trip, those words would resonate.

We arrived in Sooke an hour before sunset, too late to explore Sooke Hills, which Emily had visited. We stayed at a rambling hotel on the wedding circuit with wide porches overlooking the water. On a Monday, it was nearly empty. By the water four harbor seals bobbed and rolled between moored boats. The clouds had dispersed, revealing a Prussian blue sky and the glimmer of stars. Here, in an area where the weather is notoriously moody, the clear skies that had evaded us in the supposedly milder Victoria area, would, with luck, greet us in the morning.

“You will lose coverage,” our waitress told us later that night in the hotel’s restaurant when we described our plans. She was referring to cellphone service on the farther reaches of the Pacific Marine Circle route. “But you will see animals, guaranteed. I saw elk and eagles and bears last time.” She told us that she had been born on the island, moved to Toronto, and not relishing the pace, returned. “I live over there,” she said, pointing at the dark hills across the water. “Sometimes I kayak to work.”

I thought of Carr, who had generally been eager to return home from her travels. In her journal, she recounts an exchange with a Vancouver art promoter: “‘It’s a shame to think of you stuck out here in this corner of the world unnoticed and unknown,’ says he. ‘It’s exactly where I want to be,’ says I.”","Vancouver Island, Through an Artist’s Eyes",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/02/travel/vancouver-victoria-emily-carr.html

After the rocket strikes, Afghan helicopters circled the capital’s diplomatic quarters and the airport for hours. Gen. Salem Almas, the head of criminal investigations for the Kabul police, said Afghan forces had started an operation in the area where the rockets were fired.

He did not provide details on the number of rockets, which were most likely rocket-propelled grenades, but officials at the airport said that many had landed, and that assailants had entered a house behind the airport.

The operation to clear the house lasted about six hours. Najib Danish, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry, said all of the three attackers in the house were killed.

Mr. Danish said one civilian had also been killed and 11 wounded. Two houses were damaged in the attack on the airport and during government’s response, he said.

American helicopter gunships operating in support of the Afghan special forces caused several civilian casualties when “one of the missiles malfunctioned,” the United States military command said in a statement. It was not clear precisely what the errant missile had struck.

A senior Afghan security official said the assailants had stockpiled so much heavy weaponry in the house behind the airport that a standard clearance operation was impossible and helicopters targeted the area.

One Western official said the insurgent rockets had ignited part of an American weapons depot at a military camp, causing secondary explosions. The airport remained closed to domestic and international flights for much of the day, resuming flights on Wednesday night.

Some officials said Afghan and American aircraft parked at the airport may have been hit. Jalaluddin Ibrahimkhel, a spokesman for the Afghan Air Force, denied this. “The rockets landed in the military and civil parts of the Kabul airport, but it did not damage the runway or any aircraft,” he said.

Capt. Bill Salvin of the United States Navy, a spokesman for the military, also denied reports of aircraft damage and said “nothing in the schedule of the visit changed because of the attack.”

At the time the rockets struck, Mr. Mattis was meeting with Mr. Ghani and Mr. Stoltenberg. Mr. Mattis, who arrived from India, emphasized that President Trump’s new strategy for Afghanistan was an “inclusive” effort to bring stability to South Asia.

The strategy has caused a particularly harsh reaction in Pakistan, which Afghan and American officials contend has long been a safe haven for the Taliban leadership. Mr. Mattis said that the Trump administration would work with Pakistan, but that it would also “watch Pakistan’s choices.”

Mr. Mattis did not provide details on how many more American troops would be arriving in Afghanistan, saying he did not want to share details that could help the enemy. But the lack of transparency has raised concerns, particularly since it was revealed that the United States already had thousands more troops in Afghanistan than officials had declared.

Mr. Ghani emphasized that American and NATO troops stationed in the country would not be “returning to a combat role,” but would be assisting, training, and advising the Afghan forces who are leading the fight.

“We will not abandon you to a merciless enemy trying to kills its way to power,” Mr. Mattis said, emphasizing the American position that a negotiated settlement was the only way out of the 16-year-old war.

The rival claims of responsibility for the rocket assault by both the Taliban and Islamic State pointed to the confusing landscape of the Afghan insurgency. Although the groups have fought territorial battles, American and Afghan officials have expressed concern about their convergence in certain areas.

The officials have been particularly concerned about an overlap in the enabling networks for major attacks planned by the Islamic State branch operating in Afghanistan and the Haqqani Network, an arm of the Taliban.

LOS ANGELES — The expensive science-fiction sequel “Blade Runner 2049” collapsed at the North American box office over the weekend, taking in $31.5 million, or roughly 30 percent less than analysts had expected, as younger audiences and women failed to materialize in sizable numbers.

“I’m disappointed,” said Jeff Goldstein, president of domestic distribution for Warner Bros., which released the independently produced movie in the United States and Canada. “The real trick now is to expand the audience past older men.” Warner said that 71 percent of opening-weekend ticket buyers were male.

Euphoric reviews and possible attention on Hollywood’s awards circuit could help “Blade Runner 2049” play longer and more successfully in theaters than would be typically expected. Denis Villeneuve, who directed the film, had that kind of luck with his last movie, “Arrival,” which had $24 million in initial ticket sales last fall and ultimately collected $100.5 million.

And “Blade Runner 2049” did better overseas, where Sony Pictures Entertainment has the distribution rights. Sony said that the movie took in $50.2 million in partial international release, with major countries like Japan, South Korea and China still to come.

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — I’m not sure whether it stems from a solving, constructing, or editing mind-set, but I’m always fascinated by the variety of “circled letter” themes in puzzles. Circles can highlight letters within a single entry that spell a word, whether they’re adjacent or spread out. At times, they can be arranged to form images the solver must identify. There have even been puzzles where the circles were used to bring attention to noncircled letters.

Thus, with nearly infinite theme possibilities of this type, it’s no surprise that Jacob Stulberg has come up with an interesting “circled letters” puzzle based on a fresh revealer. Let’s take a look:

Today’s Theme

Mr. Stulberg has made the revealer, THREE-RING CIRCUS, almost come to life: the grid contains three common circus performers arranged in a “ring” as indicated by the clusters of circled letters. When read clockwise, they spell out GLASS EATER, FIRE DANCER, and WIRE WALKER.

This is a very impressive feat. Not only did Mr. Stulberg have to find three circus performers large enough to form into rings, but each one had to be hidden within normal entries so that the surrounding fill could still be smooth.

Normally, when constructing a crossword, each letter has two constraints: it must work with both Across and Down entries. However, for a puzzle like this, the requirement of spelling out a circular phrase serves as a third constraint that makes filling the grid exponentially more difficult. Sure, we have tougher bits of fill like KER, LATH and ASSAI in the bottom-right corner alone ... but these are small prices to pay for such an intricate theme.

“The president has free speech rights, too,” Mr.","But in weighing in on the Georgia lawsuit and in vowing to voice support in similar cases in coming weeks, Mr. Sessions drew on so-called statements of interest, a technique used aggressively by the Obama administration to push the boundaries of civil rights laws. They are a legal tool, historically reserved for matters of national security and diplomacy, used to interject the federal government in private disputes.

In the Georgia case, an evangelical Christian student sued administrators last year at Georgia Gwinnett College, a public institution, saying they had limited his ability to proselytize.

According to the lawsuit, the student, Chike Uzuegbunam, an undergraduate at the time, had distributed evangelical Christian materials outside the school library. The college’s administration stopped him because he was not within designated free-speech zones and had not obtained a permit.

Mr. Uzuegbunam later reserved a place outside the school’s food court, within a free-speech zone, and began “discussing the brevity of life and how all men and women have fallen short of God’s commands,” according to the lawsuit. After students complained, administrators said Mr. Uzuegbunam’s “open-air speaking” had disturbed the peace, and they restricted it.

Justice Department lawyers argued in the statement of interest that school administrators were unjustified in silencing Mr. Uzuegbunam simply because other students had been “uncomfortable.”

Casey Mattox, a senior lawyer at the Alliance Defending Freedom, which is representing Mr. Uzuegbunam, said the Justice Department’s support was heartening.

“It’s a boost for the broader free speech movement that the federal government is taking First Amendment rights very seriously,” said Mr. Mattox, whose organization is also representing a student arrested last year for distributing copies of the Constitution on the campus of Kellogg Community College in Battle Creek, Mich.

Mr. Sessions also mentioned that case in his remarks on Tuesday.

“The American university was once the center of academic freedom — a place of robust debate, a forum for the competition of ideas,” Mr. Sessions said. “But it is transforming into an echo chamber of political correctness and homogeneous thought, a shelter for fragile egos.”

Condemning a violent protest at Middlebury College, in Middlebury, Vt., that this year shut down a speech by the author Charles Murray, Mr. Sessions noted that some of the dissenters had worn masks, “a common tactic also used by the detestable Ku Klux Klan.”

The debate about how to interpret the First Amendment on college campuses has divided university faculties, with some arguing for unrestricted speech, no matter how inflammatory, and others advocating boundaries be established in an age of internet trolling and cyberbullying.

At the University of California, Berkeley, the faculty is divided on the issue. Last week, a Free Speech Week event featuring the conservative provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos was canceled.

Mr. Sessions invoked a recent appearance at Berkeley by the conservative writer Ben Shapiro, the former editor at large of Breitbart News, whom he described as a “Harvard trained lawyer who has been frequently targeted by anti-Semites for his Jewish faith, and who vigorously condemns hate speech on both the left and right.”

Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the law school at Berkeley and a First Amendment scholar, said he was pleased about Mr. Sessions’s advocacy for free speech. “I think it’s great that the attorney general of the United States is coming down on the side of free speech — I would hope liberals and conservatives can agree,” he said.

But Mr. Chemerinsky, who has co-written a new book, “Free Speech on Campus,” said he thought Mr. Sessions failed to fully consider the balance of freedom of expression with public safety.

“This university spent $600,000 to facilitate Ben Shapiro coming, and it was estimated if Milo Yiannopoulos came, it would cost $1 million,” he said. “It’s not sustainable for this campus on a weekly basis to facilitate free speech while protecting public safety. Where is that line to be drawn? It’s a really hard question.”

Further stoking the debate about First Amendment rights, Mr. Sessions joined Mr. Trump in criticizing professional athletes who have declined to stand for the national anthem to raise awareness of police brutality and racial injustice.

“The president has free speech rights, too,” Mr. Sessions said in response to a question from the audience. “If they take a provocative act, they have a right to be condemned, and the president has a right to condemn them, and I would condemn their actions.”

Some dissenting students and faculty at Georgetown — where Tiffany Trump, the president’s youngest daughter, is newly enrolled in the law school — called the administration’s message inconsistent.

“There’s hypocrisy here,” said Peter B. Edelman, who teaches constitutional law at Georgetown. “Just as the president has shown a lack of respect for freedom of speech, the attorney general comes to make use of his freedom of speech at our law school.”

Mr. Sessions requested Tuesday’s appearance — the subject and time of which was chosen before Mr. Trump’s remarks about the N.F.L. — according to Randy Barnett, a professor of constitutional law who helped organize the event. Attendance was invitation-only, he said, in order to promote a “civil” tone.

Mr. Sessions urged the students to appreciate their ability to speak out. “As you exercise these rights, realize how precious, how rare and how fragile they are,” he said.

In “most societies throughout history,” he added, “openly criticizing the government or expressing unorthodox opinions could land you in jail, or worse.”","Sessions Calls for ‘Recommitment’ to Free Speech on Campus, Diving Into Debate",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/26/us/politics/jeff-sessions-campus-free-speech-georgetown.html

Vicki Eastus, a puzzle solver in Brooklyn, put it this way: “The more hectic life is, the more calming I find filling in those little boxes.”

Search the internet for research on the impact of puzzle-solving on the brain, and you’ll find plenty of studies. But the results are mixed, and it’s not clear whether puzzle solving has any purely physiological benefits.

The psychological benefits, though, are not in question.

“When you do a puzzle, the mind becomes completely absorbed in the task at hand,” said Joanne Cohen-Katz, a psychologist in Allentown, Pa. “There is total focus on what is happening in the moment, which is the definition of mindfulness. And we know that mindfulness results in all sorts of positive changes in the brain.”

For one, solving a crossword can be a path to serenity in a world of uncertainty.

“I don’t think I have to sell you on the increased demand for this type of pastime in an increasingly worried world,” wrote Margaret Farrar, the first crossword editor of The Times, in a memo to Lester Markel, the Sunday editor, after the Pearl Harbor attack. “You can’t think of your troubles while solving a crossword.”

In recent interviews, New York Times crossword enthusiasts shared their emotional connections to the pastime and described the value they find in the exercise.

Harry Hassell, of Jackson Heights, Queens, remembered his mother working on crosswords. “Amid the chaos of the household, it allowed her a personal pleasure and a routine all her own,” he said. “It also allowed me to see her not just as a car-pooling, tennis-playing mother, but also as a clever, intelligent, word-loving woman.”

Such intergenerational connections, forged over black-and-white grids, can have long-term implications.

“I first started doing crosswords as a child while visiting my Grandma Pat,” said Neil Padrick Wilson, a claims analyst in Tacoma, Wash. “She would sit at the big dining room table, dipping toast in her coffee. I would dip toast in my hot chocolate and we would work through a puzzle together. It got me to think, it got me to learn and it got me to know her better.”

Puzzles became so important to Mr. Wilson that he began to create them, and a crossword he made recently ran in The Times.

While not all enthusiasts go on to construct puzzles, it’s not uncommon for an early habit to persist.

“Rituals are often key in bonding with others, particularly family rituals,” said Ray Bepko, a clinical psychologist in Clinton, N.Y. “Pastimes and hobbies are very much a part of this and impact our adult relationships.”

That seems to be at least one reason people continue or develop a solving habit in adulthood, Dr. Bepko said. “Accessing this deep emotional connection is a source of comfort and reassurance anytime, particularly in difficult moments.”

Of course, puzzles are games, and they’re meant to be fun — especially in the addictive “aha!” moments that many solvers describe.

Of course, the standard claims are being made about the vast stimulative effects of the repatriated cash. They are being met this time with vigorous counterclaims based on the results of the Bush administration’s shot over a decade ago.

Back then, companies found their way around regulations forbidding this use of the money to simply benefit shareholders and corporate chiefs. A Senate commission reported that the top 15 repatriating corporations reduced their overall United States work force by 20,931 jobs, even as share buybacks increased and the annual compensation for their top five executives jumped 27 percent from 2004 to 2005 and another 30 percent the next year.

Pfizer, for instance, brought back $35.5 billion, the largest amount repatriated by a single company during the tax holiday, according to the Senate report. Then it turned around and spent over $20 billion in stock repurchases from 2005 to 2007. By 2007, the aggregate compensation of its top five executives was nearly $13 million higher than in 2004. Its United States payroll was 12,000 smaller.

The pattern was similar across most repatriating companies. Hewlett-Packard, which brought home $14.5 billion, bought back $22 billion worth of stock over the three years and cut its payroll by more than 8,500. The tobacco company Altria, which brought over $6 billion home during the holiday, spent $2.5 billion on share buybacks and bumped pay in the executive ranks by more than $50 million, but cut 6,000 jobs.

A few years back, Ms. Forbes explained to my colleague Floyd Norris how the computer manufacturer Dell had lobbied hard for the holiday — claiming that part of the money would be used to build a plant in Winston-Salem, N.C. “They did bring back $4 billion, and spent $100 million on the plant, which they admitted would have been built anyway,” she said. “About two months after that, they used $2 billion for a share buyback.”

Profits Held Outside the U.S. The 10 companies with the most profit held outside the United States last year, in billions. Apple Pfizer Microsoft G.E. IBM Johnson & Johnson Cisco Merck Google Exxon Mobil $230.2 197.1 124.0 82.0 71.4 66.2 65.6 63.1 60.7 54.0

With a new move afoot to put such holdings back on American books, there is a critical question that is too quickly glossed over: Why do businesses act this way? Why didn’t corporate executives invest more in their businesses and their work forces? Why did they go to the trouble of dribbling around a rule forbidding the use of repatriated profits to pay themselves a bonus? (Note to Congress: Money is fungible.)

Call me naïve. Professor Forbes and her colleagues — indeed, many economists — might swat the question away by arguing that businesses didn’t use the extra cash to invest and employ because they were well-run businesses, well invested and sufficiently staffed to maximize their profitability.

There is truth to this argument. In fact, most corporate investment today comes not from retained earnings but from borrowing. Bringing a foreign profit stash home has little effect on investment incentives.

Still, the question should resonate in an administration that came to power on a promise to address the plight of the working class. Because the working class stands on the other end of a deal with the corporate class. I don’t think it is possible to fully address workers’ demands without understanding, and changing, corporate motivations.

Many forces have shaped this deal, including technology, which replaced workers performing routine tasks, and globalization, which squeezed the margins of many businesses and exposed their workers to competition from cheap labor markets. And yet it would be a mistake to ignore the impact of a corporate ethos that has come to focus on rewarding shareholders and executives at the expense of any other consideration — be it workers’ welfare or even the company’s long-term sustainability. Indeed, workers today amount to little more than a line on the cost side of businesses’ balance sheets, with little claim to its prosperity.

Corporate profits have risen over the last quarter-century, as a share of the nation’s income, even as the workers’ share has shrunk. While executive pay has soared — padded with stock options and shares — the earnings of ordinary workers are below where they were in the 1970s. What’s more, the pensions that ensured workers a retirement perch in the middle class have been replaced by 401(k) savings accounts — which are cheaper for companies but put workers’ retirement prospects at the mercy of the stock market.

“How you divide the pie is a choice,” said Rick Wartzman, who heads the KH Moon Center for a Functioning Society at the Drucker Institute of Claremont Graduate University. “It is being carved differently.”

The change has happened across the board. In his book “The End of Loyalty,” published in May by Public Affairs, Mr. Wartzman lays out a shift in corporate culture both in success stories like Coca-Cola and General Electric and in less successful ones, like Eastman Kodak and General Motors. “For workers, the story was the same, whether they were working at a winner or a losing firm,” he said.

The good news is that it is not impossible to modify the behavior of the corporate leaders who have so drastically altered the contract with their work force over the last few decades. While it may be tempting to cast the new breed of executives as selfish villains who somehow lost their sense of right and wrong, the shift in their behavior responded to a shift in the incentives they faced. It was fed by a belief that snaked its way three or four decades ago from the halls of the University of Chicago through investment-bank trading floors and into the corner offices of corporate America: that the interests of corporate managers must be brought into tight alignment with those of shareholders. It was accompanied by one of the most destabilizing propositions in the modern history of corporate governance: This alignment was best achieved by paying corporate managers almost exclusively with stock.

Mihir A. Desai of Harvard Business School argues that this strategy amounted to outsourcing corporate compensation decisions to the capital markets — which have no way of telling whether the rise or fall in shares is caused by executives’ strategies or simply luck. This produced an enormous bubble in chief executive pay — which rose in tandem with the stock. It also made chief executives’ jobs more uncertain, vulnerable to market downturns. And it vastly distorted their behavior, putting every decision at the service of the share price at the close of the quarter.

Professor Desai points out that in the end, this structure does not really serve shareholders, at least not those with an interest in a company’s prosperity more than a few quarters down the road. “Capitalism seems to be serving managers and investment managers at the expense of shareholders,” he wrote.

Changing this behavior is not beyond the reach of policy. Just as changes in the tax treatment of executive pay in the 1990s encouraged stock-based remuneration, tax reforms might motivate corporate executives to invest for the long term rather than for an immediate stock bump — maybe even encourage stable employment and worker training. Until then, offering tax breaks to American corporations seems more likely to line the pockets of executives and shareholders than to improve their long-term prospects or the prosperity of their workers.",Will a Corporate Tax Holiday Give Workers Anything to Cheer?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/26/business/economy/corporate-tax.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

There are downsides. “It takes some forethought to stash some stuff at work,” he said. “I just wear one or two pairs of shoes at work, so if you want to wear something different every single day, it’d be kind of difficult.”

And he once forgot to bring his work clothes, which meant he had to buy an outfit before starting his day.

Cesar Villalba, 31, a designer at Coach who bikes six miles to his office in Hudson Yards from Williamsburg, Brooklyn, finds versatility in an unexpectedly quotidian piece of clothing: a button-down shirt. “I wear it around my waist in case I have to go to the theater, or if it gets colder,” he said. “Or if I get sweaty, I can hide it.”

Mr. Villalba also advises against a backpack (he has been using a cross-body bag lately) and to think about fabrics. He prefers linen in the summer and breathable merino wool for the rest of the year.

He also notes that having a reputation as the resident bike fanatic helps.

“Many times things have happened like I’ve gotten a flat before an important meeting and arrived with my hands covered in oil and grease,” he said. “Most of the people in the company know that I’m a cyclist. I’m that sweaty person with his hair always wet.”

While some office workers might not want such a reputation, Nick Rosser, 30, an account manager at the creative agency King and Partners, isn’t bothered by it. He bikes two and a half miles from the Clinton Hill section of Brooklyn to NoHo, and often arrives drenched.

“I’m really sweaty,” he said, laughing, “and then I’ll stand in front of the air-conditioner for like five minutes. Everyone in my office just understands that I have to do that because I ride my bike to work.”

Sometimes he’ll even throw his T-shirt over the air-conditioner, whether or not his co-workers mind. “Everyone’s staring at me, but that’s the only way to cool down,” he said. “You either do that or splash cold water on your face.”

LAS VEGAS — In nearly 30 years with the Las Vegas police, Joseph Lombardo has helped defuse an armed standoff between federal agents and local ranchers, struggled to contain a spike in homicides and defended his officers against accusations of using excessive force against a professional football player.

But nothing could have fully prepared him for last week.

Since a gunman smashed out windows in a casino hotel suite on Oct. 1 and rained bullets on a country music festival, killing 58 people and wounding hundreds more, Sheriff Lombardo has found himself in charge of one of the most frustrating criminal investigations in memory: a mass shooting by a man who seems to have left no public accounting for his actions.

So far, Sheriff Lombardo, a plain-spoken man whose persona contrasts sharply with his city of flashing billboards and jangling slot machines, has not been able to uncover a motive for the shooting. And he has wondered aloud whether something — anything — might have prevented the bloodshed.

“We are always preaching, ‘If you see something, say something,’ ” Sheriff Lombardo told The New York Times last week, in one of his first interviews since the shooting. “So how did we miss this, in the see-something-say-something era? Was there housekeeping personnel that hadn’t received training? Maybe it was a new person? I don’t know the answers to those questions yet.”

Sheriff Lombardo and his subordinates have kept a relatively low news media profile in the aftermath of the shooting. Police leaders here have declined almost all interview requests, have skipped the cable-news circuit and have emphasized that they would speak with a single voice to ensure that only accurate information was released. Las Vegas officials say that that approach limits distractions and allows investigators to get on with their work. But it is a departure from the way major events have been handled by local authorities in other cities, where live broadcast interviews and news leaks have been more common.

Most of what the media gets from Sheriff Lombardo comes at his frequent news briefings, where his answers may be somber, combative or collegial, depending on the question. His relatively tight-lipped approach has drawn attention to his crisis management style.

“He is very methodical,” said Jonathan Thompson, the executive director of the National Sheriffs’ Association, who called Sheriff Lombardo “a lawman’s lawman.” “He is exhibiting years of training to make certain the chain of custody on the evidence is protected, but more important, the rights and safety of his community are protected, too.”

Longtime colleagues say he is a smart tactician with a down-to-earth manner who does not like to speak in public. His handling of the mass shooting and his tight grip on the release of information has drawn praise from Nevada politicians. But the sheriff has also frustrated some people with his reluctance to divulge details about the case, and he has not hesitated to call out journalists for inquiries that he deems superfluous or repetitive.

“That’s just a different way to ask the same question,” Sheriff Lombardo said disapprovingly on Wednesday night when a reporter pressed him about the gunman’s financial records. “I can’t answer that.”

Even as he has warned against speculation and conjecture concerning the case, Sheriff Lombardo has at times shared his own theories about the actions of the gunman, Stephen Paddock.

“Do you think this was all accomplished on his own?” Sheriff Lombardo said in that same briefing on Wednesday. “Face value, you’ve got to make the assumption that he had to have some help at some point, and we want to ensure that that’s the answer. Maybe he’s a super guy, a superhero — not a hero. Super, I won’t use the word. Maybe he’s a super yahoo that was working out all this on his own. But it would be hard for me to believe that.”

As the elected sheriff of Clark County, Sheriff Lombardo has an unusual role for an urban police leader. Unlike most big-city police commissioners, he manages a combined sheriff’s and police department, and is directly accountable to voters. His agency employs about 3,500 police and corrections officers, and patrols a land area larger than Connecticut, much of it unsettled desert.

Elected by a narrow margin to a four-year term, Sheriff Lombardo, a Republican, is in the early stages of a re-election campaign. His political allies say he is a caring man with a sharp memory and analytical mind, but is not a natural campaigner. Steve Wolfson, the Clark County district attorney, said Sheriff Lombardo “was a little rough around the edges” the first time around.

“I said, ‘Joe, smile more — you’re a good-looking guy. You never smile!’ ” said Mr. Wolfson, adding that he had been a friend of the sheriff for about 20 years.

Gary Schofield, who retired from the Las Vegas police this year as a deputy chief, said, “Joe is not a politician,” but rather “a cop who happens to be in a political job.”

Sheriff Lombardo calls himself a moderate and says that, unlike many in his party’s right wing, he supports some forms of gun control.

In the interview with The Times, he said that watching other cities cope with mass shootings had helped shape his own response.

“You have to give authority to boots on the ground to act, without having to ask for permission,” he said.

Aside from leading the investigation into the gunman, he said his most important task after the shooting was to calm the public.

“If we let that information highway get in front of us, it’s hard to come back from chaos,” he said. “So I think it’s important to be clear with what information we do have, and what we do not have.”

On Sunday, the authorities began reuniting concertgoers with the cellphones, lawn chairs and other personal items they had left behind when fleeing the shooting.

Sheriff Lombardo, who worked his way up the ranks of the Las Vegas police before running for sheriff, took over a department that had been scrutinized in 2012 by the Justice Department for frequent police shootings, but was held up as a model for what it did in response, putting changes into place that federal officials had recommended. The federal report noted that black people who were shot by the police were more likely to be unarmed than other people.

“It seems relationships are getting better, and I’ve seen a difference,” said Yvette Williams, caucus chair of the Clark County Black Caucus. “Is there still a lot that needs to be done? Absolutely. But are we on our way? Yes.”

During Sheriff Lombardo’s tenure, homicide rates have risen in Las Vegas, as they have in many other cities, and there has been another increase in shootings involving police officers. Over the summer, an N.F.L. player, Michael Bennett of the Seattle Seahawks, said Las Vegas police had stopped him because he was African-American and had used excessive force while detaining him.

“Las Vegas police officers singled me out and pointed their guns at me for doing nothing more than simply being a black man in the wrong place at the wrong time,” Mr. Bennett wrote at the time.

The accusations attracted national news media attention. Sheriff Lombardo defended his officers, saying they had acted properly.

“He’s had a lot thrown on his plate,” said Steve Grammas, president of the Las Vegas Police Protective Association, the union that represents rank-and-file officers. He added that the sheriff has “had to pivot in 50 different directions.”

William H. Sousa, a criminal justice professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, said that Sheriff Lombardo was part of a generation of reform-minded police chiefs and sheriffs who want to improve community relations and raise training standards.

“I think of him as a progressive chief,” Mr. Sousa said. “He has made a greater effort at transparency, instead of the old ‘this is police business,’ and preventing access to everyone.”

When Sheriff Lombardo’s news conferences were broadcast nationally last week, people who know him personally said they recognized the bluntness and the passion of the lawman in front of the cameras, even if the grimness of the mass shooting had obscured his usually cheerful personality.

“The man that you see at that podium delivering those hard messages to the community is the outstanding leadership individual that I know,” said Jodi Manzella, the executive director of an after-school program where the sheriff serves on the board of directors.

Still, the toll recent events have taken on the sheriff has been obvious. The mayor of Las Vegas, Carolyn G. Goodman, said that “you could see, at each press conference, a growing strain on the physical body.”

“It’s hard — this is not an easy thing to be doing,” Ms. Goodman said. “And I look in his face, and I can see — as well as he’s doing with everything, which is great — I can see the stress and the strain.”","After Las Vegas Shooting, a Tight-Lipped Sheriff Faces a Maddening Case",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/09/us/joseph-lombardo-sheriff-las-vegas.html

My previous five puzzles have been Fridays, so I’m very excited for today’s puzzle, my Saturday debut. Another debut I’m happy to mention: Today RON WEASLEY makes his first, full-name appearance in a New York Times puzzle. HARRY POTTER showed up twice in 2000, and HERMIONE GRANGER arrived in 2011. Poor Ron. How many horcruxes do you have to destroy to get some timely recognition?

I’ve really enjoyed my tour here. Other commitments (ikebana in Los Angeles) call, so I’ll bid adieu. I appreciate everyone’s patience while I flailed around. I’ve swept up the broken glass and hope Deb doesn’t notice the missing URN. [Who broke that?! — D. A.]

I live a in a rent-regulated apartment complex in Corona, Queens. The landlord hired a private investigator to inspect every apartment to “ensure the level of quality in the building.” The inspection company, run by retired police officers, specializes in criminal investigations and surveillance, and uses policing techniques. Tenants must provide photo identification and sign an inspection checklist. This feels like an invasion of privacy that goes beyond typical maintenance-related inspections. Must I comply? If I refuse, could the landlord evict me?

A. You may be experiencing a sweep: An owner (usually a new one) begins checking up on rent-regulated tenants. Cameras are installed in hallways to monitor who comes and goes. Online records are scoured in search of alternate home addresses. This strategy is intended to weed out tenants who are violating the lease — and it can be effective. The goal? Clear out rent-regulated tenants.

Bradley S. Silverbush, a lawyer who represents landlords, said that hiring private investigators to check on tenants “has become standard practice.”

So do you have to comply? Well, you are not required to show an inspector identification or sign a checklist, but you are required to give the landlord access to your apartment to, say, make repairs or check for dangerous conditions, according to Samuel J. Himmelstein, a Manhattan lawyer who represents tenants.

Landlords cannot use an access clause in a lease to get into your apartment for nefarious reasons. Read your lease closely, and if you find that the justification for the inspections is not covered, then you and your neighbors should organize a tenants’ association and respond as a group. “The landlord would love to pick people off,” Mr. Himmelstein said. So stick together.

The association should write the landlord a letter explaining why tenants will not comply with the demand. The landlord may back off. Or, the landlord could bring tenants who refuse entry to housing court on what is known as a non-access holdover proceeding. If the judge sides with the landlord, tenants would have to provide access or face eviction. The landlord could not sue a tenant for eviction until the tenant defies the judge’s orders. The judge could also side with tenants, blocking the landlord’s demand. Either way, tenants’ names could end up on a tenant blacklist, making it harder to find another apartment since landlords use these lists, compiled by private companies, to screen prospective tenants.

The association could also file a harassment suit against the landlord in housing court or with the state Division of Housing and Community Renewal, which oversees rent-regulated apartments.",Do I Have to Allow a Private Investigator Into My Apartment?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/realestate/do-i-have-to-allow-a-private-investigator-into-my-apartment.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

Back Story

This was a big weekend for Kesen, one of the many communities in Japan devastated by an earthquake and tsunami in March 2011.

Kesen reopened its Buddhist temple on Sunday. Hiroko Masuike, a Times photo editor who often chooses the images for our briefings, was there to capture the moment.

Ms. Masuike has been making twice-yearly visits to document residents’ struggles since the disaster, which killed almost 16,000 people and caused nuclear plant meltdowns.

In one village, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and reduced most buildings to rubble.

The disaster’s scars are still visible, Ms. Masuike said. Most residents have moved away, and only about 10 buildings have been rebuilt.

But Kesen’s story is one of resilience, she said. A monk named Nobuo Kobayashi stayed and, by selling land and accepting donations, rebuilt the 1,100 year-old Buddhist Kongoji Temple on higher ground. Its statues were painstakingly restored.

On Sunday, about 300 people gathered for the reopening. Monks from all over Japan chanted sutras for those who perished, Ms. Masuike said. “They prayed for the temple to stay here forever.”

11A: Do you get confused as to whether the idiom is “TOE the line” or “tow the line”? A good way to remember that is to visualize a track event where athletes are required to put their toes on the starting line.

Immigration advocates will most likely urge Democratic leaders to refuse a deal that includes the president’s proposals.
Privately, many advocates have acknowledged that a negotiated deal with the Republican president is likely to include some immigration changes.
The president’s demands include new rules that say children are not considered “unaccompanied” at the border if they have a parent or guardian in the United States.","The demands were developed by a half-dozen agencies and departments, officials said. But among the officials behind the demands are Stephen Miller, the president’s top policy adviser, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, both of whom have long advocated extremely aggressive efforts to prevent illegal entry into the country and crack down on undocumented immigrants already here.

The demands represented a concerted effort to broaden the expected congressional debate about the Dreamers to one about overhauling the entire American immigration system — on terms that hard-line conservatives have been pursuing for decades.



In a letter to lawmakers, Mr. Trump said his demands would address “dangerous loopholes, outdated laws and easily exploited vulnerabilities” in the immigration system, asserting that they were “reforms that must be included” in any deal to address the Dreamers.

Democratic leaders in Congress reacted with alarm, saying the demands threaten to undermine the president’s own statements in which he had pledged to work across the aisle to protect the Dreamers through legislation.

“The administration can’t be serious about compromise or helping the Dreamers if they begin with a list that is anathema to the Dreamers, to the immigrant community and to the vast majority of Americans,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leaders in the Senate and the House, said in a joint statement.

Mr. Schumer and Ms. Pelosi, who declared after a White House dinner last month that they had reached a deal with Mr. Trump to protect Dreamers, denounced the president’s demands as failing to “represent any attempt at compromise.” They called it little more than a thinly veiled effort to scuttle negotiations even before they begin in earnest.

“If the president was serious about protecting the Dreamers, his staff has not made a good-faith effort to do so,” they added.

Last month, the president abruptly ended an Obama-era policy called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, in which former President Barack Obama had used his executive authority to protect about 800,000 of the young immigrants from the threat of deportation and provide them work permits.

Even as Mr. Trump kept his campaign promise to halt what he had described as “one of the most unconstitutional actions ever undertaken by a president,” he quickly added that he would work with Democrats in Congress to replace the executive policy with legislation, giving them six months to do so. But a White House official said on Sunday that Mr. Trump was not open to a deal that would eventually allow the Dreamers to become United States citizens.

“The president’s position has been that he’s called on Congress to come up with a permanent solution and a fix to this process,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said last week.

Immigration advocates will most likely urge Democratic leaders to refuse a deal that includes the president’s proposals. But immigration and human rights advocates are also under pressure to do something for the Dreamers, thousands of whom will begin, by March, losing permission to work and protection from deportation if a deal is not reached.

Privately, many advocates have acknowledged that a negotiated deal with the Republican president is likely to include some immigration changes.

Administration officials responsible for securing the border and enforcing the nation’s immigration laws told reporters on Sunday night that the changes requested by the president were essential to protecting American workers from unfair competition and deterring what they described as a never-ending flow of illegal immigrants into the country.

On the president’s wish list is a long-sought Republican goal of stopping American residents from sponsoring the arrival of extended family members. His demand would limit residents to bringing only spouses and children.

Also central to the effort, officials said, are legal changes that would strip away the rights of illegal immigrants to claim asylum or make another case to stay in the United States, allowing federal officials to more quickly deport them.

“We cannot have true border security if we don’t change federal laws to ensure that people who are apprehended are removed,” said Ron Vitiello, the acting deputy commissioner for Customs and Border Protection.

Thomas D. Homan, the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said a vast increase in the number of agents and other federal resources would allow for a crackdown on immigration violators that had been difficult in the past.

Another key part of that crackdown would be on tens of thousands of children who have surged across the border with Mexico during the past several years, many of them seeking to escape gang-related violence in Central American countries. This year, about 38,500 children have been apprehended at the border without their parents.

Administration officials say the children — many of whom are sent to live with a cousin, aunt, uncle or sibling in the United States — must be turned back or quickly deported once they arrive. Under current law, many of them remain in the United States for years during legal proceedings to evaluate their asylum or refugee claims.

If the children are not deported quickly, officials say, many will never leave, eventually becoming a new population of sympathetic young immigrants who seek amnesty. That could create lasting cycles in which illegal immigrants demand to be given a legal status, the officials say.

The president’s demands include new rules that say children are not considered “unaccompanied” at the border if they have a parent or guardian in the United States. They also propose treating children from Central America the same way they do children from Mexico, who can be repatriated more quickly, with fewer rights to hearings.

Mr. Trump is also calling for a surge in resources to pay for 370 additional immigration judges, 1,000 government lawyers and more detention space so that children arriving at the border can be held, processed and quickly returned if they do not qualify to stay longer.

Critics say the focus on deporting unaccompanied children is heartless and impractical. They say many were sent by their parents on long, dangerous treks in the hopes of avoiding poverty, hunger, abuse or death by gangs in their home countries.

Advocates acknowledge that more resources are necessary to speed up those hearings. But they argue that White House efforts to demand quick decisions are likely to merely result in many children being sent back to places where they are raped, beaten or killed.

Of course, the standard claims are being made about the vast stimulative effects of the repatriated cash. They are being met this time with vigorous counterclaims based on the results of the Bush administration’s shot over a decade ago.

Back then, companies found their way around regulations forbidding this use of the money to simply benefit shareholders and corporate chiefs. A Senate commission reported that the top 15 repatriating corporations reduced their overall United States work force by 20,931 jobs, even as share buybacks increased and the annual compensation for their top five executives jumped 27 percent from 2004 to 2005 and another 30 percent the next year.

Pfizer, for instance, brought back $35.5 billion, the largest amount repatriated by a single company during the tax holiday, according to the Senate report. Then it turned around and spent over $20 billion in stock repurchases from 2005 to 2007. By 2007, the aggregate compensation of its top five executives was nearly $13 million higher than in 2004. Its United States payroll was 12,000 smaller.

The pattern was similar across most repatriating companies. Hewlett-Packard, which brought home $14.5 billion, bought back $22 billion worth of stock over the three years and cut its payroll by more than 8,500. The tobacco company Altria, which brought over $6 billion home during the holiday, spent $2.5 billion on share buybacks and bumped pay in the executive ranks by more than $50 million, but cut 6,000 jobs.

A few years back, Ms. Forbes explained to my colleague Floyd Norris how the computer manufacturer Dell had lobbied hard for the holiday — claiming that part of the money would be used to build a plant in Winston-Salem, N.C. “They did bring back $4 billion, and spent $100 million on the plant, which they admitted would have been built anyway,” she said. “About two months after that, they used $2 billion for a share buyback.”

Profits Held Outside the U.S. The 10 companies with the most profit held outside the United States last year, in billions. Apple Pfizer Microsoft G.E. IBM Johnson & Johnson Cisco Merck Google Exxon Mobil $230.2 197.1 124.0 82.0 71.4 66.2 65.6 63.1 60.7 54.0

With a new move afoot to put such holdings back on American books, there is a critical question that is too quickly glossed over: Why do businesses act this way? Why didn’t corporate executives invest more in their businesses and their work forces? Why did they go to the trouble of dribbling around a rule forbidding the use of repatriated profits to pay themselves a bonus? (Note to Congress: Money is fungible.)

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Call me naïve. Professor Forbes and her colleagues — indeed, many economists — might swat the question away by arguing that businesses didn’t use the extra cash to invest and employ because they were well-run businesses, well invested and sufficiently staffed to maximize their profitability.

There is truth to this argument. In fact, most corporate investment today comes not from retained earnings but from borrowing. Bringing a foreign profit stash home has little effect on investment incentives.

Still, the question should resonate in an administration that came to power on a promise to address the plight of the working class. Because the working class stands on the other end of a deal with the corporate class. I don’t think it is possible to fully address workers’ demands without understanding, and changing, corporate motivations.

Many forces have shaped this deal, including technology, which replaced workers performing routine tasks, and globalization, which squeezed the margins of many businesses and exposed their workers to competition from cheap labor markets. And yet it would be a mistake to ignore the impact of a corporate ethos that has come to focus on rewarding shareholders and executives at the expense of any other consideration — be it workers’ welfare or even the company’s long-term sustainability. Indeed, workers today amount to little more than a line on the cost side of businesses’ balance sheets, with little claim to its prosperity.

Corporate profits have risen over the last quarter-century, as a share of the nation’s income, even as the workers’ share has shrunk. While executive pay has soared — padded with stock options and shares — the earnings of ordinary workers are below where they were in the 1970s. What’s more, the pensions that ensured workers a retirement perch in the middle class have been replaced by 401(k) savings accounts — which are cheaper for companies but put workers’ retirement prospects at the mercy of the stock market.

“How you divide the pie is a choice,” said Rick Wartzman, who heads the KH Moon Center for a Functioning Society at the Drucker Institute of Claremont Graduate University. “It is being carved differently.”

The change has happened across the board. In his book “The End of Loyalty,” published in May by Public Affairs, Mr. Wartzman lays out a shift in corporate culture both in success stories like Coca-Cola and General Electric and in less successful ones, like Eastman Kodak and General Motors. “For workers, the story was the same, whether they were working at a winner or a losing firm,” he said.

The good news is that it is not impossible to modify the behavior of the corporate leaders who have so drastically altered the contract with their work force over the last few decades. While it may be tempting to cast the new breed of executives as selfish villains who somehow lost their sense of right and wrong, the shift in their behavior responded to a shift in the incentives they faced. It was fed by a belief that snaked its way three or four decades ago from the halls of the University of Chicago through investment-bank trading floors and into the corner offices of corporate America: that the interests of corporate managers must be brought into tight alignment with those of shareholders. It was accompanied by one of the most destabilizing propositions in the modern history of corporate governance: This alignment was best achieved by paying corporate managers almost exclusively with stock.

Mihir A. Desai of Harvard Business School argues that this strategy amounted to outsourcing corporate compensation decisions to the capital markets — which have no way of telling whether the rise or fall in shares is caused by executives’ strategies or simply luck. This produced an enormous bubble in chief executive pay — which rose in tandem with the stock. It also made chief executives’ jobs more uncertain, vulnerable to market downturns. And it vastly distorted their behavior, putting every decision at the service of the share price at the close of the quarter.

Professor Desai points out that in the end, this structure does not really serve shareholders, at least not those with an interest in a company’s prosperity more than a few quarters down the road. “Capitalism seems to be serving managers and investment managers at the expense of shareholders,” he wrote.

Changing this behavior is not beyond the reach of policy. Just as changes in the tax treatment of executive pay in the 1990s encouraged stock-based remuneration, tax reforms might motivate corporate executives to invest for the long term rather than for an immediate stock bump — maybe even encourage stable employment and worker training. Until then, offering tax breaks to American corporations seems more likely to line the pockets of executives and shareholders than to improve their long-term prospects or the prosperity of their workers.",Will a Corporate Tax Holiday Give Workers Anything to Cheer?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/26/business/economy/corporate-tax.html

On Wednesday, Caitlin Oakley, a spokeswoman for Mr. Price, said in an email that Mr. Price supported an internal review of his travel. She said that Mr. Price takes criticism over his travel “very seriously and has taken it to heart.”

“The secretary has initiated an internal departmental review of the procedures and processes that we go through for official travel,” Ms. Oakley wrote.

In recent days, Mr. Price has defended himself by saying he has a busy travel schedule, and on Saturday, Mr. Price told Fox News that he would stop traveling on private jets until a review of his activities was completed.

“We’ve taken many, many trips in cars — sometimes four and five hours at a time,” he told the network.

According to the senior administration official, Mr. Trump is less perturbed by the actions of two other cabinet members who have fallen under recent scrutiny for their spending: Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.

Mr. Pruitt recently took the unusual step of installing a $25,000 soundproof booth in his office to conduct secure communications, and Mr. Mnuchin inquired about using a military plane for his honeymoon in Europe last month. He also took a government plane on a trip that included a viewing of the solar eclipse on Aug. 21 in Kentucky. That trip fell under scrutiny when Mr. Mnuchin’s wife, Louise Linton, took a stranger to task on Instagram for criticizing the couple’s luxurious lifestyle.

The president has publicly defended Mr. Mnuchin, whose trips came under an official review after the trip to Kentucky. Responding to an ABC News report that Mr. Mnuchin had taken a $25,000 trip to Washington from New York, accompanied by Elaine Chao, the secretary of transportation, the president told reporters to check their facts.

“Why don’t you check your records before you make a statement,” Mr. Trump said to reporters on Sunday. “As I understood it — I don’t know much about it — I haven’t heard about it, but I understand he never took that flight.”

On Wednesday, the House Oversight Committee launched an investigation into the travel of Mr. Trump’s senior administration members. The investigation, opened by Representatives Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, the committee’s chairman, and Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the panel’s ranking Democrat, will examine the use of private and government travel by senior officials, and will request passenger names, destinations and the source of payment for each trip, among other details. The committee is requesting all related documents by Oct. 10.

Ethics experts are critical of the spending activities of Mr. Trump’s cabinet members, many of whom were wealthy before they entered public service. Richard W. Painter, an ethics counsel in the George W. Bush White House and a frequent critic of Mr. Trump, said that his weekly jaunts to Trump-owned resorts have created a culture of entitlement in the administration.

“Every time they’ve gone to Mar-a-Lago, it’s a couple of million just to haul Air Force One down there,” Mr. Painter said, referring to Mr. Trump’s private club in Florida. “Those other guys say, ‘Gee, I’m important too, I ought to get a private jet. I shouldn’t wait to sit around and have Delta Air Lines kick me around.’”

Matthew Dallek, an associate professor at George Washington University’s Graduate School of Political Management who studies political history, said that accusations of overspending have plagued nearly every modern presidency: John H. Sununu, the chief of staff for President George Bush, came under fire in 1991 for taking a government limousine to New York from Washington to attend a stamp auction. (He later resigned.) In 1994, David Watkins, the White House director of administration for President Bill Clinton, resigned after taking a $13,129 trip aboard a Marine presidential helicopter to play golf in Maryland.

“The consequences have been swifter” in the past, Mr. Dallek said. “People have lost their jobs for lesser offenses.”

At least two cabinet members have publicly said that they foot the bill for their travel: Betsy DeVos, the billionaire education secretary, uses her own private jet in her travels around the country “at zero cost to U.S. taxpayers,” according to her spokeswoman, Elizabeth Hill.

Linda McMahon, the former chief executive officer of World Wrestling Entertainment and the current administrator of Small Business Administration — and another billionaire in Mr. Trump’s cabinet — covers the cost on private planes “out of her own pocket,” according to her spokeswoman, Carol Wilkerson.",Tom Price’s Spending Habits Catch Trump’s Attention: ‘I’m Not Happy About It’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/us/politics/trump-price-chartered-air-travel.html

Cancer, by contrast, was an exterminator’s problem — a poisoner’s dilemma. Cancer-causing agents unleashed abnormal cellular proliferation by mutating genes involved in regulating growth. These cancer cells, occupying tissues and spreading, demanded a cellular poison — chemotherapy — that would spare normal cells and kill the malignant ones.

Cardiologists and oncologists — plumbers and poisoners — lived in different medical realms. We spoke different languages, attended different conferences, read different specialty journals. If our paths intersected, we considered the crossing coincidental, the unavoidable convergence of two common age-related illnesses on the same body.

I was a medical resident in Boston in the early 2000s when I heard a theory that would, in time, force these separate worlds to collide. Two cardiologists, Peter Libby and Paul Ridker, were thinking about plaque formation in a different way. Libby and Ridker acknowledged the role of cholesterol and lipids. But just as important was another variable, seldom discussed: inflammation — the recruitment and activation of certain immune cells. These activated immune cells infiltrated blood vessels early in the course of coronary disease and enabled plaques to grow and rupture. “Bad” cholesterol was a necessary part of the equation — it was these lipid deposits that may incite the immune cells, they proposed — but it was not sufficient.

If inflammation triggers coronary disease, might targeting it directly — beyond simply reducing cholesterol — decrease the risk of heart attacks? Over the course of a decade, Libby and Ridker found themselves focusing on a molecule involved in inflammation called interleukin-1 beta. By the mid-2000s, they heard of a new drug — an interleukin-1-beta inhibitor — that was used to treat exceedingly rare inflammatory diseases. In April 2011, Ridker’s team started enrolling 10,000 patients who carried signs of inflammation and were at very high risk for coronary disease in a randomized study to determine the effects of the inhibitor on heart disease and strokes.

The results, published this August, are provocative: Despite no change in cholesterol levels, there was a demonstrable reduction in heart attacks, stroke and cardiovascular death, particularly at higher doses of the drug. But what caught my attention was a separate analysis that asked a seemingly unrelated question: Might the drug also reduce the risk of cancer? In a paper published in The Lancet, Ridker and his colleagues found that drug-treated patients had a drop in all cancer mortality. More striking still was a stark decrease in the incidence of and deaths from lung cancer. Some element of inflammation that drives plaque formation in coronary disease is also driving cancer progression. It’s a study that needs careful replication; the analysis was designed to suggest a hypothesis, not to prove it. There are questions about drug pricing and the risks of infections and low blood counts. But if the benefit holds up in future trials, interleukin-1-beta inhibition could eventually rank among the most effective prevention strategies in the recent history of cancer.

Inflammation at the nexus between cancer and heart disease? But of course, some of you must be thinking, with an exasperated nod. You’ve had your third serving of blueberries; you’ve drunk your green tea. Wasn’t it obvious all the while?

It isn’t so simple. An avalanche of studies has implicated inflammation as a central player in many diseases — but there are inconsistencies. Consider an inflammatory illness like lupus: The risk of most cancers (except some virally related cancers and lymphomas) in lupus patients is only marginally higher. Rheumatoid arthritis increases the risk of lymphomas — but oddly lowers the risk of breast cancer. Tuberculosis, an inflammation-inducing disease, appears to promote lung-cancer risk, but in an animal study, eczema, weirdly, reduces the risk of skin cancer. Meanwhile, an alternative-medicine industry daily peddles “anti-inflammatory” diets — but which of these reduce inflammation, or what types of inflammation are affected, remains far from known.

“Inflammation,” in short, is a concept in flux — “a wastebasket word,” as Padmanee Sharma, an immuno-oncologist at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, told me. There isn’t one inflammation: Lupus, tuberculosis and influenza all cause “inflammation,” but each might provoke different or overlapping wings of immune responses. I asked James Allison, who pioneered cancer immunotherapy, to define “inflammation,” and he paused, considering the definition. “It’s a response to injury, mediated by immunological cells. But there are dozens of cell types communicating through even further dozens of signals.”

We might imagine inflammation, then, as a fuse box that you chance upon in a new house. You are looking for the switch that turns the light on in the living room, or one that turns the alarm off (just as we’re hoping to throw the switch that disables cancer growth or plaque formation). But the circuitry baffles you. Some knobs are marked in crimson: Do Not Touch. Some carry no labels. Some do, but the writing is in a foreign language.

“Inflammation, an umbrella term, is now being broken up into many different categories,” Sharma told me. Is it chronic or acute? Is there a “right” kind of inflammation that protects us from infections and a “wrong” kind that precipitates disease? Is it mediated “adaptive” immunity — the type of immunity involving B and T cells that adapts to infections? Or “innate” immunity, the more ancient phalanx of immune responses that is preprogrammed to fight certain pathogens?

When doctors read trials like Ridker’s, we generally ask two sets of questions. The first might be loosely described as: Is it good science and good medicine? Was the concept proposed in the study proved by the trial? Were the conclusions accurate, the adverse effects acceptable? Cardiologists and oncologists I spoke to agreed on the technical accuracy of the study. One of them noted the modest benefit for heart disease; Ridker and Libby counter that the drug is at least as effective as some cholesterol-reducing medicines.

But there’s a second kind of inquiry that’s harder to put a finger on, for it lives in a nearly aesthetic realm. Does the study illuminate something strange and wonderful about human physiology? A trial might be “good”— but is it, well, “beautiful”? This study is: It links disparate arenas of medicine through a common pathological mechanism. It’s hard to know whether the illnesses in the man I met were driven by inflammation, but Ridker and Libby forced me to view his case — and a thousand other cases I’d seen previously — under new clinical lights. I will never think about patients with cancer and coronary disease in the same way.

There’s another twist of wonder, though. What are the chances that one molecule, sitting at one corner of the immune response, acts as a switch for two utterly different diseases? It must be a quirk in our design, a barely visible chink in physiology that allows us to target inflammation in a manner that doesn’t kill or maim but acts just so, disabling two terrifying illnesses. It’s as if we had walked into the basement of the new house, found the fuse box, learned to read the coded language of the labels and — in the partial darkness — pulled just one switch. And, miracle of miracles: Upstairs, only the living-room lights went on.","What We Learn When Two Ruthless Killers, Heart Disease and Cancer, Reveal a Common Root",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/magazine/can-heart-disease-shed-light-on-cancer.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Mainstream economics for much of the 20th century was based on the simplifying assumption that people behaved rationally. Economists understood that this was not literally true, but they argued that it was close enough.

Professor Thaler has played a central role in pushing economists away from that assumption. He did not simply argue that humans are irrational, which is obvious but also unhelpful. Rather, he showed that people depart from rationality in consistent ways, so their behavior can still be anticipated.

For example, he showed that people do not regard all money as created equal. When gas prices decline, standard economic theory predicts that people will use the savings for whatever they need most. In reality, people still spend much of the money on gas. They buy premium gas even if it is bad for their car. In other words: they treat a certain slice of their budget as gas money.

Professor Thaler also showed that people place a higher value on their own possessions. In a famous experiment, he and two co-authors distributed coffee mugs to half the students in a classroom and then opened a market in mugs. In general, the students who had randomly been given a mug regarded it as being twice as valuable as did the students who were not given a mug.

Professor Thaler named this phenomenon, since documented across a wide range of human experience, an “endowment effect.” One of his co-authors, Daniel Kahneman, was awarded the Nobel prize in economics in 2002. At the time, some argued that Professor Thaler should have shared in the award.

The importance of fairness is another key area of Professor Thaler’s research. He showed that people care deeply about fairness and will penalize behavior they regard as unfair even if they do not benefit by doing so.

This has important economic implications. It explains, for example, why an umbrella store may not raise prices during a rainstorm.

It also illuminates the mechanics of economic recessions. Standard economic theory predicts that during an economic downturn, employers will cut wages to a level consistent with the demand for goods or services, so there is no reason to think a downturn will produce unemployment.

Why then does unemployment rise during downturns? Workers regard wage cuts as unfair. Employers, seeking to avoid angering the workers they keep, prefer to eliminate people rather than cutting the wages.

The Nobel committee described how Professor Thaler’s theory of “mental accounting” explained how people simplify financial decisions by focusing on the narrow impact of each decision rather than on its overall effect. He also showed how aversion to losses can explain why people value the same item more highly when they own it than when they do not, a phenomenon called the endowment effect.

Professor Thaler’s theories also shed light on why New Year’s resolutions can be hard to keep and on the tension between long-term planning and short-term doing.

Succumbing to short-term temptation is an important reason many people fail in their plans to save for old age, or to make healthier lifestyle choices, according to Professor Thaler’s research. He also demonstrated how seemly small changes in how systems work, or “nudging” — a term he invented — could help people exercise better self-control when, for example, saving for a pension.

Professor Thaler had a cameo appearance, alongside the actress and singer Selena Gomez, in the film “The Big Short,” in which he used behavioral economics to help explain the causes of the financial crisis. Asked about his “short Hollywood career,” he joked that he was disappointed his acting prowess had not been mentioned during the summary of his achievements when the award was announced.

Why was the work important?

Mr. Thaler’s work has forced economists to grapple with the limits of traditional analysis based on the assumption that people are rational actors.

He has also been unusually successful in directly influencing public policy.

One of his most important contributions is his influence on the shift to retirement plans that automatically enroll employees, and to policies that offer employees the option of increasing their contributions over time. Both reflect Mr. Thaler’s insight that inertia can be used to shape beneficial outcomes without limiting human choice.

In a 2008 book, “Nudge,” written with Cass R. Sunstein, Mr. Thaler argued governments had many opportunities to improve the design of public policy.

Two years later, the British government created a behavioral economics unit based on Mr. Thaler’s advice that pursued such opportunities. Other countries, including the United States, have followed suit. Some victories are relatively minor, such as sending to people who have not paid auto registration fees a letter with a picture of the car, which has been found to increase the rate of payment. Others are more profound, like automatically enrolling eligible children in school meal programs.

Reactions

Mr. Sunstein, a Harvard law professor, jokingly described the honor for his longtime collaborator as “unboundedly rational.”

“Before Thaler, economics had been using the rational actor models, assuming that people make rational decisions about whether to buy drugs, how to invest, what jobs to take,” he said. “Thaler, more than anyone, systematically dismantled that assumption, not ever by saying that people are irrational. What he did was to say that people depart from rationality in predictable and systemic ways.”

He added that Professor Thaler had “disciplined the idea of animal spirits.”

(Massanois, New York)★★½ LE ALBARE VALPOLICELLA CLASSICO IL BUONO 2016 $15Fruity, round and spicy, with lively acidity and staying power.","The production of Amarone, as is evident by the formal name, is interwoven with Valpolicella. Traditionally, a small percentage of grapes in the region are dried after harvest until they became sweet and concentrated. They are then fermented into a sweet wine, Recioto della Valpolicella. The concentration of sugar in the dried grapes produces high alcohol levels in which yeast cannot survive — generally dying before fermentation is complete — leaving a sweet, unctuous wine.

Occasionally, though, the Recioto ferments until it is dry. This is Amarone, a powerful wine with alcohol levels that can surpass 16 percent. Even though it is considered dry, it can leave a profoundly sweet impression.

The popularity of Amarone has been widely documented. At Italian seafood temples like Marea in Midtown Manhattan, you can see diners relishing this heavy red wine with ethereal raw-fish dishes. To each their own, I suppose.

The powerful wake of Amarone has given rise to a new style of Valpolicella, known as Ripasso. Valpolicella itself tends to be light- to medium-bodied wine, fragrant but not opulent. The popularity of Amarone led to efforts to add muscle to Valpolicella, by employing Amarone-like techniques to its production.

In order to make Ripasso, grape skins left over from Amarone production or dried grapes are added to Valpolicella. The resulting maceration adds body, tannins, alcohol and intensity to the wine.

With the natural inclination to assume that more is better, it is tempting to think that Valpolicella Ripasso, with more flavor, intensity and body, is better than ordinary Valpolicella. Many people feel that way, and Ripassos can be fine wines. But I have always preferred the freshness and easy drinkability of plain old Valpolicella, which, like Beaujolais, has historically been a wine you could knock back without fear of heaviness, headache or hangover.

Nonetheless, the popularity of Ripasso has made itself felt. In the last 10 years, production of ordinary Valpolicella has declined to 18 million bottles a year, from 41 million, according to the Consorzio Tutela Vini Valpolicella, a trade association.

“Nowadays, the trend is to use most of the vintage Valpolicella to produce Ripasso,” Olga Bussinello, director of the consortium, wrote in an email.

Keeping all this in mind, the wine panel recently tasted 20 bottles of Valpolicella from recent vintages. Our tasting coordinator, Bernard Kirsch, did his best to select only ordinary Valpolicellas for the tasting, but it’s not always easy to differentiate Valpolicella from Valpolicella Ripasso. The wine now has its own official designation, Ripasso della Valpolicella, but it is not always used.

For the tasting, Florence Fabricant and I were joined by Justin Timsit, who just recently left his post as wine director at Gramercy Tavern. Our second guest called in sick at the last minute. So, though we prefer a foursome, we tackled this tasting as a trio.

For our part, we all thought Bernie did pretty well in his selections. Of the 20 bottles, only one stood out as not a classic Valpolicella. This bottle, the 2012 Bussola Classico Superiore TB, was syrupy and 15.5 percent alcohol, as against the others, which ranged from 11.5 to 13.5 percent, more Amarone than Ripasso. Otherwise, we were impressed. As the production of these ordinary Valpolicellas has declined, the quality has risen.

“That’s a wine that takes me to that place,” Justin said, speaking of the Veneto region. “I appreciated their freshness and energy.”

Some of the wines seemed modern and highly polished, which made them less distinctive. But the best were quintessential Italian reds, balancing the flavors of sweet cherry fruit with a tart, earthy quality and a welcome bitterness that refreshed. These wines seemed light, almost delicate, yet they had a linear intensity, offering a progression of evolving sensations from first taste through last impression that lingered well after swallowing.

Those that we did not like so well seemed tarted up, not with the flavors of new oak barrels — as is so often the case in historic wine regions — but with richness, Ripasso-style, that thickened the texture. The lightness and linearity were lost. The richness seemed shapeless, arriving but not progressing.

Our all-around favorite was the 2016 Valpolicella Rio Albo from Ca’ Rugate, which was both sweet and savory, with depth, length and complexity. At $16, it was also our best value. Seven of our top 10, in fact, were under $20, indicating that the many Valpolicellas are good values.

The Ca’ Rugate was a simple Valpolicella rather than a Valpolicella Classico, a geographical indication. The Classicos come from the heart of the historic Valpolicella region, which is generally considered to have better potential than simple Valpolicella, which usually comes from areas into which the appellation expanded in the mid-20th century. That may be so, but five of our top 10 were simple Valpolicellas, which suggests that conscientious farming and careful production may currently be more important than location.

Our No. 3 wine, too, was a simple Valpolicella, the savory, floral 2015 Ca’ Fiui from Corte Sant’Alda, as was No. 7, the earthy, agile 2015 Acinum.

Our No. 2 bottle, the spicy, lively 2016 Il Buono from Le Albare, was a Valpolicella Classico. So was No. 4, the textbook sweet and bitter 2015 Secondo Marco and No. 6, the juicy 2013 Saseti from Monte Dall’Ora. And our No. 5 bottle, the smoky, spicy 2014 Marchesi Fumanelli, was a Valpolicella Classico Superiore, a category that must meet an aging requirement of at least one year.

What is the future of this easygoing wine? It’s hard to say. If you see any Valpolicellas on good Italian wine lists these days, they tend to be either Ripassos or very expensive wines from cult producers like Romano Dal Forno or Giuseppe Quintarelli. Wines like the bottles we tasted are rare in restaurants, though they are still on retail shelves.

The Valpolicella consortium acknowledges that Ripasso is the driving force in sales from this region of the Veneto. But trade association officials say they are taking steps to preserve what they call ordinary Valpolicella. By 2018, producers will be limited to making twice as much Ripasso as they make Amarone, and they will only be able to use Valpolicella Superiore wines. This, they hope, will ensure that some grapes are left over for Valpolicella as it has always been.

Recipe Pairing: Striped Bass with Fresh Figs

Without getting Proustian about this, there are dishes that persist. Late last fall, the main course at a pinot noir dinner at Bar Boulud, one of Daniel Boulud’s restaurants, was striped bass with fresh figs. A showstopper, the whole wild striped bass was swaddled in fresh fig leaves and stuffed with fresh black figs in a red-wine sauce. Not only was it unusual — I had never had fish with fresh figs before — but it was delectable. The brooding sauce bathed the velvet figs, and the earthy depth of the sauce made the already succulent fish a fine partner for some priceless bottles of red. For the Valpolicella pairing, I did not tackle a whole 10-pound fish, nor did I have the fig leaves. I winged it without a written recipe, and assembled a close copy that made an excellent match to those Valpolicellas. FLORENCE FABRICANT

Some are avoiding solo meetings with female entrepreneurs, potential recruits and those who ask for an informational or networking meeting.
Yet 64 percent of senior men and 50 percent of junior women avoid solo interactions because of the risk of rumors about their motives, according to a survey by the center.
Good sponsors also give candid, difficult feedback, and women are less likely than men to receive it, McKinsey and Lean In found.
One way to encourage these relationships is to have more people at the top of companies who are not straight white men.","“We found that they avoided one-on-one contact because they were fearful of gossip, or the suspicion that a standout female on a team is sleeping with the team leader,” said Sylvia Ann Hewlett, founder and chief executive of the Center for Talent Innovation, a research firm that has studied sponsorship.

She noted that sponsors “have to spend some capital and take a risk on the up-and-coming person, and you simply don’t do that unless you know them and trust them.” But these relationships are crucial, she said, for “getting from the middle to the top.”

Certain workplaces have become more tense in recent months, after high-profile sexual harassment cases at Fox News, in venture capital and elsewhere, and after the vulgar comments about women by Donald J. Trump that emerged during the presidential campaign. Most recently, accusations against the movie mogul Harvey Weinstein caused him to be fired.

The Society for Human Resource Management, an industry group, said it saw a spike in questions from members about sexual harassment in March — when cases at Uber, Fox News and military academies were in the news — and in August, when harassment surfaced again at Fox, in Silicon Valley and elsewhere.

In some cases, the heightened awareness has improved people’s behavior. “People are more sensitive to how they conduct themselves, because they’ve seen what can happen,” said a male executive in the news and entertainment industry, who spoke anonymously because of the same heightened caution over the topic that is in the air in some workplaces. “That’s presented a better working environment.”

But elsewhere, men have begun avoiding solo interactions with women altogether. In Austin, Tex., a city official was formally reprimanded last month for refusing to meet with female employees, after he ended regular mentoring lunches with one.

Some tech investors have taken similar steps. “A big chill came across Silicon Valley in the wake of all these stories, and people are hyperaware and scared of behaving wrongly, so I think they’re drawing all kinds of parameters,” said a venture capitalist who spoke anonymously for the same reason.

Some are avoiding solo meetings with female entrepreneurs, potential recruits and those who ask for an informational or networking meeting.

“Before, you might have said, ‘Of course I would do that, and I will especially do it for minorities, including women in Silicon Valley,’ ” the investor said. “Now you cancel it because you have huge reputational risk all of a sudden.”

Sometimes women avoid solo meetings with men who have made them uncomfortable or have bad reputations, as when female executives brought colleagues to meetings with Mr. Weinstein.

It has not happened in every workplace, of course, and depends in part on company culture and employees’ trust in human resources to appropriately deal with harassment. In interviews with people across industries, many said interacting with members of the opposite sex was a nonissue. People were warier in jobs that emphasized appearance, as with certain restaurants or TV networks; in male-dominated industries like finance; and in jobs that involve stark power imbalances, like doctors or investors.

Dr. Mukund Komanduri, 50, an orthopedic surgeon with a practice outside Chicago, said he avoids being alone with female colleagues, particularly those he does not know well or who are subordinates.

“I’m very cautious about it because my livelihood is on the line,” he said. “If someone in your hospital says you had inappropriate contact with this woman, you get suspended for an investigation, and your life is over. Does that ever leave you?”

He mentioned a hospital colleague who lost his job because of harassment allegations. “That individual has created a hypersensitive atmosphere for every other physician,” he said. “We basically stand 10 feet away from everyone we know.”

Even before the recent attention on harassment, the practice of avoiding solo meetings with colleagues of the opposite sex was not uncommon. It could mean not sharing in cabs, travel, lunches, projects or get-togethers over coffee, and not meeting behind closed doors.

Nearly two-thirds of men and women say people should take extra caution around members of the opposite sex at work, and about a quarter think private work meetings with colleagues of the opposite sex are inappropriate, according to a poll conducted in May by Morning Consult for The New York Times.

The effect on women’s careers is quantifiable, research has found.

Women with sponsors are more likely to get challenging assignments and raises and to say they are satisfied with their career progress, according to data from the Center for Talent Innovation. Yet 64 percent of senior men and 50 percent of junior women avoid solo interactions because of the risk of rumors about their motives, according to a survey by the center.

Good sponsors also give candid, difficult feedback, and women are less likely than men to receive it, McKinsey and Lean In found.

Megan Ketchum, 37, recently got a promotion to sales leader at LinkedIn. It’s a job that required new skills, and she said she got it largely based on the trust and friendship she’d built with leaders on her team, who were all men.

One of them regularly invited her to go for walks and grab coffee. “Trust does get built through intimacy and understanding others and sharing values,” she said. “That comes from interactions that are one-on-one, and not super formal in a conference room with an agenda.”

The dynamic affects racial and other minorities in the workplace, too. “Sponsorship is so often a mini-me — straight white guys sponsoring younger straight white guys,” Ms. Hewlett said. By getting to know people who are different from them, leaders can avoid playing favorites — which can happen if sponsorship isn’t done well and which can hurt office morale.

One way to encourage these relationships is to have more people at the top of companies who are not straight white men. In interviews, women in companies with many female or gay executives were more likely to say one-on-one relationships had never been an issue for them.

Another way is for companies to explicitly support relationship-building meetings. Some companies, for instance, have designated a certain restaurant where senior leaders take protégées for breakfast or lunch. “Once you see it happening out in public, then it becomes the norm,” said Laura Sherbin, director of research at the Center for Talent Innovation.

She added, “If you don’t want people to judge you when you go out with a senior leader, don’t be someone who judges another person.”

It helps when leaders talk about their families, introduce junior employees to their spouses or invite them to their homes, researchers said.

And would-be sponsors and would-be sponsorees can build relationships in daily moments in the office, said Lareina Yee, a senior partner at McKinsey who studied the issue with Lean In.

“It’s walking down the hallway, it’s seeking the opinion of others, it’s catching someone after a meeting,” she said. “It may be an unintentional blind spot, but it’s something you could start changing on a Monday morning.”",How Sexual Harassment Scandals Can Spook Men and Hurt Women,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/09/upshot/as-sexual-harassment-scandals-spook-men-it-can-backfire-for-women.html

The hospitals have been crippled by floods, damage and shortages of diesel. The governor said that 20 of the island’s hospitals are in working order.

Making matters worse, 911 still does not work, officials said.

“What do you think? There has to have been deaths,” said Dr. Rafael Rodríguez-Mercado, Puerto Rico’s health secretary. “I can’t give you a number, but we have to be conscious and realistic. To say no would be a lie.”

So far, seven regional hub hospitals are taking in patients. The island’s dialysis patients are also getting care. But none of it is easy. Hospitals should be required to have backup generators, diesel, a stockpile of medication and satellite phones, the doctor added. Even with those precautions, problems could arise. There is enough diesel on the island, but a shortage of gas tanker drivers — some cannot get to their jobs — and working gas stations. In Lares, the mayor, Roberto Pagan, said the municipal hospital almost had to close yesterday because it ran out of diesel fuel.

“We have been putting out fires,” Dr. Rodríguez-Mercado said. “The hospitals call you and say, ‘I have two hours of diesel left.’”

The potential for a public health crisis is a big concern, he said. Rats and decomposing animals can spread disease, the doctor added. Without running water, people are probably not washing their hands or boiling water often enough, or cooking their food well enough. This could lead to gastrointestinal outbreaks.

“What worries me is the sincere possibility of epidemics,” Dr. Rodríguez-Mercado added.

High mosquito counts on the island could also lead to a resurgence of mosquito-borne diseases, like Zika, dengue and chikungunya, doctors said.

A shortage of open pharmacies is another stressor, especially for the chronically ill and elderly residents. Most pharmacies in Puerto Rico remain closed, although they are slowly beginning to reopen. A CVS spokesman said that 21 out of 25 Puerto Rico-based CVS stores are now open, including 17 pharmacies. The first one reopened last Thursday. A Walgreens spokesman said about half of the island’s 120 stores are open and running on generators, but that hours vary. The stores are also receiving supplies of medication.

But many pharmacies in Puerto Rico are independently owned. With so many people pleading for medication, some pharmacists who know their clients are dispensing drugs without the required prescriptions or refill bottles.

Hospitals still have adequate supplies, and so do many of the open pharmacies, but there are concerns they may run out because suppliers are unable to get to them, said Dr. Victor M. Ramos Otero, the president of the College of Doctors and Surgeons of Puerto Rico.

Even when people find the drugs, they often cannot pay for them. Without electricity, A.T.M.s do not work and stores cannot accept credit cards or process insurance plans. That is what happened to José Castillo when he showed up at the Express Care Pharmacy in Santurce, a San Juan neighborhood, on Tuesday, hoping for a refill on the anti-depressants that help him sleep.

Pharmacy workers were outside, tending to customers on the sidewalk. The manager, Yanissa Serrano, told Mr. Castillo the pills cost 25 cents each — cash only.

“But I don’t have the money,” he said.

Her patience worn out, Ms. Serrano erupted.

“I would have been able to give you your medicine, but three times they robbed my generator. Three! Thanks to the fine people of this neighborhood,” she shouted. “I lost my house. I lost everything. I could be home tending to my apartment, but instead I’m here providing this service to the community, and this is how they repay me.”

Before Mr. Trump’s announcement, Representative Luis Gutierrez, Democrat of Illinois, said on the House floor that, “what I fear is that the federal government is not stepping up as fully and as quickly as we must.”

“This emergency cannot just be treated by Congress, the president, FEMA and the other agencies as just another storm,” he added.

But Mr. Trump defended the response by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Tuesday.

The speed limit, just 25 miles an hour, helps reduce the risk if something goes wrong. And because it is private property, the company does not have to share ride information with regulators and it can try new ideas without as much red tape.

Cars that can drive themselves could be a great benefit to older people. Residents at the Villages say that once people stop driving, they often pull back from activities and interacting with friends.

Ms. Jackson, who has lived here for three decades, was one of Voyage’s first test passengers. For now, the company is limiting rides in two driverless cars (with a third arriving in two weeks) to a busy, two-mile loop. A person stays in the driver’s seat in case something goes awry. And the plan is for any Village resident to be able to summon one of Voyage’s cars through a smartphone app for free door-to-door service.

Voyage’s introduction to the Villages comes as self-driving vehicles interact more and more with regular cars. Waymo, the driverless car unit of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, started a trial ride-hailing program in Phoenix this year with several hundred cars. The ride-hailing service Uber is also testing the technology in more than 200 cars with real passengers in Arizona and Pittsburgh.

Voyage was formed this year after spinning out of the online education start-up Udacity. How an online education start-up ended up operating an autonomous taxi service in a retirement community is an “only in Silicon Valley” story.

It started with a drive from nearby Mountain View to San Francisco. When Udacity started to offer a self-driving car curriculum, a team of employees created a challenge for themselves: Make a 32-mile drive on busy El Camino Real during rush hour and without human intervention.

After five months of failure, the team finally completed the route. Sensing an opportunity, Udacity executives spun out the self-driving car project into a new company. Voyage raised $5.6 million from investors.

The company had a major selling point: Udacity’s chairman, Sebastian Thrun, the founder of Google’s driverless car project and a pioneer in autonomous vehicle research, was joining Voyage as chairman. He pushed the idea of starting in a retirement community.

It was a good match. Last year, the Villages had conducted a survey about what amenities residents wanted to see over the next 15 years. Among the top answers: autonomous cars and a shuttle service.

Four years ago, the Villages considered a shuttle, but decided it was too costly to have a full-time driver. There is a service called the Villages Medical Auxiliary to take people to the doctor’s office or the supermarket, but there is a shortage of volunteer drivers and people need to make appointments two days in advance. It pushes residents to keep driving when they shouldn’t.

Ask almost anyone at the Villages and he or she can tell you about an accident: the driver who drove into a pond or the person who hit the accelerator instead of the brake and took out the tennis court fence.

“The driverless car would be far less risky than the drivers that we currently have,” said Bill Devincenzi, a former board president of the Villages whose term expired in June.

Another issue that could be solved by driverless cars is a shortage of parking spots. Like many of the Villages’ residents, Nancy Green, 88, is active. She swims three times a week, regularly attends wine-tasting dinners and participates in a weekly bridge game. But after three back operations, she struggles to walk long distances.

For popular events, she sometimes arrives an hour early to secure one of the few handicap spots. If none are available, she turns around and goes home. She said she did not like eating dinner at the clubhouse at 5:30 p.m., but the chances of finding a parking spot at her preferred time of 7 p.m. were “slim and none.”

“From that perspective, I think the self-driving car would be great,” she said.

But what seemed like a done deal hit a roadblock this year. The agreement to offer self-driving car rides in the retirement community almost fell apart when negotiations hit an impasse over insurance. California requires autonomous vehicles to have $5 million of coverage, but the Villages insisted on 50 percent more coverage because it is a private community with more liability risk.

“We’d call the Geicos and Progressives of the world and asked them, ‘Do you do self-driving car insurance?’” said Oliver Cameron, Voyage’s 29-year-old chief executive. “The answer was no.”

Working with an insurance broker, Voyage delved into “exotic insurance” policies and had to pay twice as much per car for its insurance policy versus the standard $5 million coverage.

The insurer, Munich Re, also had an unusual request. It wanted data — any data — produced by the cars. Because this is a new field, even insurers wanted to understand the potential risks of self-driving cars. Voyage agreed to hand over nonidentifiable, sensor data.

Another issue arose when Mr. Thrun had to leave the company because of a conflict of interest. He was also the chief executive of Kitty Hawk, a flying car start-up backed by Larry Page, chief executive of Alphabet, which owns Waymo.

Coupled with the fact that Voyage and not Udacity would be operating in the Villages, some in the community were concerned that they had fallen for a bait and switch.

To sweeten the deal for the Villages, Voyage offered them an equity stake — the equivalent of what it would grant a new hire.

For the last few months, Voyage has been testing at the Villages. The cars — nicknamed Homer and Marge after the characters on “The Simpsons” — have often prompted questions from curious onlookers in the Villages.

Are you from Google? (No.)

What’s that spinning top on the roof? (It’s a sensor that helps the car see the world around it.)

How do I invest? (Flattering, but we’re not taking new investors now.)

Then, there were the skeptics who questioned whether driverless cars were safer. Mr. Cameron said the residents’ concerns were a welcome reality check from the hype of Silicon Valley. “It’s preparing us for the sorts of questions many millions have on their mind when it comes to the technology,” he said.

Ms. Jackson, who still drives regularly and shuttles friends to church, activities and other community events, said she could not distinguish between human driver and machine during her ride.

In 2001, nearly four decades later, scientists scaled the rock, a third-of-a-mile-high, and discovered a small group of living tree lobsters dining on tea tree at night. It turned out they were not extinct.

But some scientists worried these tree lobsters might actually be a distinct species because they looked mysteriously different from the preserved Lord Howe tree lobsters. Their legs were skinnier with smaller spines and the little stubs sticking out from the abdomen called cerci were slightly off. They were darker. It wasn’t clear if they’d always been on Ball’s Pyramid or if birds, mistaking them for nesting material, carried them there. The two islands were never connected by land, and the insects couldn’t swim.

The researchers collected living specimens to create a new population of tree lobsters that could be reintroduced to the wild if the ones on Ball’s Pyramid ever disappeared. Now thousands of living descendants and eggs from the Ball’s Pyramid couple are held in zoos and museums around the world.

But more recently, Dr. Mikheyev and his colleagues managed to reveal that the genetic differences between Lorde Howe and Ball’s Pyramid insects were within the range of the same species. This meant that they had to make sense of stick bugs’ massive genome — about a quarter bigger than the human genome. They did this by comparing genetic samples from living Ball’s Pyramid tree lobsters with material extracted from Lord Howe specimens preserved in museums. Age, inbreeding, environment or diet might explain their new look.

The finding could make it possible to restore the insects to their former home on Lord Howe island.

But rats remain a problem on the island, where they have killed off five bird species and around a dozen invertebrates, and still threaten 70 other species.

Following years of research and debate, the Lord Howe Island Board decided in September to go ahead with a rat eradication program. Beginning in mid-2018, helicopters will drop cereal laced with rat poison onto the island.

If all goes to plan, threatened or endangered species like ground lizards, snails and the Little Mountain Palm could then recover on this World Heritage site.

The tree lobsters may be able to return, too. Confirming their identity was important because the consequences of introducing a new species mistaken for an old one to Lord Howe Island were unpredictable.

Return candidates must also be chosen. Would they come directly from Ball’s Pyramid, or their captive bred descendants? Ideally, the most genetically diverse tree lobsters have the best shot at recolonization. This means more genetic analysis.

This is a locked-in piece of music and script that I’m going to be performing pretty much the same on a nightly basis. It’s a solidified piece of work. And I think the intimacy of the venue is going to really affect it, to make it quite a bit different from the acoustic tours. Though I don’t know if I’d be doing this without the experience of doing them. When I recorded “Nebraska” back in the ’80s, I didn’t tour on it because I wasn’t sure if I could.

Are you using video?

Basically it’s a one-man show. There’s no production beyond the stage, some lights and some very high-quality sound. I thought anything beyond the song and the story ended up feeling too rigid and distracting. It happens every time we go to do a tour, you know?

You did a VH1 Storytellers with some extensive spoken interludes [in 2005].

That would be the closest thing to what I’m doing now. When I did the VH1 thing, Elvis Costello came up to me later and said, “Gee, it created some third entity.” And that’s what I’m interested in doing with the show. I’m playing familiar music, but I believe it will lead you to hear it with very fresh ears by the context that I set it in. I always make a comment that when things are working in art, one plus one equals three.

I think an audience always wants two things. They want to feel at home and they want to be surprised. And I go out every time to do those two things. I try to make people feel that they’ve come to some place that they’ve known for a long time, and then also try to surprise them with some new insights or new forms or new energy or just a new way of doing something. You’ve got to have that X factor. If you don’t have that, you’re dead in the water.

Do you go to Broadway shows?

We go on occasion. I saw “Hamilton.” I guess that was the last thing I’ve seen. It was great.

But you didn’t try to write a Broadway musical.

That’s tough! I salute the guys that have given that a shot. It’s not the same rules as pop music writing. It’s a completely different format, and I think it takes a set of completely different skills. It’s not like, oh, I’ll write 12 songs and kind of stick them together somehow. The guys I know who tried it really gave a good shot at it. My friend Sting, I thought, did a great job [with “The Last Ship”]. But it’s a different thing conceiving it from the beginning to the end. I admire all the Broadway writers, Sondheim, who have been able to do that so magnificently, but it’s not something I could ever do. It just seems too hard.

And then I’ve never really been good at, say, writing to script. In other words, “Now I need a song about [a certain subject].” I’ve never written like that. I’ve always written about what’s pressing itself upon me to write at a given moment. I’ve never sat back and said, well, I need a song about Trump, or I need a song about this happening or that happening. When I’ve crossed over with topical songwriting, even that was something that began as, you’re angry about something or you want to say something. That’s the feeling that comes up first.

With your book and with “Springsteen on Broadway,” you’re surveying your whole past. Are you also writing songs?

I’ve finished a record. I had some inspiration. When you’re locked into a period of creativity it’s very similar to being hungry all the time. You have an appetite to write. It’s one of the nicest feelings in the world for a songwriter because you know what it is to be without that appetite. Once you lock into that, then you’re feeding yourself. Everywhere you go you’re hungry. So I might come up with a verse sitting at the kitchen table, I might be asleep and wake up in the middle of the night and run upstairs to my writing room and come up with another verse or two. Literally I do it anywhere and everywhere and that’s a nice place to be. It doesn’t happen that often.

Writing the book must have made you think about your life story.

I really never had planned on writing anything. So when it came around, yeah, obviously, you draw a story from your story. I supposed you’re contextualizing your own life for yourself, and in the course of it you’re trying to have an honest hand.

It’s one of the things that I’m sort of glad it exists. Just for your kids — your kids really don’t know much about your life, you know? We had our kids late, I was 40 when our first son was born, and they showed a healthy disinterest in our work over all the years. They had their own musical heroes, they had their own music they were interested in. They’d be pretty blank-faced if someone mentioned a song title of mine, and I always looked upon that as that we did a good job. I know that none of my kids have read the book, though I imagine someday they will perhaps. I kind of like that. My job, it’s a strange job, it’s an eccentric line of work. And it’s not comparable to anything else and it can be difficult to be around it. As I say in the book, I know a lot of kids who wouldn’t mind seeing 50,000 people boo their parents. But I don’t know how many would want to see those people cheer their parents. It’s just not right (laughs).

The book explains that you’ve always been a musician. You never really had a 9-to-5 job. But “Springsteen on Broadway” is five nights a week for five months. It’s steady work.

That’s a real job. This is my first real job, I think (laughs). That’s the one thing I’m going into with a certain sense of faith. I go, well, I’m not using myself so totally physically on a nightly basis. And I’m not using my voice — you know, you’re not screaming. But the mental energy that it takes to do it is the same. People come to see you be completely, completely present. Any time you’re trying to do that, it takes a lot of energy.

You say the show and stories are locked in — won’t that become repetitive for you?

I’ve played “Born to Run,” many, many times. I’m sure if we went on the internet we could find out how many. (laughs) But the key is, you have to approach it not as a repetition but as a renewal. And to do that your spirit has got to be 100 percent present. But it’s a new audience every night. There’s new faces, there’s new opportunities. Those songs have been very good to me over the years, and in return I try to be good to them. So you have a chance of renewing the emotion and the spirit in that music on a nightly basis. That’s the place I work to get to every night when I’m onstage. I think that if the foundation of what you’ve built is built well, you’ll be able to inhabit it on a nightly basis and your audience will come in and it will feel like they’re seeing it for the first time.

“People from Paris come here to drink, which is weird,” said Michael Mortensen, who edits a wine magazine called Vang and is a sommelier at Kadeau on the tiny Baltic island of Bornholm, east of Copenhagen, as a bottle of Brut Nature Champagne from French winemaker Comte Hugues de la Bourdonnaye was uncorked. He came to the shop on his day off to chat with Mr. Danielsen, even bringing a bottle of his own to open.

Rødder & Vin, a bottle shop, doesn’t have a license to sell glasses of wine, though complimentary tastings usually take place there, attracting an array of influential people from the culinary world. On this day, visitors gathered at a round table tasting from several bottles, mostly French.

“I don’t like them because they are natural, but most of the wines I do like are natural,” said Mr. Danielsen as he emerged from the back with a half kilo of chicken liver mousse that he just happened to have.

“I like the balance between sweetness and bitterness, something you get from natural fermentations,” he said.

What I found over the next few days was that it is as easy, if not easier, to find natural wine in Copenhagen than conventional wines. Every top restaurant in town, from three-Michelin-star Geranium to Noma’s spinoff 108 to graffiti-covered Amass, had wine lists and pairings that were almost entirely natural. Plus, nearly every neighborhood has a great natural wine bar.

The highest concentration of natural wine is in Norrebro, the bohemian quarter where Noma alum Christian Puglisi opened the laid-back wine bar Manfreds in 2011, across from his Michelin-starred restaurant Relae.

It helped kick off the natural wine movement and remains popular with a long list of hard-to-find wines from cult vintners.

A few doors down is Terroiristen, a basement bar with high-top tables and maps of Italian wine regions on the wall. Most of the wines hailed from emerging regions of Slovenia, Austria and Italy. A few blocks away is Gaarden & Gaden, a neighborhood pub with natural wines from top names like Radikon and Olivier Cousin.

Den Vandrette, where the Nyhavn waterfront meets the footbridge to Christianshavn neighborhood, is partly owned by Sune Rosforth, the importer whose Rosforth & Rosforth canal-side wine shop has been integral to introducing Copenhagen to natural wine since opening in 1994.

“He’s the closest thing you will get to a rock star importer, if such a thing exists,” Mr. Danielsen told me. Mr. Rosforth launched Den Vandrette in 2013 in the basement of a historic building to showcase the mostly French and Italian wines.

On a quiet corner near Christiansborg Palace, Ved Stranden 10, feels like your Danish friend’s living room with mismatched midcentury furniture and stacks of books about Burgundy. There’s no formal wine list, though there are constant rotations of 10 to 15 wines by the glass.

On a summer afternoon, I told the waiter that I was in the mood for something to go with the warm weather and she returned with two bottles, a French L’Anglore Sels d’argent and another from Austrian producer Meinklang made from the obscure varietal Juhfark, of which only about 10 gallons were produced.

As she notes in her book, Mr. Ailes told her at the beginning of her career “to not try so hard to be perfect” and to show “who I really am.” Who she really was turned out to be smart, aggressive and impossibly quick. A former lawyer, she developed an adversarial approach that made her something of an anomaly among talk show hosts: Whether she was sparring with Anthony Weiner over President Barack Obama’s tax policy or with Donna Brazile over the Democratic National Committee’s hacked emails, Megyn Kelly was not there to make friends.

With time, in fact, she assumed a style that had hitherto been the exclusive province of men: a charisma that comes from dispensing with the need to be liked. And in featuring her, Fox News was doing more to break female stereotypes than any of the more mainstream networks.

It’s true that Ms. Kelly developed her signature style while perfectly coifed, with obligatory blond streaks. And it’s true that she developed her brand of magnetic unlikability while outfitted in Fox’s ubiquitous jewel-toned dresses, her legs exposed beneath the obligatory glass table. But Megyn Kelly’s power came not from her beauty but from her sharp-wittedness, her familiarity with the issues, and her willingness to ask tough questions and demand answers — the same traits that were on full display in the infamous Republican debate when she took on Candidate Trump.

She certainly had viewpoints that liberals found unsavory. There was the time she insisted to all the children watching that Santa Claus is white. She also seems to be in the All Lives Matter, “what about black-on-black crime?” corner. But over the years she also became increasingly interested in women’s issues, and remained utterly unflappable in the face of Republican male hysteria, as when she told Newt Gingrich to work on his anger issues.

Watching Ms. Kelly make minced meat of men and insist on her right to eschew likability, I — a liberal — admired her. I often found myself thinking that if she could do this kind of work from behind that glass Fox News desk, imagine what she could do if she were freed from it. When she left Fox News for NBC and a reported $23 million yearly contract, it looked as if I was going to get my wish.

Oh, the irony.

Instead of unleashing her, NBC has attempted to transform Megyn Kelly into one of the nice girls of mainstream media, another Kelly Ripa, Savannah Guthrie or Katie Couric. The results have been predictably awkward. The glee at her stumble has been swift and vicious.

Why was Megyn Kelly’s transition into the mainstream accompanied by this kind of neutering? Why did Fox News have more room for this charismatic, difficult woman than NBC? It’s hard to say. Mainstream talk shows — morning shows in particular — have never had much of an appetite for difficult. And at a time when our country is so divided, it was always likely that a network like NBC would try to cast as broad a net as possible, meaning that politics would be off the table for someone like Ms. Kelly.

Whatever the reason, however, her descent into banal harmlessness operates as a cautionary tale to all women: You will have to be likable if you want to go mainstream.

Mr. Obama, who has been doing quite well financially since leaving the White House, has not yet written a check, but the president of Occidental, Jonathan Veitch, said the former president was high on his list of asks.

“I am going all over the world asking people for money,” he said. “Why wouldn’t I ask him?”

“There are not many liberal arts colleges that educate a president,” Mr. Veitch said. “We are very proud of the fact and very proud of him. We thought this would be a great way to honor him and have our students emulate the values he represents.”

Mastodons, rhinoceroses and saber-toothed cats once roamed Southern California.

We know because of the bones and footprints they left behind in places like Rainbow Basin, in the Calico Mountains just north of Barstow.

Administered by the Bureau of Land Management, the area owes its name to the pink, green, orange and brown sediments that form the basin’s walls.

Over eons, tectonic forces and erosion have lifted the rock and exposed zigzagging strata, made colorful by differing stages of iron oxidation.

It’s a mecca for geologists.

“It’s quite spectacular,” said Robert Hilburn, a Barstow paleontologist. “People come from all over the United States and sometimes all over the world.”

Rainbow Basin was once a lush marshland populated by a unique array of prehistoric animals whose fossils remain scattered across what is now a parched desert.

“Everything that you have on the African savanna today, they had here — except one,” said Mr. Hilburn, who is also vice president of the Mojave River Valley Museum.

Which one? “No man,” he said.

Rainbow Basin is accessible to visitors at the end of a long dirt road. You can walk miles of trails or stay at nearby campsite.

After reaching a settlement with Mr. Weinstein, Ms. O’Connor withdrew her complaint and thanked him for the career opportunity he had given her.
“You constantly question yourself — am I the one who is the problem?”“I don’t know anything about that,” Mr. Weinstein said.
When several board members pressed Mr. Weinstein about it, he insisted that the woman had set him up, colleagues recalled.
She also wrote a letter to Mr. Weinstein thanking him for the opportunity to learn about the entertainment industry.","An investigation by The New York Times found previously undisclosed allegations against Mr. Weinstein stretching over nearly three decades, documented through interviews with current and former employees and film industry workers, as well as legal records, emails and internal documents from the businesses he has run, Miramax and the Weinstein Company.

During that time, after being confronted with allegations including sexual harassment and unwanted physical contact, Mr. Weinstein has reached at least eight settlements with women, according to two company officials speaking on the condition of anonymity. Among the recipients, The Times found, were a young assistant in New York in 1990, an actress in 1997, an assistant in London in 1998, an Italian model in 2015 and Ms. O’Connor shortly after, according to records and those familiar with the agreements.

In a statement to The Times on Thursday afternoon, Mr. Weinstein said: “I appreciate the way I’ve behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologize for it. Though I’m trying to do better, I know I have a long way to go.”

He added that he was working with therapists and planning to take a leave of absence to “deal with this issue head on.”

I am a 28 year old woman trying to make a living and a career. Harvey Weinstein is a 64 year old, world famous man and this is his company. The balance of power is me: 0, Harvey Weinstein: 10.  From Lauren O’Connor‘s memo

Lisa Bloom, a lawyer advising Mr. Weinstein, said in a statement that “he denies many of the accusations as patently false.” In comments to The Times earlier this week, Mr. Weinstein said that many claims in Ms. O’Connor’s memo were “off base” and that they had parted on good terms.

He and his representatives declined to comment on any of the settlements, including providing information about who paid them. But Mr. Weinstein said that in addressing employee concerns about workplace issues, “my motto is to keep the peace.”

Ms. Bloom, who has been advising Mr. Weinstein over the last year on gender and power dynamics, called him “an old dinosaur learning new ways.” She said she had “explained to him that due to the power difference between a major studio head like him and most others in the industry, whatever his motives, some of his words and behaviors can be perceived as inappropriate, even intimidating.”

Though Ms. O’Connor had been writing only about a two-year period, her memo echoed other women’s complaints. Mr. Weinstein required her to have casting discussions with aspiring actresses after they had private appointments in his hotel room, she said, her description matching those of other former employees. She suspected that she and other female Weinstein employees, she wrote, were being used to facilitate liaisons with “vulnerable women who hope he will get them work.”

The allegations piled up even as Mr. Weinstein helped define popular culture. He has collected six best-picture Oscars and turned out a number of touchstones, from the films “Sex, Lies, and Videotape,” “Pulp Fiction” and “Good Will Hunting” to the television show “Project Runway.” In public, he presents himself as a liberal lion, a champion of women and a winner of not just artistic but humanitarian awards.

In 2015, the year Ms. O’Connor wrote her memo, his company distributed “The Hunting Ground,” a documentary about campus sexual assault. A longtime Democratic donor, he hosted a fund-raiser for Hillary Clinton in his Manhattan home last year. He employed Malia Obama, the oldest daughter of former President Barack Obama, as an intern this year, and recently helped endow a faculty chair at Rutgers University in Gloria Steinem’s name. During the Sundance Film Festival in January, when Park City, Utah, held its version of nationwide women’s marches, Mr. Weinstein joined the parade.

“From the outside, it seemed golden — the Oscars, the success, the remarkable cultural impact,” said Mark Gill, former president of Miramax Los Angeles when the company was owned by Disney. “But behind the scenes, it was a mess, and this was the biggest mess of all,” he added, referring to Mr. Weinstein’s treatment of women.

Dozens of Mr. Weinstein’s former and current employees, from assistants to top executives, said they knew of inappropriate conduct while they worked for him. Only a handful said they ever confronted him.

Mr. Weinstein enforced a code of silence; employees of the Weinstein Company have contracts saying they will not criticize it or its leaders in a way that could harm its “business reputation” or “any employee’s personal reputation,” a recent document shows. And most of the women accepting payouts agreed to confidentiality clauses prohibiting them from speaking about the deals or the events that led to them.

Charles Harder, a lawyer representing Mr. Weinstein, said it was not unusual to enter into settlements to avoid lengthy and costly litigation. He added, “It’s not evidence of anything.”

I am a professional and have tried to be professional. I am not treated that way however. I am sexualized and diminished.  From Lauren O’Connor‘s memo

At Fox News, where the conservative icons Roger E. Ailes and Bill O’Reilly were accused of harassment, women have received payouts well into the millions of dollars. But most of the women involved in the Weinstein agreements collected between roughly $80,000 and $150,000, according to people familiar with the negotiations.

In the wake of Ms. O’Connor’s 2015 memo, some Weinstein Company board members and executives, including Mr. Weinstein’s brother and longtime partner, Bob, 62, were alarmed about the allegations, according to several people who spoke on the condition of anonymity. In the end, though, board members were assured there was no need to investigate. After reaching a settlement with Mr. Weinstein, Ms. O’Connor withdrew her complaint and thanked him for the career opportunity he had given her.

“The parties made peace very quickly,” Ms. Bloom said.

Through her lawyer, Nicole Page, Ms. O’Connor declined to be interviewed. In the memo, she explained how unnerved she was by what she witnessed or encountered while a literary scout and production executive at the company. “I am just starting out in my career, and have been and remain fearful about speaking up,” Ms. O’Connor wrote. “But remaining silent is causing me great distress.”

In speaking out about her hotel episode, Ms. Judd said in a recent interview, “Women have been talking about Harvey amongst ourselves for a long time, and it’s simply beyond time to have the conversation publicly.”

A Common Narrative

Ms. Nestor, a law and business school student, accepted Mr. Weinstein’s breakfast invitation at the Peninsula because she did not want to miss an opportunity, she later told colleagues. After she arrived, he offered to help her career while boasting about a series of famous actresses he claimed to have slept with, according to accounts that colleagues compiled after hearing her story and then sent on to company executives.

“She said he was very persistent and focused though she kept saying no for over an hour,” one internal document said. Ms. Nestor, who declined to comment for this article, refused his bargain, the records noted. “She was disappointed that he met with her and did not seem to be interested in her résumé or skill set.” The young woman chose not to report the episode to human resources personnel, but the allegations came to management’s attention through other employees.

Across the years and continents, accounts of Mr. Weinstein’s conduct share a common narrative: Women reported to a hotel for what they thought were work reasons, only to discover that Mr. Weinstein, who has been married for most of three decades, sometimes seemed to have different interests. His home base was New York, but his rolling headquarters were luxury hotels: the Peninsula Beverly Hills and the Savoy in London, the Hôtel du Cap-Eden-Roc near the Cannes Film Festival in France and the Stein Eriksen Lodge near the Sundance Film Festival.

Working for Mr. Weinstein could mean getting him out of bed in the morning and doing “turndown duty” late at night, preparing him for sleep. Like the colleague cited in Ms. O’Connor’s memo, some junior employees required to perform those tasks said they were disturbing.

In interviews, eight women described varying behavior by Mr. Weinstein: appearing nearly or fully naked in front of them, requiring them to be present while he bathed or repeatedly asking for a massage or initiating one himself. The women, typically in their early or middle 20s and hoping to get a toehold in the film industry, said he could switch course quickly — meetings and clipboards one moment, intimate comments the next. One woman advised a peer to wear a parka when summoned for duty as a layer of protection against unwelcome advances.

Laura Madden, a former employee who said Mr. Weinstein prodded her for massages at hotels in Dublin and London beginning in 1991, said he had a way of making anyone who objected feel like an outlier. “It was so manipulative,” she said in an interview. “You constantly question yourself — am I the one who is the problem?”

“I don’t know anything about that,” Mr. Weinstein said.

Most women who told The Times that they experienced misconduct by Mr. Weinstein had never met one another. They range in age from early 20s to late 40s and live in different cities. Some said they did not report the behavior because there were no witnesses and they feared retaliation by Mr. Weinstein. Others said they felt embarrassed. But most confided in co-workers.

Ms. Madden later told Karen Katz, a friend and colleague in the acquisitions department, about Mr. Weinstein’s overtures, including a time she locked herself in the bathroom of his hotel room, sobbing. “We were so young at the time,” said Ms. Katz, now a documentary filmmaker. “We did not understand how wrong it was or how Laura should deal with it.”

Others in the London office said the same. “I was pretty disturbed and angry,” said Sallie Hodges, another former employee, recalling the accounts she heard from colleagues. “That’s kind of the way things were.”

The human resources operation was considered weak in New York and worse in London, so some employees banded together in solidarity. “If a female executive was asked to go to a meeting solo, she and a colleague would generally double up” so as not to be alone with Mr. Weinstein, recalled Mr. Gill, the former president of Miramax Los Angeles.

Many women who worked with Mr. Weinstein said they never experienced sexual harassment or knew of anyone who did, and recalled him as a boss who gave them valuable opportunities at young ages. Some described long and satisfying careers with him, praising him as a mentor and advocate.

But in interviews, some of the former employees who said they had troubling experiences with Mr. Weinstein asked a common question: How could allegations repeating the same pattern — young women, a powerful male producer, even some of the same hotels — have accumulated for almost three decades?

“It wasn’t a secret to the inner circle,” said Kathy DeClesis, Bob Weinstein’s assistant in the early 1990s. She supervised a young woman who left the company abruptly after an encounter with Harvey Weinstein and who later received a settlement, according to several former employees.

Speaking up could have been costly. A job with Mr. Weinstein was a privileged perch at the nexus of money, fame and art, and plenty of his former assistants have risen high in Hollywood. He could be charming and generous: gift baskets, flowers, personal or career help and cash. At the Cannes Film Festival, according to several former colleagues, he sometimes handed out thousands of dollars as impromptu bonuses.

Mr. Weinstein was a volcanic personality, though, given to fits of rage and personal lashings of male and female employees alike. When a female guest of his had to wait for a hotel room upgrade, he yelled that Ms. O’Connor would be better off marrying a “fat, rich Jewish” man because she was probably just good for “being a wife” and “making babies,” she wrote in her memo. (He added some expletives, she said.) His treatment of women was sometimes written off as just another form of toxicity, according to multiple former employees.

In the fall of 1998, a 25-year-old London assistant named Zelda Perkins confronted Mr. Weinstein. According to former colleagues, she and several co-workers had been regularly subjected to inappropriate requests or comments in hotel rooms, and she was particularly concerned about the treatment of another woman in the office. She told Mr. Weinstein that he had to stop, according to the former colleagues, and that she would go public or initiate legal action unless he changed his behavior.

Steve Hutensky, one of Miramax’s entertainment lawyers, was dispatched to London to negotiate a settlement with Ms. Perkins and her lawyer. He declined to comment for this article.

Ms. Perkins, now a theater producer in London, also declined to comment for this article, saying that she could not discuss her work at Miramax or whether she had entered into any agreements.

Months after the settlement, Mr. Weinstein triumphed at the Oscars, with “Life Is Beautiful” and “Shakespeare in Love” winning 10 awards. A few years later, Mr. Weinstein, who had produced a series of British-themed movies, was made a Commander of the British Empire, an honorary title just short of knighthood.

‘Coercive Bargaining’

For actors, a meeting with Mr. Weinstein could yield dazzling rewards: scripts, parts, award campaigns, magazine coverage, influence on lucrative endorsement deals. He knew how to blast small films to box office success, and deliver polished dramas like “The King’s Speech” and popular attractions like the “Scary Movie” franchise. Mr. Weinstein’s films helped define femininity, sex and romance, from Catherine Zeta-Jones in “Chicago” to Jennifer Lawrence in “Silver Linings Playbook.”

But movies were also his private leverage. When Mr. Weinstein invited Ms. Judd to breakfast in Beverly Hills, she had been shooting the thriller “Kiss the Girls” all night, but the meeting seemed too important to miss. After arriving at the hotel lobby, she was surprised to learn that they would be talking in his suite; she decided to order cereal, she said, so the food would come quickly and she could leave.

Mr. Weinstein soon issued invitation after invitation, she said. Could he give her a massage? When she refused, he suggested a shoulder rub. She rejected that too, she recalled. He steered her toward a closet, asking her to help pick out his clothing for the day, and then toward the bathroom. Would she watch him take a shower? she remembered him saying.

“I said no, a lot of ways, a lot of times, and he always came back at me with some new ask,” Ms. Judd said. “It was all this bargaining, this coercive bargaining.”

To get out of the room, she said, she quipped that if Mr. Weinstein wanted to touch her, she would first have to win an Oscar in one of his movies. She recalled feeling “panicky, trapped,” she said in the interview. “There’s a lot on the line, the cachet that came with Miramax.”

Not long afterward, she related what had happened to her mother, the singer Naomi Judd, who confirmed their conversation to a Times reporter. Years later, Ashley Judd appeared in two Weinstein films without incident, she said. In 2015, she shared an account of the episode in the hotel room with “Variety” without naming the man involved.

In 1997, Mr. Weinstein reached a previously undisclosed settlement with Rose McGowan, then a 23-year-old-actress, after an episode in a hotel room during the Sundance Film Festival. The $100,000 settlement was “not to be construed as an admission” by Mr. Weinstein, but intended to “avoid litigation and buy peace,” according to the legal document, which was reviewed by The Times. Ms. McGowan had just appeared in the slasher film “Scream” and would later star in the television show “Charmed.” She declined to comment.

Increased Scrutiny

Just months before Ms. O’Connor wrote her memo, a young female employee quit after complaining of being forced to arrange what she believed to be assignations for Mr. Weinstein, according to two people familiar with her departure. The woman, who asked not to be identified to protect her privacy, said a nondisclosure agreement prevented her from commenting.

Soon, complaints about Mr. Weinstein’s behavior prompted the board of his company to take notice.

In March 2015, Mr. Weinstein had invited Ambra Battilana, an Italian model and aspiring actress, to his TriBeCa office on a Friday evening to discuss her career. Within hours, she called the police. Ms. Battilana told them that Mr. Weinstein had grabbed her breasts after asking if they were real and put his hands up her skirt, the police report says.

The claims were taken up by the New York Police Department’s Special Victims Squad and splashed across the pages of tabloids, along with reports that the woman had worked with investigators to secretly record a confession from Mr. Weinstein. The Manhattan district attorney’s office later declined to bring charges.

But Mr. Weinstein made a payment to Ms. Battilana, according to people familiar with the settlement, speaking on the condition of anonymity about the confidential agreement.

The public nature of the episode concerned some executives and board members of the Weinstein Company. (Harvey and Bob Weinstein together own 42 percent of the privately held business.) When several board members pressed Mr. Weinstein about it, he insisted that the woman had set him up, colleagues recalled.

Ms. Battilana had testified in court proceedings against associates of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy who are accused of procuring women for alleged sex parties, and the Italian news media also reported that, years ago, Ms. Battilana accused a septuagenarian boyfriend of sexual harassment, a complaint that was apparently dismissed. Ms. Battilana did not respond to requests for comment. Her lawyer, Mauro Rufini, could not be reached for comment.

After the episode, Lance Maerov, a board member, said he successfully pushed for a code of behavior for the company that included detailed language about sexual harassment.

Then Ms. O’Connor’s memo hit, with page after page of detailed accusations. In describing the experiences of women at the company, including her own, she wrote, “The balance of power is me: 0, Harvey Weinstein: 10.”

She was a valued employee — Mr. Weinstein described her as “fantastic,” “a great person,” “a brilliant executive” — so the complaint rattled top executives, including Bob Weinstein. When the board was notified of it by email, Mr. Maerov insisted that an outside lawyer determine whether the allegations were true, he said in an interview.

But the inquiry never happened. Mr. Weinstein had reached a settlement with Ms. O’Connor, and there was no longer anything to investigate.

“Because this matter has been resolved and no further action is required, I withdraw my complaint,” Ms. O’Connor wrote in an email to the head of human resources six days after sending her memo. She also wrote a letter to Mr. Weinstein thanking him for the opportunity to learn about the entertainment industry.",Harvey Weinstein Paid Off Sexual Harassment Accusers for Decades,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/harvey-weinstein-harassment-allegations.html

Mr. Pence framed the issue as one of patriotism and respect.","While politicians from both parties concoct situations for political gain, some criticized Mr. Pence’s walkout as transparently premeditated. The vice president did not take a pool reporter traveling with him into the stadium; a member of Mr. Pence’s staff told the reporter, Vaughn Hillyard, that the vice president might be leaving the game early.

“Manipulation of faux patriotism took new turn today with VP Pence. Preplanned early exit from Colts game after 49ers kneeled, then tweets,” Norman Ornstein, a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, wrote on Twitter.

Others pointed out the expense involved: Mr. Pence flew to Indianapolis from Las Vegas, where he had attended a memorial service for victims of last Sunday’s mass shooting, and was immediately flying back to Los Angeles.

“After all the scandals involving unnecessarily expensive travel by cabinet secretaries, how much taxpayer money was wasted on this stunt?” Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, said in a tweet.

There was little doubt, given the presence of the 49ers, that Mr. Pence would be given an opportunity to make his political statement. The former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick began the dispute over the national anthem last year by taking a knee to highlight the plight of black Americans, particularly the killing of black men by police officers.

Mr. Kaepernick left the 49ers in March and has not been signed by any other team — a situation seen by many as a blacklisting by other team owners. But other 49ers have continued the protest in a show of solidarity with their former teammate.

Last month, Mr. Trump seized on the dispute over Mr. Kaepernick, declaring at a rally in Alabama that any “son of a bitch” who refused to stand for the anthem should be “fired.” His comments led hundreds of players to protest during the anthem, though last weekend the furor appeared to be subsiding a bit.

The White House seemed determined to whip it up again. In addition to Mr. Pence’s statement and tweets, the press office released a photo of Mr. Pence in a suit, standing with his hand over his heart for the playing of “The Star-Spangled Banner” at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis. He was standing next to Maj. Gen. Courtney P. Carr, a veteran of the Iraq war who now serves as adjutant general of the Indiana National Guard.

An earlier tweet by the vice president, in which he said that he and his wife, Karen Pence, were looking forward to the game, showed him wearing a Colts cap and casual clothing. He said he was there to honor Peyton Manning, the longtime Colts quarterback whose statue was unveiled in Indianapolis this weekend, and who was set to have his number retired into the team’s ring of honor at halftime.

The vice president’s office later said that the photo had actually been taken in 2014, when Mr. Pence was governor of Indiana.

In the West Wing, officials privately said they believed that Mr. Pence had sought the controversy, which is a favorite of the president’s and which he had voiced his approval of. It came less than two weeks after Mr. Pence’s chief of staff, Nick Ayers, told a group of Republican donors that there might need to be a “purge” of the party if people did not get behind the president.

Two weeks ago, Mr. Trump had called for fans to walk out of stadiums if players knelt. So Mr. Pence was doing what Mr. Trump had called for, though few fans seem to have followed his call.

Mr. Pence has found himself on the other side of this kind of protest. Shortly after the election, he attended a Broadway performance of “Hamilton,” the hit musical about the founding fathers, and received a polite lecture from a member of the cast, after the curtain call, on the need for the Trump administration to work on behalf of all Americans.

“We truly hope that this show has inspired you to uphold our American values,” Brandon Victor Dixon, the actor playing Vice President Aaron Burr, said from the stage.

Mr. Pence seemed unperturbed, but Mr. Trump reacted angrily, saying the cast had “harassed” the vice president-elect and owed him an apology.

In the weeks since Mr. Trump complained about players kneeling during the anthem, most have returned to standing, though some continue to kneel, particularly on the 49ers. While the 49ers knelt, the Colts locked arms as a team on Sunday.

In Detroit, the Lions stood arm in arm, including two players who had knelt the past two weeks. In New Jersey, the Giants defensive end Olivier Vernon, who was in street clothes, knelt while the rest of his team linked arms.

In Miami, three members of the Dolphins — Kenny Stills, Julius Thomas and Mike Thomas — stayed in the locker room while the rest of their team stood on the sideline during the anthem.

The Dolphins’ owner, Stephen M. Ross, who has backed the players’ right to protest, appeared to be changing his stance. He told The Miami Herald that while many players insisted that their protests were about raising awareness of social injustice, the president had “changed that whole paradigm of what protest is” by turning it into a proxy for respect for the flag and support of the military.

Mr. Kaepernick, meanwhile, has been working out privately in New Jersey in hopes of finding a team willing to take a chance on him, according to a CBS report.

Mr. Pence framed the issue as one of patriotism and respect.

“At a time when so many Americans are inspiring our nation with their courage, resolve and resilience, now, more than ever, we should rally around our flag and everything that unites us,” he said in a statement. “While everyone is entitled to their own opinions, I don’t think it’s too much to ask N.F.L. players to respect the flag and our national anthem.”",Trump Tells Pence to Leave N.F.L.

Not everyone has developed a sudden case of laryngitis.

“It took enormous courage for these women to come forward, and I applaud them,” Amy Pascal, a producer and former studio chief, said in an interview. She was speaking of actresses like Ashley Judd, who told The Times that she had been sexually harassed by Mr. Weinstein. The actor Seth Rogen wrote on Twitter on Saturday, after a lawyer advising Mr. Weinstein resigned, “I believe all the women coming forward about Harvey Weinstein’s sexual harassment. It takes bravery to do so.”

But bold condemnation of Mr. Weinstein remained sparse on Sunday, especially by celebrities, many of whom seized on social media to harshly criticize President Trump for the “Access Hollywood” tape, made public a year ago this weekend, in which he boasted about kissing and grabbing women. Hollywood also denounced Roger Ailes, the former Fox News chief, and Bill O’Reilly, the former Fox News host, when women came forward with sexual harassment accusations against them. “Fox watchers turn a blind eye to predators; no morality at all,” Bette Midler wrote on Twitter at the time, with celebrities like Rosie O’Donnell, Chelsea Handler and Cher also offering biting rebukes.

(Mr. Trump dismissed his comments as “locker room talk,” and Mr. Ailes and Mr. O’Reilly denied the accusations against them.)

Many people online have noticed, in particular, conservatives.

“Thoughts on Harvey Weinstein?” Donald Trump Jr., the eldest son of President Trump, asked Jimmy Kimmel on Twitter on Saturday. Mr. Kimmel, who has become an outspoken critic of the administration and, like most of his fellow late-night talk show hosts, had not yet said anything on the air about Mr. Weinstein, responded, “It’s disgusting.”

That led some fans to thank him. “Jimmy Kimmel and Seth Rogen thank you for addressing the Harvey Weinstein situation,” wrote a Twitter user named Margaret. “Silence from most celebrities is gross.”

While the volcanic Mr. Weinstein is reviled — privately — by wide swaths of the entertainment industry, he also has a lot of friends. One producer who has worked repeatedly with Mr. Weinstein said that he wasn’t speaking out because “I happen to think the world of the guy.”

Mr. Weinstein made a lot of careers, starting at Miramax in the 1990s and then at the Weinstein Company, which was founded in 2005. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck might not be stars without “Good Will Hunting,” released by Miramax in 1997. Quentin Tarantino can credit Mr. Weinstein with getting “Pulp Fiction” and “Kill Bill” into theaters. Gwyneth Paltrow thanked Mr. Weinstein and Miramax for “their undying support of me,” when she accepted the best actress trophy for “Shakespeare in Love” at the 1999 Academy Awards.

But silence works both ways, Ms. Eller pointed out. “It’s striking that nobody has come to Harvey’s defense, either,” she said.

Especially considering that Mr. Weinstein has tried to rally support. According to two people briefed on the matter, who naturally spoke on the condition of anonymity, he reached out to top agents at William Morris Endeavor and Creative Artists Agency and asked them to sign a letter of support and release it publicly.

“There’s a multiplicity of voices that came together to shape the perception of Canada that The New York Times then shared with its readers,” she said.","“We worry when you look hard at us, but we are also touchy about being overlooked,” then-Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson of Canada told a group of American students in 1963. The quote, reprinted in the June 10th issue of The New York Times of that year, still rings true today, especially as a Canadian like myself goes through thousands of images of Canada from the newspaper’s archives.

Earlier this year, the Ryerson Image Center in Toronto received a donation of 24,804 images from a collector, Chris Bratty, who had purchased the collection with the intention of donating it. Selected by a team led by two gallerists, Steven Kasher and Stephen Bulger, the pictures range from World War I to the late 1990s, from hockey players to lumberjacks. A selection is currently on view in an exhibition at the center and in a book, both entitled “The Faraway Nearby.”

“When I heard of the collection, I immediately wanted to acquire it,” said Paul Roth, an American who is the center’s director. “For all the strengths of our holdings — including the Black Star and the Berenice Abbott archives — we don’t have a tremendous amount of Canadian photojournalism. This helps us fill that gap. And, since it comes from a major U.S. newspaper, it brings up the question of how one country covers another, which fits within our mandate of interrogating different aspects of the medium.”

The expected tropes are there: Canada as a winter wonderland; as a safe, polite neighbor who reveres hockey. But there are also images that challenge them: Canada the diplomat having lighthearted meetings with America’s foes. In one photo, Nikita S. Khrushchev laughs at a joke told by Mr. Pearson — the opposite of the famous “Kitchen Debate” moment by Elliott Erwitt, in which then-Vice President Richard Nixon castigates the Soviet leader. In another, Fidel Castro holds Prime Minister Pierre-Elliott Trudeau’s youngest son, Michel Charles-Émile, during a four-day state visit. Or, Canada the troubled young nation deploying the Army to confront Quebec’s sometimes-violent calls for independence.

“The type of coverage we see speaks of a dual fascination between how familiar Canada feels, and yet how unfamiliar it sometimes appears,” Mr. Roth surmised. “I suspect that The New York Times had to ponder how to cover a country that was so close. Should they concentrate on the differences or highlight the similarities? When stories involved people or goods crossing the border, which was often the case, were they to be considered national or international news?”

Besides snow and hockey, evidence of Canada’s subordination to the British monarchy seemed of particular interest. The New York Times dedicated space daily to Princess Elizabeth’s first tour of Canada in 1951 (Slide 9) and continued to chronicle the royal family’s subsequent visits.

Mr. Trudeau also drew a lot of attention, more than any of his predecessors and successors, that is, until his son Justin ran for the same office and won in 2015. A reproduction of a spread published during the 1972 election is revealing. Within “The World” section, the article isn’t under a rubric with the country’s name, as is customary, but simply “Trudeau,” and a headline declaring “A Swinger Shows His Sober Side.” A full column is dedicated to a collage of images showing the candidate dancing, riding a motorcycle, playing hockey and pedaling a unicycle before concluding with a somber close-up portrait.

Mounting the exhibition, Denise Birkhofer — an American who recently settled in Toronto and co-curated the show with Gerald McMaster, an Indigenous Canadian of Plains Cree and Blackfoot descent — pondered how The New York Times’s fondness for certain subjects and visual archetypes might have shaped a national identity. That’s hard to answer, partly because of the variety of photographers who contributed to the paper’s Canadian coverage.

“There’s a multiplicity of voices that came together to shape the perception of Canada that The New York Times then shared with its readers,” she said. “Not all were Americans. Sometimes staff photographers were sent to cover a story, but other times it came from local publications or freelancers. There were also images made by Canadian agencies or corporations, such as the National Film Board and the Canadian Pacific Railway.”

Photo

Most surprisingly, during World War I, the images the paper used to showcase Canada’s participation in the war effort were supplied by Canadian entities, whose work had to be vetted by the nation’s official censors. Its goal was to avoid criticism of military endeavors by showing the conflict in a romanticized light. In other words, said Gaëlle Morel, the Ryerson Image Center exhibitions curator, “The New York Times — a private commercial enterprise — obeyed the censorship requirements of a foreign country.” In other words, the country’s image, as seen in The Times, reflected an official, sanitized perspective.

Mr. Roth said the collection has greater meaning given Canada’s sesquicentennial this year. “More than a time for celebration and patriotism, it is an occasion to think about complicated questions relating to the identity of the nation,” he said. “All countries should be interested in how they’re viewed by other states. We should strive to get past the mythologies that are created to promote tourism or to reinforce patriotic values, especially nowadays. Doing so requires unpacking widely held cultural assumptions. And that’s exactly what we can do thanks to this archive. While it doesn’t tell a single story, it does help us understand what the Canadian mythologies are.”

“The Metro is like the subway in New York,” Mr. Guilbert said.","Andre Martin and Renaud Wald made off with the paintings from the Louvre without triggering the dreaded “red procedure.” That’s the high-tech system that automatically seals exits and locks doors throughout the vast museum within two minutes of a security breach. The duo then carried the artworks to a nearby Metro station and casually boarded a train.

Just two cool customers who just pulled off the most brazen daylight art heist ever captured on film?

Non. The two are Louvre copyists, upholders of what Ivan Guilbert, a Parisian photojournalist, calls “a beautiful tradition” that dates to the French Revolution. In November 1793, one month after Marie Antoinette was beheaded, the revolutionary national assembly declared the Louvre Palace, Louis XIV’s former residence on the Right Bank of the Seine, open to the public. All citizens were welcomed to enjoy the national art treasures stored there, previously for the pleasure of the golden carriage set only.

Called the Central Museum of the Arts of the Republic, the people’s musée took the democratic ideal a step further. Any professional, amateur or aspiring painter was invited to enter the museum, set up an easel — provided free of charge to this day — and have a go at copying a masterpiece.

Thousands have since followed suit. Among them are such art history boldfaced names as Paul Cézanne, Edgar Degas, Marc Chagall, Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dalí. The goal for them, and the present-day copyists whom Mr. Guilbert photographed for Le Parisien Magazine, is to learn the secrets of color, technique and composition by copying the works of some of the greatest artists of all time. “It’s like a free school,” says Mr. Guilbert.

Photo

“You have to copy and recopy the masters,” Degas once said, “and it’s only after having proved oneself as a good copyist that you can reasonably try to do a still life of a radish.”

The ambitions of the copyists Mr. Guilbert photographed went well beyond fruits and vegetables. Marius Allier, a 26-year-old graduate of the School of Fine Arts in Paris, drew crowds as he tackled Eugène Delacroix’s “Women of Algiers (in their Apartment).” The 1834 painting presents challenges that have made it long popular among copyists, including Picasso, who later painted his own variations in the 1950s.

Catherine Balpe, an amateur painter, copied Theodore Chasseriau’s 1843 portrait, “The Two Sisters,” as a gift for her husband. Sam Rachamin journeyed from his home in Israel to render his copy of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres’s 1808 painting, “The Bather.”

Mr. Martin, 58, is a professional painter — but of houses, not canvases. A self-taught artist who paints using an easel and much smaller brushes when he’s not climbing ladders, copied “View of Pirna from the Sonnenstein Castle” by the Italian artist Bernardo Bellotto.

Though the Louvre, unlike other leading museums, does not charge copyists for the privilege, applicants can wait up to two years for one of the 250 permits the museum issues annually. Valid for three months, it allows them to work in the museum’s galleries from 9:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. most days, except Sundays and holidays, from September through June.

Photo

Tourists and other museum visitors can bring cameras into the Louvre and take pictures. But because Mr. Guilbert planned to shoot for publication, he applied for, and received permission to spend three days in the galleries with the copyists. “For me, the assignment was like a romantic experience,” he says.

With the Louvre’s magnificent interior architecture enhancing the composition of his shots, Mr. Guilbert chose to use the same light that illuminates the masterworks, to strong effect. “I never used a flash,” he says. “It’s most interesting to work with what you’re given.”

Finished with their copies, Mssrs. Martin and Wald, a photographer who copied Agnolo Bronzino’s “Portrait of a Man Holding a Statuette,” met with Isabelle Vieilleville, director of the Louvre’s copy office. To guard against forgeries, she checked that the two copyists had used canvases that were one-fifth smaller or larger than the original, and that the original artists’ signatures were not reproduced on the copies. Then she stamped the backs of the canvases with a Louvre seal, added her own signature and escorted them from the museum.

On the train, masterworks in hand, they drew little more than a double take or two. “The Metro is like the subway in New York,” Mr. Guilbert said. “There was not really much reaction from the other passengers. They have seen it all.”

For better or worse, the star-centric Warhol turned out to be the modern artist who got the future right.

Some of his observations in Mr. Roth’s script, largely culled from 80 hours of recorded conversations between its two characters (who both died in the 1980s), are so presciently on-target they leave you reeling. Listen, for example, to an aside Warhol delivers about his ever-trusty cassette recorder.

Everybody he came in contact with, he says, wound up performing for the tape. “You couldn’t tell which problems were real,” he said, “and which problems were exaggerated. Better yet, the people telling you the problems couldn’t decide anymore if they were really having the problems or just performing.”

Did you hear that, Kardashians and Real Housewives of everywhere? Decades before you became TV stars by just being “yourself,” Warhol had predicted your future.

As might have been expected, “WARHOLCAPOTE” is filled with gleefully exchanged gossip. Some of it is merely lubricious; some of it verges on the profound. Capote recalls Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis telling him, “Because of an accident of history, I’ll always be an object of curiosity, like something you see in a freak show.”

That Warhol and Capote were kindred sideshow attractions may make you nostalgic for an era in which artists and writers were considered worthy of mass fascination. But Mr. Roth’s play, which doesn’t always disguise its cut-and-paste seams, turns out to be about how public freakishness leads its victims to the solace of anesthesia.

Capote found it in pills and liquor; Warhol, in a willed detachment that transformed emotional peaks and valleys into glazed, flatline curiosity. Both men turned their ways of battling anxiety into copiously documented public personas that would seem to be easy to imitate but are not.

Mr. Spinella, best known for his passionate, Tony-winning performances in the “Angels in America” plays, here has the harder task, finding the affect in Warhol’s affectlessness. And his owlish, little-boy-lost Andy only sporadically convinces. (In wig and spectacles, he reminded me more of the superstar book editor Robert Gottlieb.)

The more combustible Capote, who wore his psychodrama like a cascading pocket handkerchief, provides more obvious actorly substance. And Mr. Butler, who replaced Leslie Jordan late in rehearsals, has moments of raw, bleeding anguish that make you ache for the cyclone of self-destruction that his character became. Of course, as Warhol might have pointed out, this Capote is performing for a tape recorder.

The pain that courses through Ms. Friedman’s “Merrily We Roll Along,” which I saw in an earlier version at the Menier Chocolate Factory in London four years ago, is authentic enough to keep its audience bathed in tears. Never mind that Mr. Furth’s book — adapted from a 1934 play by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart and a 16-performance flop on Broadway — remains a compendium of heartbreak-of-success clichés.

There’s a reason that these clichés — about shedding your integrity and identity on the road to stardom — have never been displaced: They still apply. The hard truth that celebrity, or the maintenance of it, tends to make its possessors more and more superficial is the reason that novels about the rich and famous so often feel flat. (I would argue that Jacqueline Susann, the author of celebrity potboilers like “Valley of the Dolls,” was as right in her way as Warhol was.)

Ms. Friedman, best known as a star of the London musical stage and a veteran interpreter of Sondheim, appreciates the depths of feeling to be dredged from such shallows. And she allows the layers of ambivalence in this exquisite score to color everything onstage.

In following the show’s chronologically reversed path of a successful film producer — from middle age in Hollywood to his idealistic youth in Manhattan — the production brings out the sharpness in the showbiz satire. (This aspect is wittily enhanced by Soutra Gilmour’s time-capsule sets and costumes and by Tim Jackson’s effortlessly integrated choreography.)

But what makes this “Merrily” transcendent is the conviction and nuance of the three performers at its center, who embody a friendship under siege. They include two happy holdovers from the London production: Mark Umbers, as Franklin Shepard, the charismatic composer who goes Hollywood, and Damian Humbley, as Charley Kringas, his longtime pal and collaborator.

New to the cast (although you wouldn’t know it) is Eden Espinosa as Mary, the alcoholic novelist in love with Frank. Supported by a fine-tuned ensemble, they are all close to flawless in navigating Mr. Sondheim’s intricate melody lines. More important, they use the splintered music to convey a fractious but blessed interconnectedness that makes their retrospective coming apart all the more poignant.

For the first time in my experience, Frank is the beating, shattered heart of the show. That’s partly a matter of how Ms. Friedman has ingeniously framed her production. But it’s also a consequence Mr. Umbers’s startlingly sympathetic performance of a (usually unsympathetic) man to whom fame happens.

“Who says lonely at the top?” Frank sings in the show’s opening Hollywood party scene. Mr. Umbers lends the lyric a polyurethane sheen. But the varnish doesn’t quite disguise the hopeful, bewildered young man he will become as his life — to borrow from F. Scott Fitzgerald, who knew from fame and disenchantment — is borne back ceaselessly into a reproachful past.","The Pain of Fame, With Sondheim, Warhol and Capote as Guides",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/theater/sondheim-warhol-and-capote-as-guides-to-fame.html

The outcome could affect the future course of the 180-year-old corporation, which has more than $65 billion in annual revenue and is home to familiar household brands like Tide and Pampers.

The proxy war is also a warning shot to blue-chip companies across the country that activist investors are setting their sights on ever-bigger corporate targets as they agitate for changes in strategy and structure. This year, General Motors and Tiffany & Company found themselves targeted by activists.

“No company is off limits because of its size, industry, the complexity of its business or even its stock price performance,” as activist investors control larger sums of assets, said Damien Park, a managing director at Spotlight Advisors, which advises companies and investors on activism.

Indeed, in recent years, through his investment firm Trian Fund Management, Mr. Peltz, 75, has taken significant stakes in H. J. Heinz, Mondelez International and DuPont. Sometimes, but not always, he has been given representation on the board.

This time around, Procter & Gamble is fighting Mr. Peltz’s attempt to get a seat, saying he is a late arrival to a corporate turnaround that is already underway.

Mr. Peltz, who owns a $3.5 billion stake in Procter & Gamble, has said he is not looking to oust any board members or the chief executive, David Taylor. If he wins a seat, he hopes to convince the other directors, including Kenneth Chenault, the chief executive of American Express, and Meg Whitman, the chief executive of Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, that the company should be organized from its current multilevel “matrix” structure to three clear global business units to improve accountability. He also contends that a study should be conducted to understand why Procter & Gamble’s once-vaunted innovation machine appears to have stalled.

“This is different from the normal activist slate, which is seeking to replace much of the board or the C.E.O.,’’ said Charles M. Elson, director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. “Here, he’s simply seeking input into the board process. He seeks a change of direction and I think he’s right. I think the company has stalled.”

In the last decade, Procter & Gamble’s total return — stock performance plus reinvested dividends — was around 77 percent. That is about half the returns for peers like Kimberly-Clark and Colgate-Palmolive.

Procter & Gamble argues that Mr. Peltz is not providing any new ideas. The company’s management, including its board and Mr. Taylor, a longtime Procter & Gamble veteran who was named chief executive nearly two years ago, has already identified the changes that need to be made and is in the midst of making them, it argues.

Furthermore, the company says its plan is yielding results, noting that it has delivered total shareholder return of 28 percent since Mr. Taylor took over, outperforming its peers.

The company also argues that Mr. Peltz lacks the criteria that it seeks for its directors, noting that it is now looking for leaders with digital and “big data/analytics” experience, skills in artificial intelligence and direct experience in household and personal categories. The board added in a statement on Friday that Mr. Peltz’s push to reorganize the company into global units was a “bad idea” that would only stall its momentum.

Still, Mr. Peltz’s arguments were striking a chord with some investors. Late last week, the California State Teachers’ Retirement System, which invests in Trian funds and controls 5.6 million shares of Procter & Gamble, said it was throwing its vote to Mr. Peltz. Earlier, the three largest proxy advisory firms also gave their support to him, an important victory because many institutional investors vote their shares based on the firms’ recommendations.

But a crucial piece of this battle sits with smaller so-called retail shareholders who control 40 percent of Procter & Gamble’s stock and may have emotional ties to the company.

Many of them are retirees who were given shares over the years as part of the company’s profit-sharing plan. But some stock is held by individuals who inherited it.

“Grandpa or their dad worked there and you’re not supposed to sell the P.&G. stock,” said John Lame, a former finance manager for Procter & Gamble who now runs the financial advisory firm Lenox Wealth Management in Cincinnati. Among his clients are the families of 150 current and former Procter & Gamble employees and executives.

“People have been very loyal to the stock and the company,’’ he said. “A lot of those people are going to vote with management.”

It has been the effort to reach out to this sizable retail base that has ramped up the costs of this campaign. In regulatory filings, the two sides said they had over 600 people working on the board election, and they expected to spend $60 million, combined.

But according to interviews with former executives, analysts and observers who are closely monitoring the battle, the cost, when all is said and done, will very likely be closer to $100 million. Mr. Peltz has accused P.&G. of spending $100 million to keep him off the board.

“The communications have been voluminous,” said Jim Langendonk, 66, of Slidell, La., who retired from Procter & Gamble in 2010 after working for 25 years in information technology. “I’ve gotten eight to 10 voting forms from both sides. Almost too many to count, and they just keep on coming.”

Mr. Langendonk said he intended to vote for Procter & Gamble in the proxy fight. “Typically, what guys like Peltz do is try to break up the company or load it up with a bunch of debt,” said Mr. Langendonk. “That’s my biggest concern: that he’ll ruin a really good company.”

But others wonder, what’s the harm in adding a different voice to the board?

“The restructuring at P.&G. has been going on for 20 years. That’s a long time without much to show for it,” said Mr. Lame, who estimates that the company’s underperformance relative to its category has cost his clients $200 million over the last 10 years. “Maybe you need to have one person on the board who has a different point of view.”","An Epic, and Costly, Boardroom Battle at Procter & Gamble",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/08/business/economy/an-epic-and-costly-boardroom-battle-at-procter-gamble.html

All three countries have been conducting military exercises near the border of Iraqi Kurdistan this week.

Iraqi troops, including Shiite Muslim militias incorporated into Iraq’s armed forces, are already in the Kirkuk area. While the city is controlled by Kurdish forces, Iraqi troops are fighting the Islamic State as part of an American-led coalition about 40 miles southwest of the city.

Kurdish troops known as pesh merga seized Kirkuk in 2014, when the Iraqi Army fled an assault by militants there.

The inclusion of Kirkuk and other disputed areas in the referendum enraged the Iraqi government, which interpreted the move as a land grab. Baghdad has accused the Kurds of illegally selling Iraqi oil from the Kirkuk oil fields through a pipeline that runs into Turkey.

The Kurdish independence challenge is the latest crisis to rock Iraq in recent years. The country was controlled by Saddam Hussein’s regime until 2003, when the American invasion helped set off a brutal civil war and years of wrenching upheaval.

Just three years ago, Iraq lost a third of its territory to Islamic State militants. Now that the Islamic State is finally being driven out, Iraq is faced with losing a third of its territory and access to areas with oil and natural gas if Kurdistan breaks away.

Beyond the threats of military action, Iraqi authorities have struggled to come up with any meaningful punishment for the Kurds for carrying out the referendum. But with its move to shut down flights to the landlocked region, Iraq seems to have found a weak point.

Iraqi aviation authorities notified foreign airlines on Wednesday that it would cancel all permits to land and take off from two international airports in the Kurdish region as of Friday afternoon. The action followed an ultimatum by Prime Minister Abadi on Tuesday for Kurdistan to surrender control of its two international airports or face a shutdown of international flights.

The Kurdish Regional Government said Wednesday that it would refuse to hand over the airports. The region’s transportation minister, Mawlud Murad, called the Iraqi ultimatum “political and illegal.” He said the airports were critical to the American-led coalition’s fight against Islamic State militants.

Kurdish officials had planned to send a delegation to Baghdad on Wednesday to discuss the issue, but the offer was rebuffed.

On Wednesday night, Mr. Murad said that the Kurdish government had agreed to hold talks with Iraq about placing Iraqi government observers at its airports.

There was no immediate public response from the Iraqi government, but Mr. Abadi, speaking to Parliament earlier, said Iraq would not negotiate with the Kurds unless they annulled the results of the vote.

He said he had warned the Kurds “of the consequences of the crisis with Kurdistan.”

“The preservation of the security of the citizens of the country is our priority,” he added.

At least six airlines — three Turkish companies, the Lebanese carrier Middle East Airlines, Royal Jordanian and Egypt Air — started notifying passengers on Wednesday that they were canceling regularly scheduled flights from the airports in Erbil and Sulaimaniya.

Baghdad can make good on its threat because the Iraqi civil aviation authority oversees all airports in the country, including the two international airports in the Kurdish region.

The threat to cancel landing and takeoff permits would force international airlines to cancel flights to those airports because insurance risks would be too high, according to Robert W. Mann Jr., a former airline executive who is now an industry consultant.

“The issue turns on which entity controls Kurdish region airspace and airports,” Mr. Mann said. “Unless and until the autonomous region is given that control, Iraq controls and can ban, blockade or embargo air service to airports under its control, much as Qatari airports have been embargoed or blockaded by nearby nations. Faced with such a restriction, most commercial airlines would comply, in part due to warnings by their insurers.”

The Turkish Consulate in Erbil said that Turkish airlines were working to increase their seat capacity in an effort to get all passengers out of the Kurdish areas before the flight ban took effect on Friday afternoon.

Without international flights, getting in or out of Kurdistan would require going through Turkey, Iran, Syria or Iraq, where there are also threats of a blockade.

The Iraqi Parliament urged the government on Wednesday to close off its land border with Kurdistan.

For years, the Kurdish authorities in Erbil have controlled their own borders with Turkey and Syria. Mr. Abadi has demanded that all borders return to full Iraqi central government control by Friday.

Photo

Turkey’s customs minister, in remarks carried by Turkish state television, said that the main land border crossing between Turkey and the Iraqi Kurdish region remained open, although he would not say for how long that would remain the case.

Turkey is the largest trade partner with Iraqi Kurdistan, and the road border is used for much of the cargo trade. Turkey also is the transit country for the oil pumped out of areas controlled by the Kurdish authorities to the world market.

Turkey and Iran have opposed the referendum and any moves toward Kurdish independence, fearing unrest by their own Kurdish minorities.

Kurdish authorities in Erbil announced on Wednesday that 92.7 percent of those who went to the polls on Monday had voted for Kurdish leaders to seek independence. About 72 percent of 4.6 million registered voters cast ballots, with about 2.9 million voting yes to independence and about 224,000 voting no, the Kurdish Independent High Electoral Referendum Commission reported.

The referendum does not automatically trigger a declaration of independence but sets in motion a series of moves toward the establishment of a Kurdish state. The most important one of those may be negotiations of a separation with Iraq, which Iraq has refused.

American officials opposed the vote because they feared it would destabilize Iraq, stir ethnic conflict and undermine the American-led coalition.

Kurdish pesh merga fighters have played a central role in the coalition’s operations against the Islamic State militants, fighting alongside Iraqi Army units.

The Kurdish region’s president, Massoud Barzani, pushed for the referendum in hopes of obtaining a strong public mandate for eventual independence that he could use to begin negotiations with Baghdad.

Kurds have been celebrating since Monday evening, setting off fireworks, honking horns and affixing flapping red, white and green Kurdish flags to their automobiles. Government billboards promoting Monday’s independence vote were still in place on Wednesday.","Iraq Escalates Dispute With Kurds, Threatening Military Action",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/world/middleeast/kurdistan-referendum-iraq.html

The fifth of six children, he was so determined to get to college that he was already budgeting for it as a high school student. (I reproduced his handwritten budget, which he still has, in a 2015 column.)

After successful stints in the paper-shredding and executive compensation industries, Mr. Ranzetta turned to student loan consulting when his older siblings started sending their own children to college and threw up their hands in confusion and despair when trying to borrow to pay for it.

His phone number was on his company website, and every time a tearful call came in, he asked what might have kept the problems from happening in the first place. Inevitably, it came down to people wishing they’d known at the beginning how large their loan payment was going to be relative to their monthly income.

Payback, and the financial literacy work Mr. Ranzetta has been doing for years (which he pays for out of his own savings), is his attempt to open students’ eyes.

Once he persuaded McKinney to help him, he began working with Jenny Nicholson, one of the creators of Spent. Her work on that project was informed by her own childhood, part of which she spent in Tennessee without running water or electricity.

When she entered the University of California, San Diego, she was the first person in her family to go to college. Nobody told her that when the student loan check lands, it can lead to false feelings of being flush with cash, given that a chunk of the money may be needed for months of living expenses. “I was richer, frankly, than I’d ever been in my life,” she said.

Photo

She avoided the temptation to spend it all, quickly paid back her loans and entered the social work field before landing in advertising. After the success of Spent, McKinney received lots of proposals from potential clients wanting them to recreate it for some other area of decision-making.

Payback, however, is the first project the firm has accepted like this. A big part of the reason, Ms. Nicholson said, is that the firm recognized that paying for college is not just about debt but also about investment. Every decision — from where you attend to what jobs and activities and classes and majors you choose while you are there — is about trade-offs. How much paid work is enough? How much socializing and spending on fun?

And so the game asks players to consider graduation gifts of cash, laptop purchases, meal plans, dorm supplies, books, hours of paid work, the Greek system, vacations and more. A rapid-fire class registration challenge has dire consequences if you don’t act fast enough.

All the while, you see a running total of your debt. But one of the cleverest things about the game is the constant, cumulative tabulation of focus (which paid work can reduce), connections (is an unpaid internship worth it?) and happiness. That last one comes from Ms. Nicholson’s personal experience, for she eventually realized that focus and happiness were sometimes counterpoints and she might have received a better return on her investment in college if she’d had more fun and more friends.

Veteran financial literacy educators and advocates welcome the additional tool, though some of them were underwhelmed by my notion of a grand, master class on paying for college. After all, not every high school student is college material, and many others are aiming for trade training or military service. Sometimes, all of these teenagers are in the same class, so the course work needs to apply to as many of them as possible.

Still, Brian Page, a high school teacher in Reading, Ohio, said he welcomed an additional teaching tool that is highly experiential. He should know, since he’s the educator I wrote about three years ago who takes his students on a yellow school bus tour of pawnshops and payday-lending stores to do math problems using those businesses’ terms and fine print. “It’s not just what you know,” he said. “It’s what you do with what you know.”

Mr. Page has done some consulting work for Mr. Ranzetta but did not work on Payback and reviewed it at my request. He said he especially liked the various ways that players could lose the game and not even complete college, while still accruing debt. That is the worst of all worlds, he noted, since they need to repay the loans but don’t end up with the sheepskin that will make it much easier to get a decent-paying job and thus afford the monthly payments.

There is one other hurdle that teachers may need to clear to be comfortable with using Payback in the classroom. Talking about paying for college inevitably leads to questions about which families have what, how much they’re willing to pay (if anything) and what teenagers even know about their family’s finances. Ms. Nicholson knew from her own experience as the poor kid in class that this could be a source of tension, so the game doesn’t ask for household income. Instead, it assumes a certain level of family contribution plus scholarships. Then, different shortages (that debt can fill) emerge, depending on the colleges a player chooses.

Still, teachers may quite reasonably fear a delicate dance around personal data when teaching about paying for college generally. “The potential teacher reluctance is with the social aspect, not with the topic,” said Laura Levine, the president and chief executive of the nonprofit group JumpStart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy.

With the right planning, however, educators should be able to sidestep revealing too much in front of students’ peers. Students may well have questions for the teacher after class, and Mr. Ranzetta hopes they bring the questions home, too. “My hope is that this is the beginning of a great discussion,” he said.

There is risk that any such game, with its winners and losers, may result in students not attending college or not borrowing enough to do so successfully. But Ms. Nicholson said she hoped that the elements of fun and connections baked into the game would have an entirely different effect.

“I’ll never get all the details right, and there is always going to be someone who asks if we thought about this or that or living in a cardboard box to save money,” she said. “But I hope everyone who plays will understand the concept that you don’t have to give up everything to succeed.”",A Game to Help Students Pay the Right Price for College,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/29/your-money/paying-for-college/payback-college-loans.html

The biggest takeaway is counterintuitive: At all costs, resist. Many women are taught from an early age that the best chance of survival in an attack is to obey. Not true, says Kardian (who co-wrote the book with A. Clara Pistek). Get in the car, follow him to the deserted apartment, do what he wants — and you’re toast. Kardian is also a big believer in people not minding their own business. A third person barging into a situation that looks dicey is extremely likely to help avert a crime. So if you see someone who’s listening a little too closely to a woman’s room number at a hotel, tell her; if you think you saw someone slip something into her drink when she goes to the restroom, speak up. He cites a YouTube video called “Snack Man,” in which two people on a New York City subway are having a brawl because the woman thinks the man is following her. There are punches and kicks. And then some big dude eating chips just kind of sidles between them, continuing to eat, saying nothing … and the fight is over. Snack Man is my hero.

GIRL UP: Kick Ass, Claim Your Woman Card, and Crush Everyday Sexism (Touchstone, paper, $16) is a manifesto for maintaining your sanity and dignity in today’s social media quagmire, where “suddenly our lives, our looks, our relationships, our meals and our cats are open to scrutiny.” (Bonus points: Bates, the founder of the Everyday Sexism Project, is as funny and sex-positive as early Cynthia Heimel.) A bracing antidote to self-consciousness — Bates reminds us constantly that no one is scrutinizing us a tenth as much as we scrutinize ourselves — “Girl Up” offers practical steps to overcoming stereotypes and not letting the world define you. The chapter titles say it all: among them, “You Aren’t Your Body,” “Sluts, Unicorns, and Other Mythical Creatures,” “Porn ≠ Sex” and “The F-Word” — that word being “feminist.” The book is filled with tap-dancing vaginas, clever comebacks to ridiculous pickup lines and all sorts of handy translation guides, notably of tabloid-magazine language pertaining to women. For instance: “flaunts” means “has body part”; “shows off” means “has body part”; “goes makeup-free” means “is human.”

In a chart with two columns — “Ten Things Every Girl Should Know How to Do According to Magazines” vs. “Ten Things Every Girl Should Know How to Do in Real Life” — she compares the magazine imperative (“How to kiss in a way that communicates perfectly what you would and wouldn’t like to happen next”) with what would actually be useful: “How to use your words and have an actual conversation, in the event that your partner doesn’t, in fact, turn out to be a lip psychic.” All of us, and young women especially, need to maintain our humanity and kindness while not giving a hoot what other people think, as long as we’re not hurting anyone. And that’s what makes this book special. Well, that and the tap-dancing vaginas.

While Bates is empowering a young girl’s psyche, Tasneem Bhatia is here to give our health a boost. SUPER WOMAN RX: Discover the Secrets to Lasting Health, Your Perfect Weight, Energy, and Passion With Dr. Taz’s Power Type Plans (Rodale, $26.99) is a perfectly traditional self-help guide, which works on the premise that while everyone is a lovely individual snowflake, we all fall into certain emotional and physical categories, and if we figure out our category we can determine the best diet and fitness and psychic-energy plan to empower ourselves. In other words: Quizzes! I had to find out if I was a Gypsy Girl, a Boss Lady, a Savvy Chick, an Earth Mama or a Nightingale. Turns out I was a Savvy Chick, like the author, and I have to say that the ills Savvy Chicks are prone to (anxiety, migraines, infertility, eczema) are pretty much precisely the ones I’ve had. The solutions are quite involved but perfectly sensible. I also happen to be incapable of sticking to any regimen. But that doesn’t mean I won’t spend money on vitamins, probiotics and various warm broths while I try.

Speaking of quizzes, I took the pop quiz about car care at the beginning of Patrice Banks’s GIRLS AUTO CLINIC GLOVE BOX GUIDE (Touchstone, paper, $25) and scored my personal best: zero. I did not get a single answer right. I can’t be excused for being a car-less New Yorker, because I have actually owned a car. In most areas of life I am keen on understanding what I’m doing. But when it came to the car I somehow felt a penis was necessary to deal with it. And I am not alone, despite the fact that women are more frequently the purchasers of cars in a family. Explaining that a woman’s relationship to her car should be like a relationship to her partner — heavy on the communication and the commitment — Banks gives us the basics here: the parts, how they operate, what you can fix yourself, and perhaps most important, how not to be cheated (by knowing how much various repair jobs should cost). It’s simply written, it’s not condescending or cutesy, and it removes the mystery from something that many of us find a little scary. “Girls Auto Clinic” is not about how we feel about our cars; it’s about what we can learn to do. And that’s some pretty excellent roaring right there.",How to Fight and Fix Your Car Like a Woman,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/books/review/claudia-chan-this-is-how-we-rise-self-help-women.html

And I’m not using my voice — you know, you’re not screaming.","Those were more concert experiences. The sets would change. This is a locked-in piece of music and script that I’m going to be performing pretty much the same on a nightly basis. It’s a solidified piece of work. And I think the intimacy of the venue is going to really affect it, to make it quite a bit different from the acoustic tours. Though I don’t know if I’d be doing this without the experience of doing them. When I recorded “Nebraska” back in the ’80s, I didn’t tour on it because I wasn’t sure if I could.

Are you using video?

Basically it’s a one-man show. There’s no production beyond the stage, some lights and some very high-quality sound. I thought anything beyond the song and the story ended up feeling too rigid and distracting. It happens every time we go to do a tour, you know?

You did a VH1 Storytellers with some extensive spoken interludes [in 2005].

That would be the closest thing to what I’m doing now. When I did the VH1 thing, Elvis Costello came up to me later and said, “Gee, it created some third entity.” And that’s what I’m interested in doing with the show. I’m playing familiar music, but I believe it will lead you to hear it with very fresh ears by the context that I set it in. I always make a comment that when things are working in art, one plus one equals three.

I think an audience always wants two things. They want to feel at home and they want to be surprised. And I go out every time to do those two things. I try to make people feel that they’ve come to some place that they’ve known for a long time, and then also try to surprise them with some new insights or new forms or new energy or just a new way of doing something. You’ve got to have that X factor. If you don’t have that, you’re dead in the water.

Do you go to Broadway shows?

We go on occasion. I saw “Hamilton.” I guess that was the last thing I’ve seen. It was great.

But you didn’t try to write a Broadway musical.

That’s tough! I salute the guys that have given that a shot. It’s not the same rules as pop music writing. It’s a completely different format, and I think it takes a set of completely different skills. It’s not like, oh, I’ll write 12 songs and kind of stick them together somehow. The guys I know who tried it really gave a good shot at it. My friend Sting, I thought, did a great job [with “The Last Ship”]. But it’s a different thing conceiving it from the beginning to the end. I admire all the Broadway writers, Sondheim, who have been able to do that so magnificently, but it’s not something I could ever do. It just seems too hard.

And then I’ve never really been good at, say, writing to script. In other words, “Now I need a song about [a certain subject].” I’ve never written like that. I’ve always written about what’s pressing itself upon me to write at a given moment. I’ve never sat back and said, well, I need a song about Trump, or I need a song about this happening or that happening. When I’ve crossed over with topical songwriting, even that was something that began as, you’re angry about something or you want to say something. That’s the feeling that comes up first.

With your book and with “Springsteen on Broadway,” you’re surveying your whole past. Are you also writing songs?

I’ve finished a record. I had some inspiration. When you’re locked into a period of creativity it’s very similar to being hungry all the time. You have an appetite to write. It’s one of the nicest feelings in the world for a songwriter because you know what it is to be without that appetite. Once you lock into that, then you’re feeding yourself. Everywhere you go you’re hungry. So I might come up with a verse sitting at the kitchen table, I might be asleep and wake up in the middle of the night and run upstairs to my writing room and come up with another verse or two. Literally I do it anywhere and everywhere and that’s a nice place to be. It doesn’t happen that often.

Writing the book must have made you think about your life story.

I really never had planned on writing anything. So when it came around, yeah, obviously, you draw a story from your story. I supposed you’re contextualizing your own life for yourself, and in the course of it you’re trying to have an honest hand.

It’s one of the things that I’m sort of glad it exists. Just for your kids — your kids really don’t know much about your life, you know? We had our kids late, I was 40 when our first son was born, and they showed a healthy disinterest in our work over all the years. They had their own musical heroes, they had their own music they were interested in. They’d be pretty blank-faced if someone mentioned a song title of mine, and I always looked upon that as that we did a good job. I know that none of my kids have read the book, though I imagine someday they will perhaps. I kind of like that. My job, it’s a strange job, it’s an eccentric line of work. And it’s not comparable to anything else and it can be difficult to be around it. As I say in the book, I know a lot of kids who wouldn’t mind seeing 50,000 people boo their parents. But I don’t know how many would want to see those people cheer their parents. It’s just not right (laughs).

The book explains that you’ve always been a musician. You never really had a 9-to-5 job. But “Springsteen on Broadway” is five nights a week for five months. It’s steady work.

That’s a real job. This is my first real job, I think (laughs). That’s the one thing I’m going into with a certain sense of faith. I go, well, I’m not using myself so totally physically on a nightly basis. And I’m not using my voice — you know, you’re not screaming. But the mental energy that it takes to do it is the same. People come to see you be completely, completely present. Any time you’re trying to do that, it takes a lot of energy.

You say the show and stories are locked in — won’t that become repetitive for you?

I’ve played “Born to Run,” many, many times. I’m sure if we went on the internet we could find out how many. (laughs) But the key is, you have to approach it not as a repetition but as a renewal. And to do that your spirit has got to be 100 percent present. But it’s a new audience every night. There’s new faces, there’s new opportunities. Those songs have been very good to me over the years, and in return I try to be good to them. So you have a chance of renewing the emotion and the spirit in that music on a nightly basis. That’s the place I work to get to every night when I’m onstage. I think that if the foundation of what you’ve built is built well, you’ll be able to inhabit it on a nightly basis and your audience will come in and it will feel like they’re seeing it for the first time.

The busy hurricane season of 2017 has given fresh purpose to a president who, until now, made most of his own weather inside the West Wing. On Tuesday, he said he would visit Puerto Rico and the storm-ravaged Virgin Islands next week. The White House issued photos of a grave-looking Mr. Trump being briefed in the Situation Room.

But the hurricanes are yet another reminder of this president’s rare capacity for self-congratulation — a trait that seems particularly ill-suited to the aftermath of deadly disasters, when the plight of people who lost homes or even family members would seem to take precedence over testimonials to FEMA.

From the start, Mr. Trump has had trouble separating himself from the story. On his first visit to Texas after Hurricane Harvey swamped Houston, the president went to a firehouse in Corpus Christi, nearly 220 miles away, for a briefing with federal, state and local officials that stopped just short of being a pep rally. “We’ll congratulate each other when it’s all finished,” he told the group.

Outside, he greeted a crowd of about 1,000 who had gathered by saying, “What a crowd! What a turnout!”

Four days later, Mr. Trump returned to the state — this time, to meet actual victims of the storm. He handed out cardboard boxes with hot dogs and potato chips to residents in Houston, and talked about the love he had seen in the NRG Center, a convention center converted into a shelter for nearly 1,200 people. But he could not resist a victory lap.

“They’re really happy with what’s going on,” he told reporters traveling with him. “It’s something that’s been very well received. Even by you guys, it’s been very well received.”

In Florida, after Hurricane Irma roared up the Gulf Coast, Mr. Trump seemed more at ease in his role as a consoler. At a ruined mobile home park in Naples, he handed out encouragement along with hoagies. But when one man yelled, “Where was Obama during the last hurricane? On a golf course,” Mr. Trump stopped and asked whether he had voted for him.

“Best vote of your life?” the president said, with a grin.

Puerto Rico, unlike Texas and Florida, is not Trump country. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida trounced him in the Republican primary there in March 2016. And Mr. Trump has been noticeably less vocal about the damage from Hurricane Maria. Over the weekend, as Puerto Ricans ran perilously low on food, water and fuel, he posted nothing about the crisis.

Yet he posted 17 tweets about sports — from the dispute he single-handedly revived over the N.F.L. and the national anthem to his withdrawal of an invitation for Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors to visit the White House. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump denied that he had neglected Puerto Rico in favor of his feud with professional athletes.

“I’ve heard that before: ‘Was I preoccupied?’” he said. “Not at all, not at all. I have plenty of time on my hands. All I do is work.”

Some residents of the Virgin Islands, parts of which were leveled by Irma, feel similarly overlooked by Washington. Kenneth E. Mapp, the governor, assured them that Mr. Trump had told him he “loves the Virgin Islands.”

When the president finally did get around to addressing Puerto Rico, on Monday, he led off with some unsympathetic observations about the territory’s well-publicized fiscal problems.

“Texas & Florida are doing great but Puerto Rico, which was already suffering from broken infrastructure & massive debt, is in deep trouble,” he said in a series of tweets. “It’s old electrical grid, which was in terrible shape, was devastated. Much of the Island was destroyed, with billions of dollars owed to Wall Street and the banks which, sadly, must be dealt with. Food, water and medical are top priorities – and doing well.”

On Tuesday, Mr. Trump said he had deployed Navy ships to Puerto Rico. His homeland security adviser, Thomas P. Bossert, and the FEMA administrator, Brock Long, traveled there to meet with officials. But even then, Mr. Trump said less about the resilience of the people than about the territory’s problems. The federal government, he said, had to take over some security because police officers, having lost their homes, had gone off duty.

After his news conference, Mr. Trump tweeted, “America’s hearts & prayers are with the people of #PuertoRico & the #USVI. We will get through this — and we will get through this TOGETHER!”

To the extent that Mr. Trump lauded Puerto Rican officials, however, it was for their praise and gratitude for his administration’s efforts.

“We have had tremendous reviews from government officials, as we have in Texas and Louisiana, and as we have in Florida,” Mr. Trump said, singling out Greg Abbott of Texas and Rick Scott of Florida as “great governors.”

For a moment, it looked like he would pay a similar tribute to the governor of Puerto Rico, Mr. Rosselló.

Mr. Nadella also addressed a series of business flops — including a disastrous acquisition of the phone maker Nokia and Microsoft’s late start in development of cloud computing services — that pushed it out of the top tier of white-hot tech companies like Facebook, Apple and Google.

But recently, Microsoft has regained traction, making some of the most innovative personal computers in the industry, experimenting with artificial intelligence and augmented reality and testing autonomous vehicles. Microsoft’s share price has more than doubled during Mr. Nadella’s tenure as chief executive.

But there is still room to grow. Revenue from Microsoft’s Azure cloud service soared 97 percent in its fourth quarter, but the business still lags behind the offering of its nearby rival, Amazon.

Mr. Nadella said that companies cannot expect to “hit every trend or catch every wave,” noting that Microsoft faced “a new existential threat” every five years throughout its history. He said that while “zero sum competition” exists in the industry, he also values partnerships.

Amazon and Microsoft, based a short drive apart in Washington State, compete for both talent and business. But the two companies recently paired up to integrate Amazon’s Alexa voice-controlled digital assistant with its Microsoft counterpart Cortana.

“I do not view it primarily through a competitive lens — technology today is much more pervasive, and the top five companies by market cap are all very different,” he said. “The worst mistake I can make is to assume that we should do what they’re doing and not be true to our identity.”

The proposals have won converts among city leaders who have been unable to marshal the resources or political will to deal with the homeless crisis.

Progress, they say, has been thwarted by skyrocketing housing costs that have pushed more Californians into destitution.

The encampment proposals are divisive. Supporters see them as a humane path to permanent housing in the absence of another good alternative.

Critics worry that they could foster complacency in the battle to create affordable housing.

And residents bring a host of safety and sanitation concerns connected to where the encampments would be placed.

San Diego’s proposal was catapulted onto the city’s agenda this year for public health reasons as a devastating hepatitis A outbreak took aim at the homeless population.

Bob McElroy, president of the Alpha Project, a charity that will operate the camp on a city lot near Balboa Park, said the long-term goal was to get people into permanent housing.

“But what do people do in the meantime? Die in the streets?” he said. “There’s got to be a starting point.”

The Dodgers are the only Californian club competing in baseball’s playoffs this year.

On Friday, Conor Dougherty, a Times reporter and Giants fan, asked readers to consider a touchy question: Was it even possible for a Giants fan to root for the Dodgers?

Let’s just say the feedback was spirited.

Some samples:

“No. Just no.”

— Margaret Stone

“I don’t know where to begin. The reporter’s premise has left me apoplectic. While I am also a die-hard Giants fan, I would no sooner root on the Dodgers than I would the I.R.S.”

— Chris Larson

“As a longtime Giants fan, I’d say the only time I’d root for the Dodgers would be if they were playing against the Taliban.”

— Pete Mastromonaco

“I’m a true blue, 54 year old, born and raised in Southern California, watch every game I can, Dodgers fan. But if my guys weren’t in the postseason and the Giants were, I’d be rooting for them! We Californians need to stick together, water rights be damned!”

— Laura Turkel

“My dad taught me two things: Love the Giants with all of your heart and hate the Dodgers with every fiber of your being. The mere thought of a playoff series between the Giants and Dodgers makes me hyperventilate.”

— Harrison Reilly

“I don’t see why not. Us SoCal residents cheered endlessly for the Giants in 2010, 2012, 2014. It’s time they returned the favor. We can keep the rivalry but at the end of the day, yes — we’re all California.”

— Nicole Villanova-Price

After the “X Case” of 1992, in which a 14-year-old rape victim was prevented from traveling to Britain for an abortion, voters passed a constitutional amendment that left the ban intact but recognized a woman’s right to travel abroad. Another amendment, also passed in 1992, permitted Irish women to obtain information on abortion services overseas, which had been prohibited by the state.

Much of the impetus for the new constitutional effort stems from the case of Savita Halappanavar, 31, an Indian-born dentist who died of sepsis after miscarrying in a Galway hospital in 2012. Having learned that her 17-week-old fetus would not live, Ms. Halappanavr repeatedly asked the staff to terminate the pregnancy to relieve her own worsening condition. She was told that her pregnancy could not be terminated while the fetus had a heartbeat.

An inquiry determined that recent interpretations of the Eighth Amendment had found therapeutic terminations to be permissible, but the medical staff’s uncertainty over the law and the lack of clear legislation contributed to a delay in her treatment.

The case helped build momentum for a citizens’ constitutional assembly, which this year recommended that the Eighth Amendment be repealed or amended, and that legislation be introduced to allow abortion, effectively on request.

A number of social and economic factors have made contemporary Ireland a more liberal country that the one that passed the Eighth Amendment. Not least among these is an erosion in the status of the Roman Catholic Church, weakened by scandals over the sexual abuse of children and the treatment of marginalized women in bleak church-run laundries, where many died and were buried anonymously.

The 1983 campaign to ban abortion, backed by bishops and Catholic lay groups, represented the high-water mark for institutional Catholic power in Ireland, coming just four years after Pope John Paul II drew huge crowds in the first papal visit to the country. While a significant majority describe themselves as Catholic, few now adhere to the church’s teachings in matters like divorce, contraception, sex outside marriage or gay rights.

An Irish Times poll in May showed that large majorities supported legal changes allowing abortion in cases of rape or serious risk to the physical or mental health of the mother, but less than a quarter of people supported changes making it legal under all circumstances.

Leaders of the Repeal the Eight campaign are likely to be buoyed by another liberal constitutional effort, the 2015 referendum that legalized same-sex marriage, though the country’s well-organized anti-abortion activists will find much in the polls to encourage their own hopes.

Traditionally cautious, Ireland’s mainstream politicians may huddle as close as they can to the middle ground. Mr. Varadkar’s own position is somewhat ambiguous. Though he came out as gay during the same-sex marriage campaign, Mr. Varadkar had sounded conservative notes earlier in his political career, opposing abortion and same-sex adoption.",Ireland to Hold Abortion Referendum Next Year,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/26/world/europe/ireland-abortion-ban-referendum.html

Mr. Strange lost his primary runoff to Roy Moore, a provocative former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, who made attacking Mr. McConnell a central feature of his campaign.

“McConnell has become synonymous with gridlock,” said Richard C. Fording, a political scientist at the University of Alabama who followed the race closely. “I think people here are frustrated, and they have bought into this narrative that Mitch McConnell is to blame, that he’s incompetent, that he’s part of the establishment, that he’s controlled by special interests and synonymous with the status quo.”

Allies of Mr. McConnell poured millions into the runoff contest, painting Mr. Strange as a reliable Trump loyalist and Mr. Moore as a lifelong, untrustworthy politician.

But that story line never broke through. In fact, the race spotlighted growing divisions between establishment Republicans personified by Mr. McConnell and his allies and Trump Republicans, even though it was Mr. Strange who had the president’s endorsement.

The gap was so wide that when Mr. Trump campaigned for Mr. Strange, he tried to distance the senator from the Republican leader.

That was not quite true.

With Democrats across the country energized by the election of Mr. Trump, some analysts say Democrats now have an outside chance to pick up the seat — even in a deeply conservative state like Alabama. But if Mr. Moore wins, he will almost certainly be a wild card in the Senate, where Mr. McConnell is already struggling to keep the 52 Republicans in line.

“The stakes here are high,” said Scott Jennings, a Republican strategist who is close to Mr. McConnell. “His majority of 52 is slim, and it’s even slimmer when you consider at any given time there are four to six of them who are contrarians. So if you take out a Luther, who is not a contrarian, and you throw in a Roy Moore, who’s going to be a contrarian, that makes the majority even less effective and productive.”

And it could get worse — much worse. Buoyed by Mr. Moore’s victory, conservatives like the former Trump strategist Stephen K. Bannon and Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska, now speak of separating “Trumpism” from Mr. Trump, and they are throwing themselves behind insurgent populists around the country.

Already, Trumpist candidates have emerged to challenge Senators Dean Heller of Nevada and Jeff Flake of Arizona in Republican primary races next year.

In Mississippi, Mr. Bannon is courting another firebrand, State Senator Chris McDaniel, to challenge Senator Roger Wicker, who embodies low-key country-club Republicanism.

And Mr. Bannon and allies are looking for a populist candidate to run for Tennessee’s Senate seat, which opened up Tuesday when Senator Bob Corker, a Republican, announced that he would not run for re-election.

Victories by such candidates would drastically remake the Senate, and could threaten Mr. McConnell’s leadership. Already, conservatives are smelling blood.

“If this was a football team and you lost this many times, you’d start firing the coaches,” said David Bozell, the president of For America, a conservative advocacy group.

Richard A. Viguerie, the conservative direct-mail guru, called Mr. Moore’s victory “a stunning rejection of Mitch McConnell’s corrupt and incompetent leadership.”

But in the Senate, Mr. McConnell has a deep well of support within his conference, in part because he is so effective a raising money to re-elect his fellow Republicans. He also has a thick skin.

“Senator McConnell is not a hot personality,” said Ralph Reed, the chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, an organization of social conservatives. “He doesn’t have real high highs, and he doesn’t have real low lows, and he’s been at this a long time, and he’s smart enough and wise enough to know that there are good days and not so good days in this business.”

Senate Republicans are clearly frustrated by the legislative gridlock that has gripped the chamber, especially the on-again, off-again effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The latest attempt ended Tuesday when Mr. McConnell concluded that he did not have the votes to pass the so-called Graham-Cassidy bill, which would have taken money spent under the law and given it to the states in the form of block grants.

“I wasn’t sent up here to sit around and talk,” complained Senator John Kennedy, a freshman Republican from Louisiana. “I was sent up here to make ordinary Americans’ lives better.”

But Mr. Kennedy said he did not blame Mr. McConnell.

It’s an issue that hits close to home. Five percent of her staff members are DACA recipients, or Dreamers, as they are known, and the museum is operating in a borough where about 91,000 undocumented immigrants are eligible for DACA, the highest of New York City’s five boroughs.

National politics is sensitive territory that arts organizations all over the country are trying to navigate during this polarized era, and some are asking whether it is appropriate for museum directors to also be public advocates.

“It’s hard to put one’s own politics aside when we represent public institutions that welcome all viewpoints,” said Anne Pasternak, the director of the Brooklyn Museum. “This is a moment when cultural leaders are asking themselves, do I want to be on the right side of history?”

Traditionally, museum directors have remained behind the scenes, allowing the art they show to speak for itself. But increasingly they have been forced to defend and — in two recent cases, at the Guggenheim and the Louvre — remove controversial exhibitions. Many see the withdrawal of artwork as a troubling development for cultural institutions that are supposed to champion free expression.

When the Trump era of fast-moving political developments headed toward cultural institutions this year — specifically the president’s proposed defunding of the National Endowment for the Arts — at least two museum directors in New York felt compelled to jump into the fray.

Some museums have also responded by quickly staging politically relevant exhibitions. To protest Mr. Trump’s executive order on immigration, the Museum of Modern Art in February rehung part of its permanent collection with works by artists from some of the majority-Muslim nations whose citizens were blocked from entering the United States. And the Brooklyn Museum organized its recent show, “The Legacy of Lynching: Confronting Racial Terror in America,” in just five weeks.

But in Queens, where 165 different languages are spoken, Ms. Raicovich seems to be charting her own community-focused path, with an emphasis on making the museum a safe haven for the borough’s large immigrant population.

“I take my leadership very seriously — not just in a physical and managerial sense,” Ms. Raicovich said in a recent interview at her museum office. “Care and equity has to be part of what I bring to my position.

“This isn’t an abstraction; this is real,” she added. “It’s people that I work with every day. This museum is interacting with immigrants.”

On Mr. Trump’s Inauguration Day in January, the Queens Museum closed its galleries in solidarity with an art strike called by hundreds of artists — including Cindy Sherman, Richard Serra and Louise Lawler — to combat, as the organizers put, it “the normalization of Trumpism — a toxic mix of white supremacy, misogyny, xenophobia, militarism, and oligarchic rule.” The museum invited the community to come make protest posters, buttons and banners (materials provided for free).

And, since some immigrant residents have been newly wary of going out in public — Ms. Raicovich said attendance noticeably dropped after the election — the museum has been holding events in people’s homes and on their blocks. “Xenophobia is not a new thing,” Ms. Raicovich said. “Our work has just intensified.”

A politically outspoken museum director could run the risk of alienating trustees, donors and potential future employers, who may disagree with her views or deem such advocacy inappropriate. But so far, the Queens Museum board has supported Ms. Raicovich. “This is an engaged time, and she is an engaged leader who has placed values of difference and multiplicity at the center of her leadership,” Mark J. Coleman, the museum’s chairman, said.

Artists also say they appreciate Ms. Raicovich’s bold stances. “Having a young director brave enough to talk about issues that are directly affecting Americans — especially people born Dreamers — is so worthy,” said the conceptual visual artist Mel Chin, who will have a retrospective at the museum in April. “Someone in a position to speak out on behalf of people who don’t have voices is what it’s all about.”

To help New York’s cultural institutions through this thicket, the city’s Department of Cultural Affairs and the Ford Foundation last spring invited arts leaders to a discussion with legal experts on what is permissible for nonprofits in lobbying and political activity. Nonprofit laws bar institutions from engaging in electoral politics and holding political fund-raisers, a hornet’s nest the Queens Museum ran into this past summer when it appeared to cancel and then reinstate an Israel-sponsored event after accusations of anti-Semitism.

Two city officials in August called for Ms. Raicovich’s removal, and one of them, Councilman Rory I. Lancman, said in an interview this month that he is still awaiting the results of the museum’s investigation into the matter.

“The museum discriminated against a Jewish organization in a way that I think makes it impossible for her to serve as the head of the museum,” he said. “I have given the board of the museum the opportunity to conduct a thorough investigation and present me with facts showing me she’s not at fault, and she should not be removed, but they haven’t done so yet.”

Mr. Coleman said the museum’s board could not elaborate on its ongoing investigation, but he expected it to be concluded by the end of November.

Ms. Raicovich said the decision regarding the Israel event, which was made by the board, simply had to do with an application of the museum’s space rental practice, which has not permitted art fund-raisers, auctions or political events. The board then decided to overrule its initial decision and allow the event upon realizing that a museum official had led the Israeli Ambassador to believe the rental would proceed.

“The decision was not anti-Semitic,” Ms. Raicovich said. “The accusation is very painful. This is not who I am. My grandmother helped young Jewish men escape across the border out of fascist Italy during the war. My husband is the grandson of Holocaust survivors. I have dedicated my career to freedom of expression, inclusiveness and civic discourse.”

For Ms. Raicovich, immigration issues are also personal. Her father is Italian; her mother, Italian-American. Raised mostly in Roslyn, N.Y., she also spent years in Milan and Bucharest as a child when her father worked as a banker there.

The Queens Museum — built as a pavilion for the 1939 World’s Fair and then home to the United Nations General Assembly before becoming a museum in 1972 — was physically in her life at an early age; she learned to drive a stick shift nearby, often stalling in front of its entrance.

After a brief stint at the Guggenheim, she spent 10 years at Dia Art Foundation, before joining the nonprofit Creative Time in 2012 to expand the organization’s international presence.

Because the Queens Museum has a collaborative quality and loyal staff similar to that of Dia and Creative Time, Ms. Raicovich said she felt “at home” in becoming director. Nevertheless, she said there has been a learning curve in “understanding what it means to be in Queens.”

“What is hyper local here is intrinsically linked to what is international,” she said.

In addition to mounting exhibitions like the artist Patty Chang’s multimedia “Wandering Lake” or “Never Built New York,” about unrealized architectural plans, the museum offers Immigrant Movement International, a community storefront space on Roosevelt Avenue that provides free educational, health and legal services. And the museum will in the next few years house a branch of the Queens Public Library.

“The highest-level curatorial program also has to be rooted in the realm of the real,” Ms. Raicovich said.

“To be a responsible citizen in a democracy, one has to be involved in a kind of civic engagement,” she added. “Culture has a huge role to play in that. And museums have a huge role to play in that.”","At Queens Museum, the Director Is as Political as the Art",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/08/arts/design/queens-museum-laura-raicovich-daca.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

For low-income families, the result would be identical to Senator Sanders’s plan — no premium, no deductible, no gaps in coverage.

For middle-income families, the plan would not provide first-dollar coverage, but it would be much more affordable than plans now offered on the Affordable Care Act exchanges. Today, a 40-year-old pays an average premium of $4,970 for an individual “silver” plan, according to a study by HealthPocket.com, and faces maximum out-of-pocket costs of $6,449. For a family of four, the maximum out-of-pocket cost would be $12,952, and the premium would be higher, too. That is far more than the $4,600 maximum exposure for a family earning $80,000 under the hypothetical universal catastrophic coverage formula outlined above. Subsidies under Obamacare reduce total costs for families with lower incomes, but their costs would be lower under the plan, too.

Of course, a $4,600 deductible is not trivial for a middle-class family. Some families would opt for supplemental insurance, like that now purchased by many Medicare beneficiaries, to cover costs incurred before universal catastrophic coverage kicked in. But premiums for this type of supplemental insurance would be far lower than for policies now sold on A.C.A. exchanges, because maximum claims would be capped at the deductible.

Another feature that should be especially attractive to liberals: universal catastrophic coverage would apply to everyone regardless of work arrangement. Under the current system, workers at large corporations enjoy employer-sponsored insurance, while employees of small businesses or the self-employed typically have to scrape together what coverage they can.

If employers thought it would help them attract good workers, they could offer supplemental coverage to help cover universal catastrophic coverage deductibles — although there would be no tax benefit for doing that instead of just paying higher wages. Ending the tax exclusion for employer-sponsored insurance would save the government about $235 billion per year, which would go a long way toward covering the cost of universal catastrophic coverage.

“But,” some readers may say, “why not go all the way to a single-payer system like they have in Europe?”

Part of the answer is that most health care systems are not, in fact, single payer. European health care systems include some where the governments pay medical bills directly and others where private insurers or nonprofit sickness funds play a role. Some provide first-dollar coverage, while others require deductibles and co-payments. In some countries clinics and hospitals are state-owned; in others they are private or nonprofits.

Even the Sanders plan is not true single-payer, since it allows both patients and providers to opt out if they think they can do better outside the system. Universal catastrophic coverage would bring the United States into the club of nations that provide universal, affordable health care without exactly copying any one system.

More important, what we should be asking is not whether we want single-payer health care but whether single-party health care reform will get us to universal access. The Democrats-only A.C.A. was a step forward, but one with deep technical flaws. Republican-only efforts to repeal and replace the A.C.A., had they been enacted, would have only worsened the problems of high costs and gaps in coverage.

Universal catastrophic coverage has the potential to be a compromise that could appeal to pragmatists in both parties and break the political stalemate.",A Health Care Plan That’s Universal and Bipartisan,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/09/opinion/universal-catastrophic-health-care-coverage.html

With the Louvre’s magnificent interior architecture enhancing the composition of his shots, Mr. Guilbert chose to use the same light that illuminates the masterworks, to strong effect.
Then she stamped the backs of the canvases with a Louvre seal, added her own signature and escorted them from the museum.
“The Metro is like the subway in New York,” Mr. Guilbert said.","Andre Martin and Renaud Wald made off with the paintings from the Louvre without triggering the dreaded “red procedure.” That’s the high-tech system that automatically seals exits and locks doors throughout the vast museum within two minutes of a security breach. The duo then carried the artworks to a nearby Metro station and casually boarded a train.

Just two cool customers who just pulled off the most brazen daylight art heist ever captured on film?

Non. The two are Louvre copyists, upholders of what Ivan Guilbert, a Parisian photojournalist, calls “a beautiful tradition” that dates to the French Revolution. In November 1793, one month after Marie Antoinette was beheaded, the revolutionary national assembly declared the Louvre Palace, Louis XIV’s former residence on the Right Bank of the Seine, open to the public. All citizens were welcomed to enjoy the national art treasures stored there, previously for the pleasure of the golden carriage set only.

Called the Central Museum of the Arts of the Republic, the people’s musée took the democratic ideal a step further. Any professional, amateur or aspiring painter was invited to enter the museum, set up an easel — provided free of charge to this day — and have a go at copying a masterpiece.

Thousands have since followed suit. Among them are such art history boldfaced names as Paul Cézanne, Edgar Degas, Marc Chagall, Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dalí. The goal for them, and the present-day copyists whom Mr. Guilbert photographed for Le Parisien Magazine, is to learn the secrets of color, technique and composition by copying the works of some of the greatest artists of all time. “It’s like a free school,” says Mr. Guilbert.

“You have to copy and recopy the masters,” Degas once said, “and it’s only after having proved oneself as a good copyist that you can reasonably try to do a still life of a radish.”

The ambitions of the copyists Mr. Guilbert photographed went well beyond fruits and vegetables. Marius Allier, a 26-year-old graduate of the School of Fine Arts in Paris, drew crowds as he tackled Eugène Delacroix’s “Women of Algiers (in their Apartment).” The 1834 painting presents challenges that have made it long popular among copyists, including Picasso, who later painted his own variations in the 1950s.

Catherine Balpe, an amateur painter, copied Theodore Chasseriau’s 1843 portrait, “The Two Sisters,” as a gift for her husband. Sam Rachamin journeyed from his home in Israel to render his copy of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres’s 1808 painting, “The Bather.”

Mr. Martin, 58, is a professional painter — but of houses, not canvases. A self-taught artist who paints using an easel and much smaller brushes when he’s not climbing ladders, copied “View of Pirna from the Sonnenstein Castle” by the Italian artist Bernardo Bellotto.

Though the Louvre, unlike other leading museums, does not charge copyists for the privilege, applicants can wait up to two years for one of the 250 permits the museum issues annually. Valid for three months, it allows them to work in the museum’s galleries from 9:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. most days, except Sundays and holidays, from September through June.

Tourists and other museum visitors can bring cameras into the Louvre and take pictures. But because Mr. Guilbert planned to shoot for publication, he applied for, and received permission to spend three days in the galleries with the copyists. “For me, the assignment was like a romantic experience,” he says.

With the Louvre’s magnificent interior architecture enhancing the composition of his shots, Mr. Guilbert chose to use the same light that illuminates the masterworks, to strong effect. “I never used a flash,” he says. “It’s most interesting to work with what you’re given.”

Finished with their copies, Mssrs. Martin and Wald, a photographer who copied Agnolo Bronzino’s “Portrait of a Man Holding a Statuette,” met with Isabelle Vieilleville, director of the Louvre’s copy office. To guard against forgeries, she checked that the two copyists had used canvases that were one-fifth smaller or larger than the original, and that the original artists’ signatures were not reproduced on the copies. Then she stamped the backs of the canvases with a Louvre seal, added her own signature and escorted them from the museum.

On the train, masterworks in hand, they drew little more than a double take or two. “The Metro is like the subway in New York,” Mr. Guilbert said. “There was not really much reaction from the other passengers. They have seen it all.”

One of the Displaced Dinners speakers is a gay Syrian refugee named Lutfi who was persecuted for many years for his sexual orientation.
But when I told her I am a Syrian refugee, she stopped joking with me.
Mr. al-Jokhadar, who said his fellow Syrians are more affectionate and excitable than Canadians, finds himself reminding new arrivals of two things.
“We did it at Walmart and people thought we were gay” Mr. al-Jokhadar said of himself and a friend.","If you start chatting with your Ethiopian cabdriver, it can be rude to ask a lot of questions about Addis Ababa or the Great Rift Valley — he probably wants to be perceived as American, not Ethiopian.

But how should we proceed when the foreigner in question is a refugee, and was forced to leave his country? Nasser Jab, a founder of Displaced Dinners, encourages inquiry: “Americans don’t want to come off as offensive, so they don’t ask questions. But the only way to learn is to ask.”

Some people who work with refugees, however, take a slightly different tack. Kate McCaffrey, an associate professor of anthropology at Montclair State University and a founder of the Syria Supper Club (similar to Displaced Dinners, only these meals take place in an American host’s home), stressed delicacy.

She said, “If you were meeting someone who just went through a traumatic divorce, you wouldn’t necessarily say, ‘So tell me about the divorce — whose fault was it?’ You can have a very successful evening without delving into the past. And you don’t show up at a dinner party with a bag of used clothes.”

Dr. McCaffrey remembered one Syria Supper Club dinner she attended shortly after the organization was started in December 2015. “One of the cooks introduced herself to us all with, ‘Hi, I’m a Syrian refugee and I appreciate your help.’ People responded, ‘Oh, we’re so glad to be here, we really want to help you!’ But my partner and I didn’t want the conversation to go that way. We want to reinforce the idea of these folks being new neighbors. We want to reinforce their dignity. I’m not sure that storytelling is empowering.”

Indeed, even the word “refugee,” loaded as it is with meaning, can throw Americans off balance. One of the Displaced Dinners speakers is a gay Syrian refugee named Lutfi who was persecuted for many years for his sexual orientation. Disowned by his family and arrested in both Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, he now lives in New York and works at a clothing store in SoHo.

Lutfi takes no issue with his official designation: “I don’t have a problem with ‘refugee.’ I’m a very proud ‘refugee’!” However, he added, “One girl at work, the first week we were very friendly. But when I told her I am a Syrian refugee, she stopped joking with me. Suddenly just ‘hello’ and ‘goodbye.’”

Some relief workers suggest that the best way to navigate these shores is to let the refugee steer the conversation, and to be discreet about using the “r” word. Hisham Zawil, who runs the International Rescue Committee’s office in Oakland, Calif., said that a person who has worked in the group’s youth program for two years “has never talked to these kids about their refugee story or where they’re coming from. It’s sometimes not appropriate.”

Manal Kahi, a founder of Eat Offbeat, a New York City catering company staffed with refugees, said of her employees: “They are chefs. We emphasize that they are chefs before we mention their refugee status.”

Another misperception that many Americans have is that all refugees are poor. “A lot of our chefs come from the middle class or even upper class,” Ms. Kahi said. “It makes it hard to be seen as someone who needs charity.”

Sam Jisri, the executive director of Syrian Active Volunteers, a resettlement agency in Ontario, told the story of Ahmet, who fled the bombing in Damascus with his family last year, losing one of his children to a bomb in Lebanon before reaching Canada. Once in Ontario, Ahmet overheard one resettlement volunteer ask another, “Why does Ahmet have an iPhone 5?”

Mr. Jisri said, “Ahmet looked at him and said, ‘I had what you have. But unfortunately I lost it. It wasn’t in my hands to have this war. But I still have my iPhone.’”

Americans are also sometimes wont to overvalue the solaces of their own country. “Refugees are being welcomed to a place that they don’t necessarily want to be,” Mr. Zawil said. “That’s tough for people to understand. An American native who’s very well intentioned might say, ‘You must be really happy that you’re in California!’ But to someone who’s just lost his home, that might be the last thing on his mind.”

Mohammed al-Jokhadar, a founding member of the Syrian Thanksgiving Group, which delivers meals to shelters in Halifax, Nova Scotia, made mostly by refugees and Syrian-Americans, said that a Syrian refugee asked him, “Are there any legal repercussions to me getting help from a psychiatrist?”

“In Syria, it exists, psychological therapy,” Mr. al-Jokhadar said. “But most people, especially older ones, don’t try it.” Mr. al-Jokhadar said that it may help if American and Canadian natives subtly let it be known to refugees if they themselves have sought psychological counseling.

But the greatest need, of course, is for Americans to educate themselves about the mores of their newcomers. Mr. al-Jokhadar, who said his fellow Syrians are more affectionate and excitable than Canadians, finds himself reminding new arrivals of two things. First, “In Arabic, you say that you ‘love’ a friend, but in Canada, you cannot walk around saying ‘I love you’ to everybody.”

Second, locking arms with another man has a different implication in the Western world. “We did it at Walmart and people thought we were gay” Mr. al-Jokhadar said of himself and a friend. “They were looking at us weird.” He has experienced similar misunderstandings when kissing other Syrian men on the cheek.

In an ideal world, the differences between the two parties — native and newcomer — would work to each party’s advantage. Consider the case of Jo Du, who was married in Guelph, Ontario, in September. Just hours before her ceremony, the zipper on her wedding dress broke. No one in her bridal party knew how to fix it, or where to find a tailor on a Sunday.

A bridesmaid ran next door to borrow a pair of pliers from a neighbor. This neighbor, it turned out, had been hosting a family of Syrian refugees for four days; the father of the family had been a tailor in Aleppo for 28 years. The father and his young son scurried over to the bride’s house, sewing kit in tow: wedding saved.

When the wedding photographer posted the serendipitous turn of events on Facebook, one of the photographer’s friends offered the tailor a five-thread table sewing machine for free. Another person set up an online fund-raising page to cover the health care costs of the tailor and his family.

In the end, resettlement is not a one-way street. When I asked Lutfi how he felt about the word “refugee,” he proudly said, “From the third world to the first!” But the first world must also voyage.","New Neighbors, New Considerations",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/04/style/refugee-dinners.html

When Hawkins was inducted into the Hall of Fame, he was asked about being denied an N.B.A.
and was able to play basketball.","The former playground phenom could dunk the ball at age 11, when he was 6 feet 2 inches. He became one of the finest players in New York City high school basketball history, starring in Brooklyn and being named a first-team all-American. Growing into a 6-foot-8-inch frame, he possessed unusually large hands and a talent for bursting through defenses before slamming down a dunk.

But by the time he reached the grandest stage in basketball, the N.B.A., he was at an advanced age for a rookie and recovering from knee surgery.

By then, a basketball career that had held so much potential for greatness had been damaged by the suspicions — unsubstantiated — that he had been involved in a collegiate point-shaving scandal in the early 1960s.

Recovering from the setback proved to be an enormous emotional challenge.

“It was totally devastating,” Hawkins told NBA.com in 2009. “I was innocent, but no one would listen to me. Plus, coming from a poor family, no one even thought about trying to get a lawyer to fight it. We just weren’t that sophisticated.”

Other players in the league shared the view that he had been mistreated. When Hawkins was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1992, Bob Lanier, the former Detroit Pistons center, who was part of that class, said Hawkins had “never got his just due,” adding, “because obviously the media wasn’t big then.”

Lanier marveled at Hawkins’s skills. Referring to Erving, he remarked how Hawkins “was doing these wild, swooping kind of moves before anyone knew about Dr. J.”

Hawkins had been recruited by numerous colleges before enrolling at the University of Iowa in 1961. But he never a played a game there.

College basketball at the time was engulfed in its second point-shaving scandal after players had received money from gamblers to affect the final score of games. Hawkins was questioned by the New York City authorities about possible connections with one of the fixers, but he was never accused of wrongdoing. Nonetheless, he was barred from collegiate play and the N.B.A.

Hawkins played one season in the American Basketball League and two seasons with the Globetrotters and was a star in his two seasons in the American Basketball Association, which later merged with the N.B.A.

Hawkins’s path to the N.B.A. was buoyed in part by a 1969 article in Life magazine by David Wolf. “Evidence recently uncovered,” Mr. Wolf wrote, “indicates that Connie Hawkins never knowingly associated with gamblers, that he never introduced a player to a fixer, and that the only damaging statements about his involvement were made by Hawkins himself — as a terrified, semiliterate teenager who thought he’d go to jail unless he said what the D.A.’s detectives pressed him to say.”

On Hawkins’s behalf, Roslyn Litman, a civil liberties activist, along with her husband and law partner, S. David Litman, and another lawyer, Howard Specter, sued the N.B.A. on antitrust grounds, arguing that the league had in effect illegally barred Hawkins and deprived him of the “opportunity to earn a livelihood.”

They won. The league paid Hawkins a settlement of nearly $1.3 million and dropped the ban. Hawkins joined the N.B.A. in 1969 and became an instant star with the Suns.

Mr. Wolf recounted the Hawkins case in 1972 in the book “Foul!: The Connie Hawkins Story.” Jonathan B. Segal, writing in The New York Times Book Review, said it showed “how an underprivileged black man was victimized by a fat-cat, unfeeling Establishment.”

Cornelius Hawkins was born on July 17, 1942, in Brooklyn. He was introduced to basketball as a youngster in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn by a New York City police officer, Gene Smith, who helped run recreational programs at a Y.M.C.A.

His career at Boys High School in Bedford-Stuyvesant was capped by his being named a first-team high school all-American by Parade magazine in 1960.

“My model was Elgin Baylor,” he told The Times in 1992, recalling the forward known for his superb body control when playing with the Minneapolis and Los Angeles Lakers. “My friends and I used to sneak into the old Madison Square Garden to see him play. Before Baylor, basketball was a more stand-up-and-shoot game.”

Hawkins averaged more than 24 points a game, sixth best in the N.B.A., in his first season with the Suns, and he was named to the all-N.B.A. first team.

He put up impressive numbers for several more years, but when his skills began to erode he was traded to the Lakers early in the 1973-74 season.

The Lakers dealt him to the Atlanta Hawks before the 1975-76 season, and after one season with them he retired, having averaged 16.5 points a game in his N.B.A. career.

Hawkins later worked in recreational programs for youth in Pittsburgh and was hired by the Suns as a community ambassador in 1992.

A list of survivors was not immediately available.

When Hawkins was inducted into the Hall of Fame, he was asked about being denied an N.B.A. career for so long. He displayed no rancor.

“My attitude was that had I not played in the A.B.A., I wouldn’t have a job,” The Boston Globe quoted him as saying. “Had I not played with the Globetrotters, I would not have learned the experience and traveled around the world. Those things helped me out and gave me a different style of play once I got into the N.B.A.”

Asked whether induction gave him a sense of vindication, he responded: “My vindication was that I got into the N.B.A. and was able to play basketball. This was icing on the cake.”","Connie Hawkins, Electrifying N.B.A. Forward Barred in His Prime, Dies at 75",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/obituaries/connie-hawkins-dead.html

With a history dating back to the dinosaurs, trees are the planet’s documentarians, watching us cycle through life while providing oxygen, shade and shelter. Trees, the oldest of which, according to Peter Wohlleben’s “The Hidden Life of Trees,” has 9,500 years, are a critical part of the human experience. We rely on them, from their deep roots to fluttering leaves.

But — at least when we’re not cutting them down — how do we influence trees? Diane Cook and Len Jenshel present some answers in their new book, “Wise Trees,” which will be published by Abrams in October. Traveling to more than 70 locations, they found trees that represent “landscapes of complexity where nature and humanity converge.” In other words, trees with stories, like the young sycamore that witnessed the Civil War, or the elm that survived the Oklahoma City bombing. These photos show how events have shaped trees, their energy, and sometimes, literally, the shape of their limbs.

“Forty-million trees are being lost every day,” said Mr. Jenshel. “We love the environment and wanted to do something that would make people think differently about trees.”

Though Mr. Jenshel and Ms. Cook — who are married, collaborate on all their projects and frequently finish each other’s sentences — have a long history of photographing trees, a much more personal seed for their project was planted in the spring of 2012. They were in Japan documenting a nighttime cherry tree ritual when Ms. Cook learned that her father was dying. Struggling to process the information, she found herself watching the fragile petals of the cherry blossoms slowly drift to the ground, one by one.

“We did what the Japanese have been doing for centuries,” said Ms. Cook. “To take in that beauty, appreciate its ephemeral nature, and know that life does go on.”

Her father died soon after, but a new project was born, influenced by the cherry blossoms and a National Geographic magazine commission. “Taking that strength from the trees, we had this idea of looking at wise trees around the world,” said Ms. Cook. “And the importance trees have had throughout history in so many cultures.”

After the Sept. 11 attacks, search and rescue workers were looking for human remains among the rubble, when they found part of a Callery pear tree, which traditionally is the first tree to bloom in spring and the last to change leaves in autumn. Though its trunk was scorched and many branches missing, the tree had survived the attacks. Now a symbol of strength and survival, the pear tree was nursed back to health at a Bronx nursery and, nearly a decade later, replanted at the World Trade Center memorial.

Other trees have been a part of unspeakable cruelties. From 1846 to 1870, in Goliad, Tex., an oak known as “The Hanging Tree,” provided shade for court sessions and branches for lynching.

“It’s not always a happy story,” said Ms. Cook.

One of the rain or monkeypod trees in Cambodia (imported from South or Central America), was isolated from the others as “The Killing Tree.” In 1975 when Pol Pot’s murderous rule started, the tree was used to bash children’s heads while their mothers were forced to watch.

“It took us days to recover from that experience of photographing that tree,” said Ms. Cook. “That left the deepest scar on us.”

Other trees seem to travel, and quite far. It is not clear how the adansonia gregorii (or boab) tree got to Western Australia. Perhaps it was the result of seeds dropped from the fruits by early migrants. It was a good thing, though, for the local aboriginals who used the tree as a spiritual home and lifeline, since it can hold up to 26 gallons of water.

In India, from the ancient tree deities to current bodhis of enlightenment, most trees are seen as sacred. In a Varanasi sweet shop, they found a neem tree, said to cure all ailments. Long after they shot the photo, Ms. Cook noticed her spouse’s anxiety.

“Len kept saying, ‘I don’t think we got the picture. I need to go back to that tree,’” Ms. Cook recalled. “I totally knew it was about the sweets.”

They sent the company scrambling to do damage control, with Bob Weinstein outlining the fallout in an email to Mr. Weinstein’s legal adviser, Lisa Bloom.

“The Democrats are giving Harvey’s money back,” he wrote on Friday morning, referring to politicians who were unloading political contributions they had received from Mr. Weinstein to women’s groups. “Women’s rights organizations are offended by his actions and are now calling for him to be fired. Actors and actresses in the community are appalled at Harvey and have gone on the record as such.”

The situation was complicated by Harvey Weinstein’s response to the Times article, swinging wildly between contrition and attack. In a statement on Thursday, he acknowledged that “the way I’ve behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologize for it,” while likening his personal flaws to those of the rapper Jay-Z, who apologized on his most recent album to his wife, Beyoncé, for cheating on her.

Mr. Weinstein said he was planning to get help, but within hours, he had threatened to sue The Times for defamation. And in her own statement released on Thursday, Ms. Bloom said Mr. Weinstein “denies many of the accusations as patently false.”

Ms. Bloom told the company’s board on Thursday that Mr. Weinstein was planning to follow through with a lawsuit, and that board members could expect “more and different reporting” that would include “photos of several of the accusers in very friendly poses with Harvey after his alleged misconduct.”

Mr. Maerov voiced anger in an email response to Ms. Bloom, saying her approach and public comments were “definitely fanning the flames and compounding the problem” and contending that she had a conflict of interest because Mr. Weinstein had agreed to turn a book she wrote into a TV series.

“This is not the time for Harvey or TWC to appear defiant or indignant,” he wrote, using an abbreviation for the Weinstein Company. “It is time to repair, heal, accept responsibility and recover.”

He wrote that “publishing pictures of victims in friendly poses with Harvey will backfire as it suggests they are exculpatory or negate any harm done to them through alleged actions.”

Bob Weinstein put it this way in his email to Ms. Bloom: “Perhaps, Harvey as he stated in the NY Times, to the world, should get professional help for a problem that really exists.”

On Saturday, Ms. Bloom resigned as an adviser to Mr. Weinstein. She offered no explanation, saying only that it was her understanding “that Mr. Weinstein and his board are moving toward an agreement.”

She said in an interview Saturday afternoon that there was a large team handling Mr. Weinstein’s defense and that she personally “did not release photos of accusers” to the news media. She also denied that her work with Mr. Weinstein created a conflict of interest.

Mr. Weinstein also parted ways with another adviser, Lanny Davis, a lawyer and crisis counselor who served as special counsel to President Bill Clinton. He and Mr. Weinstein had disagreed over how to handle the sexual harassment allegations, with Mr. Davis advising a more conciliatory approach than Mr. Weinstein seemed willing to adopt.

In recent days, other women have gone public with accusations of sexual misconduct by Mr. Weinstein, including a former news anchor who said he had trapped her in the hallway of a restaurant that was closed to the public and masturbated in front of her.

For decades, Mr. Weinstein had cultivated an image as a liberal power broker, raising money for Hillary Clinton, briefly employing Malia Obama as an intern and calling himself an advocate for women. President Trump, who has himself been accused of making unwelcome advances toward women, told reporters on Saturday that he had known Mr. Weinstein “for a long time” and was “not at all surprised to see” the reports.

For the past week, many women in Hollywood, frustrated with an industry that seems stuck perpetually sexualizing and mistreating women, had been watching closely to see where the Weinstein revelations would lead.

“I see this as a tipping point,” Jenni Konner, executive producer of the HBO series “Girls,” said on Sunday. “This is the moment we look back on and say, ‘That’s when it all started to change.’”

The firing of Mr. Weinstein by his own company, Ms. Konner said, “is going to scare any man in Hollywood using his power for anything but making movies and television.”",Harvey Weinstein Is Fired After Sexual Harassment Reports,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/08/business/harvey-weinstein-fired.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

They wait on a platform at the Milan train station in 1970, their many suitcases secured with rope, their bags filled to the brim. A box of panettone, a Milanese holiday specialty, accompanies this family of travelers, suggesting Christmastime. Dressed for the cold, the family of five — parents, children, and an older woman wearing black from head to toe — gaze to the right, pondering perhaps their unknown destinies. We see them in Gianni Berengo Gardin’s photograph, shot at mid-distance from above, a portrait of Italy as a migrant nation.

I know these people.

No, they are not my family, but they could be. My parents left their respective mountain towns for New York City two decades earlier than those in the photo, fleeing the destruction, the penury and the hopelessness of post-World War II Italy.

The family on the platform could have easily been one of the multitudes of migrating Italians I encountered on trains when I lived in Milan and Bologna in the mid-1970s, traveling between their hometowns and northern Italian cities, Switzerland, Germany, and other enchanted places of drudgery, sacrifice and desires, temporary stops along an unending journey toward security.

Indeed, Italians keep leaving now, not with the same desperation of the undereducated masses that changed the course of nations in North and South America beginning in the 19th century, but with college degrees and smartphones in hands, grasping for opportunities their country remains incapable of providing.

These images from the mid-20th century capture the ubiquity and possibility of travel and escape, from the gaggle of scugnizzi (street urchins) hitching a ride on the back of a Neapolitan tram to a couple cuddling in their bathing suits, nestled between train tracks. I know them too, having met them in my own travels across the peninsula, heard about them in family stories on both sides of the Atlantic, and encountered them through the countless viewings of films by the likes of Vittorio De Sica, Federico Fellini, and Michelangelo Antonioni.

The 31 black-and-white images displayed in the London gallery exhibition of Gardin’s work, “The Italians,” are, for the most part, those he made in the midcentury, when Italy hovered between agrarian provincialism and an internationally touted cosmopolitanism. The meta-image of an Asian tourist posing for a photographic portrait against a Mediterranean backdrop highlights Italy as destination, in stark disparity to the fleeing migrant family.

Contrasts are a leitmotif for Gardin, as seen with the seven girls in communion whites delighted by a dark-haired dog before them, or the jangle of men on a train, caught in mirrored reflections. The pairing of Italy with style and leisure is found in the photos of an elegantly veiled woman in sunglasses and pearls aboard what appears to be a Venetian water taxi, and the portly man in bathing trunks beatifically splayed on an outcrop, the sea below a resounding swirl.

Photo

Gardin is a master of the patterned panorama, vistas of startling beauty shot from above: In one image a donkey-driven plow cuts a billowing swath across an astonishingly stark landscape and in another, two men scurry across a plank in a flooded Piazza San Marco. These are captured flashes of haunting revelation.

His images are not merely of the real, the documented — they are also reveries of the imagination. Lovers, clothed but barefoot, embrace on a beach. A blanket, a pair of shoes and vinyl records in the foreground.

I know them, too.

“It’s not about Christopher Columbus,” Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said of the holiday. “It’s about the millions of Italian-Americans who came to this country under hard circumstances and made it what it is.”

While some historians have warned against removing statues and monuments, out of the need to preserve history, others say the time is now.

Elizabeth Ellis, a professor of early American and native history at N.Y.U., and a citizen of the Peoria Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma, described these public spaces as snapshots of what’s important to our society.

“Historically, we have to remember that we create monuments and holidays as elements of national mythmaking, as ways to celebrate our heritage,” she said. “You can see the founding of the U.S. in many ways, but I think our national understanding of who we are and what matters changes over time.”

“You can never erase history,” Mr. Matias added, “but you can pick who in history we honor.”

Los Angeles County, Seattle, Denver and Albuquerque have already replaced Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples Day. New York, at least for now, will continue celebrating both.

Last month, we asked you vote in a statewide contest to choose the best “I Voted” sticker for Election Day in November.

The ballots are in, and you can check out the winning design here: It celebrates the 100th anniversary of women winning the right to vote in New York, and the woman on the sticker is the New York suffragist Rosalie Jones.

In 1912, Ms. Jones led a 150-mile trek — on foot — from New York City to Albany with other “suffragist pilgrims” to hand-deliver a petition to the governor.

When the group arrived in the upstate capital after two weeks of travel, The Times reported, the streets of Albany were filled with cheering onlookers.

“We have done the thing we set out to do, and in that thought alone there is much satisfaction.” Ms. Jones said, according to The Times. “But we have done more than that. We have had a chance to talk to the men and women of the rural districts. They have come to know us, and many of them believe in us and in the cause we represent.”

Five years later, in 1917, women won the right to vote in New York, and in 1920, the passing of the 19th Amendment granted the same right to women across the United States.

Over the years, and almost without meaning to, I have become an obsessive collector — not of objects but of recipes. I have accumulated boxes’ and files’ worth. I search for them casually in print and online, and relentlessly, determinedly and often shamelessly when I’m out, whether close to home or traveling. I eavesdrop as I wait in line at the market, and sometimes, if I think there’s the possibility of nabbing something special, I’ll muster the courage to wriggle into the conversation. I ask shopkeepers how they prepare whatever it is they sell, which is how I came to cook a turkey at a temperature so low I feared it wouldn’t be ready to eat until the next day (its slow-roasted skin was burnished and its meat moist). I take notes when I taste something I like in a restaurant and then spend days in my kitchen trying to recreate it. And sometimes recipes just come to me, by mail, by good luck or through the front door, which is how my first visiting cake arrived.

The cake, protected by a tea towel and nestled in a basket, was given to me by its baker, Ingela Helgesson, a woman I’d talked with now and then at a local farm store in Connecticut. Ingela was searching for the perfect kitchen sink, and I invited her to come see mine; the cake was her unnecessary — but much appreciated — thanks. It was a butter cake, round and low, a few sliced almonds baked into its golden top. It was both unassuming and immensely inviting, but it was the story of the cake that I loved most. Ingela’s mother, who taught her to make the cake in their native Sweden, said it came together so speedily that you could start mixing the batter the moment you spied visitors coming up the walk. By the time they were settled in your home, the cake would be ready to serve.

The name charmed me. It evoked images of pilgrims as well as of potlucks, of picnics in town and country, of weekends with friends and treats to tide you over on long trips.

Fifteen years later, I’ve christened dozens of “visiting cakes” of my own devising, no matter if I’ve taken them far away or left them in the kitchen to be enjoyed for days. My visiting cakes might be Bundt cakes, simple yet often fanciful, with swirls, stripes and crenelations molded into the pans they are baked in. They might be sheet cakes that can be cut into squares, or rounds, like Ingela’s, which make nice wedges. But most often they’re compact loaves, sometimes squat, sometimes flat and many times crowned, their centers cracked in volcanic fault lines.

What separates a visiting cake from all other cakes is its sturdiness — it’s built to be wrapped, packed and bundled, to travel and to retain its goodness for at least the span of a long weekend. This often precludes frostings and fussy decorations and means that the cake’s clarion qualities are its flavor and its texture, which tips toward moist, firm and easily sliceable, like poundcakes (which make fine visiting cakes). What all the cakes have in common is that they are meant to be shared. The joy of community is implicit in their name.

My lemon-spice visiting cake is one I bake regularly. Among its virtues are the quickness with which it’s made; the need for only a whisk to blend the batter; the fact that, like many spice cakes, it’s good when you make it and even better a day or two later, when the spices have had time to find their way into the cake; and that it is both homely and beautiful — its golden honey color and solid shape promise comfort and satisfaction.

A full century after the Russian Revolution, the failed alliance between Communism and Islam continues to shape the politics of the Muslim world.","Over the preceding decade, Indonesian labor activists had already established a strong union representing workers on the extensive railroad network servicing the vast plantation economy of Java and Sumatra. By 1914, the Indische Sociaal-Democratische Vereeniging, or Indies Social-Democratic Union, had expanded from labor organizing among railroad workers into broader forms of social activism and political action against colonial rule.

Photo

In particular, members began to join the Sarekat Islam, an organization founded in 1912 as a Muslim batik traders’ association that had morphed into a broader popular movement and was staging mass rallies and strikes across Java. Socialist influence within the Sarekat Islam was already evident at the movement’s congress in 1916, where the Prophet Muhammad was proclaimed to be “the father of Socialism and the pioneer of democracy” and “the Socialist par excellence.”

The Russian Revolution further inspired the Sarekat Islam. By late 1917, activists from the Indies Social-Democratic Union had begun agitating and organizing among the lower ranks of the Dutch armed forces in the Indies. Borrowing the successful tactics of the Bolsheviks in Russia, hundreds of sailors and soldiers were recruited in the hope of staging mutinies and uprisings. The Dutch colonial authorities promptly arrested and imprisoned the activists and ordered their expulsion from the Indies.

But by 1920, the Indies Social-Democratic Union had renamed itself the Communist Union of the Indies, becoming the first Communist party in Asia to join the Comintern. New unions were formed on Java and Sumatra. Peasant villagers mobilized against landowners. A railway strike briefly paralyzed the plantation belt in eastern Sumatra.

It was in this context that the legendary figure of Tan Malaka first appeared. The scion of an aristocratic family from western Sumatra, Tan Malaka had spent World War I as a student in the Netherlands. He came into contact with Socialist activists and ideas, and witnessed the short-lived Troelstra Revolution of late 1918, during which Dutch social-democrats briefly tried to emulate an ongoing revolutionary uprising in Germany. In early 1919, Tan Malaka returned to Indonesia, where he was soon drawn into labor organizing. He joined the embryonic local Communist Party, quickly ascending to its leadership — before the colonial government forced him into exile, and back to the Netherlands, in early 1922.

And so it was with early experience of the revolutionary potential of combining Communism and Islam that Tan Malaka made an appearance at the Fourth Comintern Congress in Moscow and Petrograd in 1922. There, he delivered a memorable speech about the similarities between Pan-Islamism and Communism. Pan-Islamism was not religious per se, he argued, but rather “the brotherhood of all Muslim peoples, and the liberation struggle not only of the Arab but also of the Indian, the Javanese and all the oppressed Muslim peoples.”

“This brotherhood,” he added, “means the practical liberation struggle not only against Dutch but also against English, French and Italian capitalism, therefore against world capitalism as a whole.”

The official record of the proceedings notes that Tan Malaka’s impassioned plea for an alliance between Communism and Pan-Islamism was met with “lively applause.” But his memoirs recall that after three days of heated debate following his speech, he was formally prohibited from further contributing to the proceedings. The official conclusions of the Fourth Comintern Congress, including the “Theses on the Eastern Question,” are notably ambiguous on the question of Pan-Islamism and strikingly silent on Indonesia, even though the movement there was far more successful than any other Communist mobilization in the so-called East at the time.

An alliance between Communism and Islam was not to be, neither in Indonesia nor elsewhere. The strength of Communism, as a movement, was its ability to mobilize laborers to fight for better wages and working conditions through unions, whether in oil boomtown Baku or the plantations of Java and Sumatra. But as a form of government, Communism meant one-party rule, a command economy with collectivized agriculture and party-state control over all spheres of social life — including religion.

Islamism, by contrast, was a much broader and enduringly more open-ended and ambiguous basis for political engagement. In Java and elsewhere, “Islam” provided a banner for Muslim merchants to contest economic encroachment by non-Muslims and build an infrastructure for organizing in the countryside, largely through Islamic schools. Politically, it was a supple notion: Islamist scholars and activists could be for colonialism, Communism or capitalism.

In Indonesia, tensions between Communists and Islamic leaders had already begun to divide Sarekat Islam in the early 1920s. Communists urged escalating strikes and protests, whereas Islamic leaders advocated accommodation with the Dutch colonial authorities. Sarekat Islam dissolved in the face of Dutch repression after failed rebellions in 1926-7.

In the late 1940s, Islamic parties opposed the Partai Komunis Indonesia (P.K.I.), or Indonesian Communist Party, during the struggle for independence. Islamic parties were uncomfortable with the Communists’ insistence that independence from Dutch colonial rule also upend aristocratic privileges and bring about the establishment of Socialist forms of ownership over land and industry. This conflict extended into the early post-independence period. Islamic organizations actively participated in the anti-Communist pogroms of 1965-66, which destroyed the P.K.I. and left hundreds of thousands of casualties across Indonesia.

By this time, the pattern of antagonism was well established across the Muslim world, and it persisted throughout the Cold War. The institutional and ideological boundaries of both Communism and Islamism hardened, dashing prospects for renewed experiments in political alliance-building.

In Muslim areas of the Soviet Union, the party-state suppressed institutions of Islamic worship, education, association and pilgrimage, which were viewed as obstacles to ideological and social transformation along Communist lines. Where Islamic states were established, left-wing politics was often associated with blasphemy, and outlawed. In countries like Sudan, Yemen, Syria, Iraq and Iran, Communist and other left-wing parties found themselves in bitter competition for power with Islamists.

One effect of the failure of revolutionary forces to mobilize under the joint banner of Communism and Islam was to deeply divide Muslims, weakening their capacity first to fight colonialism during the first half of 20th century and then to resist the rise of authoritarianism across the Muslim world.

As a physician who graduated from a domestic medical school, I’ve often heard others disparaging doctors who went to medical school outside the country as if they were inferior. Those complaints are not supported by data. A study from Health Affairs in 2010 found that patients with congestive heart failure or myocardial infarction had lower mortality rates when treated by doctors who were foreign medical graduates. Another from earlier this year in the BMJ found that older patients who were treated by foreign medical graduates had lower mortality as well, even though they seemed to be sicker in general.

A recent study in Annals of Internal Medicine shows that these graduates are also responsible for a significant amount of teaching. Of the 80,000 or so academic physicians in the country, more than 18 percent were foreign medical graduates. More than 15 percent of full professors in medical schools in the United States were educated elsewhere, most often in Asia, Western Europe, the Middle East, Latin America and the Caribbean.

Foreign medical graduates also do a lot of research. Although they are ineligible for some National Institutes of Health funding — which is granted only to citizens of this country — they still manage, through collaboration, to be primary investigators on 12.5 percent of grants. They led more than 18 percent of clinical trials in the United States and were responsible for about 18 percent of publications in the medical literature.

“Our findings suggest that, by some metrics, these doctors account for almost one fifth of academic scholarship in the United States,” said the lead author of the study, Dhruv Khullar, who is a physician at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, a researcher at Weill Cornell and a contributor to The Upshot. “The diversity of American medicine — and the conversations, ideas and breakthroughs this diversity sparks — may be one reason for our competitiveness as a global leader in biomedical research and innovation.”

The United States is not the only country that relies on doctors trained or educated in other countries. We’re not even the country with the highest percentage of such physicians. According to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, almost 58 percent of physicians practicing in Israel are foreign medical graduates. About 40 percent of the doctors in New Zealand and Ireland were trained outside those countries.

Because of the sizes of those nations, even though the percentages of foreign medical graduates are higher there, the total numbers aren’t as high as in the United States. In 2015, the O.E.C.D. estimated that the United States had more than 213,000 foreign-trained doctors, and no other country was close. Britain had about 48,000, Germany had about 35,000, and Australia, France and Canada had between 22,000 and 27,000.

For years, I’ve listened to doctors tell me stories of physicians who leave Canada — because they were dissatisfied about working in a single-payer health care system. That might have been true decades ago. But in the last 10 years, that number has dropped precipitously. The number of Canadians returning to their country to practice may actually be higher than the number leaving.

Although many feared that coverage expansions from the Affordable Care Act might lead to an overwhelmed physician work force, that didn’t happen. That doesn’t mean that America doesn’t have a shortage of physician services, especially when it comes to the care of the oldest, the poorest and the most geographically isolated among us.

The proposals have won converts among city leaders who have been unable to marshal the resources or political will to deal with the homeless crisis.

Progress, they say, has been thwarted by skyrocketing housing costs that have pushed more Californians into destitution.

The encampment proposals are divisive. Supporters see them as a humane path to permanent housing in the absence of another good alternative.

Critics worry that they could foster complacency in the battle to create affordable housing.

And residents bring a host of safety and sanitation concerns connected to where the encampments would be placed.

San Diego’s proposal was catapulted onto the city’s agenda this year for public health reasons as a devastating hepatitis A outbreak took aim at the homeless population.

Bob McElroy, president of the Alpha Project, a charity that will operate the camp on a city lot near Balboa Park, said the long-term goal was to get people into permanent housing.

“But what do people do in the meantime? Die in the streets?” he said. “There’s got to be a starting point.”

The Dodgers are the only Californian club competing in baseball’s playoffs this year.

On Friday, Conor Dougherty, a Times reporter and Giants fan, asked readers to consider a touchy question: Was it even possible for a Giants fan to root for the Dodgers?

Let’s just say the feedback was spirited.

Some samples:

“No. Just no.”

— Margaret Stone

“I don’t know where to begin. The reporter’s premise has left me apoplectic. While I am also a die-hard Giants fan, I would no sooner root on the Dodgers than I would the I.R.S.”

— Chris Larson

“As a longtime Giants fan, I’d say the only time I’d root for the Dodgers would be if they were playing against the Taliban.”

— Pete Mastromonaco

“I’m a true blue, 54 year old, born and raised in Southern California, watch every game I can, Dodgers fan. But if my guys weren’t in the postseason and the Giants were, I’d be rooting for them! We Californians need to stick together, water rights be damned!”

— Laura Turkel

“My dad taught me two things: Love the Giants with all of your heart and hate the Dodgers with every fiber of your being. The mere thought of a playoff series between the Giants and Dodgers makes me hyperventilate.”

— Harrison Reilly

“I don’t see why not. Us SoCal residents cheered endlessly for the Giants in 2010, 2012, 2014. It’s time they returned the favor. We can keep the rivalry but at the end of the day, yes — we’re all California.”

— Nicole Villanova-Price

He continued, “If they can’t keep you down by discrimination, then they have attempted to keep you down by terror, by instilling fear in you, in me.”

The decision by Senate Republican leaders may prove to be a milestone in the decades-long fight over health insurance in the United States, suggesting that the Affordable Care Act had gained at least a reprieve and perhaps a measure of political acceptance.

Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and the chairman of the Senate health committee, and Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the senior Democrat on the panel, have been working on legislation to stabilize insurance markets and hold down premiums in the next couple of years. Both said on Tuesday that they hoped to resume those efforts.

Millions of people who buy insurance on their own face sharp increases in premiums next year, and Trump administration officials have taken a number of steps that have already undermined the operations of the health law.

And health care is sure to be an issue in next year’s midterm elections.

Senator John Thune of South Dakota, a member of the Senate Republican leadership, said the concept behind the Graham-Cassidy bill would help Republicans define their differences with Democrats in the campaign season.

“Single payer, socialism — or federalism, returning power to the states to make decisions,” Mr. Thune said. “I think that’s a great contrast for us, and I think that’s an argument eventually we can win.”

For their part, Democrats have tried to use health care as a bludgeon against the few Senate Republican targets they have next year, mainly Senators Dean Heller of Nevada and Jeff Flake of Arizona.

“We know Republicans like Dean Heller and Jeff Flake won’t stop until they force Americans to pay more for less, and we will make sure voters hold them accountable for it,” the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee said in a statement this week.

The Graham-Cassidy bill would have taken money provided under the Affordable Care Act for insurance subsidies and the expansion of Medicaid and sent it to states in the form of block grants.

The bill’s demise was welcomed by consumer groups, doctors, hospitals and insurance executives who mobilized opposition to the proposal. The Congressional Budget Office said Monday that the bill would have reduced projected federal Medicaid spending by $1 trillion over a decade, added millions of Americans to the ranks of the uninsured and eliminated consumer protections for some people with pre-existing conditions.

Senate Republicans tried in July to approve a repeal bill, but that attempt ended in defeat when Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, gave a thumbs-down, killing that version of the legislation.

This time, Senate Republicans were trying to pass a different proposal, and a deadline was fast approaching: They had only until the end of this week to pass a repeal bill using special budget rules that shield it from a Democratic filibuster.

Mr. McConnell had planned for a vote before that deadline, but he could afford to lose only two Republicans. By Tuesday, three members of his party had already gone public with their firm opposition: Ms. Collins, Mr. McCain and Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky.

None of the three senators seemed likely to change their minds. Mr. McCain detested the hasty, partisan process used to push the bill; Ms. Collins had broad concerns about the legislation’s effects on health care; and Mr. Paul objected to the fundamental architecture of the bill, which in his view constituted “fake repeal.”

Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said he saw no reason for the Senate to vote.

“If you don’t have the votes,” he said, “I don’t see why we would waste the time of the Senate.”

And other Republican senators might have opposed it had party leaders moved forward. In a statement released after Senate Republicans decided not to do so, Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who voted against the last repeal attempt in July, denounced what she described as “a lousy process.”

“The U.S. Senate cannot get the text of a bill on a Sunday night, then proceed to a vote just days later, with only one hearing — and especially not on an issue that is intensely personal to all of us,” Ms. Murkowski said, without saying which way she would have voted.

Mr. Cassidy was blunt: “We don’t have the votes,” he said, adding, “Am I disappointed? Absolutely.”

And Senator David Perdue, Republican of Georgia, was left fuming.

“I am kind of disgusted that after nine months, the self-interest is still outweighing the national interest in our caucus in some ways,” he said.

But Mr. Graham still held out the hope that the repeal proposal would pass — just later, after Republicans tackle taxes, and when Republicans can consider the repeal plan in a more deliberative fashion.

“There are 50 votes for the substance,” Mr. Graham said. “There are not 50 votes for the process.”

But that could be months away — if not years.

The tax effort will probably occupy Congress through the remainder of this year, and into next year.

After tackling the tax overhaul, Republicans could make another attempt at passing a health bill without needing any Democratic votes. But such an undertaking would require passing yet another budget blueprint, in order to protect the bill from a Democratic filibuster, and it would put health care front and center as lawmakers head into the midterm elections.

Even as Republicans shift their focus to taxes, pressure is building for a bipartisan response to the problems of the health care system. The Alexander-Murray stabilization package has two main elements: money for subsidies paid to insurance companies, to reimburse them for reducing out-of-pocket costs for low-income people, and more freedom for states to revamp their insurance markets.

Democrats see the cost-sharing subsidy payments as essential. But many Republicans, including Mr. Trump, have described them as a bailout for insurance companies that would prop up the Affordable Care Act.

“I think most of the members would suggest they really don’t know that they can stabilize the product at this stage of the game,” said Senator Mike Rounds, Republican of South Dakota. “I think there’s a number of them that are going to be very hesitant to try to put more money into a system that they are convinced is going south.”

Earlier Tuesday, with little hope of success in the Senate, Mr. Trump expressed his displeasure.

“At some point there will be a repeal and replace, but we’ll see whether or not that point is now or will it be shortly thereafter,” he said at the White House. “But we are disappointed in certain so-called Republicans.”

The failure in the Senate was also a disappointment to Republicans in the House, who managed to pass a repeal bill in May after their own struggles.

“We’re a little frustrated that the Senate has not acted on a seminal promise,” said Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin.

Then he returned to talking up the need for a tax overhaul.",Senate Republicans Say They Will Not Vote on Health Bill,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/26/us/politics/mcconnell-obamacare-repeal-graham-cassidy-trump.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss
