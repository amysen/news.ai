(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) easily beat Wall Street’s third-quarter profit expectations on Thursday, with loan growth and higher interest rates more than offsetting weakness in its markets-related unit.

Executives at the largest U.S. bank touted the diverse mix of businesses that allow JPMorgan to weather a dip in one area or another, and downplayed a 27 percent drop in bond trading revenue even though weakness has continued into the fourth quarter.

Overall, JPMorgan’s profit rose 7.1 percent in the third quarter compared with the year-ago period, to $6.73 billion, or $1.76 per share. Analysts had expected earnings of $1.65 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The bank’s total revenue of $25.33 billion also topped the average analyst estimate of $25.23 billion.

In early notes to clients, analysts characterized the results as “solid” or “pretty good,” given problems in bond trading that have affected Wall Street banks for some time.

“The results were solid but not exceptional,” said Morningstar analyst Jim Sinegal.

JPMorgan shares were down 0.4 percent at $96.48 in morning trading.

Growth in credit cards, auto loans, commercial banking and corporate advisory fees drove the results, with average core loans up 7 percent during the quarter. JPMorgan’s net interest income, or the difference between what it pays for funds and collects from lending them out, rose 10 percent.

However, markets revenue fell 21 percent as the slump in bond trading outweighed a more modest dip in equities, slightly worse than the roughly 20 percent drop Chief Executive Jamie Dimon had forecast at an event in September.

Wall Street banks have been grappling with bond market challenges for most of the past seven years, as client volumes have been depressed for a number of reasons and new regulations have restricted certain activities and made trading more expensive.

JPMorgan fared worse last quarter than rival Citigroup Inc (C.N), which reported a 16 percent decline in bond trading on Thursday. The trends bode poorly for Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), which has struggled more in bond trading recently than other Wall Street banks.

JPMorgan’s markets revenue is likely to drop again in the fourth quarter because the year-ago period was strong, Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said on a conference call with analysts.

Trading revenue during the fourth quarter of 2016 benefited from a surge in trading activity following the U.S. election.

Still, management maintained earlier guidance for full-year net interest income, expenses, charge-offs and loan growth, indicating that they expect JPMorgan’s other businesses to continue to offset capital markets pain.

During a call with reporters, Lake cited “the benefits of diversification and scale,” while Daniel Pinto, who runs JPMorgan’s investment bank, pointed to “balanced strength across diverse businesses” in a memo to employees.",Loan growth helps JPMorgan beat expectations despite trading decline,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-jpmorgan-results/loan-growth-helps-jpmorgan-beat-expectations-despite-trading-decline-idUSKBN1CH1GW?il=0

DETROIT (Reuters) - The arrival of Aston Martin’s DBX sport utility vehicle in 2019 could help more than double sales of the British sports car maker by early next decade, its chief executive told Reuters.

The company’s entry into the fast-growing super-premium SUV market “absolutely changes the business,” Andy Palmer said in an interview in the United States.

It could boost sales to as many as 12,000 vehicles a year by early in the next decade, more than double the roughly 5,000 sports cars the company expects to sell globally this year, he forecast. Aston Martin’s previous peak sales year was 2007, when it sold 7,300 cars just before the financial crisis.

Palmer said U.S. sales could reach about 1,300 cars this year, propelled by the new DB11 model. “I am not claiming success,” he said. Aston’s goal is to get over 2,000 cars a year in the United States.

The DBX will be a four-door SUV designed to compete with models such as Volkswagen AG’s Bentley Bentayga, a $229,000-and-up vehicle billed by its maker as “the fastest SUV ever built”.

The DBX’s design “is complete”, Palmer said, and the factory should be building prototypes by the end of 2018.

Aston Martin, the preferred drive of fictional British spy James Bond, is late to join the SUV mania gripping the global luxury car business.

The financial incentives are clear. In the United States, SUVs accounted for nearly 40 percent of total U.S. vehicle sales in 2016, up from 32.6 percent in 2014, and super-premium models are one of the fastest growing segments.

BREXIT

Privately-owned Aston Martin reported 94.6 million pounds ($125.1 million) of cash from operations during the first half of 2017, after years of losses. Under Palmer, a former Nissan Motor Co executive, Aston Martin has restructured and issued 550 million pounds in debt securities that are due in 2022.

That year is also near the end of Palmer’s restructuring plan. By then, Aston Martin - with the DBX SUV and the relaunch of the Lagonda brand - will have a profile similar to Ferrari, Palmer said, adding: “Ferrari is a $15 billion company.”

Decisions about a public offering or a sale of the company are up to the Kuwaiti and Italian investors who control it, Palmer said. “One assumes they will want an exit.”

Britain’s departure from the European Union could make Aston Martin’s road tougher if the two sides fail to maintain favorable trade rules, Palmer said. Non-tariff barriers that could slow deliveries in Europe “are my first concern,” he said.

“Our brand is largely rooted in the UK so it’s a tough call” to consider factories elsewhere, he added. A weaker British pound and the ability of Aston’s client base to absorb the costs of tariffs could offset Brexit costs, he said.

In the meantime, Aston Martin faces the same pressures to develop cleaner petroleum fueled engines and electric cars as better funded rivals.

Aston will eventually offer hybrid options on all its models, and will build a limited run of 155 RapidE electric cars in 2019 that will serve as a test fleet for developing a future generation of electric cars, Palmer said.

“The idea that every vehicle on the road will be electric in 2040 isn’t going to happen,” he said.

Aston’s more valuable play in the electric vehicle field could be as a consultant for electric car startups that don’t know how to build lightweight vehicles such as Aston’s aluminum- bodied sports cars.

The company recently established an engineering consulting arm. “It’s starting to get its first contracts,” Palmer said.",Sports car maker Aston Martin counts on an SUV to drive its future,https://www.reuters.com/article/astonmartin-strategy/sports-car-maker-aston-martin-counts-on-an-suv-to-drive-its-future-idINKBN1CH1PY

LONDON (Reuters) - HSBC (HSBA.L) has chosen John Flint as its next chief executive, with its newly arrived chairman promoting an insider to drive revenue growth at Europe’s biggest bank.

Flint, who runs HSBC’s retail and wealth management business out of London, will take over as CEO in February next year when Stuart Gulliver, 58, retires after seven years in the job.

The appointment is the first major decision taken by former AIA Group (1299.HK) chief Mark Tucker, who officially took up his post at HSBC just 12 days ago as its first externally-appointed chairman.

Flint, who is not related to Tucker’s predecessor Douglas Flint, is viewed by other HSBC executives as the safe option, having worked at the bank since 1989.

During his career at HSBC Flint, 49, has worked across most of its businesses and spent his first 14 years in Asia, giving him the breadth of experience seen as vital for the CEO role.

“He has a great understanding and regard for HSBC’s heritage, and the passion to build the bank for the next generation,” Tucker said in a statement.

Flint emerged as the forerunner in the past six months as expectations HSBC could appoint its first external CEO in its 150-year history waned on the back of a rally in its share price.

The bank’s stock is up 14 percent so far this year, though was little moved on Thursday following the announcement of Flint’s appointment.

“It’s good news - it’s important to mix an insider with the new outside chairman and continue on the path set by the current team,” said Hugh Young, head of Asia at Standard Life Aberdeen, one of the bank’s top ten shareholders.

PUSH FOR GROWTH

Flint will be paid a base salary of 1.2 million pounds ($1.6 million) a year, as well as a fixed pay allowance of 1.7 million pounds and an annual pension allowance of 360,000 pounds.

He will also be entitled to an annual bonus worth up to 215 percent of his base pay and a long-term incentive award of up to 320 pct of his base pay.

His main task will be to grow revenues across HSBC’s businesses, as it seeks to grow profits again following a period of restructuring after the 2008-9 financial crisis.

HSBC’s previous management duo of Gulliver and Douglas Flint spent the years since their appointment in 2010 shrinking HSBC, after a period of empire-building in the run-up to the 2008 global financial crisis left the bank over-extended.

In July, HSBC announced its third share buyback in a year and rising profits, in a sign of its turnaround.

But the bank still faces a tough challenge to meet its long term goal of making a better than 10 percent return on equity.

In August last year HSBC abandoned a timetable for achieving that target, as increased regulatory requirements on capital, low interest rates and rising competition from low-cost competitors pressure lenders’ profits worldwide.

Investors will watch closely to see whether Flint continues Gulliver’s shift toward the bank’s second home market of Asia.

HSBC said in 2015 it would hire 4000 staff and lend more in China’s southern Pearl River Delta region, a plan that has since encountered some setbacks as China’s growth slowed.

It has also lost market share in its Asian life insurance business, a trend which analysts expect the bank’s new chairman to attempt to reverse given his background in the industry.

Flint spent much of his early carer in Asia, and has done stints in Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, and India as well as the United States and Britain.

Before taking on his retail and wealth role in 2013, he was HSBC’s head of strategy and planning having previously run its global asset management business and was deputy head of its markets business as well as serving as Group Treasurer.",HSBC picks company veteran John Flint as new chief executive,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hsbc-ceo/hsbc-picks-company-veteran-john-flint-as-new-chief-executive-idUSKBN1CH1BB

Prime Minister Theresa May first proposed a price cap on the energy sector earlier this year, the biggest market intervention since its privatization almost 30 years ago. She said her center-right government was trying to fix a market that punishes customers for their loyalty to a supplier.

Her announcement last week that the plan would go ahead initially wiped more than 900 million pounds ($1.2 billion) off the value of the two British listed companies Centrica and SSE alone.

“I have been clear that our broken energy market has to change – it has to offer fairer prices for millions of loyal customers who have been paying hundreds of pounds too much,” May said on Thursday.

The draft bill published on Thursday said the price cap would initially last until 2020, with the potential to be extended by up to three years if needed.

But, it gave no precise detail for businesses keen to see how much it would cost them, other than to say it would be an absolute price cap, as opposed to a relative one based on the difference between the cheapest and most expensive tariff. Ofgem will set the terms.

Britain’s energy market is dominated by the so-called big six providers -- Centrica’s British Gas, SSE, Iberdrola’s Scottish Power, Innogy’s npower, E.ON and EDF Energy, which account for about 85 percent of the retail electricity market.

Shares in SSE added 1.5 percent by 1215 GMT on Thursday, while Centrica was up by 0.4 percent.

RISING COSTS

Energy bills have doubled in Britain over the past decade to an average of about 1,200 pounds ($1,500) a year, putting the biggest providers in the sights of politicians.

More than 18 million customer accounts in Britain are currently on a standard variable tariff (SVT) or other default tariffs. Many of these offer poor value to customers because they are priced higher than the fixed-rate deals available to consumers who actively seek them out.

“This draft bill ... requires Ofgem to modify the standard license conditions for gas and electricity suppliers, so as to include conditions that impose a price cap for standard variable tariffs and default tariffs offered to domestic customers,” explanatory notes accompanying the legislation said.

It set out exceptions covering tariffs already benefiting from protection and tariffs with environmental benefits.

“Ofgem will work alongside Government to provide price protection to all standard tariff customers as soon as possible, if legislation is passed,” an Ofgem spokeswoman said.

The cap is seen as a way to appeal to those voters who, after seven years of public spending cuts, are struggling with rising inflation and weak wage growth.

The leftist opposition Labour Party, which has long advocated intervention in energy markets, performed better than expected at a June snap election, depriving May of an outright majority in parliament.

(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) easily beat Wall Street’s third-quarter profit expectations on Thursday, with loan growth and higher interest rates more than offsetting weakness in its markets-related unit.

Executives at the largest U.S. bank touted the diverse mix of businesses that allow JPMorgan to weather a dip in one area or another, and downplayed a 27 percent drop in bond trading revenue even though weakness has continued into the fourth quarter.

Overall, JPMorgan’s profit rose 7.1 percent in the third quarter compared with the year-ago period, to $6.73 billion, or $1.76 per share. Analysts had expected earnings of $1.65 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The bank’s total revenue of $25.33 billion also topped the average analyst estimate of $25.23 billion.

In early notes to clients, analysts characterized the results as “solid” or “pretty good,” given problems in bond trading that have affected Wall Street banks for some time.

“The results were solid but not exceptional,” said Morningstar analyst Jim Sinegal.

JPMorgan shares were down 0.4 percent at $96.48 in morning trading.

Growth in credit cards, auto loans, commercial banking and corporate advisory fees drove the results, with average core loans up 7 percent during the quarter. JPMorgan’s net interest income, or the difference between what it pays for funds and collects from lending them out, rose 10 percent.

However, markets revenue fell 21 percent as the slump in bond trading outweighed a more modest dip in equities, slightly worse than the roughly 20 percent drop Chief Executive Jamie Dimon had forecast at an event in September.

Wall Street banks have been grappling with bond market challenges for most of the past seven years, as client volumes have been depressed for a number of reasons and new regulations have restricted certain activities and made trading more expensive.

JPMorgan fared worse last quarter than rival Citigroup Inc (C.N), which reported a 16 percent decline in bond trading on Thursday. The trends bode poorly for Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), which has struggled more in bond trading recently than other Wall Street banks.

JPMorgan’s markets revenue is likely to drop again in the fourth quarter because the year-ago period was strong, Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said on a conference call with analysts.

Trading revenue during the fourth quarter of 2016 benefited from a surge in trading activity following the U.S. election.

Still, management maintained earlier guidance for full-year net interest income, expenses, charge-offs and loan growth, indicating that they expect JPMorgan’s other businesses to continue to offset capital markets pain.

During a call with reporters, Lake cited “the benefits of diversification and scale,” while Daniel Pinto, who runs JPMorgan’s investment bank, pointed to “balanced strength across diverse businesses” in a memo to employees.",Loan growth helps JPMorgan beat expectations despite trading decline,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-jpmorgan-results/loan-growth-helps-jpmorgan-beat-expectations-despite-trading-decline-idUKKBN1CH1GU?il=0

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The Allahabad High Court on Thursday overturned the conviction of a dentist couple for the murder of their teenage daughter and the family servant for lack of material evidence, their lawyer said.

Aarushi Talwar was found with her throat slit at the family home in the Delhi suburb of Noida in 2008. A day later, the body of the servant, Hemraj, was found on the roof of the house.

A trial court convicted the girl’s parents, Rajesh and Nupur Talwar, after police alleged Rajesh had murdered his daughter and the servant in a rage when he found them in a compromising situation. The couple, both dentists, were jailed for life.

But the Allahabad High Court overruled the decision saying it was not satisfied with the evidence and ordered the couple be freed, their lawyer Tanveer Ahmed Mir said.

“The court found no forensic or material evidence to prove that the Talwars had killed their daughter,” Mir told reporters outside a packed courtroom in Allahabad.

Both parents had denied the murder and insisted they were victims of botched investigations and unfair media coverage, damaging their defence.

Aarushi’s case was labelled as a kind of crime more often associated with rural, conservative parts of India where “honour killings” are not uncommon.

Every twist in the investigation was extensively reported by the Indian press, turning the Talwars into household names.

“Finally my family can lead a dignified life. The court has upheld the facts and truth,” said Rajesh Talwar’s sister, Vandana, after the decision.

PARIS (Reuters) - Paris authorities plan to banish all petrol- and diesel-fueled cars from the world’s most visited city by 2030, Paris City Hall said on Thursday.

The move marks an acceleration in plans to wean the country off gas-guzzlers and switch to electric vehicles in a city often obliged to impose temporary bans due to surges in particle pollution in the air.

Paris City Hall said in a statement France had already set a target date of 2040 for an end to cars dependent on fossil fuels and that this required speedier phase-outs in large cities.

“This is about planning for the long term with a strategy that will reduce greenhouse gases,” said Christophe Najdovski, an official responsible for transport policy at the office of Mayor Anne Hidalgo.

“Transport is one of the main greenhouse gas producers...so we are planning an exit from combustion engine vehicles, or fossil-energy vehicles, by 2030,” he told France Info radio.

The French capital, which will host the Olympic Games in the summer of 2024 and was host city for the latest worldwide pact on policies to tame global warming, had already been eyeing an end to diesel cars in the city by the time of the Olympics.

Paris City Hall, already under attack over the establishment of no-car zones, car-free days and fines for drivers who enter the city in cars that are more than 20 years old, said it was not using the word “ban” but rather introducing a feasible deadline by which combustion-engine cars would be phased out.

There are about 32 million household cars in France, where the population is about 66 million, according to 2016 data from the Argus, an automobile industry publication.

Many Parisians do not own cars, relying on extensive public transport systems and, increasingly, fast-burgeoning networks offering bikes, scooters and low-pollution hybrid engine cars for shot-term rental.

ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan accused the United States on Thursday of mistreating a strategic ally, in a blistering speech which appeared to rule out swift resolution to a dispute between two NATO members jointly fighting Islamic State.

Hours after Ankara announced officials would meet soon to settle differences, Erdogan accused the U.S. consulate in Istanbul of hiding an individual with links to a network he blames for last year’s failed coup.

He also condemned U.S. support for Kurdish fighters in Syria and separate U.S. court cases against a senior Turkish banker and the president’s own security guards, mocking what he said was Washington’s claim to be “the capital of democracy”.

Turkey’s relations with the United States and many Western countries have been strained since last year’s failed military coup against Erdogan, in which more than 240 people were killed.

Turkey felt many allies were slow to condemn the coup attempt and failed to appreciate the danger it faced. Western countries have grown alarmed at the scale of Turkey’s post-coup crackdown, with 50,000 people detained and 150,000 suspended from work.

Ties with the United States hit a low when Turkey detained a locally employed worker at the U.S. consulate in Istanbul last week.

The United States says it is still seeking an explanation for the arrest - the second detention of a consulate worker this year. It suspended most visa services in Turkey, saying it needed to review Turkey’s commitment to the security of its mission and staff. Turkey reciprocated within hours.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson spoke with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu on Wednesday and expressed his “profound concern”, the U.S. State Department said.

Erdogan has blamed outgoing U.S. ambassador John Bass, saying he was putting at risk a decades-old alliance.

“Let me be very clear, the person who caused this is the ambassador here. It is unacceptable for the United States to sacrifice a strategic partner to an ambassador who doesn’t know his place,” Erdogan told provincial governors meeting in Ankara.

TURKISH GRIEVANCES

Earlier, Deputy Prime Minister Bekir Bozdag said Turkish and U.S. officials would meet to work on resolving the crisis and described talks between their foreign ministers as constructive.

But Erdogan aired a list of grievances, accusing Washington of sheltering suspected members of the outlawed Kurdish Workers Party (PKK), and supporters of Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen he blames for last year’s coup attempt. Gulen denies involvement.

“On the one hand you say you are the capital of democracy, but you hide PKK and FETO members,” Erdogan said, using the label his government has given to Gulen’s network.

He said Washington was defending a “FETO-linked person hiding in your consulate”, and said a Christian pastor arrested in western Turkey last year was also “clearly linked” to Gulen.

Ambassador Bass said this week no one was hiding in the U.S. consulate, and that he had seen nothing of merit in the charges against the pastor, Andrew Brunson.

Erdogan said U.S. authorities had wrongly arrested the former head of Turkey’s majority state-owned Halkbank, and were trying to use a detained Turkish gold trader “as an informant”. Both men were arrested on charges of sanctions violations.

Referring to a U.S. grand jury indictment of 15 Turkish security officials who clashed with protesters during his visit to Washington in May, Erdogan said most of them had never set foot on U.S. soil. “You issue arrest warrants for 13 of my security staff who have never seen the United States,” he said.

“If the ambassador in Ankara is leading the grand United States, then shame on you,” Erdogan said. “Someone should have said: ‘You cannot treat your strategic partner this way, you can’t behave like this’.”",Erdogan says U.S. sacrificing strategic ally Turkey,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-turkey-security/erdogan-says-u-s-sacrificing-strategic-ally-turkey-idUSKBN1CH0TU?il=0

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan’s army said on Thursday it had rescued a kidnapped U.S.-Canadian couple and their three children after receiving intelligence from the United States, nearly five years after the couple was abducted in Afghanistan.

American Caitlan Coleman, her Canadian husband Joshua Boyle and the children born in captivity were believed to be held by the Taliban-allied Haqqani network, which the United States has long accused Pakistan of not doing enough to fight.

Coleman and Boyle were kidnapped while backpacking in Afghanistan in 2012. Coleman was pregnant at the time, and a video released by the Taliban in December showed their two sons born while they were hostages.

Thursday’s statement was the first mention of a third child.

The rescue came as Pakistan and the United States, uneasy allies in fighting Taliban and other Islamist extremists in the region, are experiencing one of the worst lows in relations.

“We welcome media reports that a family including U.S. citizens has been released from captivity,” a U.S. Embassy spokesman said on Thursday evening, referring other questions to Washington.

Pakistan touted the success of the operation as proof of the strength of the alliance.

“The success underscores the importance of timely intelligence sharing and Pakistan’s continued commitment toward fighting this menace through cooperation between two forces against a common enemy,” the Pakistani army statement said. The family were released from “terrorist custody”.

Asked by a reporter if he could envision maintaining free trade with Canada if NAFTA talks sour with Mexico, Trump said: “Oh sure, absolutely. It’s possible we won’t be able to reach a deal with one or the other, but in the meantime we’ll make a deal with one.”

Trump added that a “very creative” deal was still possible to benefit all three countries.

Trump’s comments came at a White House meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who was in Washington to promote NAFTA’s benefits as a new round of renegotiations began near Washington.

Asked about Trump’s comments at a news conference later, Trudeau said he was still optimistic about the chances of modernizing the 1994 trade pact.

”I continue to believe in NAFTA ... so saying, we are ready for anything, and we will continue to work diligently to protect Canadian interests,” Trudeau said.

Trudeau added that Canada was “very much aware of and very braced for” Trump’s unpredictability, but his government would work in a “thoughtful, meaningful way towards getting a good deal.”

Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo, speaking on Mexican radio, praised Trump’s comments as “very balanced” to include the possibility of a deal with either country and hold out hope for a creative solution.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Tuesday accused Trump’s administration of trying to sabotage the talks with “poison pill proposals,” including demands for more favorable treatment for the U.S. side on car production, and a “sunset clause” to force regular negotiations.

In his appearance with Trudeau, Trump said: “We’ll see what happens” when asked whether NAFTA was doomed.

“It’s possible we won’t be able to make a deal, and it’s possible that we will,” he said. “We’ll see if we can do the kind of changes that we need. We have to protect our workers, and in all fairness, the prime minister wants to protect Canada and his people also.”

“We don’t hope it will, we don’t desire that it will, we don’t believe that it will, but it is at least a conceptual possibility as we go forward,” Ross said.

But U.S. and Mexican corporate chief executives gathered in Mexico City said they would be better off with no NAFTA than be saddled with a “bad agreement.”

AGGRESSIVE PROPOSALS

Slideshow (10 Images)

Trade experts said the NAFTA talks were likely to stall in the face of aggressive U.S. attempts to sharply increase content requirements for autos and auto parts.

People briefed on U.S. proposals to be presented this week said Washington was seeking to sharply lift North American content threshold in car manufacturing.

The proposals call for North American content overall to rise to 85 percent from the current 62.5 percent. In addition, the United States wants to add a new 50 percent U.S.-specific content requirement, something that was not in the earlier agreements.

“These will be met with widespread opposition from Canada and Mexico. I think it’s just a bridge too far,” said Wendy Cutler, the Asia Society’s Washington policy director and former chief U.S. negotiator for the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal canceled by Trump.

The U.S. side sees strengthening the rules of origin for the auto industry as a way to bring back some auto parts production, including electronics, from Asia. But Mexico strongly opposes a U.S.-specific content requirement, which would limit the growth of its own car industry.

The difficult issue of rules of origin will be addressed mostly at the end of the current talks, according to a schedule obtained by Reuters. The negotiations were extended on Wednesday by two days to Oct 17.

Other U.S. proposals opposed by Canada, Mexico and U.S. business interests include the five-year sunset provision, radical changes to NAFTA’s dispute arbitration systems, changes to intellectual property provisions and new protections for U.S. seasonal produce growers.

U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said on Wednesday the three nations had completed their negotiations on company competition policy, reaching an agreement that goes beyond previous U.S. trade deals to ensure “certain rights and transparency under each nation’s competition laws.”","Trump says open to bilateral Canada, Mexico pacts if NAFTA talks fail",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trade-nafta/trump-says-open-to-bilateral-canada-mexico-pacts-if-nafta-talks-fail-idUSKBN1CG0DV

Sin embargo, Barnier dijo en conferencia de prensa que había movimientos en torno a otros elementos del acuerdo de divorcio británico y habló de la posibilidad de acceder en los dos próximos meses a las demandas británicas de negociar un pacto comercial y un periodo de transición tras la salida de Reino unido de la UE en marzo de 2019 -- si hay voluntad política.

Barnier dejó claro que pese al nuevo ritmo imprimido a las conversaciones tras un discurso de May en septiembre, la posición británica sobre el dinero, los derechos de los ciudadanos expatriados y la frontera con Irlanda seguían sin “avances significativos”, que eran una condición para abrir las negociaciones sobre el comercio.

May dijo que Reino Unido aseguraría que los otros 27 países no salieran perdiendo financieramente por el Brexit en el actual periodo presupuestario de la UE hasta 2020 y cumpliría sus compromisos, pero Barnier dijo que Londres no logró siquiera decir lo que estaba dispuesto a pagar.

“Sobre esa cuestión estamos en un ‘impasse’, que es muy preocupante para miles de proyectos en toda Europa y para quienes contribuyen”, dijo.

“Sigo convencido de que, con voluntad política, está al alcance un avance decisivo en los próximos dos meses. Con David Davis organizaremos varias reuniones entre ahora y finales de año”, dijo.

Sobre las conversaciones en general esta semana, que incluyó algunos avances en los derechos de los ciudadanos y progresos técnicos sobre Irlanda, Barnier añadió: “Hemos trabajado con espíritu constructivo y hemos aclarado ciertos puntos, pero no hemos dado grandes pasos hacia adelante”.

Davis, reconoció que faltaba mucho trabajo por hacer, pero dijo que confiaba en que podría llegar pronto un acuerdo sobre los derechos de los ciudadanos. Barnier reiteró el deseo de Bruselas de ver que los ciudadanos de la UE en Reino Unido puedan recurrir a los jueces de la UE, pero Londres ha rechazado aceptarlo.

“No es un secreto el hecho de que debemos hablar sobre el futuro para dar certidumbre”, dijo Davis. “Espero que los líderes de los 27 den a Michel medios para explorar vías sobre eso”, añadió.

“Mientras miramos al consejo de octubre la semana que viene, espero que los estados miembros reconozcan el avance que hemos hecho y den un paso adelante en el espíritu del discurso de la primera ministra en Florencia”, dijo.

Barnier fue presionado para decir públicamente si pediría a los líderes de la UE permiso para explorar preliminarmente cómo sería la transición tras marzo de 2019. Los responsables y diplomáticos de la UE dicen que han elevado el asunto a los gobiernos.

Barnier dijo que seguiría el mandato descartando cualquier debate sobre el futuro antes de que se zanjen asuntos pasados de la pertenencia británica a la UE y dijo que era importante respetar la “secuencia”.","La negociación del Brexit encalla por el dinero, Barnier ve pasos en diciembre",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idESKBN1CH1TB-OESTP

LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin smashed through the $5,000 barrier for the first time on Thursday, jumping as much as 8 percent on the day as investors shrugged off the latest warnings on the risks of buying into the booming cryptocurrency market.

Bitcoin, the biggest and best-known cryptocurrency, has chalked up a more than fivefold increase in price this year.

Typically for bitcoin, which at less than nine years old is still highly volatile and illiquid compared with traditional currencies and assets, the precise reason for its recent tear was unclear.

Upcoming splits in its software, reports that Goldman Sachs is considering offering bitcoin trading, rumors that China could ease restrictions, and even a political crisis in Spain’s Catalonia region were all cited by market-watchers as reasons for the rally.

But the main factor could simply be demand from investors wanting ‘in’ on a market that has provided gains exceeding those of any other currency in every year bar one since 2010.

“People are just wanting to be part of it,” said Ryan Nettles, head of FX trading and market strategy at Swiss bank Swissquote, which launched bitcoin trading two months ago. Nettles said interest had been much higher than anticipated and has come from banks, hedge funds and brokers.

“The interest really stems from the media hype,” he added.

On Wednesday Russian President Vladimir Putin warned of the “serious risks” surrounding the nascent market, while Russia’s central bank said it would ban cryptocurrency trading websites.

But that was not enough to put investors off, with bitcoin rallying around 10 percent since then.

Data released last week from SEMrush, a search engine data analytics firm, found the price had a 91 percent correlation with Google searches on bitcoin, suggesting that all news -- whether negative or positive -- drives up demand, even if bad news can have a temporary negative effect.

Bitcoin almost reached $5,000 at the start of September, but fell back sharply after the head of Goldman Sachs blasted the cryptocurrency as a “fraud” and as China forced exchanges to close down, sparking fears of a broader crackdown.

But after dipping below $3,000 in mid-September, bitcoin has leapt in value by more than 75 percent in four weeks.

“Bitcoin was designed to operate outside of the influence of governments and central banks, and is doing exactly that,” said Iqbal Gandham, Managing Director at retail trading app eToro, which has seen huge increases in cryptocurrency trading volumes.

CRYPTO-RIVALS ALSO RALLY

By 1245 GMT, bitcoin was trading up 8 percent on the day around $5,200 on Luxembourg-based exchange Bitstamp.

Though there have been many warnings about a bitcoin “bubble”, including from European Central Bank Deputy Governor Vitor Constancio, some say it has much further to climb. But determining its value is difficult.

“For most currencies there are several accepted methodologies for estimating relative value, normally based on macroeconomic fundamentals,” said EFG Asset Management’s Global Head of Research, Daniel Murray. “For bitcoin no such fundamentals exist.”

Other cryptocurrencies -- whose prices tend to be highly correlated to bitcoin -- also rallied. Their total value -- or market capitalization -- climbed above $160 billion for the first time since early September, according to industry website Coinmarketcap.com.

Two upcoming “forks” in the bitcoin software code, which will create rival clones of the cryptocurrency, were seen by some as a reason for the rise in price, which saw a boost after the “Bitcoin Cash” clone was created at the start of August.

“Investors are seeing the lessons of history in the up-and-coming forks and hoping for an extra dividend,” said Charles Hayter, co-founder of data analysis website Cryptocompare, adding that rumors on online forums that China could reopen exchanges could also be affecting the price.","Bitcoin rockets above $5,000 to all-time high",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-markets-bitcoin/bitcoin-rockets-above-5000-to-all-time-high-idUKKBN1CH0YQ?il=0

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Thursday morning, dragged down by media companies, while results from JPMorgan and Citigroup failed to fuel the optimism that has driven indexes to record highs.

JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Citigroup (C.N), which had already talked down third-quarter expectations, reported earnings that were better than Wall Street estimates even as trading revenues fell. The shares of both companies were little changed.

“After a long stretch of consecutive highs in the market, with earnings, even if they are slightly disappointing, or an even an aspect of earnings like bond trading at JPM, is more an excuse to selloff,” said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist for Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.

With the S&P 500 up about 14 percent in 2017, investors are betting on strong earnings growth across the S&P 500.

AT&T (T.N) tumbled 3.22 percent after the company said its third-quarter results took a hit from the string of hurricanes.

The company also said it lost video subscribers in the quarter. Brokerage Guggenheim downgraded Disney (DIS.N) and Viacom (VIAB.O) on worries over subscriber declines

That sparked fresh jitters in a sector that was hit a day earlier by President Donald Trump’s suggestion to challenge TV network licenses over ‘fake news’.

Comcast (CMCSA.O) fell 2.8 percent, Disney (DIS.N) fell 1 percent. Viacom sank 6.6 percent after warning that Charter Communications subscribers may lose access to its channels as the expiration looms for a distribution deal.

Clemons said earnings will probably heighten volatility, with lack of any other major developments to drive the market.

At 9:37 a.m. ET (1337 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was down 38.19 points, or 0.17 percent, at 22,834.7, the S&P 500 .SPX was down 4.38 points, or 0.17 percent, at 2,550.86 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was down 7.33 points, or 0.11 percent, at 6,596.22.

Ten of the 11 major S&P indexes were lower, led by a more than 2 percent fall in the telecom services index .SPLRCL due to AT&T’s declines.

The biggest drag, however, was from the consumer discretionary sector .SPLRCD, which fell 0.57 percent, weighed down by media stocks.

Energy stocks also fell, dragged down by a more than 1 percent drop in crude oil prices as U.S. fuel inventories rose despite efforts by OPEC to cut production.

General Motors (GM.N) fell 1.5 percent. The Wall Street Journal reported GM planned to cut production at a Detroit plant and lay off about 1,500 workers.

J.Jill (JILL.N) nearly halved to hit a record low of $4.96 after the women’s fashion retailer slashed its third-quarter forecast.

(Reuters) - Firefighters struggled overnight to halt the spread of wildfires known to have killed 23 people in North California, preparing for winds to shift after one town threatened by flames evacuated all residents.

The edge of the deadly Tubbs fire was less than two miles (3km) from Calistoga, a Napa Valley community whose 5,000 residents left their homes on Wednesday.

Whether the town burns “is going to depend on the wind,” its Fire Chief Steve Campbell told Reuters early on Thursday. “High winds are predicted, but we have not received them yet.”

Tubbs is one of nearly two dozen fires spanning eight counties that, raging largely unchecked since igniting on Sunday, have left hundreds of residents unaccounted for.

They have also charred around 170,000 acres (69,000 hectares) of land and destroyed some 3,500 buildings since.

While their cause has not been conclusively determined, they are thought to have been sparked by power lines toppled by gale force winds, and fanned by hot, dry “Diablo” winds that blew into northern California toward the Pacific.

New advisory evacuations were also issued in Sonoma County late on Wednesday for parts of Santa Rosa, the largest city in the state’s world-renowned wine country, and Geyserville, an unincorporated town of 800 people.

“The winds are predicted to be very erratic,” said county spokesman Barry Dugan. “There will be burst of high gusts that can be ... very unpredictable and difficult when you are fighting a fire and also for residents who we are trying to keep posted.”

Wildfires have damaged or demolished at least 13 Napa Valley wineries, a vintners’ trade group said on Tuesday.

Around 25,000 people remained under evacuation on Wednesday as the fires belched smoke that drifted south over the San Francisco Bay area, where some residents donned face masks.

STILL MISSING

More than 285 people were still missing in Sonoma County late on Wednesday night, the sheriff said on Twitter. It was unclear how many might be fire victims rather than evacuees who had not checked in with authorities.

In Santa Rosa, blocks in some neighborhoods resembled war zones, with little left but charred debris, broken walls, chimneys and the steel frames of burned-out cars.

The 23 recorded deaths make the fires the deadliest in the state since 1991, with Tubbs, which has accounted for 13 fatalities, the worst single blaze since 2003, according to state data.

In addition to high winds, the fires have been stoked by an abundance of thick brush left tinder dry by a summer of hot, dry weather.

Matt Nauman, spokesman for the region’s main utility, Pacific Gas & Electric, said many power lines had fallen during gales that packed gusts in excess of 75 miles (120km) per hour.

California Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency in several northern counties, as well as in Orange County in Southern California, where a fire in Anaheim destroyed 15 structures and damaged 12.

The country that invented “Sturm und Drang” is showing a distinct lack of storm and stress as Angela Merkel heads towards a fourth term as chancellor.

That seemingly inexorable outcome on Sept. 24 has raised hopes that she will push through greater integration within the euro area, in partnership with French president Emmanuel Macron, while also championing the rules-based international order that America has forsaken under Donald Trump. But Merkel will find it hard to satisfy such expectations, since she will face new political constraints at home, while the basis for her authority, German economic strength, will come under increasing strain.

A string of polls suggests that the politics of Merkel’s fourth term will be tricky. The chancellor is a long way ahead but she is not doing as well as in the last election, in 2013. Recent findings show support for her center-right CDU party (together with the CSU in Bavaria) at around 36 percent, down from the 41.5 percent she managed four years ago. Because of Germany’s electoral system, which broadly aligns the distribution of seats in the Bundestag with the parties’ share of the vote – while excluding those that fail to reach a 5 percent voting threshold - she will once again have to form a coalition.

The most stable government would be another “grand coalition” with the center-left SPD, her current partner, which is currently polling at around 22 percent. That might appeal to the SPD leadership but many party members are opposed to playing second fiddle again, not least since this does not pay off at the polls. If Merkel cannot form a coalition with the SPD, she may have to form a coalition with not just one but two smaller parties, the FDP and the Greens. This combination would be a first in the Bundestag and it could prove fissile by bringing together the free-market FDP, Merkel’s junior partner in her second term of office between 2009 and 2013, with Germany’s environmentalist party, which has in the past allied itself with the SPD.

The coalition arithmetic could change if the election throws up surprise results for the smaller parties. But whatever alliance Merkel forms after probably protracted negotiations, it will face a disturbing new political phenomenon. Until now the Bundestag has been immune from the upsurge of populism in Europe. But the far-right AfD (Alternative for Germany) looks set to break through the 5 percent threshold that held it at bay in 2013. Currently polling around 10 percent, it has mutated from its euroskeptic origins into an anti-immigration party, capitalizing upon concerns about the influx of asylum-seekers in 2015. Though riven by internal divisions and shunned by the other parties, the AfD will be able to use its presence in the Bundestag as a platform for its populist opposition to the chancellor’s policies.

The politics of Merkel’s fourth term may be more unfavorable than before, but that should be surmountable if the economy – her trump card in the election - remains buoyant. Growth prospects for this year and next year are good, continuing a robust performance in the chancellor’s last two terms. Manufacturers excel in exporting the high-quality engineering products in which Germany specializes. The current-account surplus is extraordinarily high at around 8 percent of GDP. Helped by the humming economy and low interest rates on government debt, Germany boasts healthy public finances too, running a surplus of almost 1 percent of GDP.

Peter Apps: The coming robot arms race

John Lloyd: Labor reform in France's Macron economy

German economic and fiscal strength, so crucial in underpinning the euro zone during the crisis years of 2010-12, has come to be taken for granted. Yet under the shiny paint the engine looks less reliable for the longer journey ahead. Much of the economy does not match the prowess of German manufacturers. In particular Germany lags in business services, as a report from the OECD pointed out last year. Many professions are subject to restrictions that fetter competition. Germany is overbanked with too many small lenders and the banking sector has unhelpfully high levels of public ownership.

Moreover, the business model of German manufacturing is under threat. The diesel emissions scandal that began when Volkswagen admitted cheating U.S. emissions tests has cast a shadow over the country’s premier industry and German carmakers’ big bet on the fuel now looks misplaced. They have to scramble to catch up with electric-powered models, whose time has come thanks both to technological advances and a wave of public-health measures led by cities to ban polluting vehicles. The self-driving revolution poses another challenge to German carmakers. Manufacturers fret that they may be on the wrong side of the digital divide, with Silicon Valley in effect grabbing the high value-added content of many products.

Germans are proud of their massive current-account surplus, yet the domestic counterpart is a lack of investment to absorb national savings. The government’s drive to balance the books has come at the cost of inadequate capital spending on the national infrastructure. Business investment has been subdued. Indeed, according to the OECD’s survey, German firms are behind those of other advanced countries in investing in the “knowledge-based capital”, such as software and management skills, that is increasingly important in spurring greater efficiency. That is one reason why productivity growth has been weak.

An underlying and profound weakness is that Germany’s demographics are especially unfavorable in economic terms. At almost 46, the median age of the population in 2015 was only just lower than Japan’s, the world’s oldest, according to UN data released in June. Although there was a baby boom from the mid-1950s through most of the 1960s, the birth rate fell below the replacement level (of 2.1 children per woman) at the start of the 1970s and has since been among the lowest in the world; indeed the current fertility rate of 1.5 is unusually high. These persistently low birth rates mean that there are fewer young people to replace the bulge of baby-boomers as they retire. Despite the recent upsurge in immigration the working-age population is set to fall, which will act as a persistent drag on growth by reducing the number of workers over the next couple of decades.

For the moment, Merkel still has the aura of invincibility. Yet in practice she will find the going tougher in her fourth term as political, economic and demographic vulnerabilities take their toll. That will limit her ability to meet the exaggerated expectations of what she can achieve both within Europe and on the wider international stage.",Commentary: Don’t be fooled by Merkel’s aura of invincibility,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wallace-germany-commentary/commentary-dont-be-fooled-by-merkels-aura-of-invincibility-idUSKCN1BU2BJ

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Brexit talks are deadlocked over money, the EU’s Michel Barnier said on Thursday as he ruled out discussions on future trade being launched by EU leaders next week but spoke of possible progress by December.

Barnier and his British counterpart, Brexit Secretary David Davis, told reporters there had been some progress this week on the other two issues around Britain’s March 2019 withdrawal from the bloc on which the EU demands “sufficient progress” before it will agree to discuss a transition and future relationship.

Davis renewed his call for EU leaders to give a green light to those talks when they meet Prime Minister Theresa May at an EU summit in Brussels next Thursday.

Barnier made clear, however, that despite new momentum from concessions given by May in a speech at Florence lsat month 22, British proposals on expatriate citizens’ rights and the Irish border still failed the EU test, while London’s refusal to spell out a detailed cash offer was “very worrying” for business.

May said Britain would ensure the other 27 countries did not lose out financially from Brexit in the current EU budget period to 2020 and would honor commitments -- but Barnier said London was failing to spell out just what it was ready to pay.

“Regarding that question, we are at an impasse, which is very worrying for thousands of projects everywhere in Europe and also worrying for those who contribute,” he said.

Nonetheless, he offered hope: “I am still convinced that, with political will, decisive progress is within reach in the coming two months. With David Davis, we will organize several negotiating meetings between now and the end of the year.”

With signs that nerves are fraying on both sides and some hardline Brexit supporters demanding that May just walk out of talks, both negotiators repeated that they were ready for any eventuality including a collapse. But, Barnier warned, “no deal would be a very bad deal”.

RESIDENCE RIGHTS

Davis announced a “streamlined” new system for the 3 million EU citizens in Britain to claim residence rights, answering EU concerns, and said he expected good further progress on other issues. Barnier repeated that Brussels stills wants them to have recourse to EU judges to safeguard their rights and said there were still differences on rights for future family members.

A British demand for its million or so citizens on the continent to have lifetime rights to move to any of the bloc’s 27 countries after Brexit is held up by doubts among the member states. Barnier said those are rights to do with post-Brexit decisions and should be dealt with in the next phase of talks.

Slideshow (3 Images)

“I make no secret of the fact that to provide certainty we must talk about the future,” Davis said, stressing his demand for trade talks. “I hope the leaders of the 27 will provide Michel with the means to explore ways forward with us on that.”

“As we look to the October Council next week, I hope the member states will recognize the progress we’ve made and take a step forward in the spirit of the prime minister’s Florence speech.”

Barnier was pressed to say in public whether he would ask EU leaders’ permission to make some preliminary exploration of what a transition after March 2019 would look like. EU officials and diplomats say he has raised that issue with governments.

However, he told the news conference that he would follow a mandate ruling out any discussion of the future before issues arising from Britain’s past membership are settled and said it was important to respect the “sequencing”.

With the talks poised at a delicate stage, EU officials say it is unclear what leaders will tell May next week. They all rule out a clear move to trade talks but many expect “positive language” to try to defuse British accusations of Brussels intransigence and to help May stand up to her own party critics.

Officials see the early part of next year as a virtual deadline for agreeing to move on to discuss the future relationship. Failure to do so would raise the risk of there being no smooth transition and even of no deal at all.","Brexit talks deadlock on cash, Barnier eyes move by December",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-barnier/brexit-talks-deadlock-on-cash-barnier-eyes-move-by-december-idUKKBN1CH1GK?il=0

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Apple may proceed to build a 850 million euro ($1 billion) data center in Ireland, the High Court ruled on Thursday, bringing relief for the government after a two-year planning delay which it feared could hurt its reputation with investors.

Apple in February 2015 announced plans to build the data center in a rural location in the west of Ireland to take advantage of rich green energy sources nearby.

Planning permission was granted by the local council six months later, but a series of appeals blocked Apple from beginning work.

High Court judge Paul McDermott on Thursday dismissed two separate appeals against the planning permission, clearing the way for the project to proceed.

Ireland relies on foreign multinational companies for the creation of one in every 10 jobs across the economy and sees major investments such as data centers as a means of securing their presence in the country.

A similar Apple center announced at the same time in Denmark is due to begin operations later this year and Apple has announced it will build a second data center there.

Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar met Apple executives last month and said they had made clear their frustration with the planning and judicial delays and warned the process would color decisions that they might make about future investments.

The government has said it is considering amending its planning laws to include data centers as strategic infrastructure, thus allowing them to get through the planning process much more quickly.

It has said it will be one of the biggest capital investment projects in the west of Ireland, providing 300 construction jobs and 150 on-site permanent jobs.",Irish court gives $1 billion Apple data center green light,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-ireland/irish-court-gives-1-billion-apple-data-center-green-light-idUSKBN1CH1EC

Or, as some conservatives fear, the far-left leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, will soon be prime minister.","British politics are a terrible mess. But don’t blame populism, however that’s defined. If anything, blame democracy – however that’s organized.

Last June’s referendum result on Brexit was close – 52 percent voted for Britain to leave the European Union; 48 percent to stay – but indisputable. Unlike in the U.S., no one believes that Russia altered the outcome. And this was a vote not to “drain the swamp” of Westminster, but to strengthen it. As Gisela Stuart, one of the few Labour MPs who campaigned enthusiastically for Brexit as the head of the “Vote Leave” campaign put it, the electors “wanted to restore genuine democratic government and take back control of the laws that govern them.”

Brexit is what happened when people were given a voice. No doubt that many who voted for it were uninformed; some were voting for a better yesterday; many were fearful of the effects of mass immigration – especially of Muslims. A few Britons didn’t want any foreigners at all. But above all, they wanted to “take back control,” and believed that political power should reside in the British parliament – which is comprehensible in its workings and dignified by centuries of existence – rather than in a series of institutions in Brussels, confusing in their overlapping and largely mysterious operations.

No matter that those with more sophisticated views of governance saw the desire as foolish: “an attempt to create a romantic idea of what Britain could be like out of the EU,” said the Liverpool University political scientist Andrew Crines. The majority wanted politics to be at least within their understanding, their representatives – liked or loathed – familiar.

It is this view that has rumbled along beneath the surface for most of the 44 years in which Britain has been a member of the European Union; it is what Prime Minster Theresa May meant in her Brexit speech to politicians in Florence on Friday, when she said that the EU “never felt to us like an integral part of our national story.”

That feeling was quiescent at times, especially during the 13 years of a Labour government, from 1997 to 2010, fevered at others. It was most turbulent during Conservative administrations: the last three Conservative Prime Ministers – Margaret Thatcher (1979-1990) John Major (1990-1997) and David Cameron (2010-2016) all lost power because they were fatally weakened by the internal argument on Europe within their party. No one gives Theresa May much hope of avoiding the Brussels curse which has wreaked so much damage on her predecessors.

The British prime minister is seen as someone clinging on to power, at the mercy of fellow ministers who could, at any time, bring her down. The most ambitious of these, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, has revealed his desire to lead his country most clearly. In an article in the Telegraph, he lauded the UK in the most elevated rhetoric employed in the Brexit cause, largely devoid of his trademark jests, expressing a bounding belief that “we can become the greatest country on earth.”

Giving only the briefest mention to his prime minister, he took over 4000 words to make the vision of a liberated Britain his own, striking a Churchillian pose with “I do not underestimate the scale of the task ahead as we take back control of our destiny” – the kind of rhetoric wholly absent from May’s cautious, if more precise, speeches.

Her Florence speech, clearly something of a compromise between her cabinet factions, vague on many details, nevertheless laid down a process, if not a destination: honoring commitments (that is, probably a 20 billion GBP – about $27 billion – payment to the EU), adopting new laws to protect the existing rights of European citizens living in the UK and passing through a two-year transition to give both sides, especially the UK, time to adjust to a customized relationship not based on the trade pacts which other, non-EU countries, have with the EU.

May’s all-but-impossible job is – as she interprets it – to keep a party and a cabinet with many Remainers in it relatively united, and to retain at least the acquiescence of the senior diplomats and civil servants, of the Bank of England and the main institutions of state, many – probably most – of whom believe Brexit to be most grievously self-wounding, consigning Britain not to greatness but to marginality.

Speaking in Washington earlier this week, Mark Carney, the Canadian who leads the Bank of England, warned of higher inflation, interest rate rises and slower growth, and forecast that Britain – unlike the other advanced countries – would be “an example of deglobalization, not globalization.”

The former close aide to the prime minister, Nick Timothy – whom May was told to fire after nearly losing the election in June – wrote ahead of May’s Florence speech that Chancellor Philip Hammond, was “maneuvering” towards a partial Brexit, failing to promote its advantages and, in his behind-the-scenes arguments with Boris Johnson, playing “games” with the future of the country.

These “maneuvers,” and many more at every level of government, are deployed around the office of an embattled prime minister who, with a relatively modest personality (for a senior politician), has no powerful public presence with which to offset the impression of barely-controlled chaos. Meanwhile, every institution at home and abroad affected by Brexit – there are many – call loudly and daily for a certainty at which the government has not yet arrived, and an easy transition which it cannot guarantee.

In a much-discussed book, “The Road to Somewhere”, the journalist David Goodhart (disclosure: a former Financial Times colleague, and a friend, of this columnist) sees in British society a widening split. On one side there are those who are anywhere people: at home in a globalizing world, with liberal views, enthusiastically pro-European, scornful of rootedness - “progressive individualists.” On the other, somewhere people, much more rooted in family and local work and friendships, not (in the main) bigoted but slow to adapt, worried by too-rapid change - “decent populists.”

Admitting that each side usually shares aspects of the other, he argues that the somewhere people have lost out in status, income and visibility in the last few decades, to the point where they often tell pollsters that they barely recognize the country they live in. Much more strongly represented in the working and lower middle class, less often university-educated, generally older than the anywheres, they still are the largest bloc in the country – and in the referendum, their pent-up vexations were allowed a release.

Their decision was probably not a wise act, but it was a thoroughly democratic one. They have given their country’s leadership one monster of a job: to reconcile what is a still globalizing world with their need for esteem and a restored sense that their country is recognizable, and that it is theirs.

LONDON (Reuters) - British wholesale winter gas prices this winter should remain at the elevated levels seen so far this year due to high coal prices, uncertainty about French nuclear outages and low storage inventories.

Early this year, winter 2017 gas prices rose to levels not seen since 2015. The winter 2018 contract is currently trading at around 49 pence per therm and analysts expect it to average around 48 p/therm.

Price spikes in the wholesale gas market, if prolonged, can have a knock-on effect on retail gas prices for households. There is pressure on utilities to lower consumer prices. The government set out draft legislation on Thursday for a price cap which would last until 2020.

National Grid said in its winter 2017/18 outlook earlier on Thursday that Britain can meet electricity demand this winter.

However, analysts say that the gas market is not as relaxed about this winter as the grid operator.

This is due to lower-than-expected nuclear output in France which has raised demand for gas there, high coal prices of around $90 a ton, low gas storage levels and uncertainty about liquefied natural gas (LNG) deliveries.

“North-west Europe may struggle to balance if the winter sees an early cold snap or infrastructure outages and concerns over French nuclear outages continue to spook the market,” said Simon Wood, gas analyst at S&P Global Platts.

“The reality is the risks this winter are greater than ever. The loss of Rough (gas storage site), low storage stocks across the Continent and Chinese LNG spot buying driving JKM, the global LNG benchmark, to record levels,” he added.

European physical coal prices are around 20 percent higher than in October last year. When coal is expensive, its main substitute natural gas becomes more competitive for power plants to burn for electricity. However, then demand for gas increases, thus raising wholesale prices.

“Coal prices have been very robust this year and have been climbing rapidly into the winter months as well. We’ve been playing catch-up with coal prices,” said Murray Douglas, research director of European gas at consultancy Wood Mackenzie.

“There are temporary support measures for gas but (they) won’t continue to the end of next year,” he added.

VOLATILITY

During the summer, gas prices were volatile after Centrica’s decision to close Rough due to safety issues amid a prolonged outage.

The loss of 70 percent of Britain’s gas storage will be partly offset by increased gas imports and the sale of some so-called cushion gas from Rough through the end of Q1.

But prices could spike in the event of very cold periods and nervousness about further production outages and Russian gas flows, traders said.

“Some gas coming from Rough might give the markets some respite. Barring any extreme cold spell or severe disruptions in say France I cannot see a very tight winter but the market is quite irrational of late,” said Wayne Bryan, analyst at Alfa Energy.

Last year, several French nuclear reactors were halted for safety inspections by regulators, creating a power supply shortfall which Britain helped to balance through exports.

That meant there was more demand for gas from power plant operators in Britain to help balance the domestic market, supporting gas prices.

Although there is more French nuclear supply than last year, a number of reactors have had their restarts delayed, adding to tension in the market.

“There has been a reasonable level of Norwegian outages and there’s a much higher level of (French) nuclear power plant outages than we expected there to be. Those outage levels are very high at around 25 GW,” said Trevor Sikorksi, head of natural gas, coal and carbon research at Energy Aspects.

“We have seen a lot of delays to plants restarting over the last few months. In October and November we could see similar levels of nuclear outages and again that could lead to reasonably low (power supply) levels so there could be a repeat of what we saw last year,” he added.

There is also uncertainty about the amount of LNG Britain and north-west Europe will receive this winter.

In Spain, southern France and Italy, wholesale gas prices are trading at steep premiums to north-west European hubs, due to concerns over LNG supply this winter as low hydropower levels have made the region more reliant on imports.

But prices are still lower than Asian LNG prices, meaning that cargoes could continue flowing to the East due to strong Chinese demand.

Although LNG stocks at Britain’s Isle of Grain, Belgium’s Zeebrugge and Gate in the Netherlands are well stocked, traders assume most of that volume will be shipped to Asia.

United are second in the Premier League behind Manchester City on goal difference while Liverpool sit seventh after a mixed start to the season.

Despite leaking 12 goals, Juergen Klopp’s Liverpool have shown plenty of attacking flair and Dalglish feels United’s defence will exercise caution.

“You would always expect Liverpool v Manchester United to be a tight game,” Dalglish told the Liverpool Echo.

“Last year, when United came to Liverpool, Jose Mourinho parked the bus. But it wasn’t just the one bus, I think it was a couple of double deckers he put there,” he added.

”That’s not to give him stick in any way, it was very difficult for Liverpool and (Zlatan) Ibrahimovic nearly got a late winner.

”United will come and set up quite defensively, but they have fantastic frontmen in Marcus Rashford, Romelu Lukaku and Anthony Martial.

“Jose will try to make sure the pressure is on Liverpool, but the pressure is on everyone when it comes to a game like that,” Dalglish said.

Dalglish praised Liverpool’s new signing Mohamed Salah for his early impact. The Egyptian striker has scored four goals and formed a good understanding with his fellow forwards.

“Mo Salah has been the most exciting signing of the summer for Liverpool. He’s come in after a fantastic season last year with Roma,” he said.

”He’s really quick, he takes it up to people and they start to panic. He can go inside or out but he obviously prefers it on his left foot.

Flint, who runs HSBC’s retail and wealth management business out of London, will take over as CEO in February next year when Stuart Gulliver, 58, retires after seven years in the job.

The appointment is the first major decision taken by former AIA Group (1299.HK) chief Mark Tucker, who officially took up his post at HSBC just 12 days ago as its first externally-appointed chairman.

Flint, who is not related to Tucker’s predecessor Douglas Flint, is viewed by other HSBC executives as the safe option, having worked at the bank since 1989.

During his career at HSBC Flint, 49, has worked across most of its businesses and spent his first 14 years in Asia, giving him the breadth of experience seen as vital for the CEO role.

“He has a great understanding and regard for HSBC’s heritage, and the passion to build the bank for the next generation,” Tucker said in a statement.

Flint emerged as the forerunner in the past six months as expectations HSBC could appoint its first external CEO in its 150-year history waned on the back of a rally in its share price.

The bank’s stock is up 14 percent so far this year, though was little moved on Thursday following the announcement of Flint’s appointment.

“It’s good news - it’s important to mix an insider with the new outside chairman and continue on the path set by the current team,” said Hugh Young, head of Asia at Standard Life Aberdeen, one of the bank’s top ten shareholders.

PUSH FOR GROWTH

Flint will be paid a base salary of 1.2 million pounds ($1.6 million) a year, as well as a fixed pay allowance of 1.7 million pounds and an annual pension allowance of 360,000 pounds.

He will also be entitled to an annual bonus worth up to 215 percent of his base pay and a long-term incentive award of up to 320 pct of his base pay.

His main task will be to grow revenues across HSBC’s businesses, as it seeks to grow profits again following a period of restructuring after the 2008-9 financial crisis.

HSBC’s previous management duo of Gulliver and Douglas Flint spent the years since their appointment in 2010 shrinking HSBC, after a period of empire-building in the run-up to the 2008 global financial crisis left the bank over-extended.

In July, HSBC announced its third share buyback in a year and rising profits, in a sign of its turnaround.

But the bank still faces a tough challenge to meet its long term goal of making a better than 10 percent return on equity.

In August last year HSBC abandoned a timetable for achieving that target, as increased regulatory requirements on capital, low interest rates and rising competition from low-cost competitors pressure lenders’ profits worldwide.

Investors will watch closely to see whether Flint continues Gulliver’s shift toward the bank’s second home market of Asia.

HSBC said in 2015 it would hire 4000 staff and lend more in China’s southern Pearl River Delta region, a plan that has since encountered some setbacks as China’s growth slowed.

It has also lost market share in its Asian life insurance business, a trend which analysts expect the bank’s new chairman to attempt to reverse given his background in the industry.

Flint spent much of his early carer in Asia, and has done stints in Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, and India as well as the United States and Britain.

Before taking on his retail and wealth role in 2013, he was HSBC’s head of strategy and planning having previously run its global asset management business and was deputy head of its markets business as well as serving as Group Treasurer.",HSBC picks company veteran John Flint as new chief executive,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-hsbc-ceo/hsbc-picks-company-veteran-john-flint-as-new-chief-executive-idUKKBN1CH1BF?il=0

About 1.8 million people have been displaced in Nigeria by the conflict with the Islamist insurgency, which has left at least 20,000 dead and shows little sign of ending as it drags into its ninth year.

The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) said in a report that 86 percent of internally displaced people were not ready to return home in the immediate future. Insecurity is cited by 84 percent of them as the main reason for wanting to stay put, it said.

Only about six in 10 people said they wanted to return to their villages at some point, but could not do so now, the NRC report said.

Many of the displaced say they have tried to return home, only to be forced to flee back to safer camps and cities because of continued attacks by Boko Haram and general insecurity.

“While the end game is for communities to return home, the unfortunate truth is that pushing people back now will have harmful consequences,” Jan Egeland, NRC secretary general, said in a statement.

Although Boko Haram in recent months has increased its attacks on displaced people, they still feel safer in camps and urban centers than in their communities, said Egeland.

The Nigerian government and military have repeatedly said the insurgency has been “defeated”.

Despite that, Boko Haram has killed 381 civilians in Nigeria and Cameroon since the beginning of April, more than double the amount dead in the preceding five months, Amnesty International said last month.

The NRC survey did not take into account the roughly 200,000 refugees who have fled to neighboring countries such as Cameroon, Chad and Niger.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - The number of job vacancies in Canada rose in the second quarter compared to the year before, with more openings seen broadly across regions and sectors, data from Statistics Canada showed on Thursday.

There were 460,000 jobs open in the second quarter, up 17.2 percent from the second quarter of last year. The job vacancy rate, which measures the share of unfilled jobs out of those available, rose to 2.9 percent from 2.5 percent.

A higher job vacancy rate often points to economic growth. Canada has seen robust job gains over the past year amid a strong economy that has prompted the Bank of Canada to raise interest rates twice in 2017 so far.

Job vacancies in the second quarter rose in nearly all the provinces, led by Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia, which have seen strong economic growth.

The number of job openings also rose in Alberta, which is recovering from the collapse in oil prices. The mining, quarrying and oil and gas sector saw some of the biggest increases in job vacancies, which is consistent with recent employment gains in the sector, the statistics agency said.

GENEVA (Reuters) - West African migrants trying to reach Europe are dying in far greater numbers in the Sahara than in the Mediterranean but efforts to dissuade them may cause new routes to open up, the United Nations migration agency said on Thursday.

So far this year 2,569 migrant deaths have been recorded in the central Mediterranean, while more than 107,000 migrants, mainly West Africans, have reached Italy.

“One thing we still don’t have is any estimate of number of deaths in the desert,” Richard Danziger, the U.N. International Organization for Migration director for West and Central Africa, told a news conference in Geneva.

“We assume, and I think we have said before, that it has to be at least double those who die in the Mediterranean. But we really have no evidence of that, it’s just an assumption. We just don’t know.”

In Niger, a main transit route, people smugglers were increasingly scared of the authorities, which might make them more prone to abandon migrants in the desert, he said.

Many migrants had told of deaths in the desert, and some said the smugglers believed that if they drove fast through minefields they would be safe, said the IOM’s Niger mission chief, Giuseppe Loprete.

Migrant numbers heading through Niger have fallen dramatically after strong action by the government to close migrant “ghettoes” and arrest people smugglers, he said.

IOM was also trying to spread the word that “you do not want to get caught in Libya,” Danziger said.

“What happens in Libya is far scarier to people than dying, the horror stories that returnees come back with.”

Many of the smugglers did not see themselves as criminals, and were often former desert guides trying to make money. Many of them had given up, while organized criminals with contacts in Libya were continuing, Loprete said.

“Right now they are looking for alternative routes, I think at least equally dangerous,” he said.

“When you plug one hole, other holes are going to open up,” Danziger said.

Niger had two routes to Libya: one closer to Chad that was used to smuggle migrants and one closer to the Algerian border that was far more dangerous and was used by extremist groups and for drugs and gun-running.

An alternative was through northern Mali, a region beset by conflicts between rival groups, but but there did not seem to have been a dramatic rise there, Danziger said.

The route considered the safest was along the western coast of Africa, via Senegal, Mauritania and Morocco to the Strait of Gibraltar, and migrant flows there had increased, he said.",Migrant deaths in the Sahara likely twice Mediterranean toll: U.N.,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-europe-migrants-sahara/migrant-deaths-in-the-sahara-likely-twice-mediterranean-toll-u-n-idUKKBN1CH22D?il=0

“With all of the Fake News coming out of NBC and the Networks, at what point is it appropriate to challenge their License? Bad for country!” Trump, a Republican, wrote in a post on Twitter on Wednesday.

Trump and his supporters have repeatedly used the term “fake news” to cast doubt on media reports critical of his administration, often without providing any evidence to support their case that the reports were untrue.

Trump kept up his criticism of the media in an appearance with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, saying: “It is frankly disgusting the press is able to write whatever it wants to write.”

In a tweet late on Wednesday, Trump said: “Network news has become so partisan, distorted and fake that licenses must be challenged and, if appropriate, revoked. Not fair to public!”

Any move to challenge media companies’ licenses, however, would likely face significant hurdles.

The Federal Communications Commission, an independent federal agency, does not license broadcast networks, but issues them to individual broadcast stations that are renewed on a staggered basis for eight-year periods.

Comcast Corp, which owns NBC Universal, also owns 11 broadcast stations, including outlets in New York, Washington, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Boston, Dallas and Chicago.

A Comcast spokeswoman referred questions to NBC, which did not immediately respond.

ABC, owned by Walt Disney Co, declined to comment.

Shares in media companies fell, potentially reflecting concerns the war of words could worsen. Comcast was down 0.8 percent, while Disney shed 1.4 percent. CBS Corp fell 1.2 percent and Twenty-First Century Fox slid 2.8 percent.

Recon Analytics analyst Roger Entner called the market response a “short-term irrational knee-jerk reaction” and said Trump faced essentially insurmountable hurdles to getting licenses pulled.

A spokesman for FCC Chairman Ajit Pai did not immediately comment.

Gordon Smith, the chief executive of the National Association of Broadcasters, defended the media’s free speech rights.

“It is contrary to this fundamental right for any government official to threaten the revocation of an FCC license simply because of a disagreement with the reporting of a journalist,” Smith said in a statement.

ABC, owned by Walt Disney Co, declined to comment.

Numerous Democrats criticized Trump and urged Pai to denounce Trump’s comments.

Senator Ed Markey wrote Pai on Wednesday asking him to “withstand any urges from President Trump to harm the news media and infringe upon the First Amendment,” a reference to the U.S. Constitution’s free speech and press freedom guarantee.

Democratic U.S. Representative Frank Pallone said Trump “seemed to threaten broadcasters’ licenses only because he disagreed with their reporting. This threat alone could intimidate the press and lead to skewed and unfair reporting.”

FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel responded to Trump by tweeting a link to an FCC fact sheet. “Not how it works,” she said on Twitter.

‘FAIRNESS DOCTRINE’

When reviewing licenses the FCC must determine if a renewal is in the public interest, according to an agency fact sheet on its website.

The FCC said in the fact sheet it expects “station licensees to be aware of the important problems and issues facing their local communities and to foster public understanding by presenting programming that relates to those local issues.”

The agency does not issue similar licenses for cable networks such as CNN and MSNBC, or regulate internet news or other websites.

The FCC has said the First Amendment “expressly prohibits the commission from censoring broadcast matter” and that its role “in overseeing program content is very limited.”

In the early 1970s, then-President Richard Nixon and his top aides discussed using the FCC’s license renewal process as a way of punishing the Washington Post for its coverage of the Watergate burglary that ultimately brought down his presidency.

NBC News has reported on tensions between Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, and has said Trump sought a dramatic increase in the U.S. nuclear arsenal during a meeting with national security advisers in July. NBC reported Tillerson made his “moron” comment after that meeting.

Trump on Saturday also suggested he should get “equal time” because of what he described as late-night television hosts’ “anti-Trump” material.

The FCC’s equal time rules apply in limited cases to air time for political candidates and not to criticism of elected leaders.

“Everyone needs to do their bit – from national government and local authorities to businesses and residents – to end this public health emergency.”

Oxford will also introduce reduced parking fees for electric vehicles and electric-taxi ranks.

In the first stage of its plans from 2020, taxis, cars, light commercial vehicles and buses which are non zero-emission, will be banned from six streets in the city center, including near the world-famous Oxford Union debating society.

The zone will be gradually widened to include more streets and further vehicle types until 2035 when all emitting vehicles, including trucks, will be banned from the center.

Local politicians will draw up the final plans after a consultation closes on Nov. 26.

Asian stocks climbed to their highest in a decade, powering global shares to another record high and keeping them on course for their longest winning streak ever. Wall Street was set to open down from Wednesday’s record high ESc1.

The dollar’s dip came after minutes of the Federal Reserve’s September meeting on Wednesday showed policymakers had a prolonged debate about whether inflation would pick up and the path of future interest rate rises if it did not.

But it slowly regained ground on Thursday and the pound tumbled after the European Union’s chief negotiator said talks over Britain’s exit from the EU were at an impasse [GBP/].

“The minutes highlighted Fed officials are growing concerned low inflation might reflect more than transitory factors,” RBC’s global macro strategist Peter Schaffrik said.

European government bond yields fell in step with their U.S. peers. Italian yields led the trend, falling to near a three-week low after the government won support for electoral change likely to penalize the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement [GVD/EUR].

U.S. US10YT=TWEB and German 10-year yields DE10YT=TWEB fell 1 basis points to 2.33 percent and 0.45 percent, respectively. Italian yields were down 3 basis points at 2.14 percent IT10YT=TWEB.

The eye-catching move in stock markets came in Asia, with MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS reaching their highest since December 2007, up 0.7 percent on the day.

Japan's Nikkei .N225 was up 0.4 percent after brushing 20,994.40, its highest since November 1996. South Korea's KOSPI .KS11 added 0.55 percent to reach a record high. Hong Kong's Hang Seng .HIS scaled a decade-high.

MSCI’s broadest index of world stocks also reached record highs, as it has for six of the past eight trading days .MIWD00000PUS. It is on course for its 12th month of gains in October, its best run ever.

“Fundamentally, the global economy is in decent shape. Corporate sentiment is also sound as evidenced by strong data like the Chinese PMI, U.S. ISM and Japanese tankan,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management in Tokyo.

But the heart of European innovation isn’t a major metropolis –it’s a small city in the Dutch-speaking region of Flanders. That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ second annual ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science, invent new technologies, and help drive the global economy (Compare all 100 schools here).

REUTERS TOP 100

The most innovative university in Europe, for the second year running, is Belgium’s KU Leuven. This nearly 600-year-old institution was founded by Pope Martin V, but today it’s better known for technology than theology: KU Leuven maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet. In fiscal 2015, the university’s research spending exceeded €454 million, and its patent portfolio currently includes 586 active families, each one representing an invention protected in multiple countries.

How does a relatively small Catholic university out-innovate bigger, better-known institutions across Europe? KU Leuven earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than most other universities on the continent, and outside researchers frequently cite KU Leuven inventions in their own patent applications. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

The second most innovative university in Europe is Imperial College London, an institution whose researchers have been responsible for the discovery of penicillin, the development of holography and the invention of fiber optics. The third-place University of Cambridge has been associated with 91 Nobel Laureates during its 800-year history. And the fourth-place Technical University of Munich has spun off more than 800 companies since 1990, including a variety of high-tech startups in industries including renewable energy, semiconductors and nanotechnology.

Overall, the same countries that dominate European business and politics dominate the ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities. German universities account for 23 of the 100 institutions on the list, more than any other country, and the United Kingdom comes in second, tied with France, each with 17 institutions. But those three countries are also among the most populous and richest countries on the continent. Control for those factors, and it turns out that countries with much smaller populations and modest economies often outperform big ones.

The Republic of Ireland has only three schools on the entire list, but with a population of less than 5 million people, it can boast more top 100 innovative universities per capita than any other country in Europe. On the same per capita basis, the second most innovative country on the list is Denmark, followed by Belgium, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Germany, the United Kingdom and France rank in the middle of the pack, an indication that they may be underperforming compared with their smaller neighbors: On a per capita basis, none of those countries has half as many top 100 universities than Ireland.

Students walk out of a faculty building of Imperial College London, Britain, May 27, 2016. REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo

And the same trends hold true if you look at national economies. According to the International Monetary Fund, in 2016 Germany’s gross domestic product exceeded $3.49 trillion –11 times larger than Ireland at $307 billion, yet Germany has only 7 times as many top 100 innovative universities.

Some countries underperform even more drastically. Russia is Europe’s most populous country and has the region’s fifth largest economy, yet none of its universities count among the top 100. Other notable absences include any universities from Ukraine or Romania–a fact that reveals another divide between Western and Eastern Europe.

To compile the ranking of Europe’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included European universities, and then ranked them based on their performance.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and three universities that ranked in the top 100 in 2016 fell off the list entirely: the Netherland’s Eindhoven University of Technology, Germany’s University of Kiel, and the UK’s Queens University Belfast. All three universities filed fewer than 50 patents during the period examined for the ranking, and thus were eliminated from consideration. They’ve been replaced by three new entrants to the top 100: the University of Glasgow (#54), the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis (#94), and the Autonomous University of Madrid (#100).

The returning universities that made the biggest moves on the list were the Netherland’s Leiden University (up 21 spots to #17) and Germany’s Technical University of Berlin (up 21 spots to #41). Belgium’s Université Libre of Brussels (down 17 to #38) and the UK’s University of Leeds (down 17 to #73) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Generally, though, the list remained largely stable: Nine of the top ten schools of 2016 remained in the top 10 for 2017, and 17 of the top 20. This stability is understandable because something as large as university paper output and patent performance is unlikely to change quickly.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the continent: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Thursday as U.S. fuel inventories rose despite efforts by OPEC to cut production.

Brent crude oil LCOc1 was down 75 cents at $56.19 a barrel by 1340 GMT. U.S. light crude CLc1 was $1.00 lower at $50.30. Both benchmarks have risen more than 20 percent from their lows in June as world oil markets tightened.

U.S. crude stocks rose by 3.1 million to 468.5 million barrels last week, according to the American Petroleum Institute.

Official U.S. inventory data was due to be published later on Thursday by the Energy Information Administration (EIA).

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers, including Russia, agreed last year to reduce output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) to prop up prices.

The cuts have helped deplete global fuel inventories, but stocks are still high and well above the five-year average, a target that OPEC has said it wants to reach in order to balance the market.

High U.S. production is pushing increasing volumes of U.S. crude into world markets, feeding inventories and undermining OPEC’s efforts to tighten the market C-OUT-T-EIA.

The International Energy Agency said on Thursday demand for OPEC oil would be 32.5 million bpd next year - around 150,000 bpd lower than the group pumped last month.

Carsten Fritsch, commodities analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, said the tone of the IEA report was bearish because it suggested that demand for OPEC crude next year would not be sufficient to absorb all the available supplies.

“This means OPEC must deepen its production cuts to finish its job of bringing oil stocks back to the five-year average,” Fritsch said.

The OPEC-led deal helped lift oil from below $30 a barrel early last year. But traders say supplies remain ample and OPEC is widely expected to extend its cuts beyond the current expiry date of end-March 2018.

“There is little doubt that leading producers have re-committed to do whatever it takes to underpin the market,” the IEA said in a report on Thursday.

Many analysts expect Brent to stay between $50 and $60 a barrel as long as global markets stay balanced.

“Our updated global supply-demand balance ... shows peak stock draws in 3Q17,” Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients.

The U.S. bank said oil supply and demand fundamentals meant it expected Brent to average $58 a barrel in 2018.",Oil prices fall on higher U.S. crude inventories,https://www.reuters.com/article/global-oil/oil-prices-fall-on-higher-u-s-crude-inventories-idINKBN1CH023?il=0

LONDON (Reuters) - British wholesale winter gas prices this winter should remain at the elevated levels seen so far this year due to high coal prices, uncertainty about French nuclear outages and low storage inventories.

Early this year, winter 2017 gas prices rose to levels not seen since 2015. The winter 2018 contract is currently trading at around 49 pence per therm and analysts expect it to average around 48 p/therm.

Price spikes in the wholesale gas market, if prolonged, can have a knock-on effect on retail gas prices for households. There is pressure on utilities to lower consumer prices. The government set out draft legislation on Thursday for a price cap which would last until 2020.

National Grid said in its winter 2017/18 outlook earlier on Thursday that Britain can meet electricity demand this winter.

However, analysts say that the gas market is not as relaxed about this winter as the grid operator.

This is due to lower-than-expected nuclear output in France which has raised demand for gas there, high coal prices of around $90 a ton, low gas storage levels and uncertainty about liquefied natural gas (LNG) deliveries.

“North-west Europe may struggle to balance if the winter sees an early cold snap or infrastructure outages and concerns over French nuclear outages continue to spook the market,” said Simon Wood, gas analyst at S&P Global Platts.

“The reality is the risks this winter are greater than ever. The loss of Rough (gas storage site), low storage stocks across the Continent and Chinese LNG spot buying driving JKM, the global LNG benchmark, to record levels,” he added.

European physical coal prices are around 20 percent higher than in October last year. When coal is expensive, its main substitute natural gas becomes more competitive for power plants to burn for electricity. However, then demand for gas increases, thus raising wholesale prices.

“Coal prices have been very robust this year and have been climbing rapidly into the winter months as well. We’ve been playing catch-up with coal prices,” said Murray Douglas, research director of European gas at consultancy Wood Mackenzie.

“There are temporary support measures for gas but (they) won’t continue to the end of next year,” he added.

VOLATILITY

During the summer, gas prices were volatile after Centrica’s decision to close Rough due to safety issues amid a prolonged outage.

The loss of 70 percent of Britain’s gas storage will be partly offset by increased gas imports and the sale of some so-called cushion gas from Rough through the end of Q1.

But prices could spike in the event of very cold periods and nervousness about further production outages and Russian gas flows, traders said.

“Some gas coming from Rough might give the markets some respite. Barring any extreme cold spell or severe disruptions in say France I cannot see a very tight winter but the market is quite irrational of late,” said Wayne Bryan, analyst at Alfa Energy.

Last year, several French nuclear reactors were halted for safety inspections by regulators, creating a power supply shortfall which Britain helped to balance through exports.

That meant there was more demand for gas from power plant operators in Britain to help balance the domestic market, supporting gas prices.

Although there is more French nuclear supply than last year, a number of reactors have had their restarts delayed, adding to tension in the market.

“There has been a reasonable level of Norwegian outages and there’s a much higher level of (French) nuclear power plant outages than we expected there to be. Those outage levels are very high at around 25 GW,” said Trevor Sikorksi, head of natural gas, coal and carbon research at Energy Aspects.

“We have seen a lot of delays to plants restarting over the last few months. In October and November we could see similar levels of nuclear outages and again that could lead to reasonably low (power supply) levels so there could be a repeat of what we saw last year,” he added.

There is also uncertainty about the amount of LNG Britain and north-west Europe will receive this winter.

In Spain, southern France and Italy, wholesale gas prices are trading at steep premiums to north-west European hubs, due to concerns over LNG supply this winter as low hydropower levels have made the region more reliant on imports.

But prices are still lower than Asian LNG prices, meaning that cargoes could continue flowing to the East due to strong Chinese demand.

Although LNG stocks at Britain’s Isle of Grain, Belgium’s Zeebrugge and Gate in the Netherlands are well stocked, traders assume most of that volume will be shipped to Asia.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Nerves are fraying in the Brexit talks, negotiators are trying to work out if the other side is bluffing about walking away, and a ticking clock is fast narrowing British options come March 2019.

Philip Hammond, Britain’s finance minister, echoed recent EU assertions when he said that a transition period to some new relationship was a “wasting asset”, the value of which would “diminish significantly” for both sides if its form remains unclear to businesses much after the start of the new year.

As negotiators in Brussels make little progress before Prime Minister Theresa May meets EU leaders next week, a warning about a breakdown in talks from a minister seen strongly to favor a business-friendly “bespoke” transition out of the EU came a day after the EU summit chair spoke of a similar new year deadline.

Donald Tusk said on Tuesday that if London fails to settle divorce terms by December, and so unlock talks on the transition and future trade pact, then the EU would reconsider its objectives. That reflects mounting doubts across Europe that any legal exit deal can be struck.

The longer the stand-off goes on, EU negotiators said, the more Britain’s choice come March 30, 2019, will be between the “hard Brexit” by which it will simply quit all EU systems and be treated like, say, Australia, and a virtual status quo, staying in most EU systems, without voting rights, rather like Norway.

“The closer we get, the less there is to discuss about a transition and the more it just goes to a standstill transition, with Britain still in everything, but without a vote,” one said.

“Pretty soon,” said another, “It will be Norway or nothing.”

While all such commentary reflects the sides’ jockeying for negotiating advantage, the evidence this week is that they remain far apart and are getting tetchy. May and the EU traded jabs over whose court “the ball” is in after the prime minister made concessions in a speech at Florence on Sept. 22.

Behind closed doors, British negotiators voiced outraged surprise that her offer was seen as insufficient to launch talks on the future relationship. “It’s hard to say it was genuine,” one EU official said of the show of emotion. “It’s a form of pressure.”

Brexit Secretary David Davis and EU negotiator Michel Barnier are due to give a news conference around noon (1000 GMT) on Thursday to give an update on the week’s progress.

BUSINESS WORRIES

Businesses are sounding the alarm. A German industry federation warned members to start preparing for a “very hard Brexit”. A senior representative of London’s financial services industry told a Brussels audience this week that a legal transition agreement must be reached by the end of this year.

“Most importantly, it must reflect the status quo,” said Catherine McGuinness of the City of London Corporation. “There is no feasibility in asking firms to transition to a transition. If uncertainty continues, businesses will vote with their feet.”

Hammond ruled out budgeting -- yet -- for more customs and border facilities, and few on the continent believe threats of a walkout they say would hurt Britain more than them.

So leaders will watch May’s struggle to unite her government and sit tight. One senior EU diplomat said British counterparts were in such a weak position that “sometimes I feel sorry them”.

For many in Brussels, that makes a virtual status quo after Brexit the increasingly likely outcome: “In March 2019, Britain will formally leave,” said another EU official.

“But de facto most of the existing arrangements will remain ... They will have their celebration of ‘independence’ and then we will sit down to talking business again.”

May insists a two-year transition period is enough to agree a new free trade pact, but many question that.

John Bruton, the former prime minister of Ireland, has recommended an alternative to either no deal at all or a virtual status quo transition -- just keeping Britain fully in the EU for four years beyond 2019.

Arguing that the two-year deadline set by Article 50 of the EU treaty raises the risk of talks collapsing, and that agreeing first a transition and then another accord is complex, Bruton said this week that Britain and the EU should agree to a six-year negotiating period, with Britain only leaving in 2023.

Neither wants any extension. But Bruton warned: “The present tight time frame ... increases the likelihood of miscalculation and of the UK leaving the EU with no deal at all.”","In Brexit poker, clock narrows transition options",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-transition/in-brexit-poker-clock-narrows-transition-options-idUSKBN1CG2O2

Asked by a reporter if he could envision maintaining free trade with Canada if NAFTA talks sour with Mexico, Trump said: “Oh sure, absolutely. It’s possible we won’t be able to reach a deal with one or the other, but in the meantime we’ll make a deal with one.”

Trump added that a “very creative” deal was still possible to benefit all three countries.

Trump’s comments came at a White House meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who was in Washington to promote NAFTA’s benefits as a new round of renegotiations began near Washington.

Asked about Trump’s comments at a news conference later, Trudeau said he was still optimistic about the chances of modernizing the 1994 trade pact.

”I continue to believe in NAFTA ... so saying, we are ready for anything, and we will continue to work diligently to protect Canadian interests,” Trudeau said.

Trudeau added that Canada was “very much aware of and very braced for” Trump’s unpredictability, but his government would work in a “thoughtful, meaningful way towards getting a good deal.”

Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo, speaking on Mexican radio, praised Trump’s comments as “very balanced” to include the possibility of a deal with either country and hold out hope for a creative solution.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Tuesday accused Trump’s administration of trying to sabotage the talks with “poison pill proposals,” including demands for more favorable treatment for the U.S. side on car production, and a “sunset clause” to force regular negotiations.

In his appearance with Trudeau, Trump said: “We’ll see what happens” when asked whether NAFTA was doomed.

“It’s possible we won’t be able to make a deal, and it’s possible that we will,” he said. “We’ll see if we can do the kind of changes that we need. We have to protect our workers, and in all fairness, the prime minister wants to protect Canada and his people also.”

“We don’t hope it will, we don’t desire that it will, we don’t believe that it will, but it is at least a conceptual possibility as we go forward,” Ross said.

But U.S. and Mexican corporate chief executives gathered in Mexico City said they would be better off with no NAFTA than be saddled with a “bad agreement.”

AGGRESSIVE PROPOSALS

Slideshow (10 Images)

Trade experts said the NAFTA talks were likely to stall in the face of aggressive U.S. attempts to sharply increase content requirements for autos and auto parts.

People briefed on U.S. proposals to be presented this week said Washington was seeking to sharply lift North American content threshold in car manufacturing.

The proposals call for North American content overall to rise to 85 percent from the current 62.5 percent. In addition, the United States wants to add a new 50 percent U.S.-specific content requirement, something that was not in the earlier agreements.

“These will be met with widespread opposition from Canada and Mexico. I think it’s just a bridge too far,” said Wendy Cutler, the Asia Society’s Washington policy director and former chief U.S. negotiator for the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal canceled by Trump.

The U.S. side sees strengthening the rules of origin for the auto industry as a way to bring back some auto parts production, including electronics, from Asia. But Mexico strongly opposes a U.S.-specific content requirement, which would limit the growth of its own car industry.

The difficult issue of rules of origin will be addressed mostly at the end of the current talks, according to a schedule obtained by Reuters. The negotiations were extended on Wednesday by two days to Oct 17.

Other U.S. proposals opposed by Canada, Mexico and U.S. business interests include the five-year sunset provision, radical changes to NAFTA’s dispute arbitration systems, changes to intellectual property provisions and new protections for U.S. seasonal produce growers.

U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said on Wednesday the three nations had completed their negotiations on company competition policy, reaching an agreement that goes beyond previous U.S. trade deals to ensure “certain rights and transparency under each nation’s competition laws.”","Trump says open to bilateral Canada, Mexico pacts if NAFTA talks fail",https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCAKBN1CG0DV-OCADN

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Thursday pushed back against federal aid for Puerto Rico as the House of Representatives prepared to weigh $36.5 billion in emergency relief for the U.S. territory and other hurricane-hit areas as well as fire-ravaged California.

Lawmakers are expected to approve the bipartisan measure that will also provide relief to the storm-struck areas of Florida, Texas, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and leaders of both major parties have lauded the bill.

Trump, in several early Twitter posts, however, criticized Puerto Rico for ”a total lack of “accountability,” saying “electric and all infrastructure was disaster before hurricanes.”

While he noted it was up to “Congress to decide how much to spend,” he said: “We cannot keep FEMA, the Military & the First Responders, who have been amazing (under the most difficult circumstances) in P.R. forever!”

The content and timing of the comments, as the island struggles with the storm’s aftermath, prompted swift backlash from some Democratic lawmakers, who said such a move would amount to abandoning U.S. citizens.

“There is still devastation, Americans are still dying. FEMA needs to stay until the job is done,” Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer replied on Twitter.

Representatives for the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on what Trump meant by his tweets.

Republican U.S. Representative Scott Perry defended Trump’s statement, telling CNN federal assistance was meant to be finite and that it was “reasonable” for the island to eventually take up its own governance.

The bill includes $18.7 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s disaster relief fund. Of that amount, $4.9 billion is earmarked for loans to local governments to ensure that the cash-strapped Puerto Rico can keep government programs operating beyond Oct. 31.

Other funds include $576.5 million for the federal government’s wildfire control efforts. Some $16 billion would go toward the National Flood Insurance Program to help it cover claims after reaching its borrowing limit.

Once passed by the Republican-led House, the Senate, also controlled by Republicans, is expected to take up the package later this month after it returns from a week-long recess.

Republican and Democratic lawmakers, however, said more money would likely be needed later.

“These funds are vital right now, in the near term, to get the aid where it is needed most,” said House Appropriations Committee Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen, a Republican.

Democratic Representative Nydia Velázquez of New York, which has a large Puerto Rican community, said the relief package was “just the start” of federal aid to the island, where large areas remain without electricity or running water three weeks after Hurricane Maria made landfall.

Puerto Rico is burdened with nearly $72 billion in pre-hurricane debt being overseen by a federally created oversight board.

Velázquez said the funds earmarked for loans to local governments would assist Puerto Rico’s “liquidity crisis” and that steps must be taken to ensure that creditors are unable to access funds meant for disaster relief.","As US House weighs $36.5 billion disaster relief, Trump slams Puerto Rico",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-congress/as-us-house-weighs-36-5-billion-disaster-relief-trump-slams-puerto-rico-idUSKBN1CH1A7?il=0

(Reuters) - Democrats desperate to rebuild after losing the White House last year have scored a string of election victories for statehouse seats, testing a new generation of candidates and activists eager to resist President Donald Trump’s conservative agenda.

From New Hampshire to Oklahoma, Democrats have flipped eight Republican-held seats in special legislative elections, having spent millions of dollars on low-turnout contests mostly being fought over local issues. The wins showcase how Democrats want to fight back after losing to Trump and hitting historic lows in statehouses.

But the party faces challenges carrying this momentum into the 2018 midterm elections when thousands of seats are at stake, interviews with nearly two dozen Democratic leaders, campaigns and other political experts show.

“Can we recruit enough capable candidates, and can we run enough modern races?” asked Simon Rosenberg, a Democratic political strategist. He said the party must test its future leaders in real time. “Are they ready? The answer is: We don’t know.”

In November, Democrats will get an early read.

One critical test is in Washington state, where first-time candidate Manka Dhingra is running for an up-for-grabs senate seat in Seattle’s suburbs. A victory on Nov. 7 would give Democrats full control of the state.

A prosecutor and school parent volunteer, Dhingra is a Sikh Indian American whose political awakening began with businessman Trump’s surprise election victory over experienced politician Hillary Clinton. Still, Dhingra steers clear of mentioning the president in her pitch to swing voters.

“The Trump reaction, the way it works is by invigorating volunteers,” Dhingra said. “There are a lot of people, like myself, who decided we cannot be bystanders.”

Nearly 2,000 volunteers have signed up through her campaign website alone, evidence of what the party calls unprecedented interest in legislative contests.

An August primary, where Dhingra finished 10 points ahead of her Republican competitor, had a relatively robust turnout, including nearly 6,000 voters who normally skip primaries.

Outside of Washington state, however, a few Democratic wins will do little to change the political map going into the 2018 midterm elections.

Republicans control 26 state governments and two-thirds of legislative chambers. Democrats hemorrhaged power at the state level during President Barack Obama’s eight years in office with their attention on national elections.

Now Democrats see the states as critical for rebuilding, and an opportunity to advance legislation pushing back against Trump’s agenda of gutting Democratic health care reforms and environmental protections and cracking down on immigration.

VOTER OUTREACH

The party plans to recruit hundreds of thousands of volunteers to contact more than 30 million voters - double their outreach in statehouse contests in the 2016 presidential cycle.

“Because of the gridlock in Washington, people are turning to statehouses for security from Donald Trump,” said Jessica Post, executive director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.

But the party’s many inexperienced candidates must beat battle-tested incumbents in elections next year with greater voter turnout.

“If the Democrats have every bit of momentum and the wildest day they could think of, they may take us from super majorities to majorities,” said David Avella, chairman of the Republican group GOPAC. “But we will still have majorities.”

Democrats have flipped legislative seats in Florida, Oklahoma, New Hampshire and New York in 2017. Republicans picked up an uncontested seat in Louisiana.

In Oklahoma, where Trump won 65 percent of the vote in the 2016 general election, the Democrats flipped three seats in districts he carried. Candidates doubled down on local issues, such as a budget crisis forcing four-day school weeks.

They had a chance to “represent themselves as real people that weren’t actually attached to Nancy Pelosi, or Hillary Clinton, or Barack Obama,” said Anna Langthorn, Oklahoma Democratic Party chairwoman.

Some of the special elections success reflects startup progressive groups rallying voters. But they have yet to figure out how to expand their scope for 2018.

Chris Walsh, a cofounder of Flippable, which is working to win back state governments, went to Florida last month to help Democrat Annette Taddeo beat a Republican former legislator who once competed on Trump’s reality TV show, “The Apprentice.”

“There is a lot of knowledge out there that is siloed,” Walsh said, adding the party could help by sharing information such as district voting data with new groups.

This year’s most revealing contests will come in a statewide election in Virginia, where Democrats face a long-shot bid in November to pick up 17 seats and take back the House of Delegates.

In a show of enthusiasm to rebuild, the party is fielding a ticket that is more than 50 percent larger than two years ago. Yet fewer than one in four of the mostly women vying for Republican-held seats have raised more money than their competitors, Virginia Public Access Project data showed.

Republicans are also ramping up in defense. They anticipate state contests will be central to Democratic efforts in 2018, given their longer odds of reclaiming the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress.

“The Democrats are trying to probe for the weakest link, and they are looking for that at the state level,” said Matt Walter, president of the Republican State Leadership Committee. “It is our job to make sure that doesn’t happen.”",Democrats rising?

If Spanish authorities hoped strong-arm tactics against the referendum independence for Catalonia would nip nationalist feeling in the bud, they will almost certainly be proved badly wrong. Sunday’s footage of violent police action against unarmed demonstrators may prove just the catalyst pro-independence groups wanted, handing Europe yet another crisis when it needed it least.

Ironically, the government of Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy would have done better to simply ignore the non-binding referendum. It was always likely to produce a vote for independence, if only because those who favored it were far more likely to vote. Broader opinion polls conducted before the weekend ballot never showed majority support for independence, and most estimates suggest it has been ebbing steadily since 2013 to around 40 percent.

The scale of the violence this weekend and the brutality of the national police attempts to stop the ballot – almost 900 injured, according to local authorities – has changed everything. While the referendum was expected to be a polarizing event, the Spanish authorities have now effectively guaranteed it will be seen as a defining moment not just for Catalonia but the country at large. It would be astounding if it did not yield a substantial spike in separatist feeling. In a single day, the Rajoy government may have taken what should have been a manageable issue and escalated it into an existential challenge for Spain.

Catalonia’s governor Carles Puigdemont could always have been hoping to declare independence in the aftermath of the ballot. The widely reported violence, however, delivers a degree of political legitimacy to that fact. That doesn’t mean Spain will necessarily fracture – but it does dramatically increase the chances of that happening in the longer run.

A Spanish break-up will have broad implications for a continent that has spent much of the last decade bouncing from crisis to crisis, but had been having a better year than many U.S. and British pundits had anticipated. French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel both bested far-right challenges in national elections, growth is improving in eurozone economies and the refugee crisis appears to have stabilized.

Events in Spain, however, are a stark reminder that almost every European country remains trapped in a slow-burning political crisis with an ever-growing chance of unusual, unorthodox and outright aggressive nationalist or radical politics eroding the center ground.

In France, the National Front is clearly poised to take advantage of the faltering popularity of Macron, who defeated far-right leader Marine LePen in May. In Germany, Alternative for Germany (AfD) came in a strong third in last week’s election, and is now in parliament for the first time. The festering sore of Brexit continues to raise a host of challenges for both the EU and Britain, while Greece, Italy and Spain continue to struggle economically despite strong broader European growth.

So far, European nations are struggling to work out what their position should be with Spain. For all the public criticism of what is clearly seen as an unnecessarily heavy-handed Spanish clampdown, few European leaders have been willing to criticize Rajoy in public. Behind closed doors, however, the message will almost certainly be that the weekend’s scenes cannot be repeated.

Spain is not the only European country with separatist regions, and that will certainly be little appetite for a wider upswing in the regional nationalism. Just as serious, however, is the way events in Spain reinvigorate the wider European narrative of crisis.

Already, the euro was trading slightly lower on Monday on the news. Russian broadcasters and social media feeds – always keen to jump on anything that undermines the European political mainstream – gave front-page coverage to the news of riot police using rubber bullets and batons to stop the Catalonia vote. Wider international attention can be expected to continue, potentially exacerbating political polarization at every step.

Rajoy’s government is in a tricky situation. It must realize that more heavy-handed use of law enforcement will simply strengthen the separatist cause. Unlike more authoritarian states, Spain does not have the option of bludgeoning dissent into the ground. But nor can it afford to ignore events in Catalonia, for fear the now-heightened momentum behind the pro-independence movement grows still further.

The most obvious solution would be to offer Catalonians more regional autonomy. So far, however, there are few signs of that – and Rajoy’s early statements praising the police response and denying that the referendum has any legal force look set to aggravate tensions rather than ameliorate them.",Commentary: Spain's missteps supercharge the Catalonia crisis,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apps-catalonia-commentary/commentary-spains-missteps-supercharge-the-catalonia-crisis-idUSKCN1C724O

HARRISBURG, Pa./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Wednesday told workers that they would win under his tax plan, saying it would help the middle class and boost the economy, though critics say it would mainly benefit corporations and the rich.

Speaking in an airplane hangar at a Pennsylvania Air National Guard base in Harrisburg with a trailer truck behind him, Trump reiterated the basic points of the nine-page tax cut “framework” he unveiled two weeks ago.

“It’s a middle-class bill. That’s what we’re thinking of. That’s what I want,” Trump said.

“I’ve had rich friends of mine come up to me, and say, ‘Donald, you’re doing this tax plan -- we don’t want anything. ... Don’t give it to us. Give it to the middle class.’ And that’s what we’re trying so hard to do,” he said.

His remarks came as new Reuters/Ipsos polling showed that more than three-quarters of Americans say the wealthiest Americans should pay more in taxes.

The poll found 53 percent of adults “strongly agree” and 23 percent “somewhat agree” that the wealthiest Americans should pay higher tax rates. The Sept. 29-Oct. 5 poll of 1,504 people has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of plus or minus 6 percentage points.

Financial markets have rallied strongly since Trump’s November 2016 election victory, driven partly by expectations that he would cut taxes for businesses, although policy analysts have been skeptical that he would do so.

Trump on Wednesday boasted about the rally in markets.

“The stock market is soaring to record levels, boosting pensions and retirement accounts for hard-working Americans. Their values are going up every single day,” he said.

Earlier on Wednesday, San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams said he was a “little bit discouraged” about the prospects for federal tax reform.

Given the difficulties Congress has had in passing laws this year, Williams, in comments following a speech in Salt Lake City, said he is “losing confidence” that any tax reform will be passed in the next six months or so.

DEMOCRATS DISPUTE “PAY RAISE”

Trump said his plan for cutting corporate taxes could boost wage growth and mean a $4,000 pay raise for the average household, citing research from a White House economic council.

Democrats, who oppose Trump’s plan, dispute such claims.

“I have not seen any evidence that even comes remotely close to that,” Richard Neal, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee, said of the $4,000 calculation at a forum on Wednesday in Washington.

Independent analysts have said Trump’s blueprint would provide uneven tax relief, add significantly to the federal budget deficit, and in some cases, benefit the very wealthy.

For instance, taxpayers in the highest 1 percent of incomes, making more than $730,000 annually, would get about half of the total benefit from Trump’s plan, with after-tax incomes rising an average of 8.5 percent, according to the Tax Policy Center, a Washington-based nonprofit tax think tank.

Trump on Wednesday said his framework would provide a $500 tax credit to “those who care for an adult dependent or elderly loved one” and that it would substantially increase the child tax credit. No details on those items have been made public.

Congressional tax writers in the House and Senate are working to fill in the details of Trump’s framework. Republican leaders hope to pass a bill by January, delivering what would be Trump’s first legislative victory a year into his presidency.

Before that can happen, the Senate and House must open a procedural path for tax legislation by passing a budget resolution. Lawmakers have hoped to do that this month.

CORPORATE, PASS-THROUGH CUTS

The tax framework, developed in secret by a select group of senior Republicans known as the Big Six, calls for cutting the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent and creating a new category for pass-through income earned by partners and sole proprietors, which would be taxed at 25 percent, instead of the 39.6 percent top individual rate currently paid by some.

It proposes cutting the top individual rate to 35 percent, but congressional tax writers may opt to create an additional, higher rate for the highest earners.

The plan also proposes eliminating the 40 percent tax on inherited estate assets worth more than $5.5 million, or $11 million for a married couple.

A highly placed Republican operative who used to work with senior leadership on Capitol Hill said he did not expect the estate tax repeal to be included in a final package, because the proposal would greatly benefit Trump himself and his family, which would leave the tax reform effort and Trump open to Democratic attack.

He said many Republicans do not see estate tax repeal as crucial, but Republicans have promised wealthy supporters for years that the tax, which they call the “death tax,” will end.

Trump on Wednesday offered a different view. Republicans will end “the crushing, horrible, and unfair estate tax,” he said.

Trump said on Tuesday he would likely sign an executive order this week allowing people to cross state lines to obtain “great, competitive healthcare” that would cost the United States “nothing.”

The Republican president offered no specifics, but several sources familiar with the order said it was expected to be in the form of guidance to the U.S. Health and Human Services, Labor and Treasury Departments, which would be asked to look at ways that individuals and small businesses can band together to form “associations” that would buy large group health plans from states with the fewest regulations.

If the plan were to come to fruition, some healthcare analysts said it would undermine former President Barack Obama’s signature Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, by making it easier for Americans to buy stripped-down health insurance policies on the cheap. Supporters say more people could gain health insurance at a lower cost.

Despite controlling the White House and Congress, Republicans have failed in efforts this year to fulfill their campaign promise to repeal and replace Obamacare, which they say is intrusive and ineffective. Democrats defend the law, saying it has extended health insurance to some 20 million Americans.

Several experts in healthcare and employment law said Trump’s plan could violate the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), a federal law that governs large group plans that must be provided or maintained by employers or employee organizations.

Expanding association plans to market insurance to individuals who are not employees would “not be remotely legal,” said Nicholas Bagley, a professor of healthcare law at the University of Michigan.

ERISA does allow associations to act as employers and manage benefit plans.

But federal regulators have generally interpreted the law to mean that employers in the association must have a common interest beyond buying insurance, said Allison Hoffman, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Law.

“The E in ERISA is employee,” Joseph Antos, a healthcare expert at the American Enterprise Institute, a think tank that has been critical of Obamacare.

“They are going to have to stretch the definition of whether you’re an employee or not,” he said of Trump’s expected plan.

The White House declined to comment.

ENCROACHING ON STATE POWERS?

It is not clear when challenges to a Trump order would be filed. The timing could depend on if and when the Cabinet departments begin taking steps to put the plan in place.

State attorneys general would likely be among the first to legally challenge Trump’s order or regulations that stem from it, said Dania Palanker, an assistant research professor at Georgetown University’s Center on Health Insurance Reforms.

Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said in a statement on Wednesday that her office “will oppose any attempt to undermine” the state’s commitment to ensuring that every resident has access to quality healthcare.

Healey is one of several Democrats who previously sued to block Trump policies, including his proposal to block travel to the United States from six Muslim-majority countries.

In addition to challenging Trump’s healthcare proposal on ERISA grounds, the states could also oppose it on federalist grounds, said Hoffman. She noted that states had primary power to regulate insurance, except where a federal law explicitly says otherwise, as Obamacare does.",Trump healthcare order could face strong legal objections,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-healthcare-lawsuits-analysis/trump-healthcare-order-could-face-strong-legal-objections-idUSKBN1CH0DR?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenyan authorities banned protests in central Nairobi and other hotspots as they tried to keep a lid on mounting political turmoil in the build-up to a repeat presidential vote.

The order issued on Thursday covered business districts in Nairobi, the western city of Kisumu and the port of Mombasa - the scenes of repeated demonstrations since the Supreme Court annulled the last vote in August, citing irregularities.

The main opposition, which has held rallies calling for electoral reforms and the sacking of vote officials, said it would take to the streets again on Friday, and on a daily basis from Monday, despite the ban.

“The protests are covered by the bill of rights in the constitution. We do not hold the protests as a favor by the State,” Dennis Onyango, the spokesman for opposition leader Raila Odinga, said.

Politicians and activists from all sides have traded insults and accusations since the court ruling, raising fears of a repeat of the ethnically charged violence that killed around 1,200 people after a contested 2007 vote.

President Uhuru Kenyatta, whose August election victory was annulled by the court ruling, is due to stand again against Odinga on Oct. 26.

But this week Odinga announced he was withdrawing from the race, because of failure to reform the election board. The board responded that the vote would go ahead anyway with the names of Odinga and the other original candidates on the ballot paper.

“THE POLITICAL BATTLE”

At least 17 demonstrators were hospitalized on Wednesday with bullet wounds and other injuries, said medical workers in Kisumu, an opposition stronghold.

The opposition has accused the police of using excessive force while the government has accused the protesters of destroying private property .

Reuters saw footage of a crowd attacking a policeman with stones and sticks during protests in the western town of Homa Bay, near Kisumu. Marius Tum, the Homa Bay police boss, said 14 people had been arrested and would be charged with assault and participating in unlawful assembly.

Odinga’s spokesman Onyango did not immediately respond to a request for a comment on the incident.

The standoff has spooked investors in the region’s richest economy. The all share index on the Nairobi bourse was 0.43 percent lower at the close, amid low volumes, traders said.

In August, only Odinga and Kenyatta polled more than one percent. Three of the other candidates - Abduba Dida, Japheth Kavinga and Ekuru Aukot - told Reuters they intended to stand again.

“The political battle in this country has been between the Odingas and the Kenyattas for the longest time,” said Aukot. “Voters will be looking for a neutral person who can pacify the country.”

A Kenyan rights group said this week that at least 37 people were killed in protests immediately following the Aug. 8 poll.

SAN FRANCISCO(Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Waymo sought at least $1 billion in damages and a public apology from Uber Technologies Inc as conditions for settling its high-profile trade secret lawsuit against the ride-services company, sources familiar with the proposal told Reuters.

The Waymo self-driving car unit also asked that an independent monitor be appointed to ensure Uber does not use Waymo technology in the future, the sources said.

Uber rejected those terms as non-starters, said the sources, who were not authorized to publicly discuss settlement talks. The precise dollar amount requested by Waymo and the exact time the offer was made could not be learned.

Waymo’s tough negotiating stance, which has not been previously reported, reflects the company’s confidence in its legal position after months of pretrial victories in a case which may help to determine who emerges in the forefront of the fast-growing field of self-driving cars.

The aggressive settlement demands also suggest that Waymo is not in a hurry to resolve the lawsuit, in part because of its value as a distraction for Uber leadership, said Elizabeth Rowe, a trade secret expert at the University of Florida Levin College of Law.

Waymo recently persuaded a San Francisco federal judge to delay a trial to decide the dispute from October to early December, citing the need to investigate evidence Uber had not disclosed earlier.

No further settlement talks are currently scheduled, the sources said. The judge overseeing the case mandated that the companies enter mediation with a court-appointed magistrate.

Amy Candido, a Waymo attorney, declined to comment on any settlement talks, but said the company’s reasons for suing Uber are “pretty clear.”

“Waymo had one goal: to stop Uber from using its trade secrets,” she said. “That remains its goal.”

An Uber spokesperson declined to comment.

DISRUPTIVE

Waymo sued Uber in February, claiming that former engineer Anthony Levandowski downloaded more than 14,000 confidential files before leaving to set up a self-driving truck company, called Otto, which Uber acquired soon after.

Uber denied using any of Waymo’s trade secrets.

Waymo’s lawsuit has been disruptive for Uber. U.S. District Judge William Alsup granted Waymo’s request for a pretrial injunction in May, which prohibited Levandowski from working on Lidar, a key sensor technology for self-driving cars that is the crux of the current litigation.

Uber later fired Levandowski, regarded as a visionary in autonomous technology, after he refused to return Waymo documents at the heart of the case. Levandowski has asserted his constitutional right against self-incrimination and declined to answer questions from Waymo lawyers.

Meanwhile, Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick stepped down as chief executive in June after allegations of widespread misconduct at the company became public. Kalanick has since become embroiled in a boardroom fight with fellow Uber investor Benchmark Capital.

Benchmark cited Waymo’s allegations of trade secret theft in separate litigation aimed at forcing Kalanick off Uber’s board. A Delaware judge put that lawsuit on hold and sent it to private arbitration.

On Sunday Oct. 1, the day before Kalanick was scheduled to give a deposition in the Waymo case, Kalanick’s lawyers called Waymo and asked to postpone the deposition, lawyers for both companies said in court last week.

Kalanick’s lawyers said he was in the middle of a fight to appoint new board members and was therefore too busy, Waymo attorneys said in court. Waymo refused the request, forcing Kalanick to attend the deposition.

DISTRACTING A COMPETITOR

Causing such distractions for a competitor are a clear benefit to Waymo, Rowe said. Uber has hired three law firms to litigate the case and devoted thousands of hours to probe Uber servers for Waymo confidential information.

“I‘m counting all those as good reasons to keep the lawsuit going,” Rowe said.

Waymo has estimated damages in the case at about $1.9 billion, according to court filings, which Uber disputes. Despite that figure and the big settlement demands, Waymo views winning a permanent injunction against Uber using any Waymo intellectual property as the main priority, another source familiar with the company’s thinking said.

Much of the technical evidence in the case has been filed under seal, making it impossible for outside observers to independently assess the strength of each side’s arguments. In court last week, Alsup said Uber’s product was “dissimilar” from Waymo‘s.

Even if a jury finds that Uber stole Waymo trade secrets, Uber says in court filings that its engineers have designed around the Waymo technology at issue in the case. If that is true, that would lessen the impact on Uber in the event of a defeat in court.

Waymo is skeptical of Uber’s claim, however. In a court filing on Monday, it requested an order forcing Uber to disclose its source code, or underlying software, for its Lidar products.

The Alphabet subsidiary said in the filing that it recently learned that former employees took Waymo source code when they went to work at Uber, “including software related to the ‘brains’ of the vehicle that determines how the car moves.”",Exclusive: Alphabet's Waymo demanded $1 billion in settlement talks with Uber - sources,https://in.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-uber-lawsuit/exclusive-alphabets-waymo-demanded-1-billion-in-settlement-talks-with-uber-sources-idINKBN1CH0QC

Infographic ID: '2sWkzTB'

Now foreign companies that have spent billions of dollars on U.S. factories and local leaders who host them worry that global supply networks that back those investments will fray if Trump makes good on his pledge to roll back trade liberalization.

The U.S. president has threatened to tear up North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico and slap higher tariffs on nations that run trade surpluses with the United States, such as Germany or China. The administration is also discussing tighter immigration rules and more security screening of investment.

The tough message helped sway swing northeastern and Midwestern Rust Belt states Trump’s way in the 2016 election, but puts him at odds with companies and local leaders in the south, which has driven the recent growth in manufacturing jobs.

The southern states have voted for Trump, but have also spent decades wooing foreign companies with flexible labor laws, financial incentives and investment in ports, roads and other infrastructure.

POSTER CHILD AND WHIPPING BOY

The courtship has spawned new auto plants from Kentucky to Georgia, and a new Airbus (AIR.PA) plant in Mobile, Alabama.

Few places highlight the gap between Trump’s rhetoric and local aspirations better than Spartanburg in South Carolina.

German carmaker BMW (BMWG.DE) has invested here $8 billion in a 1.2 million square foot (11.15 hectares) assembly plant, which has become the largest single exporter of cars by value from the United States.

South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster, a Republican and Trump supporter, credits the German automaker for putting his state on the global investment map.

“The presence of this company changed everything in the trajectory of our state,” McMaster said on Monday at an event unveiling BMW’s newest X3 sports utility vehicle.

Its Chief Executive Harald Krueger said the carmaker would invest additional $600 million in Spartanburg over the next four years, adding 1,000 jobs to the 9,000-strong workforce, and spend further $200 million on employee training and education.

But the poster child of South Carolina’s success also doubles as a whipping boy. In January, BMW’s plans to build a plant in Mexico drew Trump’s ire and last month the U.S. president was quoted as saying Germany was “very bad” on trade and selling too many cars in the United States.

FILE PHOTO: An overall view of the assembly line where the BMW X4 is made at the BMW manufacturing plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina March 28, 2014. REUTERS/Chris Keane/File Photo

And even as the company highlights its contribution to the U.S. economy and the benefits of free trade, it is hedging its bets by preparing for a possible protectionist backlash.

Outside of the spotlight, BMW is retooling factories in South Africa and China to build volume models like the X3 SUV, reducing its dependence on Spartanburg.

“We have a big footprint here, and we are flexible enough,“ Oliver Zipse, BMW’s board member responsible for manufacturing, told Reuters. ”We will build the X3 not only in Spartanburg, we will split it into South Africa and then to China, so we will have some flexibility to produce cars somewhere else,” he said.

“If something happens at the political level - which we don’t know yet - we are able to have a flexible response.”

The Trump administration has said it welcomes foreign investment and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, who spoke at an opening of a new Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) plant in South Carolina, said such projects showed that ”America is becoming an even stronger destination for global businesses looking to grow.”

The southern U.S. states owe much of their success to coastal port authorities and cities that have invested heavily to make their channels and docks fit for shipments to and from China and Mexico.

Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina who has often clashed with Trump, said protectionism would undermine those accomplishments and hurt American workers.

DOOMSDAY SCENARIO

“Negotiate a trade agreement with Europe, modernize NAFTA, don’t tear it up,” Graham told Reuters at the BMW factory. “We’re going in the wrong direction. We need more trade agreements, not less.”

Graham noted how low-cost competition from China and Mexico destroyed South Carolina’s once thriving textile industry and how the state reinvented itself as a manufacturing hub, bringing the likes of BMW or French tire maker Michelin (MICP.PA).

The now humming port city of Charleston has a similar story to tell. When a major navy base shut down in the 1990s wiping out 20,000 jobs, local officials worked to bring foreign manufacturers, which now employ around 10,000 in the three counties around the city and more is set to come.

Mercedes-Benz, part of Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE), is adding 1,300 jobs so it can make its Sprinter van here rather than merely assemble it with imported parts, which also means more business for local suppliers.

Up the road, Volvo Car Group, part of Chinese conglomerate Geely [GEELY.UL], is due to open its first North American plant next year with a target workforce of 2,000.

Local development officials expect more jobs and investment to come, but worry that some steps discussed by the Trump administration could have a chilling effect.

Claire Gibbons, director of global marketing at the Charleston Regional Development Alliance, said the proposed new tariffs, tougher immigration rules and stricter reviews of foreign investment projects would amount to a “doomsday scenario” for the region.

Top seed Nadal extended his winning streak to 13 matches with a 6-2 6-1 demolition of American Jared Donaldson in the Qi Zhong Stadium before world number two Federer, to the delight of his sizeable Chinese fan club, got the better of Argentina’s Diego Schwartzman 7-6(4) 6-4.

Nadal, who leads Federer by 2,370 points going into the home straight of a season in which the two old rivals have shared out the game’s biggest prizes, was unstoppable against Donaldson and needed only 54 minutes to prevail.

“It was a very quick match in all aspects,” Nadal, bidding to end a year on top for the fourth time in his career, said.

”If the year-end ranking happens, it will be, I think, a very important achievement for me.

“With so many years of difference I think it’s something very difficult. But there remains work to do.”

He last finished the year as world number one in 2013.

Federer shows no sign of giving up the chase but had to battle hard against Schwartzman -- letting slip a break in the first set to get dragged into a tiebreak.

The 36-year-old Swiss always had an extra shot in his locker though and, having taken the opener, broke serve straight away in the second set to move toward victory.

He finished off the contest with his 14th ace, setting up a third round clash against Ukraine’s Alexandr Dolgopolov.

“It was a good win, very happy with my first match,” Federer said. “I knew he was dangerous. I could have closed the first set out earlier but I started the second set very well.”

Spaniard Nadal, who like Federer has won the Shanghai title once, will face Italy’s Fabio Fognini next.

Eighth seed David Goffin’s hopes of qualifying for the ATP World Tour Finals suffered a blow when he lost 7-6(4) 6-3 to Gilles Simon, while sixth seed Grigor Dimitrov had to save match points on the way to beating Ryan Harrison 3-6 6-3 7-6(6).

Seventh seed Pablo Carreno Busta also went out, losing 7-5 7-5 to fellow Spaniard Albert Ramos-Vinolas.",Nadal and Federer ease through in Shanghai,https://www.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idAFKBN1CH0UK-OZASP

YANGON (Reuters) - Rohingya Muslims are not native to Myanmar, the army chief told the U.S. ambassador in a meeting in which he apparently did not address accusations of abuses by his men and said media was complicit in exaggerating the number of refugees fleeing.

The U.N. human rights office said on Wednesday Myanmar forces had brutally driven out half a million Rohingya from northern Rakhine state to Bangladesh in recent weeks, torching homes, crops and villages to prevent them from returning.

Thousands of Rohingya were leaving the state on Thursday, aiming to reach Bangladesh by boat, citing a shortage of food and fear of repression, residents said. A Myanmar official said people were leaving but he dismissed the suggestion hunger and intimidation were factors.

The army chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, gave his most extensive account of the Rohingya refugee crisis aimed at an international audience in the meeting with Ambassador Scot Marciel, according to a report posted on his Facebook page.

The general is the most powerful person in Buddhist-majority Myanmar and his apparently uncompromising stance would indicate little sensitivity about the military’s image over a crisis that has drawn international condemnation and raised questions about a transition to democracy under Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.

The military campaign is popular in Myanmar, where there is little sympathy for the mostly stateless Rohingya, and where Buddhist nationalism has surged.

Min Aung Hlaing, referring to Rohingya by the term “Bengali”, which they regard as derogatory, said British colonialists were responsible for the problem.

“The Bengalis were not taken into the country by Myanmar, but by the colonialists,” he told Marciel, according to the account of the meeting posted on Thursday.

“They are not the natives.”

Coordinated Rohingya insurgent attacks on some 30 security posts on Aug. 25 sparked a ferocious military response.

The U.N. rights office said in its report, based on 65 interviews with Rohingya who had arrived in Bangladesh, that abuses had begun before the Aug. 25 attacks and included killings, torture and rape of children.

U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley last month denounced a “brutal, sustained campaign to cleanse the country of an ethnic minority” and called on countries to suspend providing weapons to Myanmar until its military put sufficient accountability measures in place.

The European Union and the United States are considering targeted sanctions against Myanmar’s military leaders, officials familiar with the discussions said this week.

Suu Kyi was swept into office last year after winning an election, but the military holds immense power, including exclusive say over security.

‘FEEL INSECURE’

U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra‘ad al-Hussein has described the government operations as “a textbook example of ethnic cleansing” and said the action appeared to be “a cynical ploy to forcibly transfer large numbers of people without possibility of return”.

Min Aung Hlaing did not refer to such accusations, according to the published account, but said the insurgents had killed 90 Hindus and 30 Rohingya linked to the government.

Insurgent opposition to a citizenship verification campaign, which used the term Bengali, was behind the Aug. 25 attacks that sparked the violence, he said.

“Local Bengalis were involved in the attacks under the leadership of ARSA. That is why they might have fled as they feel insecure,” he said, referring to the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army insurgents.

“The native place of Bengalis is really Bengal,” he said.

He said it was an exaggeration to say a “very large” number were fleeing to Bangladesh and there had been “instigation and propaganda by using the media from behind the scene”.

He did not elaborate but said the “real situation” had to be relayed to the international community. U.N. political affairs chief Jeffrey Feltman is due to visit on Friday.

Rohingya residents of Rakhine said up to 10,000 people had left on Wednesday and Thursday.

One resident, a teacher, said there had been no military offensive recently but people were going.

“There’s no work, nowhere to get food and the government isn’t helping,” said the teacher, who, like the first resident, declined to be identified.

Rakhine state’s secretary, Tin Maung Swe, said people were leaving “every day” to join relatives already in Bangladesh.

”Nobody is starving in death in Myanmar. The government is trying to support those in need,“ he said. ”They can fish or catch shrimps in the creeks near their villages.

“No one’s killing them or intimidating them.”

Suu Kyi, in a televised address, spoke about the importance of humanitarian assistance for all people in Rakhine and said the government would accept refugees back.

She said aid groups, international organizations and Myanmar expatriates would help with the long-term development of the state. She did not refer to accusations of rights abuses by the army.","Myanmar army chief says Rohingya Muslims 'not natives,' numbers fleeing exaggerated",https://www.reuters.com/article/myanmar-rohingya/myanmar-army-chief-says-rohingya-muslims-not-natives-numbers-fleeing-exaggerated-idINKBN1CH0I3

SAN JOSE, Calif. (Reuters) - Facebook Inc has begun overhauling how it handles political ads on its platform and may put some changes in place before U.S. elections next year, Facebook’s chief technology officer said on Wednesday.

U.S. congressional and state elections set for November 2018 present a deadline of sorts for Facebook and other social media companies to get better at halting the kind of election meddling that the United States accuses Russia of.

“We are working on all of this stuff actively now, so there is a big focus in the company to improve all of this on a regular basis,” Facebook CTO Mike Schroepfer said in an interview.

“You’re going to see a regular cadence of updates and changes,” he said, speaking on the sidelines of a conference that Facebook is hosting about virtual reality technology.

Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said last month that the company would begin treating political ads differently from other ads, including by making it possible for anyone to see political ads, no matter whom they target. U.S. lawmakers had begun calling for regulations.

Disclosures by Facebook, Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google that their products were battlegrounds for Russian election meddling last year have turned into a crisis for Silicon Valley.

Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, is in Washington this week meeting U.S. lawmakers.

Moscow has denied allegations of meddling in last year’s U.S. presidential election.

Implementing changes is tricky, Schroepfer said, because Facebook does not want to stifle legitimate speech and because of the volume of material on Facebook, the world’s largest social network with 2 billion users and 5 million advertisers.

“We’re investing very heavily in technical solutions, because we’re operating at an unprecedented scale,” he said.

Facebook is also using humans. The company said this month it would hire 1,000 more people to review ads and ensure they meet its terms.

Schroepfer, 42, has been Facebook’s CTO since 2013 and previously was director of engineering. He also sits on Facebook’s board of directors.

Facebook has dealt with problematic user-generated content in the past, he said.

“We don’t want misuse of the platform, whether that’s a foreign government trying to intercede in a democracy - that’s obviously not OK - or whether it’s an individual spewing hate or uploading pornography,” he said.",Facebook pushes ad overhaul before 2018 U.S. election: executive,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-advertising/facebook-pushes-ad-overhaul-before-2018-u-s-election-executive-idUSKBN1CH08U

Helping one of Europe’s biggest lenders sounds like an odd way to shake up the dominance of established banks. But small-business customers will probably benefit over time.

State-owned Royal Bank of Scotland is taking measures worth about 835 million pounds to increase competition in business banking – a market currently dominated by the Edinburgh-based lender and fellow high-street behemoths Barclays, Lloyds and HSBC. The package, which was designed to meet state aid conditions arising from RBS’s crisis-era bailout, includes 425 million pounds of grants to “challenger banks and other financial services providers” to help them to grow business lending.

The catch is that the UK subsidiary of Santander qualifies for funding, which can be tapped by any bank whose gross UK assets are worth less than 350 billion pounds. Smaller lenders are reportedly cross that they have to compete for funds with a Spanish bank whose 2008 acquisition of former building society Alliance & Leicester made it a relatively large player in the UK retail market.

Critics miss the point of an aid package whose primary aim is to cut RBS’s market share. Dividing funds purely between relative minnows would have achieved this in the short term. But the risk is that one or more of TSB, Clydesdale or Metro Bank might fail to break into the mainstream, to the benefit of RBS, Barclays or Lloyds.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Bharti Airtel Ltd is acquiring the Tata conglomerate’s consumer mobile business virtually free of charge in a deal that gives India’s top wireless player a major subscriber base boost, while stemming the bleed for Tata from a money-losing venture.

Bharti Airtel will gain over 40 million customers from Tata Teleservices and a subsidiary along with airwaves the companies own on a “debt-free (and) cash-free” basis, according to a joint statement on Thursday, although Bharti Airtel will take on a “small portion” of Tata’s unpaid dues for its airwaves.

India’s telecoms market, with 1.2 billion mobile subscribers, is in the midst of a wave of consolidation as smaller debt-laden players seek exits after overspending in airwave auctions.

Small players and their larger rivals have also been severely weakened by a price war triggered by new entrant Reliance Jio - backed by India’s richest man Mukesh Ambani.

The price war has led to major losses for most carriers, and spurred India’s banking regulator - the Reserve Bank of India -to ask banks to review their telecoms sector exposure and boost their provisioning for any loans made to the sector.

Tata Teleservices, which has more than $5 billion of debt, has been mired in losses and it had been speculated that the group may opt to permanently shutter the operation.

Its parent, salt-to-software conglomerate Tata Group, is also in the middle of a restructuring exercise to improve profitability and cut its complex structure under its new chairman N. Chandrasekaran.

“It’s a very big positive for Tata Group and Chandra ... It’s also a big positive for Airtel as they will have to pay less for the spectrum they are gaining,” said Sanjiv Bhasin, an executive vice president at financial services firm IIFL.

“It’s evident disruption is picking up and consolidation is the game of the hour,” he said, adding that he expects even more deals in the crowded sector.

Vodafone Group and Idea Cellular - the market’s second and third biggest players, respectively, are in the process of combining their operations to create the market’s biggest player, while Bharti Airtel had previously agreed to buy Telenor’s India unit.

A deal to combine debt-laden Reliance Communications’ wireless unit with rival Aircel fell apart this month.

MULTIPLE OPTIONS

Tata chief Chandrasekaran said in the statement the group had evaluated “multiple options” for the telecoms business, calling the Bharti Airtel deal the “most optimal solution”.

Tata and Bharti Airtel will work together to further explore other mutual areas of cooperation, the companies said.

Tata is also in the initial stages of exploring a combination of its enterprise business with Tata Communications Ltd and its retail fixed-line and broadband business with satellite TV arm Tata Sky, according to the statement.

Tata will retain its stake in tower company Viom, and will take care of the liabilities associated with it, according to the statement.

As of end-March, Tata Teleservices and its unit had combined debt of 340.89 billion Indian rupees ($5.24 billion) excluding sums due to the government for spectrum purchases, according to local ratings agency Crisil, which also said Tata Teleservices’ net loss nearly doubled in the year to March, to 46.17 billion rupees.

“Tata were losing money head over heels,” said Satish Betadpur, director of research at brokerage William O‘Neil Companies. “They were not profitable and to make it profitable, they had to spend enormous amount of money.”

In February, Tata agreed to pay NTT DoCoMo $1.18 billion to buy out the Japanese firm’s stake in the telecoms joint venture, settling a long-standing dispute.

Goldman Sachs advised Tata on the Bharti Airtel deal. Bharti Airtel, led by billionaire Sunil Mittal, has operations in 17 countries across Asia and Africa.

One week after suffering a staggering collision with Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico is in the throes of an agonizing humanitarian disaster.

The storm left at least 16 dead and the entire island without power; most people won’t get their lights back on anytime soon. The cascading effects have been devastating. More than half of residents remain without drinking water. Hospitals cannot function. Supermarket shelves are empty and few gas stations are open. Communication networks are crippled, and first responders are struggling to make contact with residents in remote or heavily affected areas. Credit cards are useless, and ATMs are out of service.

We know how to do better and we can do better. Nobody should die because the power went out.

We need a dedicated national effort to fortify our electrical grids so that they can get back online much more quickly after inevitable, and increasingly severe, extreme weather events. Natural disasters happen, but often the catastrophes that follow are man-made. And when it comes to the electricity system—the lynchpin upon which so much of our society relies—widespread, long-lasting power outages can quickly devolve into nightmares all their own. Just a few weeks ago, 11 senior citizens died in Florida following prolonged heat exposure due to power outages in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma. Similar catastrophes were suffered in the wakes of many other earlier storms, including Hurricanes Sandy and Katrina.

The centralized electricity grid is widely vulnerable to threats, both natural and manmade. Flooding can submerge and damage equipment, as it did throughout the Northeast during Sandy; heavy winds can rip down trees and power lines, as was seen throughout Florida from Irma; and extreme heat and forest fires can wreak havoc on transmission lines. Climate change stands to escalate these threats, by contributing to higher seas, more intense storms, worsening wildfires and extended heat waves.

That’s why the focus must be on electricity grid resilience. It’s impractical and impossible to stop all outages from occurring. But it is possible to design the system such that when the power does inevitably fail, fewer people are affected from the outset and power is restored more quickly for the rest.

In Florida, policymakers directed the state’s utilities to “storm harden” their systems following the devastating 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons. One decade and several billion ratepayer dollars later, Irma gave people a chance to see their increased utility bills at work.

Workers repair electrical installations after the area was hit by Hurricane Maria in San Juan, Puerto Rico, September 26, 2017. REUTERS/Alvin Baez

The result: an astounding 6.7 million customers—or nearly two out of every three in the state—were plunged into darkness. Surely evidence of a failed approach, right?

Not quite. When it comes to the cascading failures arising from widespread outages, length of the blackout is a key factor in the severity of the impact. Even though all those Floridians lost power after, the utilities were able to get over one million back online overnight, and millions more restored within a few days with help from crews from across America.

In Florida, that pivot toward improving recovery times has meant, for one, simple upgrades, like replacing thousands of wooden utility poles with concrete that can better withstand hurricane-force winds. In the aftermath of Irma, even though crashing trees and flying debris ripped down power lines, restoration times were vastly improved by a reduced need to replace fallen poles.

Other initiatives can be more technologically complex. For example, by installing sensors and grid automation throughout the system, utilities can pinpoint when and where an outage has occurred, and re-route systems to reduce the number of people without power. Similarly, flood monitoring equipment can alert a utility when critical infrastructure is at risk of inundation, allowing the equipment to be pre-emptively turned off to improve post-storm repair times.

Debris and destruction left by Hurricane Maria in Canovanas, Puerto Rico September 26, 2017. REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins

Tackling a problem this big, however, is impossible for each utility to do alone. Complicating the push for a more resilient electricity system is the fact that proposed interventions can be expensive, and investment dollars are limited. Additionally, the federal government has offered insufficient assistance, leaving states, cities and territories to largely fend for themselves, even though investing in a more resilient system now can reduce the costs of future relief and recovery efforts.

Utilities’ limited funds mean there are trade-offs, so opportunities must be carefully weighed against one another. But the costs of prolonged outages are far-reaching and challenging to quantify, and resiliency metrics are hard to define and even harder to compare. Efforts must also align with other priorities, especially as the power sector undergoes an unparalleled transition to clean and distributed renewable resources.

The fact also remains that some services are far too critical—drinking water, first responders, communications—and some populations, such as the elderly, disabled, or low-income, to tolerate even a day without power. For these people and services, a resilient grid is not enough.

Diesel generators, which have long-served a backup role when disasters hit, are expensive, heavily polluting, and prone to failure due to infrequent use. And as the long and frustrating lines following recent storms have made clear, maintaining steady access to fuel in the aftermath of a severe storm can be challenging, if not impossible. Microgrids powered by solar and storage, on the other hand, are more reliable during times of crisis, better for health and the environment, and increasingly affordable. This is thanks to lower costs of solar and storage technologies, as well as the fact that these systems can provide onsite power, generating benefits all year, not just during extreme weather events.

So what does this mean for Puerto Rico? Reports suggest parts of the island could remain without power for months, potentially impacting millions of people. This is unacceptable.

Now, as a country, we must pool together resources for a swift response to curtail the devastating crisis at hand. But we must also ensure that as the decimated power grid is pieced back together, this catastrophe—and the far too many that preceded it—were not suffered in vain. The electricity system must be rebuilt for a climate-resilient, clean-energy supporting future, not as a replica of its brittle and underinvested past.",Commentary: How we could have prevented some of Puerto Rico’s misery,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mcnamara-electricity-commentary/commentary-how-we-could-have-prevented-some-of-puerto-ricos-misery-idUSKCN1C42ER

The Liberty Party, whose candidate Charles Brumskine was considered a front-runner to take over from Nobel Peace Prize winner Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, said it would consider taking legal action if the National Elections Commission (NEC) did not act on its demands.

The NEC was originally expected to release preliminary results on Thursday.

“The Liberty Party is deeply troubled by the discovery of numerous incidents of irregularities and fraud that occurred during the elections,” Liberty Party national chairman Benjamin Sanvee said in a statement.

“We are calling on NEC to immediately halt further announcements of election results. If NEC does not cooperate with our request, we will take the appropriate legal action,” he said.

He did not give specific evidence of voter fraud and it was unclear what kind of activity could have altered Tuesday’s vote.

An NEC spokesman told Reuters that it was unaware of the Liberty Party’s complaint and did not say whether the commission believed illegal acts occurred.

On election day, materials including ballot boxes arrived late in some locations and some people struggled to find their names on voter rolls, witnesses said, but there was so far no evidence that this was linked to illicit activity.

Any irregularities would taint the results of an election expected to mark the first democratic transfer of power in over seven decades in a country haunted by a civil war that ended nearly 15 years ago.

Liberia, Africa’s oldest modern republic, was founded by freed U.S. slaves in 1847 but its last democratic power transfer dates back to 1943.

LONDON (Reuters) - For years the options market that companies and investors use to hedge against big swings in currencies viewed the euro as a bigger political and structural risk than Britain’s pound.

No more.

In the political and market turmoil immediately before and following Britain’s decision last June to leave the European Union, financial market investors flipped their long-held bias against the euro and now expect sterling to be the riskier party for years to come.

Reuters data going back to 2012 shows three- and five-year risk reversals -- the cost of taking out an option to buy or sell the pound -- have consistently been below zero.

That indicated it was almost always more expensive to hedge against the risk of euro exchange rates collapsing than of the same happening in sterling.

There are always blips. On a handful of occasions since Mario Draghi’s promise to do “whatever it takes” to prop up the euro in 2012, the single currency has briefly been valued as steadier for the long term.

But since an initial jump in the first six months of 2016, both three- and five-year euro-sterling risk reversal contracts have held consistently in positive territory, indicating the tail risk -- the risk of a low probability, high impact event -- is now instead with the pound.

That is the first time in Reuters’ historical data on the options market and means it will be increasingly costly for investors exposed to the pound’s exchange rate to insure portfolios against further slides.

With the pound pummelled by political and economic uncertainty, the euro/sterling five-year risk reversal on Thursday matched its highest in 11 months, showing an increased bias towards sterling weakness.

This followed open disagreement among Bank of England policymakers on the outlook for interest rates and, by extension, the pound.

On Tuesday BoE Governor Mark Carney said now was not the time to raise rates, warning of weak wage growth as Britain prepared to quit the EU.

On Wednesday, the central bank’s chief economist, Andy Haldane, said he was likely to join those voting for a hike later this year.

Bankers are cautious about predicting further steep falls in the pound, but some senior currency market players wonder what will happen to sterling if Brexit talks turn bad.

Some in the sales teams that focus on selling cheap option plays to hedge fund investors wanting to speculate on currency moves say the change is reflective of the broad swing in political risk.

“Risk reversals tend to price fear,” said the head of hedge fund sales with one of the big five international banks who run 40 percent of the $5 trillion a day global currency market.

“It is when you are thinking you are going to get a big gap move. And historically the gap move that was on people’s minds over the last five years was the euro break-up story. This signals a change in the potential tail risks.”

At a time when global measures of volatility are at rock bottom, those in sterling have jumped in the past fortnight, driven initially by a shock electoral turnaround that saw Prime Minister Theresa May deprived of her parliamentary majority.

Analysts say the move in the longer-term risk reversals, however, point to a broader questioning of faith in the pound.

“The market is willing to pay a higher premium to hedge against a large sterling depreciation,” said Sam Lynton-Brown, a strategist with BNP Paribas in London.

“That is a change.”","Forget euro zone breakup, sterling now deemed riskier",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-sterling-options-analysis/forget-euro-zone-breakup-sterling-now-deemed-riskier-idUSKBN19E0WV

Gucci, part of Paris-based luxury group Kering, has paraded models down the catwalk in luxurious fur coats in the past and creative director Alessandro Michele brought in loafers and sling-backs lined with kangaroo-fur two years ago.

But the brand said it would now join an alliance of fur-free companies, adding it would sell off remaining accessories and clothing made with animal fur in a charity auction.

Gucci has sold some of its mink fur coats for over $40,000.

Marco Bizzarri, Gucci’s chief executive, said the brand would drop fur starting from its spring and summer 2018 collection and that its new approach had been agreed on with Michele.

Gucci has enjoyed a revival under Michele, whose flamboyant, colorful designs have fueled sales over the past two years.

Animal rights campaigners said they hoped the move by the Italian fashion house could have a knock-on effect, although it is far from the first label to stop using fur.

“Gucci’s decision will radically change the future of fashion,” Simone Pavesi, manager of animal-free fashion at Italian campaign group LAV. “As fashion becomes more and more ethical, supply chains that revolve around animals will be a thing of the past.”

In June, Yoox Net-A-Porter, a multi-brand online luxury retailer, adopted a fur-free policy on accessories and clothing sold on the site.

Italy’s Giorgio Armani last year committed to stop using fur, saying technological progress meant there was no longer any justification for cruelty to animals, while U.S. brand Calvin Klein took the plunge in 1994.

Anti-fur protesters have been known to demonstrate outside catwalk shows at fashion weeks around the world to call for an end to practices many see as cruel to animals, and luxury goods buyers - especially younger generations - have become more sensitive to environmental issues, too.

Many labels and other luxury groups such as LVMH - owner of Louis Vuitton - are tightening their policies on how leather is sourced from tanneries and how they obtain furs, after a series of scandals over how animals are treated in breeding farms.

France’s Hermes was caught in a storm two years ago when a crocodile farm used to supply leather for one of its best-selling handbags was accused of cruel slaughter practices.","Italy's Gucci bans fur, joining others in seeking alternatives",https://in.reuters.com/article/fashion-fur-gucci/italys-gucci-bans-fur-joining-others-in-seeking-alternatives-idINKBN1CH12Z

SAN JOSE, Calif. (Reuters) - Facebook Inc has begun overhauling how it handles political ads on its platform and may put some changes in place before U.S. elections next year, Facebook’s chief technology officer said on Wednesday.

U.S. congressional and state elections set for November 2018 present a deadline of sorts for Facebook and other social media companies to get better at halting the kind of election meddling that the United States accuses Russia of.

“We are working on all of this stuff actively now, so there is a big focus in the company to improve all of this on a regular basis,” Facebook CTO Mike Schroepfer said in an interview.

“You’re going to see a regular cadence of updates and changes,” he said, speaking on the sidelines of a conference that Facebook is hosting about virtual reality technology.

Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said last month that the company would begin treating political ads differently from other ads, including by making it possible for anyone to see political ads, no matter whom they target. U.S. lawmakers had begun calling for regulations.

Disclosures by Facebook, Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google that their products were battlegrounds for Russian election meddling last year have turned into a crisis for Silicon Valley.

Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, is in Washington this week meeting U.S. lawmakers.

Moscow has denied allegations of meddling in last year’s U.S. presidential election.

Implementing changes is tricky, Schroepfer said, because Facebook does not want to stifle legitimate speech and because of the volume of material on Facebook, the world’s largest social network with 2 billion users and 5 million advertisers.

“We’re investing very heavily in technical solutions, because we’re operating at an unprecedented scale,” he said.

Facebook is also using humans. The company said this month it would hire 1,000 more people to review ads and ensure they meet its terms.

Schroepfer, 42, has been Facebook’s CTO since 2013 and previously was director of engineering. He also sits on Facebook’s board of directors.

Facebook has dealt with problematic user-generated content in the past, he said.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan’s army said on Thursday it had rescued a kidnapped U.S.-Canadian couple and their three children after receiving intelligence from the United States, nearly five years after the couple was abducted in Afghanistan.

American Caitlan Coleman, her Canadian husband Joshua Boyle and the children born in captivity were believed to be held by the Taliban-allied Haqqani network, which the United States has long accused Pakistan of not doing enough to fight.

Coleman and Boyle were kidnapped while backpacking in Afghanistan in 2012. Coleman was pregnant at the time, and a video released by the Taliban in December showed their two sons born while they were hostages.

Thursday’s statement was the first mention of a third child.

The rescue came as Pakistan and the United States, uneasy allies in fighting Taliban and other Islamist extremists in the region, are experiencing one of the worst lows in relations.

“We welcome media reports that a family including U.S. citizens has been released from captivity,” a U.S. Embassy spokesman said on Thursday evening, referring other questions to Washington.

Pakistan touted the success of the operation as proof of the strength of the alliance.

“The success underscores the importance of timely intelligence sharing and Pakistan’s continued commitment toward fighting this menace through cooperation between two forces against a common enemy,” the Pakistani army statement said. The family were released from “terrorist custody”.

Asked by a reporter if he could envision maintaining free trade with Canada if NAFTA talks sour with Mexico, Trump said: “Oh sure, absolutely. It’s possible we won’t be able to reach a deal with one or the other, but in the meantime we’ll make a deal with one.”

Trump added that a “very creative” deal was still possible to benefit all three countries.

Trump’s comments came at a White House meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who was in Washington to promote NAFTA’s benefits as a new round of renegotiations began near Washington.

Asked about Trump’s comments at a news conference later, Trudeau said he was still optimistic about the chances of modernizing the 1994 trade pact.

”I continue to believe in NAFTA ... so saying, we are ready for anything, and we will continue to work diligently to protect Canadian interests,” Trudeau said.

Trudeau added that Canada was “very much aware of and very braced for” Trump’s unpredictability, but his government would work in a “thoughtful, meaningful way towards getting a good deal.”

Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo, speaking on Mexican radio, praised Trump’s comments as “very balanced” to include the possibility of a deal with either country and hold out hope for a creative solution.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Tuesday accused Trump’s administration of trying to sabotage the talks with “poison pill proposals,” including demands for more favorable treatment for the U.S. side on car production, and a “sunset clause” to force regular negotiations.

In his appearance with Trudeau, Trump said: “We’ll see what happens” when asked whether NAFTA was doomed.

“It’s possible we won’t be able to make a deal, and it’s possible that we will,” he said. “We’ll see if we can do the kind of changes that we need. We have to protect our workers, and in all fairness, the prime minister wants to protect Canada and his people also.”

“We don’t hope it will, we don’t desire that it will, we don’t believe that it will, but it is at least a conceptual possibility as we go forward,” Ross said.

But U.S. and Mexican corporate chief executives gathered in Mexico City said they would be better off with no NAFTA than be saddled with a “bad agreement.”

AGGRESSIVE PROPOSALS

Slideshow (10 Images)

Trade experts said the NAFTA talks were likely to stall in the face of aggressive U.S. attempts to sharply increase content requirements for autos and auto parts.

People briefed on U.S. proposals to be presented this week said Washington was seeking to sharply lift North American content threshold in car manufacturing.

The proposals call for North American content overall to rise to 85 percent from the current 62.5 percent. In addition, the United States wants to add a new 50 percent U.S.-specific content requirement, something that was not in the earlier agreements.

“These will be met with widespread opposition from Canada and Mexico. I think it’s just a bridge too far,” said Wendy Cutler, the Asia Society’s Washington policy director and former chief U.S. negotiator for the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal canceled by Trump.

The U.S. side sees strengthening the rules of origin for the auto industry as a way to bring back some auto parts production, including electronics, from Asia. But Mexico strongly opposes a U.S.-specific content requirement, which would limit the growth of its own car industry.

The difficult issue of rules of origin will be addressed mostly at the end of the current talks, according to a schedule obtained by Reuters. The negotiations were extended on Wednesday by two days to Oct 17.

Other U.S. proposals opposed by Canada, Mexico and U.S. business interests include the five-year sunset provision, radical changes to NAFTA’s dispute arbitration systems, changes to intellectual property provisions and new protections for U.S. seasonal produce growers.

U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said on Wednesday the three nations had completed their negotiations on company competition policy, reaching an agreement that goes beyond previous U.S. trade deals to ensure “certain rights and transparency under each nation’s competition laws.”","Trump says open to bilateral Canada, Mexico pacts if NAFTA talks fail",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1CG0DV-OCATP

China’s government wants stakes and board seats at web giants like Tencent, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. Beijing is already influential behind the scenes in technology, and given its tightening grip elsewhere, a power grab in this vital sector was all but inevitable. This will nonetheless cost investors.

China’s bureaucrats have held discussions with Tencent, microblog-operator Weibo, and a video-streaming platform owned by e-commerce group Alibaba, according to the Journal, which cited people close to the companies. State-backed funds would buy a 1 percent stake via “special management shares” allowing them to put a government official on the board. The powerful internet watchdog has already trialled this arrangement with two startups, the newspaper said.

Xi’s government is increasing its control on everything from traditional media to private conglomerates like Dalian Wanda and Anbang. So, Beijing’s latest focus on social media and internet companies was to be expected.

To be sure, too, the government already exerts substantial sway over the sector. Tough censorship and capital controls mean bosses like Tencent’s Pony Ma need good relations with regulators. He and rivals like Jack Ma of Alibaba are also increasingly pushing into sensitive sectors like cloud computing and finance.

That said, government intervention in decision-making will have far more impact. Recently tech groups including Alibaba, Baidu, and JD.com injected $12 billion into state-owned telecom Unicom, as part of the government’s “mixed-ownership” reform. That could be the first of a series of politically motivated investments. So capital allocation could get worse.

Foreign scrutiny of Chinese takeovers is already increasing, and politicians in the United States, Europe and elsewhere are pushing for even tighter controls based on national security concerns. The $1 billion acquisition of U.S.-based MoneyGram by Ant Financial, Jack Ma’s financial-technology group, has been delayed, with the buyer having to refile an application, Reuters reported last month.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Investors are increasingly excited about the prospects for much faster growth in the solar power industry in Southeast Asia, which has until now been a backwater for renewable energy.

They say that the region is in a perfect position to benefit from rapidly declining prices in solar panels. It has strong economic growth, relatively high costs of electricity and a shortage from traditional sources, undeveloped infrastructure in more remote areas, plenty of sunshine, and backing for more renewable energy from many of Southeast Asia’s governments.

“Dramatically falling costs for solar energy technologies means businesses and governments are choosing renewable energy not for environmental reasons but for economic ones,” said Roberto De Vido, spokesman for Singapore-based Equis, one of Asia’s biggest green energy-focused investment firms with $2.7 billion in committed capital. “It simply makes good business sense. And that’s a trend that’s not going to change,”

By the end of last year, Southeast Asia had installed solar capacity of only just over 3 gigawatts (GW), a mere 1 percent of global capacity, according to data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena).

Steve O’Neil, the chief executive of Singapore-based solar panel maker REC, said he expects that to grow by 5 GW of new installations every year between 2017-2020. That’s the equivalent of building five standard fossil-fuel power stations annually.

""People don't realize what is about to happen, when you're in the middle of exponential growth,"" said REC's O'Neil. ""It's transformational.

Some European funds are among those looking at the region.

“The projects on offer in Europe are stagnating, so European investors are looking in that direction with great interest,” said Armin Sandhoevel, chief investment officer for Infrastructure Equity at Allianz Global Investors, whose team manages 1.6 billion euros ($1.76 billion) worth of renewable investments.

“In Asia, you’d expect double-digit returns. That’s hard to achieve in Europe,” he said.

Southeast Asia has a population of more than 600 million and annual power demand growth of 6 percent, which most countries struggle to meet.

Solar power potential is measured by Global Horizontal Irradiation (GHI), a measurement of the intensity of the sun. Thailand has a GHI that can produce 1,600 to 2,000 kilowatt-hours of solar power per square meter (kWh/m2), well above the 1,000 to 1,200 kWh/m2 in Europe’s solar leader Germany, according to solar weather and data provider Solargis.

The region is ripe for a boom because solar panel prices have crashed to under 50 cents per watt of electricity today from $70 per watt in 1980 as technology and manufacturing efficiency have improved consistently.

At the same time, Southeast Asian countries have all set ambitious renewable energy targets, ranging from 18 percent of overall energy generation mix in Thailand and Malaysia to 35 percent in the Philippines, up from negligible levels today.

There are, of course, still risks for investors - including currency volatility, the difficulties of making land acquisitions, and usually the lack of any government guarantees, said Sharad Somani, head of Asia/Pacific Power & Utilities at KPMG.

Storing solar power through the night remains a hurdle too, though battery technology is improving rapidly.

VENTURE CAPITAL

Bringing together international investors, panel makers, and potential users is a small but growing group of venture capital firms, mostly based in Singapore.

GA Power is one such firm. Led by German solar business veterans, it focuses entirely on financing and developing solar projects across Southeast Asia.

“There is more money than there are projects. If you can offer professional developed projects, you’ll have no issue organizing funding,” said Roland Quast, GA Power’s managing director, adding that “a solar boom in Southeast Asia is unavoidable” given it is now a competitive power source.

Slideshow (14 Images)

He said an investor can expect around a 12 percent economic internal rate of return on average in the region. The measurement reflects returns after costs for the construction, installation, and operation of a project.

Mid-sized solar projects that can be turned on without having to tap into a larger grid are in favor in the region as governments seek to bring power to an area without having to add expensive infrastructure, Quast said.

KPMG’s Somani, who is an adviser in the renewables sector, said that Equis and other funds are raising capital with U.S. and European institutional investors, including pension funds. Equis declined to provide detail on the sources of its money.

“Today we have unique confluence of all three factors necessary for success of such projects – demand for projects from government/utility side supported by conducive regulatory framework, strong developer and supplier interest and abundance of domestic and international financing availability,” Somani said.

KILLER ARGUMENT

At the REC solar panel factory in Singapore, one of Singapore’s biggest manufacturing sites, a thousand workers and more than a hundred robots work around the clock, churning out 20 containers full of panels every day, which are immediately sent to overseas customers, increasingly to Southeast Asia.

“We produce 14,000 panels per day, which go into 20 containers, 24/7. We never stop,” REC’s O‘Neil told Reuters during a recent visit to the factory.

Founded in Norway, headquartered in Singapore, and owned by Chinese industrial giant ChemChina, O‘Neil says that REC sells globally, but that he expects “Southeast Asia to become a game-changer.”

In 2016, REC grew by just 3 percent in Southeast Asia - excluding the huge solar markets of India, China and Australia. This year, it expects 5 percent growth in the region, and then 9 to 10 percent growth annually between 2018 and 2020.

The business is cut-throat. Cheap Chinese production of solar panels has left a trail of collapsed companies in its wake - the bankruptcies of Germany’s SolarWorld, once Europe’s biggest panel maker, and major U.S. panel maker Suniva are among them.

To survive, REC says it needs to be in a relentless drive to improve productivity, including employing low-wage Malaysian workers and automating as much as possible.

“Our panels are now cheaper than a same-sized window,” said O‘Neil.",Here comes the sun: investors increasingly hot on solar projects in S.E. Asia,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asia-renewables-analysis/here-comes-the-sun-investors-increasingly-hot-on-solar-projects-in-s-e-asia-idUSKBN18Y0DU

U.S., Canadian and Mexican negotiators are meeting in Arlington, Virginia, this week for a fourth round to try to revise the 23-year-old agreement, which allows the tariff-free flow of vehicles and parts across the three borders.

U.S. President Donald Trump has criticized NAFTA for luring U.S. manufacturing jobs to low-wage Mexico and has vowed to quit the pact or revise it to reduce his country’s $64 billion trade deficit with its southern neighbor.

Ending NAFTA, however, would result in a full reversion to tariffs under World Trade Organization rules, according to the Boston Consulting Group study sponsored by the Motor Equipment Manufacturers Association. The U.S. auto parts industry employs about 870,000 workers.

Mexico and Canada would fare better because they previously charged higher tariffs than the United States and would revert to those levels. And with no trade incentive to manufacture in the United States other than to avoid the 25 percent truck tariff, more full vehicle production would migrate to low-cost countries such as China, auto experts say.

Job losses could be as much as 24,000 if renegotiations lead to requirements for content from North American and specifically the United States, according to the study.

NAFTA negotiators face tough new U.S. demands to increase regional content for autos to 85 percent from 62.5 percent, with 50 percent from the United States, according to people briefed on the plan.

The rules of origin demands are among several conditions that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has labeled “poison pill proposals” that threaten to torpedo the talks.

The auto parts study was conducted before these targets were revealed.

Raising the automotive content thresholds and forcing automakers to verify the North American origin of more electronics and other parts now sourced from Asia would cause some parts manufacturers to forego NAFTA benefits, said Ann Wilson, the association’s head of government affairs.

Instead, companies may ship in more products from low-cost countries outside the region, paying U.S. tariffs ranging from 2.5 to 5.0 percent.

“Instead of encouraging more U.S. content, these provisions will lead to less U.S. content,” Wilson said.","Ending NAFTA could cost U.S. up to 50,000 auto parts jobs: study",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trade-nafta-autos/ending-nafta-could-cost-u-s-up-to-50000-auto-parts-jobs-study-idUSKBN1CH1Z4

United are second in the Premier League, level on 19 points with neighbours Manchester City, but so far Mourinho’s side have yet to face any of last season’s top five.

Six wins from their opening seven games, with 21 goals scored and only two conceded, have raised expectations at Old Trafford, but the coming weeks should give a stronger indication of just how ready United are for a real push for the title.

Spurs visit Old Trafford on Oct. 28 and then a week later United travel to Stamford Bridge to take on defending champions Chelsea, Mourinho’s former club.

The North West derby has always had an extra edge and even though the lack of local players for both clubs could take away some of the needle from the game, the passion from the stands continues to create a special atmosphere.

“Anfield away is the ultimate test, mentally and physically with the intensity,” former United captain Gary Neville told Sky Sports.

“There’s obviously less home grown talent but the atmosphere will be brilliant and it is a game which you dare not lose as a player.”

Particular focus will be on United’s 75 million pounds ($98 million) Belgian striker Romelu Lukaku, who has been in prolific form, scoring in 12 of his last 13 games for club and country.

The powerful forward joined United from Everton during the close-season and has been an instant success - but there are still some who question whether he can be just as effective against better opponents.

While Lukaku - and United - will want to prove that they are the real deal, Liverpool badly need to kick-start their campaign after a shaky beginning.

Juergen Klopp’s side have taken just five points from their last four games, leaving them seven points behind the Manchester clubs.

The exciting attacking talent in the team, despite the loss to injury of Sadio Mane who is out for six weeks with a hamstring injury, should test the United defence that has had a relatively comfortable campaign so far.

Former Liverpool striker and manager Kenny Dalglish expects Mourinho to protect his defence with a cautious approach, similar to how they played in last season’s 1-1 draw on Merseyside.

“Last year, when United came to Liverpool, Jose Mourinho parked the bus. But it wasn’t just the one bus, I think it was a couple of double deckers he put there,” said Dalglish.

”I think United will come and set up quite defensively...

“I think Jose will try to make sure the pressure is on Liverpool, but the pressure is on everyone when it comes to a game like that.”

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian new home prices rose less than expected in August as prices were unchanged in a number of markets, including the cities of Toronto and Vancouver, which have been the country’s hottest regions, Statistics Canada said on Thursday.

The 0.1 percent increase in national prices from the previous month was shy of forecasts for a gain of 0.3 percent. The index excludes apartments and condominiums.

Prices were unchanged in 15 of the 27 markets surveyed, including Toronto, where prices were flat for the third month in a row.

Home sales and prices in Canada’s largest city have cooled from their April peak since the Ontario government imposed a number of measures to rein in the hot market, including a foreign buyers tax.

Prices were also unchanged in Vancouver after five consecutive months of increases, the statistics agency said. Vancouver has had its own foreign buyers tax since last August, which initially dampened activity, though prices have been heading higher again.

Canada has had a long housing boom, partly fueled by lower borrowing costs in the wake of the global financial crisis.

Hochtief’s supervisory board is poised to discuss the potential Abertis acquisition at a meeting on Wednesday, two people close to the matter said.

If Hochtief goes ahead with a bid it would offer Abertis shareholders a mixture of cash and shares, they said.

To help finance the deal, Hochtief would launch a multi-billion euro capital increase, in which parent ACS would not take part and therefore see its 72 percent stake diluted, they added.

ACS and Hochtief declined to comment.

Italian toll-road group Atlantia in May offered 17 billion euros ($20.2 billion) in cash and equity to buy Abertis, and ACS announced shortly after it was considering a counterbid.

Last month, ACS said it was still looking into a potential bid for Abertis but that it had yet to make a decision on the issue and submit it to its board.

ESTCOURT, South Africa (Reuters) - Police fired rubber bullets and stun grenades to break up crowds hurling insults at a group of men accused of cannibalism in a South African farming town.

More than 500 people gathered outside the magistrates court in eastern Kwa-Zulu Natal province on Thursday as the men sat inside, hiding their faces with their hooded tops and their hands.

Authorities originally charged seven men after police said one of them had walked into a police station in August with a human leg and a hand. Police spokeswoman Col. Thembeka Mbele told Reuters on Thursday he had confessed that he was tired of eating human flesh.

The court acquitted three of the men on Thursday on charges of murder and conspiracy to commit murder, saying there was a lack of evidence. The other four were held in custody and the case adjourned until Oct. 27.

“We have not charged them with cannibalism, as no such charge exists as far as I know,” Mbele said.

“No one has seen them eating any of the human parts they had in their possession but we are still investigating,” she added.

Officers were also investigating the suspects for the offence of possessing human remains, Mbele said.

Police blocked streets outside the court in the town of Estcourt, about 160 km (100 miles) north of Durban, Kwa-Zulu Natal’s biggest city.

They fired the teargas and grenades to keep the crowds at bay as security officers drove all seven men back to jail - the three acquitted man were released later.

Members of the crowd shouted back at officers. “Where were you when they were eating people?” said one.

Some protesters told local media they feared missing loved ones may have been eaten.

Others have linked the deaths with witchcraft, referring to traditional medicines that can be made from a range of ingredients including animal or human body parts.",Crowds hurl abuse at South African cannibalism suspects,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-safrica-cannibal/crowds-hurl-abuse-at-south-african-cannibalism-suspects-idUSKBN1CH1ZK?il=0

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices rose in September as the price of gasoline recorded its biggest increase in more than two years amid hurricane-related production disruptions at oil refineries in Texas.

Other data on Thursday showed applications for unemployment benefits dropped to a more than one-month low last week as the boost to claims in Texas and Florida from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma continued to unwind.

While the storms impacted the data, there were signs of underlying strength in both wholesale inflation and the labor market, potentially leaving the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates again in December.

The Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand increased 0.4 percent last month after rising 0.2 percent in August. Wholesale prices were also lifted by an increase in the cost of services. In the 12 months through September, the PPI jumped 2.6 percent. That was the biggest gain since February 2012 and followed a 2.4 percent jump in August.

Wholesale gasoline prices soared 10.9 percent in September after increasing 9.5 percent in August. The increase was the largest since May 2015 and accounted for two-thirds of the 0.7 percent rise in the price of goods. The Labor Department said higher energy prices were likely the result of “reduced refining capacity in the Gulf Coast area due to Hurricane Harvey.”

It said Harvey and Irma, which devastated Florida, had “virtually” no impact on the collection of PPI data or survey response rates. Harvey and Irma, which struck in late August and early September, caused the economy to shed jobs last month for the first time in seven years.

The storms have also restrained consumer spending and undercut industrial production, homebuilding and home sales.

Last month’s gasoline-driven surge in the PPI, however, is likely to be temporary amid ample crude oil supplies.

The U.S. dollar .DXY was little changed against a basket of currencies after the data. Prices of U.S. Treasuries pared gains while U.S. stock index futures were trading lower.

CORE INFLATION FIRMING

A key gauge of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services rose 0.2 percent last month after a similar increase in August. The so-called core PPI increased 2.1 percent in the 12 months through September after climbing 1.9 percent in August.

Inflation has remained relatively low, with the main measure tracked by the Fed retreating further below its 2 percent target in August.

Price pressures remain benign despite the labor market nearing full employment, with the jobless rate at more than a 16-1/2-year low of 4.2 percent. Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said that temporary factors such as one-off price cuts by wireless telephone companies are holding back inflation.

Minutes of the Fed’s Sept. 19-20 meeting published on Wednesday showed a vigorous debate among policymakers over inflation, with “several” expressing concern that “the persistence of low rates of inflation might imply that the underlying trend was running below 2 percent.”

Despite tepid inflation, U.S. financial markets have largely priced in a rate increase for December. The Fed has increased borrowing costs twice this year.

Last month, the cost of services increased 0.4 percent, driven by a rise in margins for final demand trade services, a measurement of changes in margins received by wholesalers and retailers. Services edged up 0.1 percent in August.

The cost of healthcare services was unchanged after advancing 0.3 percent in August. Those costs feed into the Fed’s preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy.

In a second report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased 15,000 to a seasonally adjusted 243,000 for the week ended Oct. 7, the lowest level since late August.

Claims have been declining since surging to an almost three-year high of 298,000 at the start of September as workers displaced by the hurricanes were left temporarily unemployed.

Underscoring the labor market’s underlying strength, claims have now been below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a robust labor market, for 136 straight weeks. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller.

The claims report also showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 32,000 to 1.89 million in the week ended Sept. 30, the lowest level since December 1973.",U.S. producer prices increase; weekly jobless claims fall,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-unemployment/u-s-producer-prices-increase-weekly-jobless-claims-fall-idUSKBN1CH1SH

(Reuters) - Firefighters struggled overnight to halt the spread of wildfires known to have killed 23 people in North California, preparing for winds to shift after one town threatened by flames evacuated all residents.

The edge of the deadly Tubbs fire was less than two miles (3km) from Calistoga, a Napa Valley community whose 5,000 residents left their homes on Wednesday.

Whether the town burns “is going to depend on the wind,” its Fire Chief Steve Campbell told Reuters early on Thursday. “High winds are predicted, but we have not received them yet.”

Tubbs is one of nearly two dozen fires spanning eight counties that, raging largely unchecked since igniting on Sunday, have left hundreds of residents unaccounted for.

They have also charred around 170,000 acres (69,000 hectares) of land and destroyed some 3,500 buildings since.

While their cause has not been conclusively determined, they are thought to have been sparked by power lines toppled by gale force winds, and fanned by hot, dry “Diablo” winds that blew into northern California toward the Pacific.

New advisory evacuations were also issued in Sonoma County late on Wednesday for parts of Santa Rosa, the largest city in the state’s world-renowned wine country, and Geyserville, an unincorporated town of 800 people.

“The winds are predicted to be very erratic,” said county spokesman Barry Dugan. “There will be burst of high gusts that can be ... very unpredictable and difficult when you are fighting a fire and also for residents who we are trying to keep posted.”

Wildfires have damaged or demolished at least 13 Napa Valley wineries, a vintners’ trade group said on Tuesday.

Around 25,000 people remained under evacuation on Wednesday as the fires belched smoke that drifted south over the San Francisco Bay area, where some residents donned face masks.

STILL MISSING

More than 285 people were still missing in Sonoma County late on Wednesday night, the sheriff said on Twitter. It was unclear how many might be fire victims rather than evacuees who had not checked in with authorities.

In Santa Rosa, blocks in some neighborhoods resembled war zones, with little left but charred debris, broken walls, chimneys and the steel frames of burned-out cars.

The 23 recorded deaths make the fires the deadliest in the state since 1991, with Tubbs, which has accounted for 13 fatalities, the worst single blaze since 2003, according to state data.

In addition to high winds, the fires have been stoked by an abundance of thick brush left tinder dry by a summer of hot, dry weather.

Matt Nauman, spokesman for the region’s main utility, Pacific Gas & Electric, said many power lines had fallen during gales that packed gusts in excess of 75 miles (120km) per hour.

California Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency in several northern counties, as well as in Orange County in Southern California, where a fire in Anaheim destroyed 15 structures and damaged 12.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The New Yorker reported on Tuesday that 13 women have claimed that movie producer Harvey Weinstein sexually harassed or assaulted them, including three who told the magazine they had been raped.

Weinstein’s spokeswoman Sallie Hofmeister was quoted in the article saying, “Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein.”

Weinstein and the women for whom contact information was available did not reply to Reuters requests for comment. Reuters was unable to independently confirm any of the claims.

“Mr. Weinstein obviously can’t speak to anonymous allegations, but with respect to any women who have made allegations on the record, Mr. Weinstein believes that all of these relationships were consensual,” Hofmeister was quoted as saying.

Weinstein’s wife of 10 years, Marchesa label fashion designer Georgina Chapman, said late on Tuesday that she was leaving him, according to a report in People magazine.

“My heart breaks for all the women who have suffered tremendous pain because of these unforgivable actions. I have chosen to leave my husband,” Chapman was quoted as saying.

Her representatives did not respond to a request for comment.

The New York City Police Department and Manhattan District Attorney’s office said in separate statements on Tuesday that Weinstein was investigated in 2015 over an allegation that he sexually abused one of the women, who was named in the article. The district attorney’s office said there was insufficient evidence to charge him.

Separately, the New York Times reported on Tuesday that actress Gwyneth Paltrow said she was sexually harassed by Weinstein more than 20 years ago and that Angelina Jolie said she “had a bad experience with Harvey Weinstein in my youth and as a result chose never to work with him again.”

The New Yorker reported that Italian actress Ambra Battilana Gutierrez went to police in 2015 claiming that Weinstein had sexually assaulted her.

She was asked by police to arrange another meeting with Weinstein during which she would wear a recording device, the New Yorker reported.

Manhattan Chief Assistant District Attorney Karen Friedman- Agnifilo said on Tuesday, referring to the wire, “While the recording is horrifying to listen to, what emerged from the audio was insufficient to prove a crime under New York law.”

Actress Gutierrez could not be reached for comment.

The New York Times published an article last week in which it was alleged that Weinstein had sexually harassed several women over 30 years. After a statement in which Weinstein apologised for his behaviour, his attorney Charles J. Harder said the newspaper’s story was defamatory because it relied on “mostly hearsay accounts and a faulty report.”

Weinstein, one of the most powerful men in Hollywood who produced and distributed movies like “Shakespeare in Love” and “Chicago,” was fired over the weekend from his job as co-chairman of The Weinstein Company.

The Democratic National Committee and several Democratic politicians who received political contributions from Weinstein said they would reroute the money to women’s rights groups.

On Tuesday, former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said she was “shocked and appalled” at the reports about Weinstein. She did not mention any contribution but said “the behaviour described ... cannot be tolerated.”",Women claim Harvey Weinstein sexually assaulted them - report,https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-people-harvey-weinstein/women-claim-harvey-weinstein-sexually-assaulted-them-report-idUKKBN1CF2PH

Donald Trump mentioned Afghanistan just once in his speech to the United Nations Tuesday. His “new strategy for victory” there, he said, would help “crush the loser terrorists and stop the reemergence of safe havens they use to launch attacks on all of our people.”

Trump outlined that new strategy on August 21, in an address that was a curious mixture of the vague and the specific. Speaking at Fort Myer, the U.S. president announced plans to deploy additional American troops, but did not give details about numbers, policy specifics or an exit strategy. He mentioned Pakistan 12 times – criticizing it for “housing the very terrorists that we are fighting” – but did not make a single mention of the two other countries ramping up resistance to the U.S. presence in the region: Russia and Iran.

That was a serious omission on Trump’s part. No U.S. plan for Afghanistan can accomplish even its most minimal objective of destroying militant groups like al Qaeda or the Taliban unless it factors in the mounting evidence that Tehran and Moscow are playing a more aggressive role in resisting the American presence in the region.

Sharif Yaftali, chief of general staff of the Afghan national army, told the BBC in an exclusive interview on September 6 that Kabul has evidence showing that Iran had provided the Taliban with weapons and equipment in western Afghanistan. While Yaftali acknowledged that Afghan security forces have not yet found any evidence of Russian support for the Taliban, others believe Tehran is consolidating its South Asian partnership with Russia by serving as a mediator between Moscow and Afghan insurgents.

“The regional politics have changed,” Mohammed Arif Shah Jehan, an Afghan senior intelligence official recently appointed the governor of Farah province adjacent to Iran told The New York Times in August. “The strongest Taliban here are Iranian Taliban.”

Iran also helps Russia provide various types of weaponry to the Taliban, Hayatullah Hayat, the provincial governor of Helmand province, told the Washington Post. The arms deliveries include rocket-propelled grenades, landmines, sniper rifles and 82mm mortar rounds.

In a similar vein, construction of the largely India-funded Chabahar port in Iran’s southeastern Sistan and Baluchistan province is arguably pursued with a view to the Afghan war and the strategic rivalries unfolding there. A counterweight to Pakistan’s Chinese-backed Gwadar port only 62 miles away, Chabahar will enhance Delhi's foothold in landlocked Afghanistan by offering it convenient access through the Gulf of Oman, thereby enabling India to bypass rival Pakistan. This can in turn boost Iran’s military mobility and political influence over events in the conflict-ridden nation.

Perhaps the most telling sign of Tehran-Taliban collaboration dates back to May 2016, when a U.S. drone targeted a lone vehicle on a desert route in the southwest Pakistani province of Baluchistan, killing the driver and his only passenger. The passenger’s passport listed his name as Wali Mohammad; U.S. and Afghan officials said he was really Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansour.

Intriguingly, the mystery passenger was returning from Iran; the passport indicated that it was at least his second trip to the neighboring Islamic Republic that year.

The catalyst for Shiite Iran’s unlikely yet growing relationship with the Sunni Taliban has been the rise of the more militant, rabidly anti-Shiite Islamic State in parts of Afghanistan. For Iran, the Taliban is the lesser evil with the potential to serve as a local bulwark against the spread of the most aggressive anti-Iranian forces to its east.

Trump needs to recognize the profound regional shift in interests and alliances since the U.S. invaded Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington. Back in 2001, Tehran helped the U.S.-led coalition topple the Taliban, which it blamed for the killing of Iranian diplomats during the storming of Iran’s consulate in Mazar-i-Sharif three years earlier. The intelligence and military assistance offered by Iran and its Afghan allies in the Northern Alliance – a military front that also enjoyed the backing of Russia and India at the time – was indispensable to the U.S. mission.

Sixteen years on, Trump’s anti-Iran sentiments make a similar collaboration unlikely. However, Washington does have to recognize that it cannot ignore Iran’s national security concerns in its immediate neighborhood or Russia’s strategic interests in Central and South Asia. Trump doesn’t have to become Moscow or Tehran’s best friend, but he should be considering measures like offering to de-list Iran as a “state sponsor of terrorism” and easing sanctions against Tehran and Moscow in return for their withdrawing support from anti-American forces in Afghanistan. Those measures aren’t going to end Afghanistan’s internal conflict, but they might de-escalate it enough for Trump to work on a new exit strategy for U.S. troops.",Commentary: The real deal Trump has to make on Afghanistan,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-behravesh-afghanistan-commentary/commentary-the-real-deal-trump-has-to-make-on-afghanistan-idUSKCN1BV28K

Asked by a reporter if he could envision maintaining free trade with Canada if NAFTA talks sour with Mexico, Trump said: “Oh sure, absolutely. It’s possible we won’t be able to reach a deal with one or the other, but in the meantime we’ll make a deal with one.”

Trump added that a “very creative” deal was still possible to benefit all three countries.

Trump’s comments came at a White House meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who was in Washington to promote NAFTA’s benefits as a new round of renegotiations began near Washington.

Asked about Trump’s comments at a news conference later, Trudeau said he was still optimistic about the chances of modernizing the 1994 trade pact.

”I continue to believe in NAFTA ... so saying, we are ready for anything, and we will continue to work diligently to protect Canadian interests,” Trudeau said.

Trudeau added that Canada was “very much aware of and very braced for” Trump’s unpredictability, but his government would work in a “thoughtful, meaningful way towards getting a good deal.”

Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo, speaking on Mexican radio, praised Trump’s comments as “very balanced” to include the possibility of a deal with either country and hold out hope for a creative solution.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Tuesday accused Trump’s administration of trying to sabotage the talks with “poison pill proposals,” including demands for more favorable treatment for the U.S. side on car production, and a “sunset clause” to force regular negotiations.

In his appearance with Trudeau, Trump said: “We’ll see what happens” when asked whether NAFTA was doomed.

“It’s possible we won’t be able to make a deal, and it’s possible that we will,” he said. “We’ll see if we can do the kind of changes that we need. We have to protect our workers, and in all fairness, the prime minister wants to protect Canada and his people also.”

U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, one of Trump’s top trade advisers, downplayed the chances that a NAFTA termination would become necessary.

“We don’t hope it will, we don’t desire that it will, we don’t believe that it will, but it is at least a conceptual possibility as we go forward,” Ross said.

But U.S. and Mexican corporate chief executives gathered in Mexico City said they would be better off with no NAFTA than be saddled with a “bad agreement.”

AGGRESSIVE PROPOSALS

Trade experts said the NAFTA talks were likely to stall in the face of aggressive U.S. attempts to sharply increase content requirements for autos and auto parts.

People briefed on U.S. proposals to be presented this week said Washington was seeking to sharply lift North American content threshold in car manufacturing.

The proposals call for North American content overall to rise to 85 percent from the current 62.5 percent. In addition, the United States wants to add a new 50 percent U.S.-specific content requirement, something that was not in the earlier agreements.

“These will be met with widespread opposition from Canada and Mexico. I think it’s just a bridge too far,” said Wendy Cutler, the Asia Society’s Washington policy director and former chief U.S. negotiator for the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal canceled by Trump.

The U.S. side sees strengthening the rules of origin for the auto industry as a way to bring back some auto parts production, including electronics, from Asia. But Mexico strongly opposes a U.S.-specific content requirement, which would limit the growth of its own car industry.

The difficult issue of rules of origin will be addressed mostly at the end of the current talks, according to a schedule obtained by Reuters. The negotiations were extended on Wednesday by two days to Oct 17.

Other U.S. proposals opposed by Canada, Mexico and U.S. business interests include the five-year sunset provision, radical changes to NAFTA’s dispute arbitration systems, changes to intellectual property provisions and new protections for U.S. seasonal produce growers.

U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said on Wednesday the three nations had completed their negotiations on company competition policy, reaching an agreement that goes beyond previous U.S. trade deals to ensure “certain rights and transparency under each nation’s competition laws.”","Trump says open to bilateral Canada, Mexico pacts if NAFTA talks fail",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-trade-nafta/trump-says-open-to-bilateral-canada-mexico-pacts-if-nafta-talks-fail-idUSKBN1CG0DV?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

Given an unproven business model and the flame-out of U.S. rival Blue Apron after its own initial public offering, the loss-making German group’s plan to float belongs in the deep-freeze.

HelloFresh said on Tuesday it plans to raise between 250 million euros and 300 million euros in a Frankfurt initial public offering. Largest shareholder Rocket Internet abandoned a previous IPO attempt in 2015 due to concerns over investor demand and market conditions. It’s not clear why now will be any better.

Shares in Blue Apron, which also ships pre-prepared recipe ingredients to time-poor urbanites, have roughly halved in value since a June listing, and the group trades at around a one-times multiple of forecast sales. At a similar rating, HelloFresh might be worth just under 1 billion euros, based on Barclays estimates of its revenue – about half the upper-end valuation that Bloomberg reported on Oct. 6.

Granted, some of Blue Apron’s problems are unique, such as “operational challenges” in its fulfilment centres and a dependence on the promotion-heavy U.S. market. But both companies are reliant on costly marketing to buy growth. The German group has even cooked up a new accounting measure: earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and marketing, which was 122 million euros higher than EBITDA in the first half of 2017. If getting ahead is a question of piling on marketing spend, HelloFresh could face problems should a giant like Amazon, fresh from its acquisition of Whole Foods, or a major grocer muscle in.

Fortunately there’s no need to serve up this particular dish just yet. Loss-making HelloFresh needs fresh capital to keep growing, but shareholder Rocket Internet is flush with cash after selling shares in Germany’s Delivery Hero and it stake in e-commerce group Lazada. That might be a better source of funds for a company that has all the ingredients for a post-IPO flop.",Breakingviews - HelloFresh IPO belongs in the deep-freeze,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hellofresh-ipo-breakingviews/breakingviews-hellofresh-ipo-belongs-in-the-deep-freeze-idUSKBN1CF1JV

GENEVA (Reuters) - West African migrants trying to reach Europe are dying in far greater numbers in the Sahara than in the Mediterranean but efforts to dissuade them may cause new routes to open up, the United Nations migration agency said on Thursday.

So far this year 2,569 migrant deaths have been recorded in the central Mediterranean, while more than 107,000 migrants, mainly West Africans, have reached Italy.

“One thing we still don’t have is any estimate of number of deaths in the desert,” Richard Danziger, the U.N. International Organization for Migration director for West and Central Africa, told a news conference in Geneva.

“We assume, and I think we have said before, that it has to be at least double those who die in the Mediterranean. But we really have no evidence of that, it’s just an assumption. We just don’t know.”

In Niger, a main transit route, people smugglers were increasingly scared of the authorities, which might make them more prone to abandon migrants in the desert, he said.

Many migrants had told of deaths in the desert, and some said the smugglers believed that if they drove fast through minefields they would be safe, said the IOM’s Niger mission chief, Giuseppe Loprete.

Migrant numbers heading through Niger have fallen dramatically after strong action by the government to close migrant “ghettoes” and arrest people smugglers, he said.

IOM was also trying to spread the word that “you do not want to get caught in Libya,” Danziger said.

“What happens in Libya is far scarier to people than dying, the horror stories that returnees come back with.”

Many of the smugglers did not see themselves as criminals, and were often former desert guides trying to make money. Many of them had given up, while organized criminals with contacts in Libya were continuing, Loprete said.

“Right now they are looking for alternative routes, I think at least equally dangerous,” he said.

“When you plug one hole, other holes are going to open up,” Danziger said.

Niger had two routes to Libya: one closer to Chad that was used to smuggle migrants and one closer to the Algerian border that was far more dangerous and was used by extremist groups and for drugs and gun-running.

An alternative was through northern Mali, a region beset by conflicts between rival groups, but but there did not seem to have been a dramatic rise there, Danziger said.

The route considered the safest was along the western coast of Africa, via Senegal, Mauritania and Morocco to the Strait of Gibraltar, and migrant flows there had increased, he said.",Migrant deaths in the Sahara likely twice Mediterranean toll: U.N.,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-sahara/migrant-deaths-in-the-sahara-likely-twice-mediterranean-toll-u-n-idUSKBN1CH21Y?il=0

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Named the richest man in China on Thursday with a net worth of $43 billion, property tycoon Xu Jiayin is likened by some media to Donald Trump, having built his fortune on a real estate business that has blossomed under a mountain of debt.

The 59-year-old Xu’s China Evergrande Group has a market value of $47 billion, although its total debt stands at more than $100 billion, an issue that has prompted some wary investors to short the stock.

Evergrande, China’s second-most indebted company, has now pledged to cut its net debt ratio to around 70 percent by June 2020 from 240 percent and has raised $3.8 billion in new funds and exchanged $2.8 billion of existing debt this year.

Thanks to a boom in the value of Chinese property assets, Xu’s wealth has climbed by $30 billion in the past year to top the rich list compiled annually by the Hurun Report.

Evergrande, whose shares have surged 480 percent this year, is now ranked as the country’s third-largest developer by sales.

The stock’s bull run to record highs accelerated this month, driven by plans for a backdoor listing in mainland China and the announcement of a target to reduce debt.

Xu’s political stock is also high with the ruling Communist Party.

He is a member of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, the top advisory body. And the State Council, China’s cabinet, bestowed on him the title “National Model Worker” - one of the country’s highest civilian honours.

Earlier this year, Xu, in his advisory role, proposed measures to alleviate poverty and hailed China’s president.

“We believe that under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with General Secretary Xi Jinping as the core, we would certainly win the battle against poverty,” Xu said.

Xu graduated from Wuhan University of Science and Technology in 1982, and was awarded an honorary doctorate degree in commerce by the University of West Alabama in 2008.

He founded Evergrande in 1996 and listed it in Hong Kong in 2009 after raising around HK$6 billion ($767 million) in an initial public offering.

Acquisition-hungry Evergrande, which has developed thousands of middle class homes in China, made headlines in 2010 when it bought the main soccer club in its home town of Guangzhou for 100 million yuan ($15 million).

In 2014, Xu sold a half stake in the club to China’s biggest e-commerce company Alibaba for $192 million.

Alibaba’s founder Jack Ma said at the time that he and Xu hatched the deal over dinner and drinks, and wrapped it up in just a few days.

Xu came under a less friendly spotlight in 2015, when Australia ordered him to sell his A$39 million ($31 million) Sydney mansion as part of a crackdown on foreigners whose buying had contributed to an overheated residential property market.

HONG KONG/TOKYO (Reuters) - Bain Capital is planning on further ramping up its dealmaking in Japan after it came out on top in the recent battle to purchase Toshiba’s semiconductors arm and as it bids to buy out Japan’s third-largest advertising agency, Asatsu-DK (ADK).

In making further acquisitions, the Boston-based Bain would cement its position as one of the most active private equity firms in Japan and help to break down a corporate culture that has been mostly hostile to foreign investors.

“Japan is a hard market. It takes years to build teams, relationships, credibility,” said David Gross-Loh, who is Bain’s co-head of Asia and is in charge of its business in Japan, in an interview. “I wouldn’t be surprised that five years from now we’ll have twice as many deals as we do now.”

Japan’s private equity market is small relative to its economy, the world’s third largest. This year, though, the Toshiba acquisition has pushed private equity-backed deals in Japan to a record $22 billion - more than double 2016’s $8 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.

From 2007 to 2016, some 30-40 buyout deals on average were struck annually with slightly fewer exits each year, according to data provider Preqin. And both deals and exits have been worth a fraction of those done in China every year.

Yet this year has seen a pick up in interest, industry sources say, in part thanks to significant volumes of cash raised in 2016 as funds look to Japan. They are hoping to cash in on demographic shifts -- such as the nation’s aging population - changes in corporate governance standards and a more active initial public offering market allowing for future exits.

Bain led a group of investors, including Apple, SK Hynix <000660 KS>, Dell, Seagate Technology Plc and Kingston Technology that agreed to pay $18 billion for the Toshiba chips business after a mammoth bidding battle.

FORGING TIES

Bain is one of several global private equity firms that opened offices in Japan before the global financial crisis, but it has bet on its own team to forge relationships, rather than rely on banks or advisers - a slower process.

And American rivals have also piled in. KKR & Co is looking to deploy more money in Japan after completing a string of investments, while Carlyle Group targets companies in the upper-mid size with its Japan fund, while seeking larger deals with its funds in other global regions.

Another global name, Blackstone Group, will remain focused on real estate in Japan, a person familiar with the firm said.

But Bain has been ahead, striking two of Japan’s five largest private equity-backed M&A deals, with Toshiba the biggest. KKR’s $4.2 billion acquisition of auto parts maker Calsonic Kansei Corp is the second largest.

Gross-Loh said that Bain is able to catalyze growth at Japanese domestic businesses that were stable and well-managed but weren’t exposed to global rivals and therefore not as competitive as they could be.

Both Bain and Carlyle last year participated in the high-profile auction of Takata Corp, which filed for bankruptcy in June after its air bags were linked to deaths and injuries.

According to people familiar with the deal, Bain is part of the winning bid for Takata, led by Chinese-owned U.S.-based Key Safety Systems. Bain declined to comment on Takata.

BIG IN JAPAN

In a decade, Bain has invested in a wide range of companies in Japan, from hot spring chains, wind farms to a mushroom growing business. Bain invests in Japan out of its Asian funds and sometimes use dry powder from its global funds for larger transactions - such as the Toshiba deal.

One of its most lucrative deals in Japan was a $67 million investment in Domino’s Pizza Japan in 2010, which as of May this year generated an internal rate of return of 156 percent, according to data from Centre for Asia Private Equity Research.

Bain has been patient.

It started talking to the corporate level of Toshiba about seven years ago, while discussions around their semiconductor business started more than two years ago - long before the crisis that prompted the nuclear-to-laptops group to sell out.

It separately spent three years building the relationship with ADK, one of the only three advertising agencies in the country that has access to Japan’s dominating TV networks.

But it is not guaranteed success every time.

Both Toshiba and ADK deals are yet to be completed, and Bain’s buyout offer for ADK has been opposed by the agency’s largest sharehoders.

“As global funds like KKR and Bain are getting bigger, they can allocate more cash to Japan,” said Sam Takata, head of private equity investment at Tokio Marine Asset Management.

“That means the market will become more competitive and firms will have to try more difficult deals to build up their track record.”",Bain Capital leads the charge as Japan's private equity dealmaking picks up,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bain-japan/bain-capital-leads-the-charge-as-japans-private-equity-dealmaking-picks-up-idUSKBN1CH0KV

Big, grey and boxy, CNC machines use pre-programmed guides to produce intricate parts for everything from automobiles and mobile phones to furniture and clothes. They offer accuracy that human machine tool operators are unable to achieve.

In North Korea, thanks to a combination of homemade technology and reverse engineering, the machines now play a critical role in the weapons programs. They allow Kim Jong Un to build nuclear bombs and missiles without relying as heavily on outside technical aid or imports.

“North Korea’s centrifuges and new missiles all depend on components made with CNC machine tools,” said Jeffrey Lewis, head of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of Strategic Studies at Monterey, California.

“(They) are the essential underlying technology for producing missiles and nuclear weapons,” said Lewis.

Since 1996, CNC machines have been included in the Wassenaar Arrangement – an international arms control regime aimed at stopping the proliferation of equipment with both civilian and military uses. North Korea is not a signatory.

The country’s celebrations of its CNC technology have been fulsome. Hundreds of dancers in luminous orange and green performed the CNC pop song, titled “Break through the cutting edge,” at a Korean Workers’ Party celebration in 2010. In 2012, the year the South Korean hit “Gangnam Style” was released, the North’s CNC title was on karaoke machines nationwide, according to Choson Exchange, a Singapore-based company that trains North Koreans in business skills. The official video for the song opens with a long-range North Korean rocket soaring into a blue sky.

CUTTING EDGE

North Korea likely started to develop its own CNC machines in the early 1990s as part of a drive to build sophisticated missiles and nuclear weapons, nuclear experts say. It probably learned how to make them by taking apart machines it had imported from the Soviet Union.

Its first homemade CNC machine was introduced in 1995. Former leader Kim Jong Il gave the machine the “Ryonha” brand, according to a 2009 article in the country’s official newspaper, Rodong Sinmun. That was the first time state media mentioned the technology.

By 2009, the machines had become a mainstay of North Korean propaganda, as Pyongyang launched a nationwide campaign to boost domestic industry. Sanctions were mounting after its second nuclear test and a long-range missile launch that year.

At the time, arms control experts raised concerns about a visit by former leader Kim Jong Il to a North Korean factory where homemade CNC machines appeared to be producing aluminum tubes. These could be used for nuclear centrifuges.

“By around 2010, it seemed they were capable of manufacturing various types of CNC machines,” said Kim Heung-gwang, a North Korean defector who taught at Pyongyang’s Hamhung Computer Technology University before defecting to South Korea.

But it wasn’t until 2013 that the Korea Ryonha Machinery Joint Venture Corporation, which produced the machines, was blacklisted by the U.N. Security Council for supporting the weapons programs.

And it was only in August this year that U.S. intelligence officials told Reuters North Korea likely has the ability to produce its own missile engines themselves. (Full Story)

Now, Kim Heung-gwang estimates, North Korea has about 15,000 CNC machines. He bases this on North Korean state media reports and photos as well as interviews with more than a dozen defectors who were scientists, professors or factory workers.

MASS PRODUCTION

Pyongyang hailed the homemade machines as a triumph for its governing ideology of “Juche”, which champions self-sufficiency. But that wasn’t strictly true.

In August 2016, state media released photos of Kim Jong Un visiting a factory using CNC machines with the logo of Swiss engineering firm ABB ABB.UL, one of the leading players in the global CNC machine market. It’s not clear when or how the machine reached North Korea.

ABB said the firm respects all applicable trade sanctions against North Korea, and undertakes not to deliver ABB equipment to the country. “That said, we cannot rule out that some of our equipment may have been resold to DPR of Korea without our knowledge or permission,” the company said in response to a Reuters inquiry, using North Korea’s official title.

A United Nations panel monitoring sanctions on North Korea said in a report this year that Tengzhou Keyongda CNC Machine Tools Co of China had been a supplier of Pyongyang’s new CNC machines. A sales representative for Tengzhou Keyongda told Reuters the company stopped selling CNC machines to North Korea four years ago, and no longer maintains trade relations with the country.

Despite sanctions, CNC machines are commonplace across North Korean manufacturing and can be brought in through China and Russia, said Lee Choon-geun, a senior fellow at the Science and Technology Policy Institute in South Korea.

The biggest loophole has been that while some CNC machines are banned because they can have both military and civilian functions, most serve civilian industry. “Given their dual-use capability, you could even import the machines for other purposes, take them to pieces and use them however you want,” said Lee.

The CNC song highlights this in its opening line: “Whatever it is, once we put our mind to it, there’s a program to make it,” it says.",How a homemade tool helped North Korea's missile program,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-missiles-technology/how-a-homemade-tool-helped-north-koreas-missile-program-idUSKBN1CH1I4

Wien/Berlin (Reuters) - Österreich klagt vor dem Europäischen Gerichtshof (EuGH) gegen die deutsche Pkw-Maut, die etwa ab dem Jahr 2019 kassiert werden könnte.

“Die deutsche Maut ist eine reine Ausländermaut. Wir lassen das nicht durchgehen”, sagte Österreichs Verkehrsminister Jörg Leichtfried. Seine Regierung werde daher noch am Donnerstag eine 30 Seiten lange Klage beim EuGH in Luxemburg einbringen. Die Grünen in Deutschland, die vor Gesprächen über eine Regierungsbildung mit CDU, CSU und FDP stehen, machten Bundesverkehrsminister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) für die Klage verantwortlich. Die SPD forderte, die Einführung der Maut bis zur Entscheidung über die Klage zu stoppen.

Die Pkw-Maut hatte im Frühjahr die letzte parlamentarische Hürde in Deutschland genommen. Der Aufbau des System wird aber dauern, so dass Experten davon ausgehen, dass die Maut nicht vor 2019 kassiert werden kann. Die EU-Kommission stellte ihr Verfahren wegen einer möglichen Benachteiligung von Ausländern im Mai ein. Die Regierung in Wien und in anderen Nachbarländern Deutschlands befürchten einseitige Belastungen durch die Pkw-Maut. Sie halten es für unfair, dass alle die Infrastrukturabgabe zahlen müssen, Fahrzeughalter in Deutschland aber über die Kraftfahrzeugsteuer entlastet werden.

Leichtfried warf der EU-Kommission vor, sie habe die Augen bei der deutschen Pkw-Maut “fest zugedrückt”. Durch die Klage werde die Angelegenheit nun “eine Nagelprobe für das europäische Rechtsverständnis”.

Grünen-Fraktionschef Anton Hofreiter sagte der “Passauer Neuen Presse”, Dobrindt habe sich “fast ausschließlich mit der europarechtswidrigen und wirkungslosen Pkw-Maut beschäftigt”.

“Last night’s World Cup qualifying results do not change FOX Sports’ passion for the world’s biggest sporting event,” the company said in a statement.
“We think the absence of the men’s team from the 2018 World Cup is negative, but only marginally so, and in line with reported estimates,” he said.
“Arguably the challenging time zone (with the 2018 tournament hosted in Russia) will prove to cause a more significant factor depressing viewing when comparing 2018 vs. 2014,” Wieser added.
“They didn’t buy into the U.S. winning the World Cup.”","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The failure of the United States men’s team to qualify for next year’s World Cup will not impact on Fox Sports’s plans to televise the tournament, a right for which it paid $200 million, the network said on Wednesday.

Fox Sports won the English-language rights to air the 2018 and 2022 World Cups in the U.S. from ESPN as part of a $400 million deal struck in 2011 when few would have predicted that the American team would fail to qualify for the 2018 tournament in Russia.

“Last night’s World Cup qualifying results do not change FOX Sports’ passion for the world’s biggest sporting event,” the company said in a statement.

“While the U.S. was eliminated, the biggest stars in the world from Lionel Messi to Cristiano Ronaldo stamped their tickets to Russia on the same day, and will battle teams ranging from Mexico to England that have massive fan bases in America.”

U.S. dreams were dashed on Tuesday when they lost 2-1 to Trinidad and Tobago to finish fifth in the six-team North, Central American and Caribbean (CONCACAF) qualifying group.

“FOX Sports remains steadfast in our commitment of bringing the games to America for the first time in 2018 and will continue to support the U.S. Soccer Federation as they look ahead to the 2022 World Cup,” the network said.

Sports marketing experts on Wednesday said that although not qualifying is undoubtedly a setback for U.S. soccer, it does not spell disaster for Fox.

Reports indicating a $10-20 million negative impact for Fox from the U.S. team’s failure to qualify seem correct and represent a negligible amount for the network, said Brian Wieser, an analyst with equity research company Pivotal.

“We think the absence of the men’s team from the 2018 World Cup is negative, but only marginally so, and in line with reported estimates,” he said.

“Arguably the challenging time zone (with the 2018 tournament hosted in Russia) will prove to cause a more significant factor depressing viewing when comparing 2018 vs. 2014,” Wieser added.

Joe Favorito, a sports marketing consultant, said any company investing in soccer is investing in a global brand.

“When you walk down the streets of Manhattan today, you see kids wearing Messi jerseys and Ranoldo jerseys much more than you see them wearing American jerseys,” he said.

“So people saying this is disastrous to Fox are being premature.”

The real financial harm will come in the form of “collateral damage” to players like 19-year-old American Christian Pulisic, who could have used the World Cup platform to boost his personal brand.

The team’s absence will also hurt U.S. stadiums that would have hosted lead-up matches and grassroots soccer investment dollars that would have come from FIFA.

“That’s the damage of this, not so much for the brands that would have bought into Fox,” Favorito said.

“At the end of the day, it’s going to be an amazing global event and that’s what Fox bought into,” he added.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices rose in September as the price of gasoline recorded its biggest increase in more than two years amid hurricane-related production disruptions at oil refineries in Texas.

Other data on Thursday showed applications for unemployment benefits dropped to a more than one-month low last week as the boost to claims in Texas and Florida from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma continued to unwind.

While the storms impacted the data, there were signs of underlying strength in both wholesale inflation and the labor market, potentially leaving the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates again in December.

The Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand increased 0.4 percent last month after rising 0.2 percent in August. Wholesale prices were also lifted by an increase in the cost of services. In the 12 months through September, the PPI jumped 2.6 percent. That was the biggest gain since February 2012 and followed a 2.4 percent jump in August.

Wholesale gasoline prices soared 10.9 percent in September after increasing 9.5 percent in August. The increase was the largest since May 2015 and accounted for two-thirds of the 0.7 percent rise in the price of goods. The Labor Department said higher energy prices were likely the result of “reduced refining capacity in the Gulf Coast area due to Hurricane Harvey.”

It said Harvey and Irma, which devastated Florida, had “virtually” no impact on the collection of PPI data or survey response rates. Harvey and Irma, which struck in late August and early September, caused the economy to shed jobs last month for the first time in seven years.

The storms have also restrained consumer spending and undercut industrial production, homebuilding and home sales.

Last month’s gasoline-driven surge in the PPI, however, is likely to be temporary amid ample crude oil supplies.

The U.S. dollar .DXY was little changed against a basket of currencies after the data. Prices of U.S. Treasuries pared gains while U.S. stock index futures were trading lower.

CORE INFLATION FIRMING

A key gauge of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services rose 0.2 percent last month after a similar increase in August. The so-called core PPI increased 2.1 percent in the 12 months through September after climbing 1.9 percent in August.

Inflation has remained relatively low, with the main measure tracked by the Fed retreating further below its 2 percent target in August.

Price pressures remain benign despite the labor market nearing full employment, with the jobless rate at more than a 16-1/2-year low of 4.2 percent. Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said that temporary factors such as one-off price cuts by wireless telephone companies are holding back inflation.

Minutes of the Fed’s Sept. 19-20 meeting published on Wednesday showed a vigorous debate among policymakers over inflation, with “several” expressing concern that “the persistence of low rates of inflation might imply that the underlying trend was running below 2 percent.”

Despite tepid inflation, U.S. financial markets have largely priced in a rate increase for December. The Fed has increased borrowing costs twice this year.

Last month, the cost of services increased 0.4 percent, driven by a rise in margins for final demand trade services, a measurement of changes in margins received by wholesalers and retailers. Services edged up 0.1 percent in August.

The cost of healthcare services was unchanged after advancing 0.3 percent in August. Those costs feed into the Fed’s preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy.

In a second report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased 15,000 to a seasonally adjusted 243,000 for the week ended Oct. 7, the lowest level since late August.

Claims have been declining since surging to an almost three-year high of 298,000 at the start of September as workers displaced by the hurricanes were left temporarily unemployed.

Underscoring the labor market’s underlying strength, claims have now been below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a robust labor market, for 136 straight weeks. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller.

The claims report also showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 32,000 to 1.89 million in the week ended Sept. 30, the lowest level since December 1973.",U.S. producer prices increase; weekly jobless claims fall,https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-economy/u-s-producer-prices-increase-weekly-jobless-claims-fall-idINKBN1CH1WG

ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan accused the United States on Thursday of mistreating a strategic ally, in a blistering speech which appeared to rule out swift resolution to a dispute between two NATO members jointly fighting Islamic State.

Hours after Ankara announced officials would meet soon to settle differences, Erdogan accused the U.S. consulate in Istanbul of hiding an individual with links to a network he blames for last year’s failed coup.

He also condemned U.S. support for Kurdish fighters in Syria and separate U.S. court cases against a senior Turkish banker and the president’s own security guards, mocking what he said was Washington’s claim to be “the capital of democracy”.

Turkey’s relations with the United States and many Western countries have been strained since last year’s failed military coup against Erdogan, in which more than 240 people were killed.

Turkey felt many allies were slow to condemn the coup attempt and failed to appreciate the danger it faced. Western countries have grown alarmed at the scale of Turkey’s post-coup crackdown, with 50,000 people detained and 150,000 suspended from work.

Ties with the United States hit a low when Turkey detained a locally employed worker at the U.S. consulate in Istanbul last week.

The United States says it is still seeking an explanation for the arrest - the second detention of a consulate worker this year. It suspended most visa services in Turkey, saying it needed to review Turkey’s commitment to the security of its mission and staff. Turkey reciprocated within hours.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson spoke with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu on Wednesday and expressed his “profound concern”, the U.S. State Department said.

Erdogan has blamed outgoing U.S. ambassador John Bass, saying he was putting at risk a decades-old alliance.

“Let me be very clear, the person who caused this is the ambassador here. It is unacceptable for the United States to sacrifice a strategic partner to an ambassador who doesn’t know his place,” Erdogan told provincial governors meeting in Ankara.

TURKISH GRIEVANCES

Earlier, Deputy Prime Minister Bekir Bozdag said Turkish and U.S. officials would meet to work on resolving the crisis and described talks between their foreign ministers as constructive.

But Erdogan aired a list of grievances, accusing Washington of sheltering suspected members of the outlawed Kurdish Workers Party (PKK), and supporters of Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen he blames for last year’s coup attempt. Gulen denies involvement.

“On the one hand you say you are the capital of democracy, but you hide PKK and FETO members,” Erdogan said, using the label his government has given to Gulen’s network.

He said Washington was defending a “FETO-linked person hiding in your consulate”, and said a Christian pastor arrested in western Turkey last year was also “clearly linked” to Gulen.

Ambassador Bass said this week no one was hiding in the U.S. consulate, and that he had seen nothing of merit in the charges against the pastor, Andrew Brunson.

Erdogan said U.S. authorities had wrongly arrested the former head of Turkey’s majority state-owned Halkbank, and were trying to use a detained Turkish gold trader “as an informant”. Both men were arrested on charges of sanctions violations.

Referring to a U.S. grand jury indictment of 15 Turkish security officials who clashed with protesters during his visit to Washington in May, Erdogan said most of them had never set foot on U.S. soil. “You issue arrest warrants for 13 of my security staff who have never seen the United States,” he said.

“If the ambassador in Ankara is leading the grand United States, then shame on you,” Erdogan said. “Someone should have said: ‘You cannot treat your strategic partner this way, you can’t behave like this’.”",Erdogan says U.S. sacrificing strategic ally Turkey,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-turkey-security/erdogan-says-u-s-sacrificing-strategic-ally-turkey-idUKKBN1CH0UI?il=0

FRANKFURT/BERLIN (Reuters) - Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) reinforced its position as Germany’s largest airline on Thursday by signing a 210 million euro ($249 million)deal to buy large parts of insolvent Air Berlin (AB1.DE).

Lufthansa plans to use the Air Berlin assets to quickly expand its Eurowings budget business. News of the deal pushed Lufthansa shares up more than 3 percent to their highest level in nearly 17 years.

Air Berlin, which has struggled to turn a profit over the last decade, filed for insolvency on Aug. 15, and a government loan has kept its planes aloft while its administrator negotiated with prospective buyers for parts of the business.

Lufthansa has agreed to acquire Air Berlin’s Austrian leisure travel airline Niki, its LG Walter regional airline and 20 additional aircraft, Air Berlin said in a statement.

“This contract provides new opportunities for jobs for a large part of our workforce. But we can only really breathe again when the EU Commission approves the deal,” Air Berlin Chief Executive Thomas Winkelmann said.

Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr said earlier he expected the European Union to approve the transaction by the end of 2017.

Talks to sell some of Air Berlin’s remaining assets to Britain’s easyJet (EZJ.L) and other bidders are continuing, Air Berlin said, without providing details.

EasyJet, which has a base at Berlin’s Schoenefeld airport, has been discussing acquiring 27 to 30 planes. Air Berlin previously said others, such as Thomas Cook’s (TCG.L) Condor, could pick up some parts of the business.

EasyJet declined to comment on the progress of talks on Thursday.

BIG INVESTMENTS

Lufthansa CEO Spohr told a German paper earlier that his airline would be investing around 1.5 billion euros in total as a result of the Air Berlin deal.

That sum includes investment in new planes, for which the board freed up 1 billion euros of funds last month, the purchase price and the costs of taking on new staff.

Air Berlin, Germany’s second largest carrier, will cease operating flights this month, capping a turbulent summer for European carriers.

Italy’s national airline Alitalia [CAITLA.UL] is in administration and seeking investors too, British leisure airline Monarch collapsed at the start of this month.

Lufthansa’s Spohr said on Thursday while he was not interested in the Italian carrier in its current shape he would be interested in talks to create a new Alitalia.

Shares in Lufthansa were up 3.3 percent at 25.38 euros, the top gainer in Germany’s DAX market index <0#.GDAXI> by 1340 GMT.

Analysts at Bernstein Research raised their rating on Lufthansa’s shares to “outperform” from “market-perform”, saying they expected a deal with Air Berlin to add around 70 to 90 million euros to annual operating profits at Lufthansa’s budget unit Eurowings in the medium term.

(Reuters) - NFL Players Association Executive Director DeMaurice Smith will attend meetings next week where team owners will discuss the issue of player protests during the U.S. national anthem, the two sides said on Wednesday.

NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell invited Smith to the Oct. 17-18 meetings in New York, where the issue of some players kneeling in protest when the anthem is played before each game is expected to command much attention.

”There has been no change in the current policy regarding the anthem,“ the two sides said in a statement. ”The agenda will be a continuation of how to make progress on the important social issues that players have vocalized.

“Everyone who is part of our NFL community has a tremendous respect for our country, our flag, our anthem and our military, and we are coming together to deal with these issues in a civil and constructive way.”

The protests, in a league where African-Americans make up the majority of players, have continued through the season, with some players kneeling and others standing arm-in-arm in solidarity.

The gesture is intended to call attention to what protesting players see as a pattern of racism in the treatment of African-Americans by U.S. police.

WARSAW (Reuters) - South Korea’s LG Chem will open Europe’s largest lithium-ion battery factory in Poland next year as the region’s auto industry gears up to mass produce electric cars.

Tumbling battery prices and growing pressure to cut exhaust emissions have led carmakers to embrace electric vehicles. Manufacturers from VW Group (VOWG_p.DE) to Volvo Cars, Daimler and BMW plan to roll out a raft of new electric models in coming years.

But Europe lacks big-scale battery cell production facilities so those components are mostly imported from China and South Korea.

Calls are now growing for the region to develop its own battery industry to preserve jobs and profits, though Asian producers have a huge head start in development and scale.

LG Chem plans to spend 5.9 billion zlotys ($1.63 billion) on the factory near the southwestern city of Wroclaw, according to Polish state industry agency ARP.

Wroclaw is 190 kilometers (118 miles) from the border with Germany, home of VW Group which plans to invest more than 20 billion euros ($24 billion) in zero-emission vehicles by 2030 and make 3 million electric vehicles (EVs) a year by 2025.

LG Chem expects to produce up to 100,000 EV batteries in Poland annually from next year, it said on Thursday in a statement.

The factory will employ 2,500 people. LG Chem, a subsidiary of Korea’s LG Corp, did not name the likely customers but said they would include top car companies.

“The company has chosen Poland as the most competitive location for production to satisfy the needs of European and global car producers,” said Chang-Beom Kang, vice president at LG Chem.

It was not immediately clear if the factory would produce all the basic battery cells from scratch or import some components, but the statement said the site would include a research and development center employing “about 400 engineers from various specializations: automation, electronics, chemistry and IT”.

Asked about the source of lithium and other raw materials, a representative of LG Chem’s local arm said they would first be imported from the parent company in Korea and then hopefully from Polish suppliers.

DEMAND SURGE

The factory’s planned capacity is just a fraction of expected future demand.

Based on the typical capacity of a mid-market compact car like Nissan Leaf, 100,000 car batteries are equivalent to 4 GWh per year. This means the factory’s capacity could be slightly more than 10 percent of the production capacity that Tesla’s U.S. based “Gigafactory” is to reach in 2018.

Battery costs have been prohibitive but are falling rapidly. Average battery costs have come down from over $1,000 per kilowatt hour in 2010, to around $227 in 2016, according to analysts at Barclays.

In 2016, only 0.2 percent of new passenger cars sold in Europe were fully electric.

But Britain and France say they will ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2040 in an attempt to reduce air pollution, ending use of the fossil fuel-guzzling internal combustion engine.

LG’s Polish plant may not remain Europe’s largest car battery plant for long.

In September, Swiss engineering group ABB said it had joined a project to build Europe’s largest lithium-ion battery factory in Sweden targeting annual cell production equivalent to 32 gigawatt-hours by 2023, over 90 percent of Tesla’s Gigafactory target.

That project, named Northvolt, is led by a former manager at Tesla, which also plans to build a Gigafactory in Europe, though it has not said where.",LG to open Europe's biggest car battery factory next year,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lgchem-factory-poland/lg-to-open-europes-biggest-car-battery-factory-next-year-idUKKBN1CH21W?il=0

That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ annual ranking of the World’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science, invent new technologies and power new markets and industries.

REUTERS TOP 100

The most innovative university in the world, for the third consecutive year, is Stanford University. Located in the heart of California's Silicon Valley, Stanford has long played a key role in the development of our modern networked world: A Stanford professor designed the basic communication standard for the Internet, and university alumni founded some of the biggest tech companies in the world, including Google, Intel, Hewlett-Packard and Netflix. Today the university continues to consistently produce original research and technology. Innovations that originate at Stanford are frequently cited by researchers elsewhere in academia and in private industry. Those are key criteria in the ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of numerous indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

MORE FROM REUTERS TOP 100 Compare Institutions | Methodology

Overall, the top ranks of The World's Most Innovative Universities remain largely unchanged, with nine of last year’s 10 highest-ranked universities remaining in the top 10. And the most elite institutions are almost all large, well-established universities based in the United States and Western Europe. Rounding out the top three are MIT and Harvard, which have held onto their respective 2nd and 3rd place rankings for the past three years. In fourth place is the University of Pennsylvania, which climbed four spots from #8 last year. The highest ranked university outside the U.S., Belgium’s KU Leuven (#5), is a nearly 600-year-old institution that maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet.

In contrast, there are only two Asian universities in the top 20, both of which are based in South Korea, and one of them actually teaches the majority of its classes in English: South Korea’s KAIST, formerly the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, ranked #6. Established in 1971 by the Korean government, KAIST was modeled after engineering schools in the United States, and initially funded with a multimillion-dollar loan from the United States Agency for International Development.

Overall, the top 100 consists of 51 universities based in North America, 26 in Europe, 20 in Asia and 3 in the Middle East. Why does Asia underperform? One reason is because Japanese universities – traditionally the research powerhouses of the region – depend heavily on government R&D spending, and the nation has been undergoing deflation and economic stagnation for more than 20 years. That means less money for research and fewer innovations.

According to data from Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science, which tracks articles published in scientific journals, Japanese researchers accounted for 8.4% of all papers published in 2005, but only 5.2% in 2015. Key research areas such as computer science showed even larger decreases, with the number of published papers falling by more than 37%. As a result, the Reuters ranking shows significant declines in rank for leading Japanese universities, including the University of Tokyo (down five spots to #21), Osaka University (down 13 to #24), and Keio University (down 25 to #78). Japan had nine universities on the list in 2016, but only has eight this year; six of those eight universities saw their rank fall from 2016, and one was unchanged. Only Kyushu University saw its ranking improve, moving from #79 to #68.

Of course, while Japan struggles, other Asian nations are growing fast. China has gone from one university on the list in 2015 to two in 2016, and now three in 2017. The two Chinese universities returning to the list this year both made significant gains (Tsinghua University climbed 15 spots to #51, and Peking University climbed 10 spots to #60); the third, Zhejiang University, appears on the list for the first time at #100. But given China’s massive population and economy, just three universities out of 100 still represents significant underperformance.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations – including educational institutions, nonprofit charities and government-funded labs – that publish the most academic research. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries), and ranked them based on their performance.

Slideshow (8 Images)

Careful observers might note a few differences between how non-U.S. institutions rank on Reuters’ regional innovation lists, Asia’s Most Innovative Universities and Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and how they rank on the global innovators list. An institution’s relative ranking may change from list to list, since each ranking is dependent on summarizing 10 indicators and comparing that with others in a specific population; when that population changes, individual rankings might change as well. Furthermore, the global list is restricted to institutions that filed 70 or more patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization during the five-year period examined by Thomson Reuters. The cutoff for regional lists is just 50 patents, allowing a more in-depth view of the most active institutions within a limited geographic area.

Due to changes in the methodology of this year’s list, three university systems that were ranked in the top 100 last year (University of London, State University System of Florida and University of Arizona and Board of Regents) were broken up so that each of their member institutions were ranked individually: As a result, four of those constituent universities – the University of Florida (#66), University College London (#67), Florida State University (#76) and Arizona State University (#85) – made the top 100 for the first time.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university – or whether it appears on the list at all – does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s best theoretical physics departments, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the planet. All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian new home prices rose less than expected in August as prices were unchanged in a number of markets, including the cities of Toronto and Vancouver, which have been the country’s hottest regions, Statistics Canada said on Thursday.

The 0.1 percent increase in national prices from the previous month was shy of forecasts for a gain of 0.3 percent. The index excludes apartments and condominiums.

Prices were unchanged in 15 of the 27 markets surveyed, including Toronto, where prices were flat for the third month in a row.

Home sales and prices in Canada’s largest city have cooled from their April peak since the Ontario government imposed a number of measures to rein in the hot market, including a foreign buyers tax.

Prices were also unchanged in Vancouver after five consecutive months of increases, the statistics agency said. Vancouver has had its own foreign buyers tax since last August, which initially dampened activity, though prices have been heading higher again.

“There’s obviously less home grown talent but the atmosphere will be brilliant and it is a game which you dare not lose as a player.”

Particular focus will be on United’s 75 million pounds ($98 million) Belgian striker Romelu Lukaku, who has been in prolific form, scoring in 12 of his last 13 games for club and country.

The powerful forward joined United from Everton during the close-season and has been an instant success - but there are still some who question whether he can be just as effective against better opponents.

While Lukaku - and United - will want to prove that they are the real deal, Liverpool badly need to kick-start their campaign after a shaky beginning.

Juergen Klopp’s side have taken just five points from their last four games, leaving them seven points behind the Manchester clubs.

The exciting attacking talent in the team, despite the loss to injury of Sadio Mane who is out for six weeks with a hamstring injury, should test the United defence that has had a relatively comfortable campaign so far.

Former Liverpool striker and manager Kenny Dalglish expects Mourinho to protect his defence with a cautious approach, similar to how they played in last season’s 1-1 draw on Merseyside.

“Last year, when United came to Liverpool, Jose Mourinho parked the bus. But it wasn’t just the one bus, I think it was a couple of double deckers he put there,” said Dalglish.

”I think United will come and set up quite defensively...

”I think Jose will try to make sure the pressure is on Liverpool, but the pressure is on everyone when it comes to a game like that.”

ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan accused the United States on Thursday of mistreating a strategic ally, in a blistering speech which appeared to rule out swift resolution to a dispute between two NATO members jointly fighting Islamic State.

Hours after Ankara announced officials would meet soon to settle differences, Erdogan accused the U.S. consulate in Istanbul of hiding an individual with links to a network he blames for last year’s failed coup.

He also condemned U.S. support for Kurdish fighters in Syria and separate U.S. court cases against a senior Turkish banker and the president’s own security guards, mocking what he said was Washington’s claim to be “the capital of democracy”.

Turkey’s relations with the United States and many Western countries have been strained since last year’s failed military coup against Erdogan, in which more than 240 people were killed.

Turkey felt many allies were slow to condemn the coup attempt and failed to appreciate the danger it faced. Western countries have grown alarmed at the scale of Turkey’s post-coup crackdown, with 50,000 people detained and 150,000 suspended from work.

Ties with the United States hit a low when Turkey detained a locally employed worker at the U.S. consulate in Istanbul last week.

The United States says it is still seeking an explanation for the arrest - the second detention of a consulate worker this year. It suspended most visa services in Turkey, saying it needed to review Turkey’s commitment to the security of its mission and staff. Turkey reciprocated within hours.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson spoke with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu on Wednesday and expressed his “profound concern”, the U.S. State Department said.

Erdogan has blamed outgoing U.S. ambassador John Bass, saying he was putting at risk a decades-old alliance.

“Let me be very clear, the person who caused this is the ambassador here. It is unacceptable for the United States to sacrifice a strategic partner to an ambassador who doesn’t know his place,” Erdogan told provincial governors meeting in Ankara.

TURKISH GRIEVANCES

Earlier, Deputy Prime Minister Bekir Bozdag said Turkish and U.S. officials would meet to work on resolving the crisis and described talks between their foreign ministers as constructive.

But Erdogan aired a list of grievances, accusing Washington of sheltering suspected members of the outlawed Kurdish Workers Party (PKK), and supporters of Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen he blames for last year’s coup attempt. Gulen denies involvement.

“On the one hand you say you are the capital of democracy, but you hide PKK and FETO members,” Erdogan said, using the label his government has given to Gulen’s network.

He said Washington was defending a “FETO-linked person hiding in your consulate”, and said a Christian pastor arrested in western Turkey last year was also “clearly linked” to Gulen.

Ambassador Bass said this week no one was hiding in the U.S. consulate, and that he had seen nothing of merit in the charges against the pastor, Andrew Brunson.

Erdogan said U.S. authorities had wrongly arrested the former head of Turkey’s majority state-owned Halkbank, and were trying to use a detained Turkish gold trader “as an informant”. Both men were arrested on charges of sanctions violations.

Referring to a U.S. grand jury indictment of 15 Turkish security officials who clashed with protesters during his visit to Washington in May, Erdogan said most of them had never set foot on U.S. soil. “You issue arrest warrants for 13 of my security staff who have never seen the United States,” he said.

“If the ambassador in Ankara is leading the grand United States, then shame on you,” Erdogan said. “Someone should have said: ‘You cannot treat your strategic partner this way, you can’t behave like this’.”",Erdogan says U.S. sacrificing strategic ally Turkey,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-turkey-security/erdogan-says-u-s-sacrificing-strategic-ally-turkey-idUSKBN1CH0TU

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump finds himself under immense pressure as he considers de-certifying the international nuclear deal with Iran, a move that would ignore warnings from inside and outside his administration that to do so would risk undermining U.S. credibility.

Trump is expected to unveil a broad strategy on confronting Iran this week, likely on Friday. There was always the chance he could still have a last-minute change of heart and certify Iran’s compliance with the 2015 accord, which he has called an “embarrassment” and the “worst deal ever negotiated.”

Senior U.S. officials, European allies and prominent U.S. lawmakers have told Trump that refusing to certify the deal would leave the U.S. isolated, concede the diplomatic high ground to Tehran, and ultimately risk the unraveling of the agreement.

Signed by the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China, the European Union and Iran, the deal relieved sanctions on Tehran in exchange for curbing its disputed nuclear program.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) concluded that Iran secretly researched a nuclear warhead until 2009, which Tehran denies. Iran has always insisted that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes and denies it has aimed to build an atomic bomb.

After Trump made clear three months ago he would not certify Iran’s compliance with the deal, his advisers moved to give him options to consider, a senior administration official said.

“They came up with a plan that protects the things they are concerned about but doesn’t recertify, which the president made clear he was not going to do. That ship has sailed,” according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

The official said Trump has been telling foreign leaders and U.S. lawmakers that his refusal to certify the Iran deal would not blow it up.

“He’s not walking away from it. The chances of him walking away from it go down if they work with him on making it better,” the official said.

White House officials said Trump is expected to announce a broad, more confrontational policy toward Iran directed at curbing its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and financial and military support for Hezbollah and other extremist groups.

Trump has said he believes the nuclear deal is too generous toward Iran and would not stop it from trying to develop a nuclear weapon.

He has criticized the agreement’s “sunset clauses,” under which some restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program would expire over time. He also wants to toughen language on ballistic missiles and inspections. The International Atomic Energy Agency says Iran is complying with the agreement.

NO RENEGOTIATION

European officials have categorically ruled out renegotiating the deal, but have said they share Trump’s concerns over Iran’s destabilizing influence in the Middle East.

Several diplomats have said Europe would be ready to discuss sanctioning Iran’s ballistic missile tests and forming a strategy to curb Iran’s influence in the region.

Officials have also said there could be room to open a new negotiation for what happens once some of the core terms of the deal begin expiring in 2025, although there is no reason to believe Iran would be ready to enter in such a negotiation. Iran has said it may exit the deal if the U.S. withdraws.

De-certifying would not withdraw the United States from the deal but it would give the U.S. Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose the sanctions on Tehran that were suspended under the agreement.

One U.S. official involved in administration said that declining to certify Iran’s compliance would probably leave all of the parties to the deal on one side and the United States on the other.

“That means that while the French and others are also interested in curbing Iran’s destabilizing activities, they may be less likely to follow (the U.S.) lead at the risk of the agreement blowing up,” the official said.

British Prime Minister Theresa May and French President Emmanuel Macron both spoke to Trump this week to express their concerns about the potential decision not to recertify the Iran deal.

“If the feeling is that the United States no longer supports the agreement, then the political reality is that the agreement will be in serious jeopardy and its implementation will be very difficult,” a senior French diplomat said.

Two other U.S. officials, who also requested anonymity, said Trump’s bellicose rhetoric on a number of fronts is troubling both many of his own aides and some of America’s closest allies, a few of whom have asked U.S. officials privately if Trump’s real objective is attacking Iran’s nuclear facilities.

One of the officials said that like the heated rhetoric with North Korea on its nuclear program, the Iran discussion has vexed White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson “who have tried to advise the President that there are significant risks in the course he’d prefer to pursue.”

“At the end of the day, though, everyone recognizes that he’s the decider.”

Trump allies who oppose the deal have watched the president closely to see if he might buckle under pressure.

“He’s not going to re-certify,” said Sebastian Gorka, a former Trump national security aide. “I‘m not worried. His gut instinct is absolutely right.”",Trump resists pressure to soften stance on Iran nuclear deal,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-trump/trump-resists-pressure-to-soften-stance-on-iran-nuclear-deal-idUSKBN1CH01D

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Bharti Airtel Ltd is acquiring the Tata conglomerate’s consumer mobile business virtually free of charge in a deal that gives India’s top wireless player a major subscriber base boost, while stemming the bleed for Tata from a money-losing venture.

Bharti Airtel will gain over 40 million customers from Tata Teleservices and a subsidiary along with airwaves the companies own on a “debt-free (and) cash-free” basis, according to a joint statement on Thursday, although Bharti Airtel will take on a “small portion” of Tata’s unpaid dues for its airwaves.

India’s telecoms market, with 1.2 billion mobile subscribers, is in the midst of a wave of consolidation as smaller debt-laden players seek exits after overspending in airwave auctions.

Small players and their larger rivals have also been severely weakened by a price war triggered by new entrant Reliance Jio - backed by India’s richest man Mukesh Ambani.

The price war has led to major losses for most carriers, and spurred India’s banking regulator - the Reserve Bank of India -to ask banks to review their telecoms sector exposure and boost their provisioning for any loans made to the sector.

Tata Teleservices, which has more than $5 billion of debt, has been mired in losses and it had been speculated that the group may opt to permanently shutter the operation.

Its parent, salt-to-software conglomerate Tata Group, is also in the middle of a restructuring exercise to improve profitability and cut its complex structure under its new chairman N. Chandrasekaran.

“It’s a very big positive for Tata Group and Chandra ... It’s also a big positive for Airtel as they will have to pay less for the spectrum they are gaining,” said Sanjiv Bhasin, an executive vice president at financial services firm IIFL.

“It’s evident disruption is picking up and consolidation is the game of the hour,” he said, adding that he expects even more deals in the crowded sector.

Vodafone Group and Idea Cellular - the market’s second and third biggest players, respectively, are in the process of combining their operations to create the market’s biggest player, while Bharti Airtel had previously agreed to buy Telenor’s India unit.

A deal to combine debt-laden Reliance Communications’ wireless unit with rival Aircel fell apart this month.

MULTIPLE OPTIONS

Tata chief Chandrasekaran said in the statement the group had evaluated “multiple options” for the telecoms business, calling the Bharti Airtel deal the “most optimal solution”.

Tata and Bharti Airtel will work together to further explore other mutual areas of cooperation, the companies said.

Tata is also in the initial stages of exploring a combination of its enterprise business with Tata Communications Ltd and its retail fixed-line and broadband business with satellite TV arm Tata Sky, according to the statement.

Tata will retain its stake in tower company Viom, and will take care of the liabilities associated with it, according to the statement.

As of end-March, Tata Teleservices and its unit had combined debt of 340.89 billion Indian rupees ($5.24 billion) excluding sums due to the government for spectrum purchases, according to local ratings agency Crisil, which also said Tata Teleservices’ net loss nearly doubled in the year to March, to 46.17 billion rupees.

“Tata were losing money head over heels,” said Satish Betadpur, director of research at brokerage William O‘Neil Companies. “They were not profitable and to make it profitable, they had to spend enormous amount of money.”

In February, Tata agreed to pay NTT DoCoMo $1.18 billion to buy out the Japanese firm’s stake in the telecoms joint venture, settling a long-standing dispute.

Goldman Sachs advised Tata on the Bharti Airtel deal. Bharti Airtel, led by billionaire Sunil Mittal, has operations in 17 countries across Asia and Africa.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to block a Chinese-backed firm from buying a U.S.-based chipmaker this week is detrimental to America’s growth and the global economy, China’s state news agency Xinhua said in a commentary on Saturday.

Canyon Bridge Capital Partners’ planned $1.3 billion acquisition of Lattice Semiconductor Corp was one of the largest attempted by a Chinese-backed firm in the U.S. microchip sector and was the first announced deal for the buyout fund, which launched last year with a focus on technology investment.

U.S. regulatory scrutiny grew after Reuters reported in November that Canyon Bridge was funded partly by capital from China’s central government and had indirect links to its space program.

Trump said in an executive order on Wednesday that Lattice and Canyon Bridge “shall take all steps necessary to fully and permanently abandon the proposed transaction” within 30 days.

“The move, which is detrimental to both America’s growth and global economic recovery, also runs counter to the mutually-beneficial and win-win nature of China-U.S. relations,” the Xinhua commentary said.

Security reviews of investments in sensitive sectors “should not be used as a tool to implement protectionism”, it added, echoing comments by a Commerce Ministry spokesman last week.

Citing analysts who said Trump’s decision was made with an eye to the 2018 midterm election, Xinhua called it “penny wise and pound foolish ... It is a short-sighted move to take protectionist measures amid sluggish global growth.”

“Chinese investment is not ‘Trojan Horse’ with hidden purposes,” it said.

Trump is set to visit China in November.

“The two countries need to strengthen dialogue and communication, promote cooperation and exchanges in various fields and properly handle issues of common concerns. Only then can China and the United States push forward the world’s most important bilateral relationship,” Xinhua said.",Trump move to block chipmaker deal bad for America - Xinhua,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-usa-trade-commentary/trump-move-to-block-chipmaker-deal-bad-for-america-xinhua-idUSKCN1BR062

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain published proposals on Wednesday for a levy on social media firms and internet providers to help fund its online safety strategy, designed to tackle bullying, abuse and other risks for children and vulnerable users.

Prime Minister Theresa May and her ministers have been critical of firms like Twitter, Facebook, and Google, repeatedly calling on them to do more to stop the spread of extremist content online and help victims of abuse.

May first promised a levy on “social media companies and communication service providers” in her 2017 election manifesto.

On Wednesday, digital minister Karen Bradley published proposals for an Internet Safety Strategy including the levy, a code of practice on removing intimidating or humiliating content from social media, and online safety classes in schools.

“The internet has been an amazing force for good, but it has caused undeniable suffering and can be an especially harmful place for children and vulnerable people,” Bradley said in a statement.

“We need an approach to the internet that protects everyone without restricting growth and innovation in the digital economy.”

The government proposal, which invites views from the industry before being formulated into legislation, said the levy would initially be sought on a voluntary basis.

“We may then seek to underpin this levy in legislation, to ensure the continued and reliable operation of the levy,” the document said. “The levy will not be a new tax on social media.”

It likened the proposed levy to an existing one paid on a voluntary basis by the gambling sector to fund charitable work.

Social media firms have typically been exempt from regulatory fees that can apply to communication services.

YANGON (Reuters) - Rohingya Muslims are not native to Myanmar, the army chief told the U.S. ambassador in a meeting in which he apparently did not address accusations of abuses by his men and said media was complicit in exaggerating the number of refugees fleeing.

The U.N. human rights office said on Wednesday Myanmar forces had brutally driven out half a million Rohingya from northern Rakhine state to Bangladesh in recent weeks, torching homes, crops and villages to prevent them from returning.

Thousands of Rohingya were leaving the state on Thursday, aiming to reach Bangladesh by boat, citing a shortage of food and fear of repression, residents said. A Myanmar official said people were leaving but he dismissed the suggestion hunger and intimidation were factors.

The army chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, gave his most extensive account of the Rohingya refugee crisis aimed at an international audience in the meeting with Ambassador Scot Marciel, according to a report posted on his Facebook page.

The general is the most powerful person in Buddhist-majority Myanmar and his apparently uncompromising stance would indicate little sensitivity about the military’s image over a crisis that has drawn international condemnation and raised questions about a transition to democracy under Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.

The military campaign is popular in Myanmar, where there is little sympathy for the mostly stateless Rohingya, and where Buddhist nationalism has surged.

Min Aung Hlaing, referring to Rohingya by the term “Bengali”, which they regard as derogatory, said British colonialists were responsible for the problem.

“The Bengalis were not taken into the country by Myanmar, but by the colonialists,” he told Marciel, according to the account of the meeting posted on Thursday.

“They are not the natives.”

Coordinated Rohingya insurgent attacks on some 30 security posts on Aug. 25 sparked a ferocious military response.

The U.N. rights office said in its report, based on 65 interviews with Rohingya who had arrived in Bangladesh, that abuses had begun before the Aug. 25 attacks and included killings, torture and rape of children.

U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley last month denounced a “brutal, sustained campaign to cleanse the country of an ethnic minority” and called on countries to suspend providing weapons to Myanmar until its military put sufficient accountability measures in place.

The European Union and the United States are considering targeted sanctions against Myanmar’s military leaders, officials familiar with the discussions said this week.

Suu Kyi was swept into office last year after winning an election, but the military holds immense power, including exclusive say over security.

‘FEEL INSECURE’

U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra‘ad al-Hussein has described the government operations as “a textbook example of ethnic cleansing” and said the action appeared to be “a cynical ploy to forcibly transfer large numbers of people without possibility of return”.

Min Aung Hlaing did not refer to such accusations, according to the published account, but said the insurgents had killed 90 Hindus and 30 Rohingya linked to the government.

Insurgent opposition to a citizenship verification campaign, which used the term Bengali, was behind the Aug. 25 attacks that sparked the violence, he said.

“Local Bengalis were involved in the attacks under the leadership of ARSA. That is why they might have fled as they feel insecure,” he said, referring to the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army insurgents.

“The native place of Bengalis is really Bengal,” he said.

He said it was an exaggeration to say a “very large” number were fleeing to Bangladesh and there had been “instigation and propaganda by using the media from behind the scene”.

He did not elaborate but said the “real situation” had to be relayed to the international community. U.N. political affairs chief Jeffrey Feltman is due to visit on Friday.

Rohingya residents of Rakhine said up to 10,000 people had left on Wednesday and Thursday.

One resident, a teacher, said there had been no military offensive recently but people were going.

“There’s no work, nowhere to get food and the government isn’t helping,” said the teacher, who, like the first resident, declined to be identified.

Rakhine state’s secretary, Tin Maung Swe, said people were leaving “every day” to join relatives already in Bangladesh.

”Nobody is starving in death in Myanmar. The government is trying to support those in need,“ he said. ”They can fish or catch shrimps in the creeks near their villages.

“No one’s killing them or intimidating them.”

Suu Kyi, in a televised address, spoke about the importance of humanitarian assistance for all people in Rakhine and said the government would accept refugees back.

She said aid groups, international organizations and Myanmar expatriates would help with the long-term development of the state. She did not refer to accusations of rights abuses by the army.","Myanmar army chief says Rohingya Muslims 'not natives,' numbers fleeing exaggerated",https://www.reuters.com/article/myanmar-rohingya/myanmar-army-chief-says-rohingya-muslims-not-natives-numbers-fleeing-exaggerated-idINKBN1CH0I3?il=0

ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan accused the United States on Thursday of mistreating a strategic ally, in a blistering speech which appeared to rule out swift resolution to a dispute between two NATO members jointly fighting Islamic State.

Hours after Ankara announced officials would meet soon to settle differences, Erdogan accused the U.S. consulate in Istanbul of hiding an individual with links to a network he blames for last year’s failed coup.

He also condemned U.S. support for Kurdish fighters in Syria and separate U.S. court cases against a senior Turkish banker and the president’s own security guards, mocking what he said was Washington’s claim to be “the capital of democracy”.

Turkey’s relations with the United States and many Western countries have been strained since last year’s failed military coup against Erdogan, in which more than 240 people were killed.

Turkey felt many allies were slow to condemn the coup attempt and failed to appreciate the danger it faced. Western countries have grown alarmed at the scale of Turkey’s post-coup crackdown, with 50,000 people detained and 150,000 suspended from work.

Ties with the United States hit a low when Turkey detained a locally employed worker at the U.S. consulate in Istanbul last week.

The United States says it is still seeking an explanation for the arrest - the second detention of a consulate worker this year. It suspended most visa services in Turkey, saying it needed to review Turkey’s commitment to the security of its mission and staff. Turkey reciprocated within hours.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson spoke with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu on Wednesday and expressed his “profound concern”, the U.S. State Department said.

Erdogan has blamed outgoing U.S. ambassador John Bass, saying he was putting at risk a decades-old alliance.

“Let me be very clear, the person who caused this is the ambassador here. It is unacceptable for the United States to sacrifice a strategic partner to an ambassador who doesn’t know his place,” Erdogan told provincial governors meeting in Ankara.

TURKISH GRIEVANCES

Earlier, Deputy Prime Minister Bekir Bozdag said Turkish and U.S. officials would meet to work on resolving the crisis and described talks between their foreign ministers as constructive.

But Erdogan aired a list of grievances, accusing Washington of sheltering suspected members of the outlawed Kurdish Workers Party (PKK), and supporters of Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen he blames for last year’s coup attempt. Gulen denies involvement.

“On the one hand you say you are the capital of democracy, but you hide PKK and FETO members,” Erdogan said, using the label his government has given to Gulen’s network.

He said Washington was defending a “FETO-linked person hiding in your consulate”, and said a Christian pastor arrested in western Turkey last year was also “clearly linked” to Gulen.

Ambassador Bass said this week no one was hiding in the U.S. consulate, and that he had seen nothing of merit in the charges against the pastor, Andrew Brunson.

Erdogan said U.S. authorities had wrongly arrested the former head of Turkey’s majority state-owned Halkbank, and were trying to use a detained Turkish gold trader “as an informant”. Both men were arrested on charges of sanctions violations.

Referring to a U.S. grand jury indictment of 15 Turkish security officials who clashed with protesters during his visit to Washington in May, Erdogan said most of them had never set foot on U.S. soil. “You issue arrest warrants for 13 of my security staff who have never seen the United States,” he said.

“If the ambassador in Ankara is leading the grand United States, then shame on you,” Erdogan said. “Someone should have said: ‘You cannot treat your strategic partner this way, you can’t behave like this’.”",Erdogan says U.S. sacrificing strategic ally Turkey,https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-turkey-erdogan/erdogan-says-u-s-sacrificing-strategic-ally-turkey-idINKBN1CH1HO?il=0

A pop song celebrating a North Korean hero. The lyrics, anything we put our minds to, it can create, and the hero they're referring to is this gray box, the computer numerical control machine, or CNC for short. They're widely available in factories around the world. And while they might not look like much, experts say they're a key feature of Kim Jong-un's missile and nueclear weapons program.

As Reuter's James Pearson explains.>> Well much like a 3D printer, which you can use to print any object, CNC machines, which been around for a very long time, can be used to drill precision parts. Now usually that's used in normal manufacturing, in the North Korean case issue is that, you can use them to make missile nose cones and centrifuges.

And things that can actually boost the banned nuclear missile programs.>> CNC machines weren't designed to help make weapons of mass destruction. They're set up to produce parts for anything from cars, to clothes, to mobile phones. Experts say North Korea probably started fine tuning its own version in the early 90s, after stripping down CNCs imported from the Soviet Union and reverse engineering them.

By 2009, the machines started showing up in North Korean propaganda and that's when arms experts noticed something alarming. They seem to be producing aluminum tubes, a key component in building nuclear weapons. The factory behind North Korea's homemade machines was blacklisted by the UN four years ago, but by then it was practically too late.

Pyongyang now has more than 15,000 CNCs, and on top of that, US officials suspect it also has the ability to produce its own missile engines.>> Because of CNC machines you can develop more or less anything, North Korea's actually not allowed to import certain kinds of CNC machines.

It had managed to do so. One issue is that people aren't always aware that these things, which have a primarily commercial and civilian use, can also be used for the banned nuclear and missile programs.>> Experts say that means the current sanctions aimed at stopping Pyongyang's weapons program are effectively meaningless.",The mechanical hero behind North Korea's nukes,https://www.reuters.tv/v/aaH/2017/10/12/the-mechanical-hero-behind-north-korea-s-nukes

Pfizer, the $215 billion U.S. drugmaker, has tasked investment banks with looking into a spinoff or sale of its consumer-goods division, which makes Advil and Preparation H. New GlaxoSmithKline boss Emma Walmsley would be well placed to offer a home.

Over-the-counter products are a tiny sideline for Pfizer, accounting for just 6.4 percent of its revenue last year. Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read therefore loses little from putting the business on the block. While these goods might share manufacturing and shipping processes with prescription medicines, the unique nature of cooking up, testing and distributing drugs to patients suggests there’s not much reason to keep them together. Germany’s Merck is considering a similar split.

Of course, some are less dismissive – including Walmsley. She took over as CEO in April, having run the consumer-goods joint venture Glaxo co-owns with Switzerland’s Novartis. Walmsley has pledged to focus on Glaxo’s drugs, like its HIV and asthma meds, rather than her old division, which makes just 15 percent of group operating profit. But as she will know, consumer goods are a game of scale – something rivals like Sanofi, Reckitt Benckiser and Johnson & Johnson also covet.

A neat solution would be to fold Pfizer’s consumer business into the Glaxo-Novartis joint venture. Valued at 15 times operating profit – roughly the 10-year average for the consumer-staples sector – the business could be worth $10 billion. That assumes Pfizer’s consumer operating margin is roughly the same 20 percent that Glaxo is targeting. Since Glaxo now values its venture with Novartis at $27 billion, Pfizer could argue for a stake somewhere south of 30 percent. One day, the enlarged company might make for a more lucrative spinoff or sale than Pfizer could muster today.

Timing matters. Read says he will make a decision some time in 2018. Ideally, Glaxo would buy Novartis out before doing any other deals, since it would otherwise have to pay the Swiss for their share of any synergies that came from adding Pfizer. Besides, Walmsley has only been in the job for six months. Nonetheless, she could do worse than toss an offer over Pfizer’s counter.",Breakingviews - Pfizer and Glaxo may find romance over the counter,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pfizer-divestiture-breakingviews/breakingviews-pfizer-and-glaxo-may-find-romance-over-the-counter-idUSKBN1CF2JQ

HARRISBURG, Pa./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Wednesday told workers that they would win under his tax plan, saying it would help the middle class and boost the economy, though critics say it would mainly benefit corporations and the rich.

Speaking in an airplane hangar at a Pennsylvania Air National Guard base in Harrisburg with a trailer truck behind him, Trump reiterated the basic points of the nine-page tax cut “framework” he unveiled two weeks ago.

“It’s a middle-class bill. That’s what we’re thinking of. That’s what I want,” Trump said.

“I’ve had rich friends of mine come up to me, and say, ‘Donald, you’re doing this tax plan -- we don’t want anything. ... Don’t give it to us. Give it to the middle class.’ And that’s what we’re trying so hard to do,” he said.

His remarks came as new Reuters/Ipsos polling showed that more than three-quarters of Americans say the wealthiest Americans should pay more in taxes.

The poll found 53 percent of adults “strongly agree” and 23 percent “somewhat agree” that the wealthiest Americans should pay higher tax rates. The Sept. 29-Oct. 5 poll of 1,504 people has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of plus or minus 6 percentage points.

Financial markets have rallied strongly since Trump’s November 2016 election victory, driven partly by expectations that he would cut taxes for businesses, although policy analysts have been skeptical that he would do so.

Trump on Wednesday boasted about the rally in markets.

“The stock market is soaring to record levels, boosting pensions and retirement accounts for hard-working Americans. Their values are going up every single day,” he said.

Earlier on Wednesday, San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams said he was a “little bit discouraged” about the prospects for federal tax reform.

Given the difficulties Congress has had in passing laws this year, Williams, in comments following a speech in Salt Lake City, said he is “losing confidence” that any tax reform will be passed in the next six months or so.

DEMOCRATS DISPUTE “PAY RAISE”

Trump said his plan for cutting corporate taxes could boost wage growth and mean a $4,000 pay raise for the average household, citing research from a White House economic council.

Democrats, who oppose Trump’s plan, dispute such claims.

“I have not seen any evidence that even comes remotely close to that,” Richard Neal, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee, said of the $4,000 calculation at a forum on Wednesday in Washington.

Independent analysts have said Trump’s blueprint would provide uneven tax relief, add significantly to the federal budget deficit, and in some cases, benefit the very wealthy.

For instance, taxpayers in the highest 1 percent of incomes, making more than $730,000 annually, would get about half of the total benefit from Trump’s plan, with after-tax incomes rising an average of 8.5 percent, according to the Tax Policy Center, a Washington-based nonprofit tax think tank.

Trump on Wednesday said his framework would provide a $500 tax credit to “those who care for an adult dependent or elderly loved one” and that it would substantially increase the child tax credit. No details on those items have been made public.

Congressional tax writers in the House and Senate are working to fill in the details of Trump’s framework. Republican leaders hope to pass a bill by January, delivering what would be Trump’s first legislative victory a year into his presidency.

Before that can happen, the Senate and House must open a procedural path for tax legislation by passing a budget resolution. Lawmakers have hoped to do that this month.

CORPORATE, PASS-THROUGH CUTS

The tax framework, developed in secret by a select group of senior Republicans known as the Big Six, calls for cutting the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent and creating a new category for pass-through income earned by partners and sole proprietors, which would be taxed at 25 percent, instead of the 39.6 percent top individual rate currently paid by some.

It proposes cutting the top individual rate to 35 percent, but congressional tax writers may opt to create an additional, higher rate for the highest earners.

The plan also proposes eliminating the 40 percent tax on inherited estate assets worth more than $5.5 million, or $11 million for a married couple.

A highly placed Republican operative who used to work with senior leadership on Capitol Hill said he did not expect the estate tax repeal to be included in a final package, because the proposal would greatly benefit Trump himself and his family, which would leave the tax reform effort and Trump open to Democratic attack.

He said many Republicans do not see estate tax repeal as crucial, but Republicans have promised wealthy supporters for years that the tax, which they call the “death tax,” will end.

Trump on Wednesday offered a different view. Republicans will end “the crushing, horrible, and unfair estate tax,” he said.

“You hear stories about an angry man or woman throwing jewelry down the toilet, but we didn’t find any rings, unfortunately,” report author Bas Vriens said on Thursday.

“The levels of gold or silver were very small, in the micrograms, or even nanograms, but when you add them up it’s pretty substantial.”

Researchers are now studying if it is worthwhile to extract the metals that end up in sewage sludge before usually being burnt, but so far it has not found to be cost effective.

Higher levels of gold were found in the western Swiss region of Jura, believed to be linked to watchmakers that use the precious metal to decorate their expensive timepieces.

There was also a higher concentration in the southern canton of Ticino due to the gold refineries in the area. This was the only region where it might make sense to recover the metals, Vriens said.

Other trace elements including rare metals such as gadolinium - used in medical imaging - were also found by the scientists from the government’s institute of aquatic science and technology (EAWAG).

Their discovery is the latest example of wealthy Switzerland finding riches in unusual places.

Last month an investigation was launched after toilets at a Geneva bank and three restaurants were blocked by about $100,000 in high-denomination banknotes - a bit different from the huge fat mass that blocked an east London sewer.

The Swiss metal concentrations complied with regulations and were removed before humans drank the water again, the study said.

“It wouldn’t make sense for people to boil their tap water to recover gold or silver because it has already been filtered out before it re-enters the drinking water supply,” Vriens said.",Swiss flushing away millions in gold and silver every year,https://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idAFKBN1CH1DN

As of the end of September, at least 205 civilians had been killed and 261 wounded this year in air strikes in Afghanistan, U.N. investigators said in a quarterly report.

At least 38 percent of those casualties were caused by international military forces, while the majority were attributed to the Afghan Air Force, which has begun to conduct more attacks on its own.

More than two thirds of the civilian victims were women and children, the report said.

In September, U.S. warplanes dropped more bombs than in any single month since 2010, driven largely by Trump’s strategy of trying to reassert pressure on militants after several years of drawdown by foreign troops.

A spokesman for the U.S. military command did not immediately comment on the report.

General Dawlat Waziri, spokesman for the Afghan Ministry of Defence, rejected the findings and said the government took civilian casualties seriously.

“It is quite obvious that Taliban and other insurgent groups cause more civilian casualties,” he said, adding that insurgents also “use civilians as human shields and hide in residential areas”.

Overall civilian casualties decreased slightly compared to the same period last year, the report said.

At least 2,640 civilians were killed and 5,379 injured this year, compared to 2,616 killed and 5,915 injured in the same period of 2016.

The drop reflected fewer casualties from fighting in populated areas, the report noted, as militants failed to capture any major cities.

The head of the U.N. mission in Afghanistan, Tadamichi Yamamoto, praised the Afghan government for formally endorsing a national policy designed to reduce civilian casualties.

“The government owes it to its citizens, particularly the victims of the armed conflict, to ensure full implementation of the policy through a concrete action plan,” he said.

LORDSTOWN, Ohio (Reuters) - Wall Street is fretting that the U.S. auto industry is heading for a downturn, but for thousands of workers at General Motors Co factories in the United States, the hard times are already here.

Matt Streb, 36, was one of 1,200 workers laid off on Jan. 20 - inauguration day for Republican U.S. President Donald Trump - when GM canceled the third shift at its Lordstown small-car factory here. Sales of the Chevrolet Cruze sedan, the only vehicle the plant makes, have nosedived as U.S. consumers switch to SUVs and pickup trucks.

Streb is looking for another job, but employers are wary because they assume he will quit whenever GM calls him back.

“I get it,” said Streb, who has a degree in communications, “but it’s frustrating.”

Layoffs at Lordstown and other auto plants point to a broader challenge for the economy in Midwestern manufacturing states and for the Trump administration.

The U.S. auto industry's boom from 2010 through last year was a major driver for manufacturing job creation. The fading of that boom threatens prospects for U.S. industrial output and job creation that were central to President Trump's victory in Ohio and other manufacturing states.

Infographic ID: '2smL7NQ'

“This is about economics, not what Trump says,” said Robert Morales, president of United Auto Workers (UAW) union Local 1714, which represents workers at GM’s stamping plant at Lordstown. “Even if Trump went out and bought 10,000 Cruzes a month, he wouldn’t get the third shift back here.”

Last week the Federal Reserve said U.S. factory output fell 0.4 percent in May, the second decline in three months, due partly to a 2-percent drop in motor vehicles and parts production.

Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, has compiled data from government sources that show the auto industry punching higher than its weight in job creation in recent years - accounting for between 60 percent and 80 percent of all U.S. manufacturing jobs added in 2015 and 2016.

In the first quarter of this year, the auto industry accounted for less than 2 percent of the 45,000 manufacturing jobs created.

“There’s no argument with the idea that auto has been pulling the manufacturing sled up the mountain for the last three or four years,” Muro said. “If you take auto out, you’re left with a very tepid outlook indeed.”

Long-term auto layoffs could threaten the economies of communities and states directly affected, although after decades of boom and bust, many communities in the auto manufacturing heartland have diversified.

In Ohio’s Mahoning Valley, which was battered by the collapse of the once-dominant steel industry, the boom in drilling for shale gas helps offset job cuts at auto plants.

Lordstown Mayor Arno Hill says the town salted away money during the boom to pay down its debts and new businesses are coming in, including a $900-million power plant being built in town that will burn cheap natural gas produced in the region.

GM makes up 40 percent of tax receipts versus 85 percent in the early 1990s, he said.

“GM is still the brightest star in the Mahoning Valley, but luckily we have diversified our economy,” Hill said. “There is pain for the laid-off workers, but it won’t hurt us as bad it used to.”

Lordstown’s workers have taken steps to blunt the impact of layoffs, with help from GM.

Matt Streb’s wife is due to start work soon after getting a degree, while he hopes to return to a former job as a mailman. In the meantime, GM gave advance notice of job cuts so he saved extra money and has drastically cut his spending.

STALLING SEDAN SALES

The decline in U.S. auto sales is still minor compared to the dramatic collapse during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, when demand for new vehicles plunged to its lowest levels in decades.

However, the days when auto assembly and parts plants throughout the Midwest were running flat-out because of high demand for nearly every type of vehicle are over. Recent sales trends show consumers becoming more selective, shunning older models and especially smaller cars.

For much of the boom that ran from 2010 through to a record year in 2016 of 17.55 million new vehicles sold, the share of cars has declined versus “light trucks” - or pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers.

After peaking at 51.32 percent of all sales in 2012, passenger cars fell to 40.4 percent of sales in 2016. That decline equates to the output of seven or eight vehicle assembly plants.

Through the first five months of this year, sedan sales fell 11 percent, even as the light truck category rose 4.7 percent.

To avoid profit-sapping discounts, and reverse a decline in prices of used vehicles, automakers are ordering more and deeper production cuts.

GM has laid off more than 5,000 workers so far this year - including 1,000 at its Fairfax plant in Kansas that makes the Chevrolet Malibu midsize sedan. GM has also laid off 1,100 workers at a plant in Lansing because it has ended production of the GMC Acadia SUV there.

More GM workers will be hit with temporary layoffs this summer. Lordstown will shut up shop for five weeks this summer, much longer than the usual two-week summer vacation closure.

Many laid-off GM workers are finding temporary employment at other facilities or taking permanent transfers to plants like its Arlington, Texas, facility where production of large sport utility vehicles continues unabated. However, those temporary postings require workers to relocate hundreds of miles from home.

Randy Freeman, president of UAW Local 652 which represents workers at GM’s Grand River plant in Lansing, Michigan, which makes sedans, says he has been pleased by GM’s efforts to rehire workers and relations with the automaker “are on an upward swing.”

The threats to U.S. workers building sedans are not likely to ease, barring a spike in the price of gasoline. Ford Motor Co signaled its long-term pessimism about small-car demand in the United States by announcing plans on Tuesday to shift production of its Focus compact car model to China. The Michigan plant that builds the Focus currently is expected to switch to building trucks and SUVs in 2018.

At GM’s Lordstown and Lansing Grand River plants, UAW representatives say they are focused on improving quality in the hope that GM will pick their plant when it’s time to find a location for producing a new truck or SUV.

At Lordstown, for instance, union officials tout the fact the plant has just won a quality award for local innovation on a part that helps the Cruz run better.

“We’re working hard to make the best product we can,” said Glenn Johnson, president of UAW Local 1112 at Lordstown, “so we can raise our hands and say to GM ‘look at what we can do.”

(Reuters) - Rafael Nadal continued to scythe his way through the Shanghai Masters on Thursday, reaching the quarter-finals with a 6-3 6-1 thrashing of temperamental Italian Fabio Fognini.

The Spaniard needed two minutes over the hour to dispatch Fognini, taking his winning streak to 14 matches since the start of the U.S. Open where he claimed a 16th grand slam title.

The 31-year-old is closing in on finishing the year as world number one for the first time since 2013 but Roger Federer, the only man who can stop him, is looking equally impressive.

Federer delighted his small army of Chinese fans inside the Qi Zhong Centre with an emphatic 6-4 6-2 defeat of tricky Ukrainian Alexandr Dolgopolov.

Fognini was playing the day after being handed a suspended ban from two grand slams and $96,000 fine for verbally abusing a female umpire at the U.S. Open.

But there was little fight from the 30-year-old as Nadal lost only six points on serve in the opening set.

While a Nadal-Federer final looms, Argentina’s Juan Martin del Potro could ruin the script, as he did at the U.S. Open where he defeated Federer in the quarter-finals when a semi-final between the two greats looked likely.

The former U.S. Open champion stopped third seed Alexander Zverev, recovering from losing the opener to win 3-6 7-6(5) 6-4.

“I think he played a great match, maybe one of the best of the season,” Zverev said.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Divisions along national lines, including actions taken by the United States against Russia’s Kaspersky Lab, are making it harder to effectively fight cross-border cyber crime, a senior Interpol official told Reuters on Tuesday.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration barred U.S. government agencies from using Kaspersky Lab anti-virus products in September, saying it was concerned the firm was vulnerable to Kremlin influence and using its software could jeopardize national security.

Kaspersky Lab has strongly denied the allegations, arguing that it has been caught up in a wider geopolitical spat between Moscow and Washington following allegations Russian hackers interfered in last year’s U.S. presidential election.

Moscow denies the accusations and some researchers have pointed to the company’s problems in the United States as an example of growing fragmentation in the cyber security industry after a series high-profile attacks which have fueled distrust and suspicion between countries.

“Balkanisation, especially in the cyber security community - that is happening and that needs to be corrected,” said Noboru Nakatani, executive director of Interpol’s Global Complex for Innovation.

“The reality is criminals, they are working together by sharing information by helping each other to make money,” he said at a cyber crime conference in Moscow. “Do you think the governments or the good people are doing the same?”

Speaking on the sidelines of the conference organized by Russian cyber security firm Group-IB, Nakatani said Kaspersky Lab’s situation was an example of Balkanisation.

He said Interpol, which coordinates international efforts to fight cyber and other crimes, had not received any information from the United States about the allegations against the company.

“Kaspersky is fighting against cyber criminals, it is very clear. Kaspersky is working with governments and companies across the world,” he said. “We should work together.”

GENEVA (Reuters) - West African migrants trying to reach Europe are dying in far greater numbers in the Sahara than in the Mediterranean but efforts to dissuade them may cause new routes to open up, the United Nations migration agency said on Thursday.

So far this year 2,569 migrant deaths have been recorded in the central Mediterranean, while more than 107,000 migrants, mainly West Africans, have reached Italy.

“One thing we still don’t have is any estimate of number of deaths in the desert,” Richard Danziger, the U.N. International Organization for Migration director for West and Central Africa, told a news conference in Geneva.

“We assume, and I think we have said before, that it has to be at least double those who die in the Mediterranean. But we really have no evidence of that, it’s just an assumption. We just don’t know.”

In Niger, a main transit route, people smugglers were increasingly scared of the authorities, which might make them more prone to abandon migrants in the desert, he said.

Many migrants had told of deaths in the desert, and some said the smugglers believed that if they drove fast through minefields they would be safe, said the IOM’s Niger mission chief, Giuseppe Loprete.

Migrant numbers heading through Niger have fallen dramatically after strong action by the government to close migrant “ghettoes” and arrest people smugglers, he said.

IOM was also trying to spread the word that “you do not want to get caught in Libya,” Danziger said.

“What happens in Libya is far scarier to people than dying, the horror stories that returnees come back with.”

Many of the smugglers did not see themselves as criminals, and were often former desert guides trying to make money. Many of them had given up, while organized criminals with contacts in Libya were continuing, Loprete said.

“Right now they are looking for alternative routes, I think at least equally dangerous,” he said.

“When you plug one hole, other holes are going to open up,” Danziger said.

Niger had two routes to Libya: one closer to Chad that was used to smuggle migrants and one closer to the Algerian border that was far more dangerous and was used by extremist groups and for drugs and gun-running.

An alternative was through northern Mali, a region beset by conflicts between rival groups, but but there did not seem to have been a dramatic rise there, Danziger said.

The route considered the safest was along the western coast of Africa, via Senegal, Mauritania and Morocco to the Strait of Gibraltar, and migrant flows there had increased, he said.",Migrant deaths in the Sahara likely twice Mediterranean toll: U.N.,https://www.reuters.com/article/europe-migrants-sahara/migrant-deaths-in-the-sahara-likely-twice-mediterranean-toll-u-n-idINKBN1CH22N?il=0

Cette nouvelle vague de réformes, promesses de campagne du chef de l‘Etat, doit déboucher sur un projet de loi qui sera présenté au printemps prochain - en avril - pour une entrée en vigueur des réformes au 1er janvier 2019.

Premier leader syndical à être reçu à l‘Elysée jeudi matin, le secrétaire général de Force ouvrière (FO) Jean-Claude Mailly a présenté ses lignes rouges sur ces sujets.

“On a fait un premier tour d‘horizon”, a-t-il dit à la presse à l‘issue de son entretien avec le chef de l‘Etat.

Parmi les mesures phares de ces réformes, l‘ouverture de l‘assurance chômage aux indépendants et, une fois tous les cinq ans, aux salariés démissionnaires.

Le coût de ce dispositif a été estimé, selon Les Echos, entre 8 et 14 milliards d‘euros la première année puis entre trois à cinq milliards d‘euros les années suivantes, un chiffre que n‘a pas souhaité confirmer la ministre du Travail, Muriel Pénicaud

“J‘ai insisté sur le fait que nous tenions à avoir notre responsabilité en ce qui concerne les salariés, sur la définition des prestations et de l‘indemnisation”, a dit Jean-Claude Mailly, en référence à la promesse d‘Emmanuel Macron pendant la campagne de “prendre en charge le pilotage du système d’assurance chômage”.

Pour l‘instant le régime est dirigé par les organisations patronales et syndicales. “Quand on gère à trois, il y en a toujours deux contre un et ça tourne, je ne pense pas que ce soit le meilleur système” a ajouté le leader syndical.

“FAIRE LE TRI”

Le gouvernement souhaite par ailleurs entreprendre une refonte totale de l‘apprentissage et de la formation professionnelle, un secteur qui a coûté 31,6 milliards d‘euros à l‘Etat, aux entreprises, aux collectivités publiques et aux ménages en 2014, selon le ministère du Travail, et qui a été épinglé par la Cour des comptes en février dernier pour ses risques “d‘irrégularités et de fraude”.

Il a annoncé, à cette fin, un investissement massif additionnel de 15 milliards d‘euros sur l‘ensemble du quinquennat pour former un million de chômeurs et un million de jeunes.

“Il faut faire le tri dans les organismes de formation. Aujourd‘hui, tout le monde peut monter une boite de formation, il suffit de s‘inscrire sur internet, il n‘y a aucune évaluation, aucun contrôle qui est fait”, a dit Jean-Claude Mailly à propos des 66.362 organismes de formation qui existaient en 2013.

Pour Jean-Claude Mailly, cette rencontre était aussi l‘occasion de parler des conditions de travail des fonctionnaires, qui étaient plus de 209.000 à manifester le 10 octobre dans les rues, selon le ministère de l‘Intérieur.

“J‘ai à nouveau demandé, j‘espère cette fois que je serai entendu, qu‘il y ait un vrai débat sur le rôle et les missions du service public”, a-t-il dit, précisant que le président de la République avait été “sensible” à sa demande.

CLIMAT SOCIAL TENDU

Emmanuel Macron doit recevoir ensuite Philippe Martinez (CGT), François Hommeril (CFE-CGC), Alain Griset (U2P), Pierre Gattaz (Medef), Philippe Louis (CFTC) et François Asselin (CPME). Le secrétaire général de la CFDT Laurent Berger sera lui reçu vendredi matin pour des raisons d‘agenda.

L‘ensemble des partenaires sociaux seront ensuite reçus entre le 17 et 19 octobre par le Premier ministre Edouard Philippe avant d‘entamer à proprement parler les discussions avec Muriel Pénicaud.

Le lancement de ce chantier intervient dans un climat social tendu. Le projet de loi de finances pour 2018, présenté fin septembre, a été jugé “déséquilibré” au bénéfice des catégories aisées par l‘opposition et des membres de la majorité.

L‘incertitude plane sur l‘attitude qu‘adopteront pendant les discussions les partenaires sociaux, notamment FO qui fait face à une base désireuse d‘en découdre et mécontente de la concertation sur la réforme du Code du travail.

Réunis lundi soir, les syndicats n‘ont trouvé aucun terrain d‘entente sur une nouvelle journée de mobilisation contre la loi travail. Ils ont prévu de se revoir le 24 octobre.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s annual consumer price inflation remained steady in September from the previous month, but hopes of a rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India remain bleak as it expects higher inflation in coming months.

India’s annual consumer inflation (CPI) in September rose to 3.28 percent from a year earlier, government data showed on Thursday.

Analysts polled by Reuters had expected September’s CPI inflation rate would edge up to 3.60 percent from August’s downwardly revised 3.28 percent.

Earlier this month, the RBI left interest rates unchanged, after cutting the key rate by 25 basis points in August, while raising its retail inflation projection for October-March to a range of 4.2 to 4.6 percent, and lowered its economic growth estimates.

Analysts said the chances of a rate cut were bleak as higher sales during India’s long festival season that begins next week, coupled with higher petrol and diesel prices, could feed into broader prices.

“Aside from volatile food and fuel prices, core inflation is likely to accelerate,” said Shilan Shah, an economist at Capital Economics in Singapore.

“There is also a risk that excessive liquidity in the banking sector could seep into inflation.”

Since Aug. 1, retail petrol prices in Delhi have gone up 4.7 percent and diesel 2.6 percent despite a cut in taxes by the federal government.

Retail inflation has been steadily rising since June, when it eased to 1.46 percent - its slowest pace since India started releasing such figures in January 2012, based on combined data for rural and urban consumers.

Separately, annual industrial output grew at a nine-month high of 4.3 percent in August, compared with the forecast of 2.4 percent by economists in a Reuters poll, the data showed.

Industrial output growth was revised to 0.9 percent year-on-year in July.

POLITICAL COMPULSIONS

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who faces crucial state elections in his home state of Gujarat and hilly state of Himachal Pradesh in December, is under pressure to revive growth, which slipped to 5.7 percent in the April-June quarter, the slowest pace in three years.

Last week, the government cut taxes on 27 items, mostly food products, and eased rules for small and medium-sized companies, as it rushes to address growing criticism of its new tax launched in July.

New Delhi, facing risks of a widening fiscal deficit this year mainly due to lower growth in revenue receipts, wants the RBI to ease policy rates to support private investment and revive growth.","Retail inflation remains steady in September, hopes for rate cut bleak",https://www.reuters.com/article/india-economy-retail-inflation/retail-inflation-eases-to-3-28-percent-in-september-idINKBN1CH1QB

Hannover (Reuters) - Im Anleger-Prozess um Milliardenforderungen wegen der geplatzten bernahme von Volkswagen durch Porsche vor neun Jahren hat der Richter Zweifel an möglichen Schadensersatzansprüchen zu erkennen gegeben.

Der Kartellsenat des Oberlandesgerichts Celle erklärte zu Beginn des Musterverfahrens am Donnerstag in Hannover, dass er nach vorläufiger Wertung der von den klagenden Hedgefonds und Privatanlegern vorgebrachten Argumente keine Anhaltspunkte für eine bewusste Irreführung der Anleger durch die VW-Mutter PSE sehe. Daraus folge, dass womöglich “ein großer Teil der Feststellungsziele nicht begründet ist und abgewiesen” werden könne, sagte Richter Matthias Wiese. Zwei Klägeranwälte stellten einen Befangenheitsantrag gegen das Gericht, dem sie mangelnde Unabhängigkeit vorwefen. Der auf Musterklagen spezialisierte Rechtsanwalt Andreas Tilp betonte in einer Verhandlungspause, dass es sich um eine vorläufige Auffassung des Gerichts handle, und gab sich kämpferisch. “Es wäre nicht das erste Mal, dass wir einen Senat in zentralen Punkten drehen würden.” Er warf der Kammer zudem Mängel im Kapitalmarktrecht vor. “Ich bedaure es, dass hier ein Kartellsenat über kapitalmarktrechtliche Fragen entscheidet, der ersichtlich dazu - jedenfalls partiell - noch nicht in der Lage zu sein scheint.” Sollten die Kläger unterliegen, würde sich dies als “Pyrrhussieg” für die Gegenseite erweisen. Denn spätestens nach einem Gang zum Bundesgerichtshof werde sich das OLG Celle erneut mit dem Fall befassen müssen. “Ich gehe allerdings davon aus, dass das ein anderer Senat sein wird”, ergänzte Tilp. Die Porsche SE wollte sich nicht äußern. Anders als erwartet, führte Richter Wiese zu Beginn des Prozesses nicht nur in den Streitfall ein, sondern würdigte bereits ausführlich die von den Klägern vorgebrachten rechtlichen Fragestellungen. Für eine Irreführung der Anleger durch Porsche sehe er keine Anhaltspunkte. Es sei auch nicht zu erkennen, dass Porsche vor neun Jahren seine Absichten bei Volkswagen im Dunkeln gehalten habe, um Anleger zu schädigen. Die von der VW-Mutter zwischen März und Oktober 2008 veröffentlichten Mitteilungen seien “nicht grob falsch”. Die klagenden Investoren, darunter mehrere Hedefonds, hätten sich zudem des Risikos bewusst sein müssen, das sie mit Leerverkäufen eingingen. Der Richter verwies zudem auf Urteile anderer Gerichte, die Schadensersatzforderungen gegen Porsche bereits abgewiesen hatten. Die Kläger halten Porsche vor, seine wahre Absicht verschleiert und sich an Volkswagen herangeschlichen zu haben, um den sehr viel größeren Wolfsburger Autobauer unter seine Kontrolle zu bringen. Erst mit der Mitteilung am 26. Oktober 2008 sei klar geworden, was die Stuttgarter im Schilde führten. Damals legte die PSE offen, dass sie sich durch Käufe und Optionsgeschäfte bereits rund 74 Prozent an Volkswagen gesichert hatte. Der Kurs der VW-Aktie sprang danach von 210 Euro auf etwas über 1000 Euro je Anteilschein.

Die Kläger vermuten, dass Porsche die Anteilsquote bewusst zu diesem Zeitpunkt veröffentlicht hat, um durch den erwarteten Kursanstieg einen Finanzierungsengpass zu überbrücken. Das Unternehmen hat dies bestritten - und das Gericht scheint dem zu folgen: “Porsche hat damit nur die bestehenden Verhältnisse offengelegt”, sagte Richter Wiese. Hedgefonds, die mit Leerverkäufen auf fallende Kurse gesetzt hatten, wurde mit der Mitteilung klar, dass kaum VW-Aktien verfügbar waren. Sie mussten sich extrem teuer eindecken, um ihre Leerverkäufe abzuwickeln, was ihnen hohe Verluste einbrockte. Allein die Kanzlei von Tilp vertritt Anleger, die Schadensersatz von über drei Milliarden Euro fordern. Insgesamt geht es in dem Rechtsstreit um mehr als fünf Milliarden Euro. Als Musterklägerin hat das Oberlandesgericht die Inkassogesellschaft ARFB bestimmt. Die anderen Kläger sind so genannte Beigeladene, die den Prozess verfolgen.

Una spinta agli utili aziendali potrebbe arrivare anche dalla proposta di riforma fiscale del presidente Donald Trump, le cui speranze di successo sono accresciute la scorsa settimana dopo che Camera dei Rappresentanti ha approvato un progetto di spesa fiscale per il 2018 che potrebbe favorire il passaggio della più ampia legge di riforma. “E come se ci fossero alcuni investitori che accompagnano il mercato con ottimismo sui tagli fiscali in assenza di cattive notizie”, commenta Andre Bakhos, direttore generale di Janlyn Capital.

In un mercato azionario in rialzo per la gran parte dell‘anno, le valutazioni di molti titoli sono cresciute sopra la media di lungo termine e i forti risultati trimestrali potrebbero contribuire a giustificare i premi raggiunti.

Secondo i dati Thomson Reuters a livello aggregato gli utili delle società S&P 500 dovrebbero salire del 4,9% nel terzo trimestre, in calo dalla crescita a doppia cifra registrata nei primi due trimestri dell‘anno.

LONDON (Reuters) - Maersk (MAERSKb.CO) can no longer transport goods in or out of Qatar after Arab countries imposed restrictions on trade with the tiny Gulf state and the company is looking at alternative shipping routes.

Shipping lines normally transship cargoes from the United Arab Emirates port of Jebel Ali to Qatar, which relies heavily on imports by sea and land.

A Maersk Line spokesman said on Tuesday: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

“We expect disruptions to our Qatar services. The situation is very fluid,” the spokesman said, adding that Maersk would notify customers about alternative options as soon as possible.

The spokesman said the company, which is the world’s biggest container shipping line, was looking at other routes such as Oman.

Larger container ships are unable to dock at ports in Qatar due in part to shallow waters so shipping lines use feeder services, which transport container boxes from the larger port of Jebel Ali in the United Arab Emirates.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

Ports have also been directly affected, which has disrupted trade in commodities from crude oil to metals and food.

The ban has meant that any ship sailing to and from Qatar will be prevented from calling at major ports in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, which include Jebel Ali, as well as Bahrain.

Food imports have been affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies.

Trade sources said the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already cut exports of white sugar to Qatar. Consumption is traditionally higher during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is currently being observed.","Maersk says unable to ship Qatar bound cargo from UAE, seeks alternatives",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gulf-qatar-shipping/maersk-says-unable-to-ship-qatar-bound-cargo-from-uae-seeks-alternatives-idUSKBN18X1YS

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s administration has vowed to revive the coal industry, challenged climate-change science and blasted renewable energy as expensive and dependent on government subsidies.

And yet the solar power industry is booming across Trump country, fueled by falling development costs and those same subsidies, which many Republicans in Congress continue to support.

Data provided to Reuters by GTM Research, a clean energy market information firm, shows that eight of the 10 fastest-growing U.S. solar markets between the second quarters of 2016 and 2017 were Western, Midwestern or Southern states that voted for Trump, with Alabama and Mississippi topping the list. And solar firms are ramping up investments in these regions, signaling their faith that key renewable energy incentives will remain in place for years to come.

The industry’s sunny outlook illustrates the complexity of green power politics in Washington and casts doubt on whether the administration can boost the coal and nuclear sectors while subsidies continue to the fuel growth of competing wind and solar.

Solar expansion in the middle of the country is offsetting its slowing growth in the maturing California and Northeast markets. That marks a big shift for an industry that has historically relied on politically liberal coastal states where renewable energy development is mandated to combat air pollution and climate change.

With falling development costs, solar firms now see strong prospects in conservative states with no such mandates.

“Climate change has never come up in any discussion about why we would do a project,” said Matt Beasley, chief marketing officer for Silicon Ranch Corp, a solar developer based in Nashville, Tennessee. “It is always about the economics.”

The estimated costs of solar power generation have dropped 85 percent since 2009, making its unsubsidized cost competitive with natural gas in the sunniest locations, according to a report by Lazard, an asset management firm.

Still, the sector’s growth continues to rely on public support. The U.S. Congress’ Joint Committee on Taxation earlier this year estimated that solar projects would receive $12.3 billion in tax breaks between 2016 and 2020.

Trump has never specifically proposed repealing those incentives but has expressed skepticism about the viability of solar and wind, calling both ""very, very expensive"".

The president’s Energy Secretary Rick Perry last month called for new rules to subsidize coal and nuclear energy, arguing that the rise of weather-dependent solar and wind power would make the grid less reliable.

This week, Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency chief, Scott Pruitt, said during in a speech in Kentucky that he would scrap incentives for renewable energy firms and let them “stand on their own,” while acknowledging the decision rests with Congress.

A White House official did not respond to a request for comment and clarification of the administration’s position on solar subsidies. But other Republicans are outspoken in their continuing support for the incentives, using an economic rather than environmental rationale.

“The expansion of solar and other clean technologies has created thousands of jobs and reduced emissions,“ said Sen. Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican. ”Once these technologies have reached a competitive position in the energy market, a gradual reduction in incentives is an appropriate way to approach their sustained growth.”

Of the 10 states that installed the largest amounts of solar power over the past year, six were Republican-led, according to the GTM Research data. Of those, Utah, North Carolina and Texas each installed more than 1 gigawatt of solar, or enough to power about 700,000 homes.

Industry players hope solar growth in states that form Trump’s political base will influence how he decides later this yar in a trade case they fear could lead to tariffs on solar panels imported to the U.S.

SOLAR SUPPORT IN TRUMP COUNTRY

Solar and wind energy firms have become important constituents in some Republican-led states because they employ about 300,000 people nationwide - six times the number working in the coal industry, according to industry and government data.

In 2015, a Republican-controlled Congress extended lucrative tax credits for renewable energy industries through 2020, primarily a tax credit worth 30 percent of the cost of residential and utility-scale installations.

Under current law, the solar credits would phase out gradually, ending at a permanent 10 percent for utility projects after 2021. The residential credit would expire. Solar firms expect that, by then, they can bring down costs enough to compete without government help.

Solar providers in rural states have also gotten a boost from a pair of other federal programs.

One is a U.S. Department of Agriculture program ushered in by former President Barack Obama, which provided more than $400 million in funding for rural solar projects in 2015 and 2016. Seventy percent of the money went to states that voted for Trump.

The other is the federal Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA), a 40-year-old law requiring utilities to buy renewable power from small providers if their prices are competitive with fossil fuels - something solar developers have only recently been able to offer.

The growth of solar directly undermines Trump’s goal of boosting the coal industry. Luke Popovich, a spokesman for the National Mining Association, called Republican support of solar subsidies “inconsistent with market-based energy policy.”

“Solar is a competitor - and a handsomely subsidized one, along with wind,” he said.

House of Representatives Republican Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, of California, has supported such incentives but said clean power firms should soon start fending for themselves.

“It’s not a level playing field,” McCarthy told Reuters in an interview. “So you will see those (subsidies) beginning to phase out.”

BOON TO DEVELOPERS

Beyond subsidy politics, solar developers’ confidence in red-state markets reflects strong demand from utilities there.

When Reuters surveyed 32 utilities with operations in politically conservative states earlier this year, they overwhelmingly rejected making new investments in coal-fired power despite Trump’s pro-coal agenda - citing falling costs of renewable energy as a factor.

In one example last month, Ameren Corp’s (AEE.N) coal-dependent Missouri utility said it would add 100 megawatts of solar in the next decade.

One installer benefitting from solar’s geographic shift is Inovateus Solar LLC, based in South Bend, Indiana. Eighty percent of its planned project pipeline is in either its home state or neighboring Michigan.

“A red state like Indiana has a lot to show the current administration on how solar energy is valuable and economical,” said Inovateus Chief Executive TJ Kanczuzewski.

Vermont-based groSolar, a subsidiary of France’s EDF (EDF.PA), just opened a Minnesota office and called the Midwest its “number one priority” for future development.

“There’s been a groundswell of interest and curiosity from utilities,” she said. “We’re anxious to fill that need.”

Coronal Energy, a California developer backed by Panasonic (6752.T), meanwhile, is targeting electric cooperatives, many of which are in rural states, according to Danny Van Clief, the company’s chief commercial officer.

Solar capacity at co-ops, which are not-for-profit utilities owned by their customers, has tripled in the last three years, according to the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association.

Texas, where Energy Secretary Perry was once governor, is expected to be the second biggest state for solar growth over the next five years, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, largely because of demand from electric cooperatives and municipal utilities, according to Colin Smith of GTM Research.

The wide open spaces of Texas and other states where solar is growing offer cheaper real estate and easier permitting for solar installations than the industry’s traditional markets in densely populated coastal cities, said Silicon Ranch Co-founder Reagan Farr.

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co on Wednesday warned leaders of Canada’s Unifor labor union that it will start to wind down production of its popular Chevrolet Equinox sport utility vehicle at an Ontario factory unless workers there call off a month-long strike.

The strike has been fueled by union opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement.

Unifor leader Jerry Dias told Reuters on Wednesday that GM officials said they would ramp up production of the vehicle at two plants in Mexico that build the Equinox and a similar model, the GMC Terrain if the walkout is not called off.

“GM just told us today that they are going to ramp up production in Mexico,” Unifor President Jerry Dias said by phone from Washington. “They have declared war on Canada.”

GM has plants in the United States that are under-utilized, but retooling them to build the Equinox would be expensive.

GM plans to study how quickly key suppliers to the Ontario Equinox plant could move their operations to accommodate a shift in the vehicle’s production, a person familiar with the discussions said on Wednesday.

GM’s decision to build the Equinox and Terrain in Mexico is a major issue in the contract dispute between the automaker and the Canadian union.

Dias said he would not call off the strike.

“This is the big issue,” Dias said of the strike. “Once we solve this, everything else will fall into place.”

About 2,500 workers at a factory in Ingersoll, Ontario, walked off the job on Sept. 18 after GM rejected Unifor’s call for the automaker to designate the factory, known as CAMI, as the lead production site for the Equinox in North America. The automaker invested $800 million to retool the plant for the new model.

The union also objected to GM’s decision to lay off 600 CAMI workers as it phased out production of the last-generation GMC Terrain SUV, and launched production of new generation Terrain models along with the Equinox in Mexico.

The CAMI plant was projected to build about 210,000 vehicles in 2018, while two plants in Mexico together were projected to build about 150,000 vehicles next year, according to AutoForecast Solutions, a forecasting firm.

Unifor’s Dias has blamed NAFTA for the job losses, complicating Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s effort to promote the benefits of open trade in response to U.S. President Donald Trump’s criticism of the deal.

U.S., Canadian and Mexican negotiators began another round of talks this week to modernize the agreement.

The Equinox was the second best-selling model in the United States Chevrolet lineup in September, and GM had just 41 days worth of the vehicle in stock at the end of last month, according to Automotive News.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Mylan N.V. is best known for producing EpiPen emergency allergy treatments and generic drugs.

But a non-pharmaceutical offering – refined coal – has quietly generated hundreds of millions of dollars of tax credits for the company over the last six years that have boosted its bottom line, according to a Reuters review of company filings.

Since 2011, Mylan has bought 99 percent stakes in five companies across the U.S. that own plants which process coal to reduce smog-causing emissions. It then sells the coal at a loss to power plants to generate the real benefit for the drug company: credits that allow Mylan to lower its own tax bill.

Infographic ID: '2sQaEQL'

These refined coal credits were approved by Congress in 2004 in order to incentivize companies to fund production of cleaner coal. They are available to any company that is willing to invest the capital, and are set to expire after 2021.

Mylan is one of only a few public companies, and the only publicly-traded pharmaceutical maker, that uses these tax credits, a Reuters review of a comprehensive database of filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission found. It is possible other companies receive an immaterial amount of the tax credits and decline to disclose them.

Future tax credits could prove valuable to Mylan, which has seen sales of its flagship EpiPen allergy treatment sag after consumer outrage over the allergy treatment’s $600 list price. The pricing issue, which has drawn scrutiny from members of Congress and the U.S. Department of Justice, and Chairman Robert Coury’s nearly $100 million pay package last year have caused a group of investors to launch an effort to vote down the company’s board at its annual meeting on Thursday.

Mylan already carries a low tax rate after moving its headquarters overseas in 2015. The coal credits helped the company lower its effective tax rate further, to just over four percent in 2014 and 7.4 percent in 2015. Last year, the company actually had a tax benefit of $358 million, giving it an effective tax rate of negative 294 percent.

Mylan confirmed Reuters’ calculations based on figures in the tax footnotes in the company’s annual reports. According to these calculations, Mylan used more than $100 million of “clean energy and research” tax credits in both 2016 and 2015, and around $95 million in 2014.

A person familiar with the matter told Reuters these coal operations have increased Mylan’s net earnings by around $40 million to $50 million in each of the past two years. That accounts for around 9 percent of the company’s earnings last year and more than 5 percent of its 2015 earnings.

Mylan has disclosed very little about the tax credit strategy or its coal refining operations. It did not announce the coal deals when they occurred or disclose how much they cost. Mylan has not discussed them on its earnings conference calls and does not disclose exactly how much in tax credits they generate or what effect they are having on its bottom line.

Wells Fargo analyst David Maris, who has a market perform rating on the company, said he believes that, from an investor standpoint, the coal transactions adds unnecessary complexity.

“The average investor looking at their financial statements or their press releases, would have no idea what this is or how it flows through to their profit and loss statement,” he said.

“BEING MINDFUL OF TAX PLANNING”

Mylan refers to losses and interest expense generated by its “clean energy investments,” as well as the fact that they qualify for tax credits, in tables and footnotes at the bottom of its earnings releases. In filings with regulators, it discloses some risks around the investments, their carrying value, and liabilities related to the investments.

“It does sound like they are being mindful of tax planning,” said Lisa De Simone, professor of accounting at Stanford Graduate School of Business. “From the perspective of shareholder value, companies have all of the incentive in the world to try to reduce their tax payments, to increase net income and increase distributions to shareholders.”

Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin said in an emailed statement that the tax credits are available to any interested company, and often “made outside of a company’s ordinary course of business, and companies involved in such projects range across a variety of non-energy related sectors.”

Other companies Reuters found that take the credits include insurance brokerage and risk management services firm Arthur J Gallagher, Waste Management Inc and industrial supply company WW Grainger. The companies vary in their level of disclosure of the investments, but some disclose the number of tax credits they receive from the facilities.

Devlin added that the health company recognizes that the production at the refined coal facilities will no longer be eligible for a tax credit beginning in 2022. “Nonetheless, on an ongoing basis, we consider appropriate opportunities for tax planning with respect to our global operations,” she added.

New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer spoke out against the tax strategy when informed about it by Reuters. Stringer, who is leading the effort to vote down Mylan’s current board, oversees New York City pensions that together own more than 1.1 million shares of Mylan stock.

“From the EpiPen pricing debacle to embracing complex tax avoidance strategies, Mylan’s board appears more focused on financial engineering than on the company’s core business,” he said.

COAL INTEREST DATES TO 2011

Mylan made the first investment in the coal producing plants in 2011, and expanded its total holdings to 5 plants by 2014.

Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch, who has led the company since 2012, has coal country roots: she is the daughter of U.S. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the second largest coal-producing state in the country. The company declined to discuss the origin of why it adopted the tax strategy.

Mylan says in its last two annual reports that its holdings are equity method investments in five limited liability corporations that own refined coal production plants, but does not name them.

Reuters was able to identify these operations by reviewing lists of the company’s subsidiaries included with its annual reports. Mylan has 99 percent stakes in 5 LLCs that own refined coal plants: Canton Fuels Company in Illinois, Chouteau Fuels Company in Oklahoma, Deogun Manufacturing Company in Utah, Marquis Industrial Company in Indiana and Powder Street LLC in West Virginia.

Mylan is booking losses from the plants, which is not unusual for these facilities. The companies often pay a middleman who manages the coal production facilities as well as other costs.

Mylan recorded pre-tax losses of $92.3 million in 2016, $93.2 million in 2015 and $78.9 million in 2014 from the operations. The loss generated by the coal plants, as well as depreciation, is tax deductible, according to tax experts.

But the tax credits generated by the facilities are extremely valuable. Last year, companies received $6.81 in tax credits for every ton of refined coal produced. Mylan produced around 16 million tons of refined coal last year, according to a person familiar with the matter.

According to the same person, expenses – including costs paid for the assets and adjusted for tax deductions – equate to around 60 percent of the gross credits earned.",Drugmaker Mylan gets boost from unlikely source: coal,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mylan-coal-insight/drugmaker-mylan-gets-boost-from-unlikely-source-coal-idUSKBN19C0DW

(Reuters) - Cash-strapped U.S. shale firms scaled back their hedging programs in the first quarter, leaving them more vulnerable to tumbling spot market prices just after OPEC reached a landmark deal to curb global supply.

The pullback in hedging was driven by rising service costs and expectations that prices would continue to rally after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended those cuts in May, analysts said.

However, rising U.S. production has stymied OPEC’s efforts to rebalance markets. Crude oil futures LCOc1 have lost 15 percent of their value since February, raising the risk that unhedged companies are more exposed to market weakness.

The market peaked at $55 a barrel in January as cuts got under way, but has struggled since, and closed Monday at $48.29 a barrel [O/R], barely changed from the end of November, when OPEC agreed with nonmembers to cut 1.8 million barrels a day in supply.

For oil traders, hedging data serves as a leading indicator of future supplies. With so little hedged, dealers say producers are now looking to hedge at the next chance possible, a move that will pressure prices in coming months.

Producers hedge by buying a variety of financial options to secure a minimum price for crude and safeguard future production.

According to a Reuters analysis of hedging disclosures by the 30 largest U.S. shale firms, most stayed on the sidelines in the first three months of 2017, a stark contrast from a year ago when firms rushed to lock in prices, even though oil was trading $15 a barrel lower.

In total, 18 companies reduced outstanding oil options, swaps or other derivatives positions by a total of 49 million barrels from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, the data shows. Another 10 companies increased their hedging positions by 91 million barrels; two others did not hedge at all.

Infographic ID: '2rolpok'

Compared with a year ago, the group is more exposed to falling oil prices, with one-fifth fewer barrels hedged, or the equivalent of 28 million barrels, and three times more barrels rolling off, or the equivalent of 38 million barrels.

“A lot of producers held back on locking in hedges in the first quarter because OPEC cut their historic deal and they thought there would be a linear shift higher in prices. But then, we saw several pullbacks,” said Michael Tran, director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets.

Prices are too low now for producers to lock in large volumes of future production, Tran said. In addition, pent-up demand for hedging will pressure any moves higher in the oil market, he said.

UNDERHEDGED ANXIETIES

Morgan Stanley said in a recent note that producers are hedged at around 12 percent of their 2018 output and 40 percent for their current 2017 output.

The increases were driven by Hess Corp (HES.N) and Apache Corp (APA.N), which had previously remained unhedged. They added a combined 54 million barrels.

Analysts expect U.S. oil drilling to taper off as old hedge positions wind down, leaving smaller producers exposed to market prices at below break-even levels.

“I think companies are a little bit nervous that they are underhedged right now and they will try to take advantage of any hedging opportunity they get at about $50 per barrel,” said Bill Costello, a portfolio manager at Westwood Holdings Group.

SOME NEW PLAYERS

In total, the 30 companies held hedged positions equivalent to about 483 million barrels at the end of March, compared with 441 million at the end of 2016. Excluding Hess and Apache, the two highest hedgers, the group held only 428 million barrels.

Some large players refrained from building a larger buffer. Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) - which held 33.2 million barrels hedged for 2017 in the fourth quarter - had 8 million barrels roll off through the first quarter. EOG Resources (EOG.N) had nearly 6 million barrels unwind after terminating its hedges.

Analysts said much of the hesitation has to do with rising service costs. Firms that supply rigs and crews are clamoring to take back discounts extended during the height of the slump early last year, in some cases boosting prices by 10 to 15 percent.

“Producers are working in an environment where they see service cost increases on the horizon. They see their expenses going up, but their revenues are not going up correspondingly, which is why they do not want to hedge and compress their margins,” said Rob Thummel, a portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors LLC.

That hero, widely available in factories across the world, was the Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine.

Big, grey and boxy, CNC machines use pre-programmed guides to produce intricate parts for everything from automobiles and mobile phones to furniture and clothes. They offer accuracy that human machine tool operators are unable to achieve.

In North Korea, thanks to a combination of homemade technology and reverse engineering, the machines now play a critical role in the weapons programs. They allow Kim Jong Un to build nuclear bombs and missiles without relying as heavily on outside technical aid or imports.

Nuclear weapons experts say this has helped him accelerate missile and nuclear testing despite international sanctions on the transfer of sensitive equipment.

Interactive: Kim’s latest act of defiance

“North Korea’s centrifuges and new missiles all depend on components made with CNC machine tools,” said Jeffrey Lewis, head of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of Strategic Studies at Monterey, California.

“(They) are the essential underlying technology for producing missiles and nuclear weapons,” said Lewis.

Since 1996, CNC machines have been included in the Wassenaar Arrangement – an international arms control regime aimed at stopping the proliferation of equipment with both civilian and military uses. North Korea is not a signatory.

The country’s celebrations of its CNC technology have been fulsome. Hundreds of dancers in luminous orange and green performed the CNC pop song, titled “Break through the cutting edge,” at a Korean Workers’ Party celebration in 2010. In 2012, the year the South Korean hit “Gangnam Style” was released, the North’s CNC title was on karaoke machines nationwide, according to Choson Exchange, a Singapore-based company that trains North Koreans in business skills. The official video for the song opens with a long-range North Korean rocket soaring into a blue sky.

CUTTING EDGE

North Korea likely started to develop its own CNC machines in the early 1990s as part of a drive to build sophisticated missiles and nuclear weapons, nuclear experts say. It probably learned how to make them by taking apart machines it had imported from the Soviet Union.

North Koreans perform during mass games in Pyongyang, August 2011. Choson Exchange/via REUTERS

Its first homemade CNC machine was introduced in 1995. Former leader Kim Jong Il gave the machine the “Ryonha” brand, according to a 2009 article in the country’s official newspaper, Rodong Sinmun. That was the first time state media mentioned the technology.

By 2009, the machines had become a mainstay of North Korean propaganda, as Pyongyang launched a nationwide campaign to boost domestic industry. Sanctions were mounting after its second nuclear test and a long-range missile launch that year.

At the time, arms control experts raised concerns about a visit by former leader Kim Jong Il to a North Korean factory where homemade CNC machines appeared to be producing aluminum tubes. These could be used for nuclear centrifuges.

“By around 2010, it seemed they were capable of manufacturing various types of CNC machines,” said Kim Heung-gwang, a North Korean defector who taught at Pyongyang’s Hamhung Computer Technology University before defecting to South Korea.

But it wasn’t until 2013 that the Korea Ryonha Machinery Joint Venture Corporation, which produced the machines, was blacklisted by the U.N. Security Council for supporting the weapons programs.

Slideshow (3 Images)

And it was only in August this year that U.S. intelligence officials told Reuters North Korea likely has the ability to produce its own missile engines themselves. (Full Story)

Now, Kim Heung-gwang estimates, North Korea has about 15,000 CNC machines. He bases this on North Korean state media reports and photos as well as interviews with more than a dozen defectors who were scientists, professors or factory workers.

MASS PRODUCTION

Pyongyang hailed the homemade machines as a triumph for its governing ideology of “Juche”, which champions self-sufficiency. But that wasn’t strictly true.

In August 2016, state media released photos of Kim Jong Un visiting a factory using CNC machines with the logo of Swiss engineering firm ABB ABB.UL, one of the leading players in the global CNC machine market. It’s not clear when or how the machine reached North Korea.

ABB said the firm respects all applicable trade sanctions against North Korea, and undertakes not to deliver ABB equipment to the country. “That said, we cannot rule out that some of our equipment may have been resold to DPR of Korea without our knowledge or permission,” the company said in response to a Reuters inquiry, using North Korea’s official title.

A United Nations panel monitoring sanctions on North Korea said in a report this year that Tengzhou Keyongda CNC Machine Tools Co of China had been a supplier of Pyongyang’s new CNC machines. A sales representative for Tengzhou Keyongda told Reuters the company stopped selling CNC machines to North Korea four years ago, and no longer maintains trade relations with the country.

Despite sanctions, CNC machines are commonplace across North Korean manufacturing and can be brought in through China and Russia, said Lee Choon-geun, a senior fellow at the Science and Technology Policy Institute in South Korea.

The biggest loophole has been that while some CNC machines are banned because they can have both military and civilian functions, most serve civilian industry. “Given their dual-use capability, you could even import the machines for other purposes, take them to pieces and use them however you want,” said Lee.

The CNC song highlights this in its opening line: “Whatever it is, once we put our mind to it, there’s a program to make it,” it says.",How a homemade tool helped North Korea's missile program,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-missiles-technology/how-a-homemade-tool-helped-north-koreas-missile-program-idUSKBN1CH1I4

The Treasury said in a statement on Thursday that Gigaba would use the meetings during the International Monetary Fund and World Bank annual conference to convince investors and ratings firms that the economy was on the mend.

Moody‘s, Fitch and S&P Global Ratings all downgraded the country’s sovereign credit rating, the latter two to sub-investment grade, following President Jacob Zuma’s abrupt axing of Pravin Gordhan as finance minister in March.

All three agencies have warned that persistently low growth at struggling state firms heavily reliant on government bailouts pose significant risks to the country’s ratings. They are also concerned about political jostling ahead of a conference of the ruling African National Congress party in December to elect a new leader to replace Zuma.

“It is important that we continue to engage these stakeholders to discuss interventions on how they can support South Africa’s development process, and to demonstrate our commitment towards addressing their concerns,” the Treasury said in the statement.

The World Bank on Wednesday kept its 2017 economic growth forecast for South Africa at 0.6 percent, and said the economy would expand below 2 percent in 2018 and 2019, warning the country needed to urgently rein in political uncertainty.

On Tuesday, the IMF said it expected South Africa’s economy to grow by 0.7 percent this year, down from an earlier projection of 1 percent given in July, saying rising political uncertainty has dented consumer and business confidence.

The leadership contest to replace Zuma as head of the African National Congress (ANC) party has spawned different rival factions and no clear frontrunner, raising political uncertainty. Zuma can remain as head of state until an election in 2019.",South Africa to woo investors at IMF meetings,https://www.reuters.com/article/investingNews/idAFKBN1CH11U-OZABS

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices rose in September as the price of gasoline recorded its biggest increase in more than two years amid hurricane-related production disruptions at oil refineries in Texas.

Other data on Thursday showed applications for unemployment benefits dropped to a more than one-month low last week as the boost to claims in Texas and Florida from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma continued to unwind.

While the storms impacted the data, there were signs of underlying strength in both wholesale inflation and the labor market, potentially leaving the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates again in December.

The Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand increased 0.4 percent last month after rising 0.2 percent in August. Wholesale prices were also lifted by an increase in the cost of services. In the 12 months through September, the PPI jumped 2.6 percent. That was the biggest gain since February 2012 and followed a 2.4 percent jump in August.

Wholesale gasoline prices soared 10.9 percent in September after increasing 9.5 percent in August. The increase was the largest since May 2015 and accounted for two-thirds of the 0.7 percent rise in the price of goods. The Labor Department said higher energy prices were likely the result of “reduced refining capacity in the Gulf Coast area due to Hurricane Harvey.”

It said Harvey and Irma, which devastated Florida, had “virtually” no impact on the collection of PPI data or survey response rates. Harvey and Irma, which struck in late August and early September, caused the economy to shed jobs last month for the first time in seven years.

The storms have also restrained consumer spending and undercut industrial production, homebuilding and home sales.

Last month’s gasoline-driven surge in the PPI, however, is likely to be temporary amid ample crude oil supplies.

The U.S. dollar .DXY was little changed against a basket of currencies after the data. Prices of U.S. Treasuries pared gains while U.S. stock index futures were trading lower.

CORE INFLATION FIRMING

A key gauge of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services rose 0.2 percent last month after a similar increase in August. The so-called core PPI increased 2.1 percent in the 12 months through September after climbing 1.9 percent in August.

Inflation has remained relatively low, with the main measure tracked by the Fed retreating further below its 2 percent target in August.

Price pressures remain benign despite the labor market nearing full employment, with the jobless rate at more than a 16-1/2-year low of 4.2 percent. Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said that temporary factors such as one-off price cuts by wireless telephone companies are holding back inflation.

Minutes of the Fed’s Sept. 19-20 meeting published on Wednesday showed a vigorous debate among policymakers over inflation, with “several” expressing concern that “the persistence of low rates of inflation might imply that the underlying trend was running below 2 percent.”

Despite tepid inflation, U.S. financial markets have largely priced in a rate increase for December. The Fed has increased borrowing costs twice this year.

Last month, the cost of services increased 0.4 percent, driven by a rise in margins for final demand trade services, a measurement of changes in margins received by wholesalers and retailers. Services edged up 0.1 percent in August.

The cost of healthcare services was unchanged after advancing 0.3 percent in August. Those costs feed into the Fed’s preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy.

In a second report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased 15,000 to a seasonally adjusted 243,000 for the week ended Oct. 7, the lowest level since late August.

Claims have been declining since surging to an almost three-year high of 298,000 at the start of September as workers displaced by the hurricanes were left temporarily unemployed.

Underscoring the labor market’s underlying strength, claims have now been below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a robust labor market, for 136 straight weeks. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller.

The claims report also showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 32,000 to 1.89 million in the week ended Sept. 30, the lowest level since December 1973.",U.S. producer prices increase; weekly jobless claims fall,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-unemployment/u-s-producer-prices-increase-weekly-jobless-claims-fall-idUKKBN1CH1SH

The defeat of ultra-nationalist parties in the Netherlands and in France earlier this year gave European leaders the sense that fear of a far-right surge had, after all, been misplaced. As it turns out, it was the relief that was misplaced.

Europe remains a battleground between nationalist forces, conventional right or left governments and parties which cleave to broadly liberal positions. It is not alone. Across the world, the same impulses to define a state according to ethnic or historic criteria, or to put existing states “first,” grow in diverse forms.

Two referenda illuminate the trend. One, in the Kurdistan region of Iraq on Sept. 25, produced an almost 93 percent vote in favor of Kurdish independence, followed by an immediate demand from the Iraqi government to invalidate the vote and a threat to use the army to suppress any move to independence. On Sunday the citizens of the Catalonia region will vote on whether to secede from Spain – provided that the Spanish state, which has already arrested leaders of the referendum and confiscated voting materials, does not carry out threats to block all voting stations.

The tone in the democratic world is often set by the United States – no longer the champion of greater openness and cooperation, but now the promoter of America First. Work began earlier this week on prototypes for Donald Trump’s “beautiful” wall between Mexico and the United States; the president extended his travel ban to the citizens of three more states (Chad, North Korea and Venezuela) while dropping one, Somalia, from the list – this to align immigration “with his America First foreign policy vision.”

Europe, though, is the hub of nationalist struggles. In large part, this is because the nationalist politicians pit themselves against the continent’s large ambition to create a European Union which, in its enthusiasts’ view, should become a powerful, federal state through progressive integration – a perspective powerfully supported by the European Commission’s president, Jean-Claude Juncker in his “state of the Union” address earlier this month.

Immigration has been and remains the spur for the nationalists. Its growing unpopularity fills out their sails and brings them votes from all over the political compass, including a significant proportion from working class voters accustomed to voting left, even far left.

In Germany’s general election last weekend, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) soared to become the third-largest party in the Bundestag (parliament) behind the governing CDU/CSU center-right coalition and the center-left SPD, largely on strong opposition to immigration. One of the AfD leaders, Alexander Gauland, called Chancellor Angela Merkel’s opening of the borders to some one million migrants “a gift” to his party, which it gratefully accepted and used more successfully than even the party thought possible. Some commentators believe the shock to the German system – built for decades on a moderate consensus opposed to right-wing extremism of any kind – will “condemn Europe to permanent crisis.”

In Sweden, which has taken proportionately more migrants than any other European country over the past two years, crime, including shootings and riotous behavior, seems to have increased. The extent of that has been distorted by the right, but a careful analysis in the National Review does conclude that Sweden has “a growing problem with crime that is linked to immigration.”

The phenomenon was enough for the Migration Minister from neighboring Norway, Sylvi Listhaug – a member of the nationalist Progress Party, part of the governing coalition - to make a media-trailed visit to a Swedish “no-go area,” claiming during the visit that there are ""conditions of lawlessness and criminals in control"" in places with ""a large quantity of people with immigrant backgrounds."" The subtext was that this would not be permitted to happen in Norway. Her Swedish counterpart cancelled a scheduled meeting with her, saying her statement was “complete nonsense.""

In Central Europe, the Visegrad Group of states – the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia – have rejected requests from fellow members of the European Union to take in a quota of migrants. Earlier this week in Prague, I asked the leader of the ANO party, Andrej Babis, strongly favored to be prime minister after the October general election, what his policy toward the EU would be. He answered that he would demand a return of powers from Brussels to the national level, since the EU had no business dictating national policy – a popular view in the country. He has already made clear that he is wholly opposed to migrants being received in Europe.

In her speech on Brexit in Florence last week, UK Prime Minister Theresa May said that the British had “never felt entirely comfortable” in the EU. It’s probably a fair summation of a national mood; most British have always seen the EU as a transactional, rather than political, union. When a sizable part of the population came to believe that the EU is both incomprehensible and overbearing, Brexit resulted.

Across the English Channel, Emmanuel Macron has put himself at the head of a revived and fiercely proactive campaign to rouse the EU to continue its forward march. In a speech Tuesday, the French president proclaimed that “the only path that assures our future is the rebuilding of a Europe that is sovereign, united and democratic.” Integration – in defense, security and within the eurozone, had to be more profound, he said.

It was the vision in which one will not compromise with the nationalist forces – forces which will weaken Merkel, his strongest ally, as she tries to balance Germany’s contending forces rather than embrace his euro-optimism.

Brexit has had the headlines, and attracted the most derision from the EU enthusiasts. But nationalism – the wish to create, or to strengthen, the nation state against real or mythic enemies – remains a dominant current in the politics of the democratic countries.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. smartphone chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM.O) has offered to buy NXP Semiconductors (NXPI.O) without some of its patents in a bid to win EU antitrust regulatory approval for the $38 billion deal, two people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.

The NXP deal, the biggest-ever in the semiconductor industry, would make Qualcomm the leading supplier to the fast-growing automotive chips market.

Qualcomm, which supplies chips to Android smartphone makers and Apple (AAPL.O), submitted its proposal to the European Commission on Oct. 5, but did not provide details.

The EU competition authority is worried that the merged company may provide incentives to customers to buy bundled products, thereby squeezing out rivals, or change NXP’s intellectual property licensing practices.

Qualcomm has told regulators it will not acquire NXP’s standard essential patents, which the Dutch company can sell to another buyer, the sources said.

The company also agreed not to take legal action against third parties related to NXP’s near field communication (NFC) patents except for defensive purposes. NXP co-invented NFC chips which enable mobile phones to be used to pay for goods and store and exchange data.

Qualcomm also offered an interoperability pledge, allowing rival products to function with NXP’s products.

Groundbreaking on homes edged slightly lower in September to 217,118 units from August’s upwardly revised 225,918 as a 10.7 percent drop in multiple starts, typically condos, outweighed an 8.2 percent climb in single starts, the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation said.

Analysts had expected starts to cool to a 210,000 annual rate but construction continued to defy expectations for a pullback after a near decade-long boom.

“Canadian homebuilding activity remains robust, with the best population growth in 25 years proving fundamental support. And, after declining modestly in the second quarter, residential investment looks to have added to growth again in the third quarter,” BMO senior economist Robert Kavcic wrote in a client note.

Canada’s long housing boom has shown signs of cooling, particularly in the nation’s largest city, Toronto, where the introduction in April of a foreign buyers tax has doused sales and ended many of the bidding wars that had become a hallmark of the city’s overheated market.

A separate report from Statistics Canada showed the value of Canadian building permits fell more than expected in August, the second straight monthly decrease, on lower construction intentions for multifamily homes as well as industrial facilities.

The 5.5 percent decrease in total building permits surpassed forecasts for a decline of 1.0 percent and suggested that the building boom will slow in the months ahead. July figures were revised to show a decrease of 2.8 percent from the previously reported 3.5 percent fall.

“Despite the drop (in housing starts) in September, Canadian residential construction remains at a level that is higher than demographic needs,” said Krishen Rangasamy, senior economist at National Bank Financial, estimating that a 190,000 pace of starts would meet demographic needs.

LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin smashed through the $5,000 barrier for the first time on Thursday, jumping as much as 8 percent on the day as investors shrugged off the latest warnings on the risks of buying into the booming cryptocurrency market.

Bitcoin, the biggest and best-known cryptocurrency, has chalked up a more than fivefold increase in price this year.

Typically for bitcoin, which at less than nine years old is still highly volatile and illiquid compared with traditional currencies and assets, the precise reason for its recent tear was unclear.

Upcoming splits in its software, reports that Goldman Sachs is considering offering bitcoin trading, rumors that China could ease restrictions, and even a political crisis in Spain’s Catalonia region were all cited by market-watchers as reasons for the rally.

But the main factor could simply be demand from investors wanting ‘in’ on a market that has provided gains exceeding those of any other currency in every year bar one since 2010.

“People are just wanting to be part of it,” said Ryan Nettles, head of FX trading and market strategy at Swiss bank Swissquote, which launched bitcoin trading two months ago. Nettles said interest had been much higher than anticipated and has come from banks, hedge funds and brokers.

“The interest really stems from the media hype,” he added.

On Wednesday Russian President Vladimir Putin warned of the “serious risks” surrounding the nascent market, while Russia’s central bank said it would ban cryptocurrency trading websites.

But that was not enough to put investors off, with bitcoin rallying around 10 percent since then.

Data released last week from SEMrush, a search engine data analytics firm, found the price had a 91 percent correlation with Google searches on bitcoin, suggesting that all news -- whether negative or positive -- drives up demand, even if bad news can have a temporary negative effect.

Bitcoin almost reached $5,000 at the start of September, but fell back sharply after the head of Goldman Sachs blasted the cryptocurrency as a “fraud” and as China forced exchanges to close down, sparking fears of a broader crackdown.

But after dipping below $3,000 in mid-September, bitcoin has leapt in value by more than 75 percent in four weeks.

“Bitcoin was designed to operate outside of the influence of governments and central banks, and is doing exactly that,” said Iqbal Gandham, Managing Director at retail trading app eToro, which has seen huge increases in cryptocurrency trading volumes.

CRYPTO-RIVALS ALSO RALLY

By 1245 GMT, bitcoin was trading up 8 percent on the day around $5,200 on Luxembourg-based exchange Bitstamp.

Though there have been many warnings about a bitcoin “bubble”, including from European Central Bank Deputy Governor Vitor Constancio, some say it has much further to climb. But determining its value is difficult.

“For most currencies there are several accepted methodologies for estimating relative value, normally based on macroeconomic fundamentals,” said EFG Asset Management’s Global Head of Research, Daniel Murray. “For bitcoin no such fundamentals exist.”

Other cryptocurrencies -- whose prices tend to be highly correlated to bitcoin -- also rallied. Their total value -- or market capitalization -- climbed above $160 billion for the first time since early September, according to industry website Coinmarketcap.com.

Two upcoming “forks” in the bitcoin software code, which will create rival clones of the cryptocurrency, were seen by some as a reason for the rise in price, which saw a boost after the “Bitcoin Cash” clone was created at the start of August.

“Investors are seeing the lessons of history in the up-and-coming forks and hoping for an extra dividend,” said Charles Hayter, co-founder of data analysis website Cryptocompare, adding that rumors on online forums that China could reopen exchanges could also be affecting the price.","Bitcoin rockets above $5,000 to all-time high",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-markets-bitcoin/bitcoin-rockets-above-5000-to-all-time-high-idUSKBN1CH0YQ?il=0

Canada’s BlackBerry filed lawsuits against BLU in 2016, as part of the handset-maker-turned-software-company’s move to make cash off a bunch of technology patents it had collected in its heyday.

Thursday’s agreement will include on-going payments from BLU to BlackBerry, the companies said, but did not give further details.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Apple may proceed to build a 850 million euro ($1 billion) data center in Ireland, the High Court ruled on Thursday, bringing relief for the government after a two-year planning delay which it feared could hurt its reputation with investors.

Apple in February 2015 announced plans to build the data center in a rural location in the west of Ireland to take advantage of rich green energy sources nearby.

Planning permission was granted by the local council six months later, but a series of appeals blocked Apple from beginning work.

High Court judge Paul McDermott on Thursday dismissed two separate appeals against the planning permission, clearing the way for the project to proceed.

Ireland relies on foreign multinational companies for the creation of one in every 10 jobs across the economy and sees major investments such as data centers as a means of securing their presence in the country.

A similar Apple center announced at the same time in Denmark is due to begin operations later this year and Apple has announced it will build a second data center there.

Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar met Apple executives last month and said they had made clear their frustration with the planning and judicial delays and warned the process would color decisions that they might make about future investments.

The government has said it is considering amending its planning laws to include data centers as strategic infrastructure, thus allowing them to get through the planning process much more quickly.

It has said it will be one of the biggest capital investment projects in the west of Ireland, providing 300 construction jobs and 150 on-site permanent jobs.",Irish court gives $1 billion Apple data center green light,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1CH1EC-OCATP

So it was actually very easy for us to get a picture of the world as Vincent van Gogh saw it. The other reason is that he just has this incredibly dramatic and tragic story."" Each of the 65,000 frames of the animated independent film is an oil painting hand painted by 125 professional artists who traveled from around the world to be a part of the project. More than 4,000 artists from around the world applied for the job and 125 were chosen and put through three weeks training. The film has won lavish praise for the technique, but some critics said the narrative does not match the film's breathtaking visual appeal. But Welchman said the film has been given a thumbs-up by audiences in the United States, where it opened more than two weeks ago. ""Loving Vincent"" is the first to have actors playing some of the people Van Gogh captured on canvas. Actor Helen McCrory plays Louise Chevalier, the housekeeper of Doctor Gachet who looked after the painter. The $5.5 million production focuses on the last weeks of Van Gogh's life before his death in 1890 in France at age 37 from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.","""Loving Vincent"" premieres in London",https://www.reuters.com/video/2017/10/10/loving-vincent-premieres-in-london?videoId=372702439&videoChannel=3&channelName=Entertainment

On Oct. 15, he will have to certify whether Tehran is observing the 2015 multinational agreement to forego nuclear weapons. Trump has reluctantly certified Iran’s compliance, which is due quarterly, twice since taking office. This time, his belligerent address to the United Nations suggests he may not.If the United States follows through on threats to stop fulfilling its commitments under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, as the Iran deal is formally known, its allies in Europe will be forced to choose between committing a crime and making a mistake. Whichever they decide, the strength of the transatlantic coalition – America’s most important and most reliable partnership – will be cast into doubt.

Iran is complying with the JCPOA. The U.S. intelligence community has repeatedly confirmed it, as have partner intelligence agencies and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). European leaders oppose refusing to certify Iranian compliance because it would make it likely that Congress will re-impose U.S. sanctions.

That would be only the first of two body blows to the agreement and to the alliance. The second would be an abuse of U.S. authority to re-impose United Nations sanctions.

The president has the power to force the United Nations to “snap back” the multilateral sanctions lifted under the deal – biting restrictions on Iranian banks and other businesses. If the United States re-imposes its own sanctions on Iran, it will inevitably avail itself of these UN sanctions, as well.

The Bush and Obama administrations persuaded Russia, China, and the UN Security Council to sanction Iran’s economy in order to limit its nuclear program. The JCPOA traded these sanctions for tight nuclear restrictions and inspections, but the United States and its partners worried that the Security Council might fail to re-impose the sanctions if Iran cheated, reducing Iran’s incentive for long-term compliance. A clever procedural solution was built into the JCPOA. Any participant in the deal can demand that the Security Council vote on a resolution to continue sanctions relief. The U.S. can veto that resolution, so even if the Security Council votes 14-1 all of the previous restrictions on Iran still snap back into place.

The JCPOA was built to respond to Iranian violations, even if Russia and China were no longer aligned with the United States and the EU. It was not designed to withstand a hawkish or isolationist America using its veto power outside of the terms of the deal or against the objections of its European partners.

Ironically, though, if the U.S. does choose to act alone, in the absence of Iranian violations and against the wishes of its allies, it might undermine the substantive goal of UN snapback, leaving empty sanctions on paper.

Once the UN applies – or in this case, re-applies – sanctions, the European Commission and European Union member countries are supposed to take a number of steps to make the UN sanctions part of EU law and regulation. This is serious business for Europe, which is strongly committed to the idea that, as a matter of international law, the UN can impose binding requirements on all members in the interest of international peace and security. The EU has occasionally faced legal challenges in applying UN sanctions, but it never has simply chosen to ignore a binding Security Council resolution as a matter of policy.

Europe would be sorely tempted to do exactly that on Iran. The snap back mechanism is designed for cases of Iranian non-compliance. Under the JCPOA, Washington does not need to prove that Iran has violated the deal, but Europe may decide that American bad faith justifies breaking from its own UN obligations. Certainly, Europe will categorically disagree with the U.S. policy. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, echoing the senior leadership of the UK, France, and Germany, said after Trump’s UN speech that the deal is working and must be preserved. If the U.S. withdraws, the EU has made clear it will do everything within its power to keep the agreement alive by sustaining newly established business ties with Iran.

Europe would thus be faced with a choice between a crime under international law and what it considers to be a policy mistake. In either case, Europe would be justifiably furious about being forced to choose between two important, deeply held policies – adherence to Security Council resolutions and implementation of the JCPOA.

Other countries, including Russia and China, may also prove lax in applying the restored sanctions, but this is both less uncommon and less important to Iran’s economic aspirations. U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA will hurt Iran’s economy badly, but will not achieve the kind of strangulating effect the broad international coalition had before the deal. A deep break between the United States, the UN and Europe will make it much less likely that the U.S. will ever be able to muster such powerful international economic pressure again.

At the UN last week, President Trump called the Iran deal “an embarrassment to the United States.” He teased that he has made a decision about whether to certify Iranian compliance to Congress but refused to tell anyone, including UK Prime Minister Theresa May, what he had decided. The weeks leading to the October 15 certification deadline may be Europe’s last, best chance to explain to President Trump and his advisors that undermining, let alone abrogating, the JCPOA would be a catastrophe not only for the goal of preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons, but also for the bond between the United States and Europe.

PARIS (Reuters) - French investigators are preparing for an intricate operation to repatriate an Air France Airbus A380 passenger jet that was forced to make an emergency landing in Canada after one of its engines came apart in mid-flight, people familiar with the maneuver said.

The Airbus superjumbo diverted to Goose Bay in Labrador on Sept. 30 after one of its four engines exploded over Greenland, sending the front part of the engine including its 3-metre-wide fan into the ice sheet 37,000 feet below.

More than 500 passengers and crew, some of whom had reported a bang and vibration, were picked up on two replacement jets after waiting for hours onboard due to problems in accommodating the world’s largest airliner at the remote military airport.

But the aircraft itself remained stranded while French-led investigators collected evidence and developed a plan for returning it to France.

Making the roughly 2,300 nautical mile (4,260 km) trip will need a switch in engines to help the mammoth jet fly smoothly.

First, the rump of the broken engine will be taken off the wing and flown to Wales, where manufacturer General Electric can examine it at its Cardiff repair workshop, the people said.

Then a spare engine will be mounted on the right wing in the same outer position as the damaged one. But this will only be used to balance the weight during flight and that engine will not be operable.

The people declined to be quoted as the plans have not yet been announced. France’s BEA accident agency declined comment.

The operation to fetch the double-decker jet is not the only challenging errand triggered by the mid-air explosion.

Some parts of the engine were retrieved by helicopter in Greenland on Oct. 6 and dispatched to BEA headquarters in Paris. But investigators still face a tricky search in uncertain weather conditions to try to find other missing elements before they are buried by snow.

Although nobody was injured, the engine break-up has led to what could be a lengthy investigation to ensure other aircraft are not exposed to the risk of damage from high-speed engine debris. Experts say such incidents are very rare, however.

Trump said on Tuesday he would likely sign an executive order this week allowing people to cross state lines to obtain “great, competitive healthcare” that would cost the United States “nothing.”

The Republican president offered no specifics, but several sources familiar with the order said it was expected to be in the form of guidance to the U.S. Health and Human Services, Labor and Treasury Departments, which would be asked to look at ways that individuals and small businesses can band together to form “associations” that would buy large group health plans from states with the fewest regulations.

If the plan were to come to fruition, some healthcare analysts said it would undermine former President Barack Obama’s signature Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, by making it easier for Americans to buy stripped-down health insurance policies on the cheap. Supporters say more people could gain health insurance at a lower cost.

Despite controlling the White House and Congress, Republicans have failed in efforts this year to fulfill their campaign promise to repeal and replace Obamacare, which they say is intrusive and ineffective. Democrats defend the law, saying it has extended health insurance to some 20 million Americans.

Several experts in healthcare and employment law said Trump’s plan could violate the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), a federal law that governs large group plans that must be provided or maintained by employers or employee organizations.

Expanding association plans to market insurance to individuals who are not employees would “not be remotely legal,” said Nicholas Bagley, a professor of healthcare law at the University of Michigan.

ERISA does allow associations to act as employers and manage benefit plans.

But federal regulators have generally interpreted the law to mean that employers in the association must have a common interest beyond buying insurance, said Allison Hoffman, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Law.

“The E in ERISA is employee,” Joseph Antos, a healthcare expert at the American Enterprise Institute, a think tank that has been critical of Obamacare.

“They are going to have to stretch the definition of whether you’re an employee or not,” he said of Trump’s expected plan.

The White House declined to comment.

ENCROACHING ON STATE POWERS?

It is not clear when challenges to a Trump order would be filed. The timing could depend on if and when the Cabinet departments begin taking steps to put the plan in place.

State attorneys general would likely be among the first to legally challenge Trump’s order or regulations that stem from it, said Dania Palanker, an assistant research professor at Georgetown University’s Center on Health Insurance Reforms.

Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said in a statement on Wednesday that her office “will oppose any attempt to undermine” the state’s commitment to ensuring that every resident has access to quality healthcare.

Healey is one of several Democrats who previously sued to block Trump policies, including his proposal to block travel to the United States from six Muslim-majority countries.

In addition to challenging Trump’s healthcare proposal on ERISA grounds, the states could also oppose it on federalist grounds, said Hoffman. She noted that states had primary power to regulate insurance, except where a federal law explicitly says otherwise, as Obamacare does.",Trump healthcare order could face strong legal objections,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-healthcare-lawsuits-analysis/trump-healthcare-order-could-face-strong-legal-objections-idUSKBN1CH0DR

GENEVA (Reuters) - West African migrants trying to reach Europe are dying in far greater numbers in the Sahara than in the Mediterranean but efforts to dissuade them may cause new routes to open up, the United Nations migration agency said on Thursday.

So far this year 2,569 migrant deaths have been recorded in the central Mediterranean, while more than 107,000 migrants, mainly West Africans, have reached Italy.

“One thing we still don’t have is any estimate of number of deaths in the desert,” Richard Danziger, the U.N. International Organization for Migration director for West and Central Africa, told a news conference in Geneva.

“We assume, and I think we have said before, that it has to be at least double those who die in the Mediterranean. But we really have no evidence of that, it’s just an assumption. We just don’t know.”

In Niger, a main transit route, people smugglers were increasingly scared of the authorities, which might make them more prone to abandon migrants in the desert, he said.

Many migrants had told of deaths in the desert, and some said the smugglers believed that if they drove fast through minefields they would be safe, said the IOM’s Niger mission chief, Giuseppe Loprete.

Migrant numbers heading through Niger have fallen dramatically after strong action by the government to close migrant “ghettoes” and arrest people smugglers, he said.

IOM was also trying to spread the word that “you do not want to get caught in Libya,” Danziger said.

“What happens in Libya is far scarier to people than dying, the horror stories that returnees come back with.”

Many of the smugglers did not see themselves as criminals, and were often former desert guides trying to make money. Many of them had given up, while organized criminals with contacts in Libya were continuing, Loprete said.

“Right now they are looking for alternative routes, I think at least equally dangerous,” he said.

“When you plug one hole, other holes are going to open up,” Danziger said.

Niger had two routes to Libya: one closer to Chad that was used to smuggle migrants and one closer to the Algerian border that was far more dangerous and was used by extremist groups and for drugs and gun-running.

An alternative was through northern Mali, a region beset by conflicts between rival groups, but but there did not seem to have been a dramatic rise there, Danziger said.

The route considered the safest was along the western coast of Africa, via Senegal, Mauritania and Morocco to the Strait of Gibraltar, and migrant flows there had increased, he said.",Migrant deaths in the Sahara likely twice Mediterranean toll: U.N.,https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1CH22D

Portugal international Sanches, who signed for the club on loan from Bayern Munich in the close season, picked up the injury in training during the international break.

Clement said the 20-year-old midfielder was awaiting the results of a second scan but did not expect the injury to rule Sanches out for long.

“We have just got one issue from international duty. Renato Sanches is a big doubt for the weekend,” Clement told a news conference on Thursday.

“He picked up a minor thigh strain while training for Portugal which looks like it will rule him out for this weekend,” the manager added.

“Disappointing because with each game he has played for us, he has improved, his fitness is improving but it will be a short term injury.”

Victory can lift Swansea, who have five points from seven games, out of the relegation zone but they have only one win from their last six games against promoted sides.

“All the games are tough - home or away against the teams at the top or lower down,” said Clement. “We feel optimistic our form is going to change.”

Huddersfield began the season with two wins but have failed to collect all three points in the next five.

“When a team comes up from the Championship and it’s their first experience of Premier League football you can have that excitement and play without fear,” Clement said.

“They have had a heavy loss against Tottenham along with some draws. They have plateaued a little bit.”

Huddersfield manager David Wagner said Steve Mounie trained with the first team after recovering from a heel injury and did not rule the forward out from Saturday’s match.

Wagner said Huddersfield were confident going into the clash despite their poor form.

“Now it is all about Swansea and how we can be successful against them,” Wagner told a news conference.

“How can we cause them problems like other sides have done at their home.

(Reuters) - Citigroup Inc’s (C.N) quarterly profit and revenue beat Wall Street expectations as the bank kept a tight lid on costs, booked a gain from an asset sale and saw strength in equity underwriting.

The bank’s trading revenue, despite falling 11 percent, was better than the 15 percent decline Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach forecast three weeks ago.

Trading revenue has cast a dark cloud over bank results. Rival JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) said its trading revenue fell 21 percent.

Citigroup shares were slightly higher at $75 in pre-market trade, while JPMorgan was up at $97.67. Wall Street banks have seen major declines in market trading activity, which was boosted last year on global macroeconomic uncertainty, especially around Brexit and the U.S. presidential election.

The fourth-biggest U.S. bank by assets said on Thursday total revenue rose about 2 percent to $18.17 billion, topping expectations of $17.90 billion. But revenue from fixed-income trading fell 16 percent to $2.88 billion.

There were bright spots as the bank’s much smaller equities trading business saw a 16 percent increase in revenue and investment banking, which includes equity underwriting, rose 14 percent.

Net income rose 7.6 percent to $4.13 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30. Earnings per share rose about 15 percent to $1.42 and trumped analysts’ average estimate of $1.32, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Expenses at the bank were $10.17 billion, 2 percent lower than last year.

Since taking over five years ago, Chief Executive Michael Corbat has been trying to boost shareholder value by cutting expenses, consolidation and buying back stock.

Return on tangible common equity rose to 8.4 percent from 7.8 percent. Corbat’s target for the measure of profitability is 10 percent in 2019 and 14 percent longer term.

Consumer credit is a cause for concern for the bank as Citigroup said its company-wide net credit losses rose 17 percent from a year earlier. It added $194 million to its loan loss reserves.

Total credit costs rose 15 percent to $2 billion.

Citigroup’s tangible book value per share, an accounting measure of net worth, was $68.55 at the end of September, up 6 percent from a year earlier.

(The Sports Xchange) - The Boston Red Sox fired manager John Farrell on Wednesday, two days after his team was eliminated from the playoffs.

Farrell, who managed the Red Sox since 2013, will not return for the 2018 season, president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski announcement. The team said a search for a new manager will begin immediately.

Farrell, 55, was 432-378 (.533) in five seasons, leading the Red Sox to the World Series title in 2013. He was under contract through the end of the 2018 season.

The Red Sox were eliminated from the playoffs on Monday, losing to the Houston Astros 5-4 in Game 4 of the American League Division Series.

Boston finished 93-69 (.574) in 2017 to win its ninth AL East division title. The Red Sox had the third-best record in the American League, tied for fifth best in the majors.

During his Red Sox tenure, Farrell’s teams won three division titles (2013, 2016, 2017). His 432 managerial wins and 810 games managed both rank sixth in club history, and he is the only manager ever to lead the Red Sox to consecutive division titles.

Farrell’s first season in 2013 was highlighted by Boston’s eighth World Series championship.

Farrell began his major league managerial career with the Toronto Blue Jays in 2011, leading the team to a 154-170 record over two seasons. In his seven full seasons as a manager, his clubs went 586-548 (.517).

Farrell’s first professional coaching stint began with Boston in 2007 when he spent four seasons as pitching coach.

The marchers, chanting slogans and brandishing placards, halted traffic as they moved slowly through the streets. A fringe of anarchists broke windows; police responded by firing tear gas. But this was no rerun of the mass marches of past years, let alone the semi-revolutionary eruptions of 1968.

France’s second-largest union, the Conféderation Générale du Travail (CGT) was the only one of the three main workers’ organizations that took part. Another protest, this one organized by the far-left France Insoumise (France Unbowed) party is scheduled for Sept. 23. This week’s marching columns numbered, nationwide, in the few hundred thousand rather than the many millions hoped for – the police claimed 223,000, the organizers 400,000. There was little effect on production, services or transport.

It was neither victory nor defeat for either side. Instead, Macron’s changes to the vast labor code – hiring and firing will be easier, some workplace issues will be negotiated at company level – hang in the balance. The CGT, the left and the far-right National Front all oppose them, but Macron and his government have a solid, if inexperienced, majority in the Assembly.

More than his predecessors who tried and failed to liberalize France’s labor market – the center-right Nicolas Sarkozy and the center-left Francois Hollande – Macron has pinned the credibility of his presidency on systemic, cultural change, a deliberate jolting of French society and economy out of the rut into which he believes it has fallen. He is contemptuous of both former presidents (he knew Hollande well, having been both his advisor and Finance Minister), believing them to have given up too soon and too easily. When Macron spoke, as he did earlier this month, of “slackers,” he said when challenged that he meant those who retreated from the necessary surgery on France’s body politic The marchers, however, seized on the word and put it on their placards: “Macron, the slackers will kick you out,” read one.

The slackers have a point. Indeed, they have several. Labor productivity in France is relatively good, only a little behind that of the United States and the highest of Europe’s major economies. When French workers work, they work well.

Though both Macron’s labor and economic reforms have won support from the center-right and from many economists, France remains doubtful, even hostile. Perhaps the best-known Frenchman in political and intellectual circles before Macron was the economist Thomas Piketty, whose “Capital in the 21st Century” (2013) is a best seller and who has excoriated his country both for its steeply rising inequality and its hypocrisy in pretending it is egalitarian. Hypocritical it may be, but it clings to the myth, and perfectly bourgeois Frenchmen and -women may recoil from an obvious widening of the income and wealth gaps.

To put major emphasis on labor reforms may, in any case, not be the main point. Germany liberalized its labor market through the so-called Hartz reforms between 2003 and 2005, but unlike France the German unions were relatively moderate, wage bargaining was already localized and investment was rising. In addition, the costs of German unification had already been paid.

If France’s CGT and the left/far-right cannot mobilize enough opposition, the labor reforms will be implemented, and they could be part of a general renaissance of the French economy. That is also dependent on other ifs – if the present improvement in the European Union economy continues (the European Commission, while underscoring that all members are growing, warns of “higher-than-usual uncertainty) and if investment increases, then France could become more like Germany. The German (and EU) leader Chancellor Angela Merkel wants to see that, and Macron wishes to show her he can deliver.

Yet delivery of this kind of economy now comes with an apparently unavoidable cost. Faster growth and even a fall in unemployment produces an ever-larger underclass, composed both of those with few qualifications and the still-increasing numbers of immigrants, often from poor countries. Macron’s opponents like to quote the Cambridge University economist Christopher Bickerton, who argued in a New York Times column that “not since the economic boom of the 1950s and ’60s has capitalism in Europe been dynamic enough to combine high levels of employment with long-term material gains for the masses.” It will not do so, he believes, under Macron.

The deeper movement, about which Macron can do little, is that the greater integration into the global economy that he champions produces huge gains for the top one percent, more modest rises for the well educated and skilled, but a much larger tail of the precarious, insecure and low paid. The leftist German think tank, the Rosa Luxemburg Institute, called this trend “the end of social capitalism.” A sign of this is the general decline of social democratic parties such as the once-mighty German Social Democrats and the shrunken French Socialists. Only in the UK has the main left party, Labour, made substantial political gains with a far-left leadership.

Social democracy depended on, and greatly furthered, “social capitalism.” It did so in France, under socialist governments, did so again in Germany and still does, though with difficulty, in the Scandinavian states. Organized labor had a place, even an honored and at times powerful one. Now, its gains are a hindrance, its ideology no longer attractive. The leaders of the further left – such as Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn in the UK and Jean-Luc Melenchon, leader of France Insoumise in France - gain by being fundamentalists, opposed to capitalism itself, social or not.

In moving France towards the globalist model, Macron echoes the claim made nearly four decades ago by British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, that there is no alternative. In this, he may be more right than she: there is presently no popular base, no public assent, no powerful parties able to show that cooperation with capitalism is best for the workers. And that, sooner or later, will be a large problem – for leftists, or course, for the state which must provide some support for the poor and ultimately, for the capitalist system itself.",Commentary: Labor reform in France’s Macron economy,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lloyd-macron-commentary/commentary-labor-reform-in-frances-macron-economy-idUSKCN1BQ2DJ

MADRI/BARCELONA (Reuters) - O primeiro-ministro da Espanha, Mariano Rajoy, deu ao governo da Catalunha nesta quarta-feira oito dias para desistir de sua iniciativa de independência, caso contrário suspenderá a autonomia política da região e a governará diretamente.

A medida pode aprofundar o confronto entre Madri e a região do nordeste espanhol, mas também sinaliza uma saída para a maior crise política do país desde o golpe militar fracassado de 1981.

Rajoy provavelmente convocaria uma eleição regional antecipada depois de acionar o artigo 155 da Constituição, que lhe permitiria demitir o governo regional catalão.

O líder catalão, Carles Puigdemont, emitiu uma declaração de independência simbólica na noite de terça-feira, mas imediatamente a suspendeu e pediu negociações com Madri.

“O gabinete concordou nesta manhã em requerer formalmente ao governo catalão que confirme se declarou a independência da Catalunha, independentemente da confusão deliberada criada com sua entrada em vigor”, disse Rajoy em um discurso televisionado depois de uma reunião de gabinete convocada para estudar a resposta do governo central.

Mais tarde ele disse ao Parlamento espanhol que o governo da Catalunha tem até as 10h locais da segunda-feira que vem para responder. Se Puigdemont confirmar que declarou a independência, terá até as 10h do dia 19 de outubro para retificar a ação. Sem isso, o artigo 155 será acionado.

Ainda não ficou claro se o governo catalão responderá à exigência, mas agora ele enfrenta um dilema, dizem analistas.

Se Puigdemont disser que proclamou a separação, Madri intervirá. Se disser que não o fez, o partido de extrema-esquerda CUP provavelmente retirará seu apoio ao governo de minoria do líder.

“Rajoy tem dois objetivos: se Puigdemont continuar ambíguo, o movimento pró-independência ficará mais fragmentado; se Puigdemont insistir em defender a independência, Rajoy poderá aplicar o artigo 155”, disse Antonio Barroso, vice-diretor da empresa de pesquisa Teneo Intelligence, sediada em Londres.

As apostas são altas, já que perder a Catalunha, que tem língua e cultura próprias, privaria a Espanha de um quinto de sua produção econômica e mais de um quarto de suas exportações.

Era grande a expectativa de que Puigdemont declararia a independência catalã unilateralmente na terça-feira, depois de o governo regional dizer que 90 por cento dos catalães votaram pela secessão em um referendo de 1ª de outubro. As autoridades de Madri declararam a consulta ilegal e a maioria dos adversários da separação a boicotou, reduzindo o comparecimento a cerca de 43 por cento.

Um porta-voz do governo catalão em Barcelona disse nesta quarta-feira que, se Madri acionar o artigo 155, a região seguirá em frente com medidas visando a criação de um Estado próprio.",Espanha dá 8 dias para líder catalão desistir de independência,https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idBRKBN1CG2OO-OBRWD

With Radar, BlackBerry enables customers to track trailers across country, and drivers can quickly locate vacant trailers scattered across vast parking lots.
On its last earnings call, the company named Trailer Wizards, a Canadian trailer rental and storage company with 25,000 trailers, as its third Radar customer.
Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.
“Its future earnings growth as a software company is only starting to be understood,” said Rivett.","BOLTON, Ontario (Reuters) - A visit to trucking firm Titanium Transportation helps explain why BlackBerry’s stock is once again a darling in Canadian markets, having soared 70 percent in two months.

Nestled in an industrial area some 50 kilometers north of Toronto, the trucker is an early adopter of a new BlackBerry fleet-tracking service known as Radar, which uses $400 boxes to collect and transmit information on movement, temperature and physical contents of Titanium’s 1,300 truck trailers.

Efficiency gains tied to Radar should allow Titanium to get maximum utilization of its fleet, positioning it to cut the number of trailers by five percent and also reduce labor costs, company executive Marilyn Daniel told Reuters.

“Time is everything in our world,” she said. “Being able to tell a driver where exactly a trailer is as opposed to having a driver search through a yard for sometimes hours has been a definite improvement.”

Radar is emblematic of BlackBerry Chief Executive John Chen’s strategy for turning around the Canadian icon, by steering the company away from consumer electronics and back to its roots of selling products to businesses.

Beyond Radar, BlackBerry is also betting on other types of software for industrial customers. It is leveraging its QNX subsidiary’s software foothold deep inside car infotainment consoles to expand into self-driving technology, while promoting its cyber-security software and services to thwart increased threats from hacking.

BlackBerry’s stock rallied after it showed signs of progress in quarterly earnings results at the end of March, followed by news in April of a nearly $1 billion cash windfall from arbitration with Qualcomm expected to fund future investments in growth. That comes in the face of an expected revenue decline to below $1 billion this year for the first time since 2004. At its smartphone peak, BlackBerry had annual sales of $20 billion.

Among the recent BlackBerry bulls are institutional investors such as Nokota Management, which took a new position with almost 4.8 million shares in the first quarter, and Oppenheimer Funds, which added 3.3 million more shares to its existing 4 million share stake, according to U.S. securities filings.

Iridian Asset Management and Connor, Clark & Lunn Investment Management, two of BlackBerry’s biggest shareholders, each raised their stakes by around a quarter as of the end of March.

Nokota did not respond to requests for comment, while the others all declined to discuss their stakes in BlackBerry.

“HOPE AND PROMISE”

The strategy is not without risks. BlackBerry faces challenges entering the telematics market, where analysts say rivals include Omnitracs, Teletrac Navman [VCRCPM.UL], Tomtom NV, Trimble Inc and U.S. telecommunications giant Verizon Communications Inc. Verizon last year paid some $2.4 billion to buy GPS vehicle tracking firm Fleetmatics Group Plc.

Radar “is not a unique and earth-shattering product,” said Nicholas Farhi, a partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants who advises companies on optimizing logistics operations.

That’s why some investors advise caution, saying it is too soon to figure out how to properly value the new BlackBerry offerings.

“It’s not the type of situation you can justify from a valuation standpoint,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management, which manages more than $1.5 billion and exited the stock a decade ago, when BlackBerry phones were still dominant. “It is all about hope and promise.”

And yet hope and promise among BlackBerry investors were hard to come by in the aftermath of Apple and Samsung walking away with the consumer hand-held phone business.

Since taking the company’s helm in 2013 to attempt a turnaround, Chen has turned to technology products used inside automobiles and corporate cyber security services, in addition to targeting the gritty trucking industry with Radar.

He also bolstered the company’s ability to manage rival devices in the workforce - still the single largest contributor to sales - with the purchase of rival Good Technology in 2015. And he outsourced production of handsets last year, meaning the company receives a cut from any devices sold by its partners rather than carrying the risk and revenue on its own books.

With Radar, BlackBerry enables customers to track trailers across country, and drivers can quickly locate vacant trailers scattered across vast parking lots. Previously, where drivers had to walk around those lots, banging on trailers in search of a hollow sound indicating it was empty.

BlackBerry charges $10 to $20 per month for every trailer connected to Radar, a product that an analyst at investment bank Macquarie says could play a pivotal role in a more than doubling of BlackBerry’s sales by 2020.

Sandeep Chennakeshu, president of the BlackBerry Technology Solutions unit that oversees Radar, told Reuters that large package delivery firms and big carriers of lumber and home goods are among the more than 50 companies testing it.

“It really depends on us convincing our customers to try our solution,” he said. “Once they try it, we’re very confident they’ll see the benefit.”

BlackBerry says that it is targeting some 16 million to 20 million trailers, chassis, vans, refrigerated units and piece of construction equipment for the Radar service, with a new variant on the hardware due to launch later this year.

On its last earnings call, the company named Trailer Wizards, a Canadian trailer rental and storage company with 25,000 trailers, as its third Radar customer.

AT&T will supply needed cellular connections for Radar in North America, and a second carrier is lined up to provide such services when it expands to Europe and Asia, Chennakeshu said.

The company expands Radar’s functionality with quarterly updates. The next one will tell customers if a trailer is a quarter, half or three-quarters full and improve integration with warehouse inventory management systems, he said.

The Radar boxes can send alerts when a trailer door is opened, its internal temperature goes beyond a set range, has been emptied or travels through a specific geography, features which Chennakeshu said are attractive for tightly-regulated movers including pharmaceutical companies.

Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.

Macquarie analyst Gus Papageorgiou is even more bullish, saying combined hardware sales and subscription fees could hit $540 million in fiscal 2020.

“The best is yet to come for BlackBerry,” said Paul Rivett, president of Fairfax Financial, the company’s second largest shareholder and owner of BlackBerry debt that can be converted into shares at $10 a piece in late 2020.

“Its future earnings growth as a software company is only starting to be understood,” said Rivett.",Born-again BlackBerry: Canadian icon hopes to ride trucks to growth,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blackberry-recovery/born-again-blackberry-canadian-icon-hopes-to-ride-trucks-to-growth-idUSKBN1901P1

(Reuters) - Leicester City’s Jamie Vardy has fully recovered from his niggling hip injury and is fit to face West Bromwich Albion in the Premier League on Monday, manager Craig Shakespeare has said.

The striker was injured in last month’s 1-1 draw at Huddersfield but played in Leicester’s next two matches with the help of pain-killing injections.

Vardy did not feature for England in their recent World Cup qualifiers, but Shakespeare said that he looked sharp in training this week.

“Vardy has fully recovered from his hip problem,” Shakespeare told a news conference on Thursday. “He had injections and was given time away. There’s no ill effects.”

The 30-year-old has been Leicester’s top scorer in the past two seasons and has already found the net five times in seven games despite Leicester’s slow start to the campaign.

Leicester are just above the relegation zone with five points from seven games and last won against Brighton and Hove Albion in the second round of league fixtures in August.

“We want to be consistent, whether we’re playing the top teams or the teams in and around us. We’ll focus on West Brom,” the manager said.

Shakespeare said Wilfred Ndidi was fit after he appeared to injure his hamstring on international duty with Nigeria while Ben Chilwell is also in contention after missing England under 21 duty with a knock.

“There was a scare about Ndidi, but it was only cramp and he trained today fully. He’s fine so there’s no problems there.”

YANGON (Reuters) - Rohingya Muslims are not native to Myanmar, the army chief told the U.S. ambassador in a meeting in which he apparently did not address accusations of abuses by his men and said media was complicit in exaggerating the number of refugees fleeing.

The U.N. human rights office said on Wednesday Myanmar forces had brutally driven out half a million Rohingya from northern Rakhine state to Bangladesh in recent weeks, torching homes, crops and villages to prevent them from returning.

Thousands of Rohingya were leaving the state on Thursday, aiming to reach Bangladesh by boat, citing a shortage of food and fear of repression, residents said. A Myanmar official said people were leaving but he dismissed the suggestion hunger and intimidation were factors.

The army chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, gave his most extensive account of the Rohingya refugee crisis aimed at an international audience in the meeting with Ambassador Scot Marciel, according to a report posted on his Facebook page.

The general is the most powerful person in Buddhist-majority Myanmar and his apparently uncompromising stance would indicate little sensitivity about the military’s image over a crisis that has drawn international condemnation and raised questions about a transition to democracy under Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.

The military campaign is popular in Myanmar, where there is little sympathy for the mostly stateless Rohingya, and where Buddhist nationalism has surged.

Min Aung Hlaing, referring to Rohingya by the term “Bengali”, which they regard as derogatory, said British colonialists were responsible for the problem.

“The Bengalis were not taken into the country by Myanmar, but by the colonialists,” he told Marciel, according to the account of the meeting posted on Thursday.

“They are not the natives.”

Coordinated Rohingya insurgent attacks on some 30 security posts on Aug. 25 sparked a ferocious military response.

The U.N. rights office said in its report, based on 65 interviews with Rohingya who had arrived in Bangladesh, that abuses had begun before the Aug. 25 attacks and included killings, torture and rape of children.

U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley last month denounced a “brutal, sustained campaign to cleanse the country of an ethnic minority” and called on countries to suspend providing weapons to Myanmar until its military put sufficient accountability measures in place.

The European Union and the United States are considering targeted sanctions against Myanmar’s military leaders, officials familiar with the discussions said this week.

Suu Kyi was swept into office last year after winning an election, but the military holds immense power, including exclusive say over security.

‘FEEL INSECURE’

U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra‘ad al-Hussein has described the government operations as “a textbook example of ethnic cleansing” and said the action appeared to be “a cynical ploy to forcibly transfer large numbers of people without possibility of return”.

Min Aung Hlaing did not refer to such accusations, according to the published account, but said the insurgents had killed 90 Hindus and 30 Rohingya linked to the government.

Insurgent opposition to a citizenship verification campaign, which used the term Bengali, was behind the Aug. 25 attacks that sparked the violence, he said.

“Local Bengalis were involved in the attacks under the leadership of ARSA. That is why they might have fled as they feel insecure,” he said, referring to the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army insurgents.

“The native place of Bengalis is really Bengal,” he said.

He said it was an exaggeration to say a “very large” number were fleeing to Bangladesh and there had been “instigation and propaganda by using the media from behind the scene”.

He did not elaborate but said the “real situation” had to be relayed to the international community. U.N. political affairs chief Jeffrey Feltman is due to visit on Friday.

Rohingya residents of Rakhine said up to 10,000 people had left on Wednesday and Thursday.

One resident, a teacher, said there had been no military offensive recently but people were going.

“There’s no work, nowhere to get food and the government isn’t helping,” said the teacher, who, like the first resident, declined to be identified.

Rakhine state’s secretary, Tin Maung Swe, said people were leaving “every day” to join relatives already in Bangladesh.

”Nobody is starving in death in Myanmar. The government is trying to support those in need,“ he said. ”They can fish or catch shrimps in the creeks near their villages.

“No one’s killing them or intimidating them.”

Suu Kyi, in a televised address, spoke about the importance of humanitarian assistance for all people in Rakhine and said the government would accept refugees back.

She said aid groups, international organizations and Myanmar expatriates would help with the long-term development of the state. She did not refer to accusations of rights abuses by the army.","Myanmar army chief says Rohingya Muslims 'not natives,' numbers fleeing exaggerated",https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1CH0HG

O plano havia sido aprovado na semana passada pelo Conselho de Administração da companhia e prevê aportes de pelo menos 9 bilhões de reais na companhia. A proposta deverá ser analisada por milhares de credores reunidos em assembleia marcada para 23 de outubro, com uma segunda convocação prevista para 27 de novembro. Se não houver aprovação, a falência da empresa poderá ser decretada.

O processo de recuperação judicial da Oi, iniciado em junho de 2016, é o maior da história do país. A empresa, que foi eleita pelos governos petistas como uma “campeã nacional” e tentou uma fracassada fusão com a Portugal Telecom, listou dívidas de mais de 65 bilhões de reais e cerca de 55 mil credores.

Dos 9 bilhões de reais da capitalização, cerca de 6 bilhões equivalem a dinheiro novo, sendo 3,5 bilhões de reais por parte dos detentores de títulos de dívida da Oi e 2,5 bilhões dos atuais acionistas. Os 3 bilhões de reais restantes poderão vir de conversão de debêntures em ações, segundo o plano.

O limite da conversão das debêntures é de 15 (até 119 milhões de ações) a 25 por cento (até 225 milhões de papéis), dependendo da opção de juros e do prazo a serem adotados pelos principais detentores de bônus da empresa. No início deste mês estes credores manifestaram interesse de troca de 26 bilhões de reais em dívidas da Oi por 88 por cento do capital da operadora.

No caso da opção que prevê conversão de 15 por cento, a taxa de juros é de 10 por cento ao ano e o prazo é de zero a 12 meses, na alternativa de 25 por cento, os juros propostos são de 6 por cento, com a troca efetiva ocorrendo após 24 meses, segundo o plano.

O plano apresentado no início do ano previa 3,9 bilhões de reais em bônus conversíveis a partir do 36º mês, com a troca sendo equivalente a 17 por cento do capital, e juros de 6 por cento ao ano.

Além disso, o novo plano prevê dividendos a serem distribuídos apenas após seis anos, e após isso caso o índice de dívida líquida sobre Ebitda seja inferior a 2 vezes e enquanto houver créditos remanescentes da reestruturação. Anteriormente, a proposta previa distribuição de dividendos apenas caso a alavancagem ficasse abaixo de 2,5 vezes.

INVESTIMENTOS

A Oi reafirmou que o aumento de capital permitirá à empresa elevar investimentos de 5 bilhões para 7 bilhões de reais por ano nos próximos três anos. Isso permitiria à empresa competir em melhores condições com grupos internacionais como Telefónica, América Móvil e Telecom Italia, que operam no Brasil por meio das marcas Vivo, Claro e TIM.

O plano protocolado na Justiça prevê a negociação da dívida de mais de 10 bilhões e reais devida à Agência Nacional de Telecomunicações (Anatel) por meio de dois caminhos: negociação de acordos (TACs) para conversão de multas em investimentos e parcelamento em até 20 anos, com correção pelo IPCA, com entrada de 20 por cento, deduzido de depósitos judiciais. Essa solução mista havia sido antecipada na semana passada à Reuters por fontes envolvidas nas negociações.

Representantes da Anatel não puderam ser encontrados para comentar a proposta.

SOCORRO FEDERAL

Nesta semana, o governo federal criou um grupo de trabalho, liderado pela Advocacia-Geral da União (AGU) para buscar solução para as dívidas da Oi com entidades públicas, como as multas da Anatel. A Oi é responsável por cerca de 30 por cento dos serviços de telecomunicações utilizados pelo governo federal.

A orientação que partiu do Palácio do Planalto é buscar uma saída que evite a necessidade de intervenção na companhia.

Falando a jornalistas na terça-feira, após reunião com o ministro da Fazenda, Henrique Meirelles, para tratar do assunto, a ministra da AGU, Grace Mendonça, disse que o governo vai analisar todos os cenários, desde que tenham sustentação jurídica, para tentar buscar uma solução.

Ela não descartou medidas como o enquadramento de parte da dívida de mais de 10 bilhões de reais da Oi com a Anatel nas regras de financiamento previstas na Medida Provisória 780, o chamado Refis das autarquias.

Haveria ainda a possibilidade de negociar um acordo para conversão de parte das multas recebidas pela operadora em investimentos, algo já mencionado no plano entregue nesta quarta-feira. A ministra também não descartou alongamento de prazos para pagamento das dívidas, como pretendido pela Oi no plano.","Oi entrega à Justiça plano de recuperação, limita conversão a 25% do capital",https://www.reuters.com/article/internetNews/idBRKBN1CH038-OBRIN

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) faces an antitrust fine in Taiwan, the latest in a years-long streak of regulatory setbacks to its business model that comes as it also fights U.S. regulators and iPhone maker Apple Inc (AAPL.O) in court over many of the same legal issues.

The Taiwan Fair Trade Commission said on Wednesday it would fine Qualcomm T$23.4 billion ($774.14 million) for anti-trust violations of its chip technology.

The Commission said in a Chinese-language statement that Qualcomm had a monopoly over the chip market for several so-called modem technologies, which provide wireless data connectivity for mobile phones, and refused to license its technology to other industry players.

In Taiwan, Qualcomm is required to submit a progress report on the matter every six months to the Commission on negotiations with related parties.

In a statement, Qualcomm said it disagreed with the decision. Once the final decision is issued in the coming weeks, Qualcomm said it will challenge the decision in court.

“The fine bears no rational relationship to the amount of Qualcomm’s revenues or activities in Taiwan, and Qualcomm will appeal the amount of the fine and the method used to calculate it,” Qualcomm said.

The Taiwanese decision is the latest challenge to Qualcomm’s business model, which involves selling chips and also licensing a suite of patents related to how those chips are put into a phone to provide mobile data to the device. While the regulatory and legal attacks differ in some details, a key theme is the allegation that Qualcomm uses its dominant position in the market for modem chips to charge unfair royalty rates for its patents.

Last December, Korean regulators fined Qualcomm $854 million for violating its competition laws, a ruling that followed an $975 million fine from Chinese regulators in 2015.

European regulators have also expressed antitrust concerns over Qualcomm’s $38 billion bid to buy NXP Semiconductors (NXPI.O).

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is also suing Qualcomm over its licensing practices.

Those regulatory challenges are playing out as Apple is waging a global legal battle on Qualcomm’s long-held practice of charging a percentage of the total price of iPhones and other Apple devices as a licensing fee for its patents.

After those lawsuits were filed, Qualcomm brought an action against Apple before the U.S. International Trade Commission seeking to ban imports of some iPhones.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump finds himself under immense pressure as he considers de-certifying the international nuclear deal with Iran, a move that would ignore warnings from inside and outside his administration that to do so would risk undermining U.S. credibility.

Trump is expected to unveil a broad strategy on confronting Iran this week, likely on Friday. There was always the chance he could still have a last-minute change of heart and certify Iran’s compliance with the 2015 accord, which he has called an “embarrassment” and the “worst deal ever negotiated.”

Senior U.S. officials, European allies and prominent U.S. lawmakers have told Trump that refusing to certify the deal would leave the U.S. isolated, concede the diplomatic high ground to Tehran, and ultimately risk the unraveling of the agreement.

Signed by the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China, the European Union and Iran, the deal relieved sanctions on Tehran in exchange for curbing its disputed nuclear program.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) concluded that Iran secretly researched a nuclear warhead until 2009, which Tehran denies. Iran has always insisted that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes and denies it has aimed to build an atomic bomb.

After Trump made clear three months ago he would not certify Iran’s compliance with the deal, his advisers moved to give him options to consider, a senior administration official said.

“They came up with a plan that protects the things they are concerned about but doesn’t recertify, which the president made clear he was not going to do. That ship has sailed,” according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

The official said Trump has been telling foreign leaders and U.S. lawmakers that his refusal to certify the Iran deal would not blow it up.

“He’s not walking away from it. The chances of him walking away from it go down if they work with him on making it better,” the official said.

White House officials said Trump is expected to announce a broad, more confrontational policy toward Iran directed at curbing its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and financial and military support for Hezbollah and other extremist groups.

Trump has said he believes the nuclear deal is too generous toward Iran and would not stop it from trying to develop a nuclear weapon.

He has criticized the agreement’s “sunset clauses,” under which some restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program would expire over time. He also wants to toughen language on ballistic missiles and inspections. The International Atomic Energy Agency says Iran is complying with the agreement.

NO RENEGOTIATION

FILE PHOTO: A security personnel stands in front of the Mahshahr petrochemical plant in Khuzestan province,1032 km (641 miles) southwest of Tehran, September 28, 2011. REUTERS/Raheb Homavandi/File Photo

European officials have categorically ruled out renegotiating the deal, but have said they share Trump’s concerns over Iran’s destabilizing influence in the Middle East.

Several diplomats have said Europe would be ready to discuss sanctioning Iran’s ballistic missile tests and forming a strategy to curb Iran’s influence in the region.

Officials have also said there could be room to open a new negotiation for what happens once some of the core terms of the deal begin expiring in 2025, although there is no reason to believe Iran would be ready to enter in such a negotiation. Iran has said it may exit the deal if the U.S. withdraws.

De-certifying would not withdraw the United States from the deal but it would give the U.S. Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose the sanctions on Tehran that were suspended under the agreement.

One U.S. official involved in administration said that declining to certify Iran’s compliance would probably leave all of the parties to the deal on one side and the United States on the other.

“That means that while the French and others are also interested in curbing Iran’s destabilizing activities, they may be less likely to follow (the U.S.) lead at the risk of the agreement blowing up,” the official said.

British Prime Minister Theresa May and French President Emmanuel Macron both spoke to Trump this week to express their concerns about the potential decision not to recertify the Iran deal.

“If the feeling is that the United States no longer supports the agreement, then the political reality is that the agreement will be in serious jeopardy and its implementation will be very difficult,” a senior French diplomat said.

Two other U.S. officials, who also requested anonymity, said Trump’s bellicose rhetoric on a number of fronts is troubling both many of his own aides and some of America’s closest allies, a few of whom have asked U.S. officials privately if Trump’s real objective is attacking Iran’s nuclear facilities.

One of the officials said that like the heated rhetoric with North Korea on its nuclear program, the Iran discussion has vexed White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson “who have tried to advise the President that there are significant risks in the course he’d prefer to pursue.”

“At the end of the day, though, everyone recognizes that he’s the decider.”

Trump allies who oppose the deal have watched the president closely to see if he might buckle under pressure.

“He’s not going to re-certify,” said Sebastian Gorka, a former Trump national security aide. “I‘m not worried. His gut instinct is absolutely right.”",Trump resists pressure to soften stance on Iran nuclear deal,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-trump/trump-resists-pressure-to-soften-stance-on-iran-nuclear-deal-idUSKBN1CH01D

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump finds himself under immense pressure as he considers de-certifying the international nuclear deal with Iran, a move that would ignore warnings from inside and outside his administration that to do so would risk undermining U.S. credibility.

Trump is expected to unveil a broad strategy on confronting Iran this week, likely on Friday. There was always the chance he could still have a last-minute change of heart and certify Iran’s compliance with the 2015 accord, which he has called an “embarrassment” and the “worst deal ever negotiated.”

Senior U.S. officials, European allies and prominent U.S. lawmakers have told Trump that refusing to certify the deal would leave the U.S. isolated, concede the diplomatic high ground to Tehran, and ultimately risk the unraveling of the agreement.

Signed by the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China, the European Union and Iran, the deal relieved sanctions on Tehran in exchange for curbing its disputed nuclear program.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) concluded that Iran secretly researched a nuclear warhead until 2009, which Tehran denies. Iran has always insisted that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes and denies it has aimed to build an atomic bomb.

After Trump made clear three months ago he would not certify Iran’s compliance with the deal, his advisers moved to give him options to consider, a senior administration official said.

“They came up with a plan that protects the things they are concerned about but doesn’t recertify, which the president made clear he was not going to do. That ship has sailed,” according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

The official said Trump has been telling foreign leaders and U.S. lawmakers that his refusal to certify the Iran deal would not blow it up.

“He’s not walking away from it. The chances of him walking away from it go down if they work with him on making it better,” the official said.

White House officials said Trump is expected to announce a broad, more confrontational policy toward Iran directed at curbing its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and financial and military support for Hezbollah and other extremist groups.

Trump has said he believes the nuclear deal is too generous toward Iran and would not stop it from trying to develop a nuclear weapon.

He has criticized the agreement’s “sunset clauses,” under which some restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program would expire over time. He also wants to toughen language on ballistic missiles and inspections. The International Atomic Energy Agency says Iran is complying with the agreement.

NO RENEGOTIATION

European officials have categorically ruled out renegotiating the deal, but have said they share Trump’s concerns over Iran’s destabilizing influence in the Middle East.

Several diplomats have said Europe would be ready to discuss sanctioning Iran’s ballistic missile tests and forming a strategy to curb Iran’s influence in the region.

Officials have also said there could be room to open a new negotiation for what happens once some of the core terms of the deal begin expiring in 2025, although there is no reason to believe Iran would be ready to enter in such a negotiation. Iran has said it may exit the deal if the U.S. withdraws.

De-certifying would not withdraw the United States from the deal but it would give the U.S. Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose the sanctions on Tehran that were suspended under the agreement.

One U.S. official involved in administration said that declining to certify Iran’s compliance would probably leave all of the parties to the deal on one side and the United States on the other.

“That means that while the French and others are also interested in curbing Iran’s destabilizing activities, they may be less likely to follow (the U.S.) lead at the risk of the agreement blowing up,” the official said.

British Prime Minister Theresa May and French President Emmanuel Macron both spoke to Trump this week to express their concerns about the potential decision not to recertify the Iran deal.

“If the feeling is that the United States no longer supports the agreement, then the political reality is that the agreement will be in serious jeopardy and its implementation will be very difficult,” a senior French diplomat said.

Two other U.S. officials, who also requested anonymity, said Trump’s bellicose rhetoric on a number of fronts is troubling both many of his own aides and some of America’s closest allies, a few of whom have asked U.S. officials privately if Trump’s real objective is attacking Iran’s nuclear facilities.

One of the officials said that like the heated rhetoric with North Korea on its nuclear program, the Iran discussion has vexed White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson “who have tried to advise the President that there are significant risks in the course he’d prefer to pursue.”

“At the end of the day, though, everyone recognizes that he’s the decider.”

Trump allies who oppose the deal have watched the president closely to see if he might buckle under pressure.

“He’s not going to re-certify,” said Sebastian Gorka, a former Trump national security aide. “I‘m not worried. His gut instinct is absolutely right.”",Trump resists pressure to soften stance on Iran nuclear deal,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-iran-nuclear-trump/trump-resists-pressure-to-soften-stance-on-iran-nuclear-deal-idUKKBN1CH01B

LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin smashed through the $5,000 barrier for the first time on Thursday, jumping as much as 8 percent on the day as investors shrugged off the latest warnings on the risks of buying into the booming cryptocurrency market.

Bitcoin, the biggest and best-known cryptocurrency, has chalked up a more than fivefold increase in price this year.

Typically for bitcoin, which at less than nine years old is still highly volatile and illiquid compared with traditional currencies and assets, the precise reason for its recent tear was unclear.

Upcoming splits in its software, reports that Goldman Sachs is considering offering bitcoin trading, rumors that China could ease restrictions, and even a political crisis in Spain’s Catalonia region were all cited by market-watchers as reasons for the rally.

But the main factor could simply be demand from investors wanting ‘in’ on a market that has provided gains exceeding those of any other currency in every year bar one since 2010.

“People are just wanting to be part of it,” said Ryan Nettles, head of FX trading and market strategy at Swiss bank Swissquote, which launched bitcoin trading two months ago. Nettles said interest had been much higher than anticipated and has come from banks, hedge funds and brokers.

“The interest really stems from the media hype,” he added.

On Wednesday Russian President Vladimir Putin warned of the “serious risks” surrounding the nascent market, while Russia’s central bank said it would ban cryptocurrency trading websites.

But that was not enough to put investors off, with bitcoin rallying around 10 percent since then.

Data released last week from SEMrush, a search engine data analytics firm, found the price had a 91 percent correlation with Google searches on bitcoin, suggesting that all news -- whether negative or positive -- drives up demand, even if bad news can have a temporary negative effect.

Bitcoin almost reached $5,000 at the start of September, but fell back sharply after the head of Goldman Sachs blasted the cryptocurrency as a “fraud” and as China forced exchanges to close down, sparking fears of a broader crackdown.

But after dipping below $3,000 in mid-September, bitcoin has leapt in value by more than 75 percent in four weeks.

“Bitcoin was designed to operate outside of the influence of governments and central banks, and is doing exactly that,” said Iqbal Gandham, Managing Director at retail trading app eToro, which has seen huge increases in cryptocurrency trading volumes.

CRYPTO-RIVALS ALSO RALLY

By 1245 GMT, bitcoin was trading up 8 percent on the day around $5,200 on Luxembourg-based exchange Bitstamp.

Though there have been many warnings about a bitcoin “bubble”, including from European Central Bank Deputy Governor Vitor Constancio, some say it has much further to climb. But determining its value is difficult.

“For most currencies there are several accepted methodologies for estimating relative value, normally based on macroeconomic fundamentals,” said EFG Asset Management’s Global Head of Research, Daniel Murray. “For bitcoin no such fundamentals exist.”

Other cryptocurrencies -- whose prices tend to be highly correlated to bitcoin -- also rallied. Their total value -- or market capitalization -- climbed above $160 billion for the first time since early September, according to industry website Coinmarketcap.com.

Two upcoming “forks” in the bitcoin software code, which will create rival clones of the cryptocurrency, were seen by some as a reason for the rise in price, which saw a boost after the “Bitcoin Cash” clone was created at the start of August.

“Investors are seeing the lessons of history in the up-and-coming forks and hoping for an extra dividend,” said Charles Hayter, co-founder of data analysis website Cryptocompare, adding that rumors on online forums that China could reopen exchanges could also be affecting the price.","Bitcoin rockets above $5,000 to all-time high",https://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCAKBN1CH0YQ-OCATC

The draft 2018 budget would mainly affect large cars weighing more than two tonnes, it said. Norwegian media dubbed the changes a “Tesla Tax”, intended to cut down on sales of luxury models such as Tesla’s Model X sport utility vehicle.

The proposal would change an exemption from motor vehicle registration tax and discounts in taxation of company cars. Norwegian media estimated it could push up the price of a Tesla Model X by 70,000 Norwegian crowns ($8,850).

“Electric cars will still be accorded significant advantages in comparison with cars running on fossil fuels,” the proposal said. It keeps in place breaks from value-added tax and benefits for zero carbon pollution.

Twenty-nine percent of all new car registrations in Norway were fully electric or plug-in hybrids last year, according to the International Energy Agency, far ahead of the second-place Netherlands, with 6.4 percent, and Sweden in third, on 3.4.

“Norway is gambling with the electric car market,” Petter Haugneland of the Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association told Reuters.

Sales of Teslas rose almost 90 percent to 4,717 cars in the first nine months of the year from 2,500 in the same period of 2016, according to official sales statistics. Other carmakers, from Nissan to Volkswagen, have also had rising sales.

Environment Minister Vidar Helgesen has said that large electric cars wear out the roads just as much as normal cars. And electric car subsidies in Norway were originally introduced to encourage small, domestically produced electric cars, rather than luxury imports for the rich.

The minority government will need backing from other parties for its proposal.

“This movie is about just breaking free of the forms and rules, and so I got to break free from what we thought Hulk was to a slightly more fleshed-out character,” he said.

Executives at the largest U.S. bank touted the diverse mix of businesses that allow JPMorgan to weather a dip in one area or another, and downplayed a 27 percent drop in bond trading revenue even though weakness has continued into the fourth quarter.

Overall, JPMorgan’s profit rose 7.1 percent in the third quarter compared with the year-ago period, to $6.73 billion, or $1.76 per share. Analysts had expected earnings of $1.65 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The bank’s total revenue of $25.33 billion also topped the average analyst estimate of $25.23 billion.

In early notes to clients, analysts characterized the results as “solid” or “pretty good,” given problems in bond trading that have affected Wall Street banks for some time.

“The results were solid but not exceptional,” said Morningstar analyst Jim Sinegal.

JPMorgan shares were down 0.4 percent at $96.48 in morning trading.

Growth in credit cards, auto loans, commercial banking and corporate advisory fees drove the results, with average core loans up 7 percent during the quarter. JPMorgan’s net interest income, or the difference between what it pays for funds and collects from lending them out, rose 10 percent.

However, markets revenue fell 21 percent as the slump in bond trading outweighed a more modest dip in equities, slightly worse than the roughly 20 percent drop Chief Executive Jamie Dimon had forecast at an event in September.

Wall Street banks have been grappling with bond market challenges for most of the past seven years, as client volumes have been depressed for a number of reasons and new regulations have restricted certain activities and made trading more expensive.

JPMorgan fared worse last quarter than rival Citigroup Inc (C.N), which reported a 16 percent decline in bond trading on Thursday. The trends bode poorly for Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), which has struggled more in bond trading recently than other Wall Street banks.

JPMorgan’s markets revenue is likely to drop again in the fourth quarter because the year-ago period was strong, Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said on a conference call with analysts.

Trading revenue during the fourth quarter of 2016 benefited from a surge in trading activity following the U.S. election.

Still, management maintained earlier guidance for full-year net interest income, expenses, charge-offs and loan growth, indicating that they expect JPMorgan’s other businesses to continue to offset capital markets pain.

During a call with reporters, Lake cited “the benefits of diversification and scale,” while Daniel Pinto, who runs JPMorgan’s investment bank, pointed to “balanced strength across diverse businesses” in a memo to employees.",Loan growth helps JPMorgan beat expectations despite trading decline,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-jpmorgan-results/loan-growth-helps-jpmorgan-beat-expectations-despite-trading-decline-idUSKBN1CH1GW?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

LONDON (Reuters) - HSBC (HSBA.L) has chosen John Flint as its next chief executive, with its newly arrived chairman promoting an insider to drive revenue growth at Europe’s biggest bank.

Flint, who runs HSBC’s retail and wealth management business out of London, will take over as CEO in February next year when Stuart Gulliver, 58, retires after seven years in the job.

The appointment is the first major decision taken by former AIA Group (1299.HK) chief Mark Tucker, who officially took up his post at HSBC just 12 days ago as its first externally-appointed chairman.

Flint, who is not related to Tucker’s predecessor Douglas Flint, is viewed by other HSBC executives as the safe option, having worked at the bank since 1989.

During his career at HSBC Flint, 49, has worked across most of its businesses and spent his first 14 years in Asia, giving him the breadth of experience seen as vital for the CEO role.

“He has a great understanding and regard for HSBC’s heritage, and the passion to build the bank for the next generation,” Tucker said in a statement.

Flint emerged as the forerunner in the past six months as expectations HSBC could appoint its first external CEO in its 150-year history waned on the back of a rally in its share price.

The bank’s stock is up 14 percent so far this year, though was little moved on Thursday following the announcement of Flint’s appointment.

“It’s good news - it’s important to mix an insider with the new outside chairman and continue on the path set by the current team,” said Hugh Young, head of Asia at Standard Life Aberdeen, one of the bank’s top ten shareholders.

PUSH FOR GROWTH

Flint will be paid a base salary of 1.2 million pounds ($1.6 million) a year, as well as a fixed pay allowance of 1.7 million pounds and an annual pension allowance of 360,000 pounds.

He will also be entitled to an annual bonus worth up to 215 percent of his base pay and a long-term incentive award of up to 320 pct of his base pay.

His main task will be to grow revenues across HSBC’s businesses, as it seeks to grow profits again following a period of restructuring after the 2008-9 financial crisis.

HSBC’s previous management duo of Gulliver and Douglas Flint spent the years since their appointment in 2010 shrinking HSBC, after a period of empire-building in the run-up to the 2008 global financial crisis left the bank over-extended.

In July, HSBC announced its third share buyback in a year and rising profits, in a sign of its turnaround.

But the bank still faces a tough challenge to meet its long term goal of making a better than 10 percent return on equity.

In August last year HSBC abandoned a timetable for achieving that target, as increased regulatory requirements on capital, low interest rates and rising competition from low-cost competitors pressure lenders’ profits worldwide.

Investors will watch closely to see whether Flint continues Gulliver’s shift toward the bank’s second home market of Asia.

HSBC said in 2015 it would hire 4000 staff and lend more in China’s southern Pearl River Delta region, a plan that has since encountered some setbacks as China’s growth slowed.

It has also lost market share in its Asian life insurance business, a trend which analysts expect the bank’s new chairman to attempt to reverse given his background in the industry.

Flint spent much of his early carer in Asia, and has done stints in Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, and India as well as the United States and Britain.

Before taking on his retail and wealth role in 2013, he was HSBC’s head of strategy and planning having previously run its global asset management business and was deputy head of its markets business as well as serving as Group Treasurer.",HSBC picks company veteran John Flint as new chief executive,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-hsbc-ceo/hsbc-picks-company-veteran-john-flint-as-new-chief-executive-idUSKBN1CH1BB?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

Gucci, part of Paris-based luxury group Kering, has paraded models down the catwalk in luxurious fur coats in the past and creative director Alessandro Michele brought in loafers and sling-backs lined with kangaroo-fur two years ago.

But the brand said it would now join an alliance of fur-free companies, adding it would sell off remaining accessories and clothing made with animal fur in a charity auction.

Gucci has sold some of its mink fur coats for over $40,000.

Marco Bizzarri, Gucci’s chief executive, said the brand would drop fur starting from its spring and summer 2018 collection and that its new approach had been agreed on with Michele.

Gucci has enjoyed a revival under Michele, whose flamboyant, colorful designs have fueled sales over the past two years.

Animal rights campaigners said they hoped the move by the Italian fashion house could have a knock-on effect, although it is far from the first label to stop using fur.

“Gucci’s decision will radically change the future of fashion,” Simone Pavesi, manager of animal-free fashion at Italian campaign group LAV. “As fashion becomes more and more ethical, supply chains that revolve around animals will be a thing of the past.”

In June, Yoox Net-A-Porter, a multi-brand online luxury retailer, adopted a fur-free policy on accessories and clothing sold on the site.

Italy’s Giorgio Armani last year committed to stop using fur, saying technological progress meant there was no longer any justification for cruelty to animals, while U.S. brand Calvin Klein took the plunge in 1994.

Anti-fur protesters have been known to demonstrate outside catwalk shows at fashion weeks around the world to call for an end to practices many see as cruel to animals, and luxury goods buyers - especially younger generations - have become more sensitive to environmental issues, too.

Many labels and other luxury groups such as LVMH - owner of Louis Vuitton - are tightening their policies on how leather is sourced from tanneries and how they obtain furs, after a series of scandals over how animals are treated in breeding farms.

France’s Hermes was caught in a storm two years ago when a crocodile farm used to supply leather for one of its best-selling handbags was accused of cruel slaughter practices.","Italy's Gucci bans fur, joining others in seeking alternatives",https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idCAKBN1CH135-OCAEN

SAN FRANCISCO(Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Waymo sought at least $1 billion in damages and a public apology from Uber Technologies Inc as conditions for settling its high-profile trade secret lawsuit against the ride-services company, sources familiar with the proposal told Reuters.

The Waymo self-driving car unit also asked that an independent monitor be appointed to ensure Uber does not use Waymo technology in the future, the sources said.

Uber rejected those terms as non-starters, said the sources, who were not authorized to publicly discuss settlement talks. The precise dollar amount requested by Waymo and the exact time the offer was made could not be learned.

Waymo’s tough negotiating stance, which has not been previously reported, reflects the company’s confidence in its legal position after months of pretrial victories in a case which may help to determine who emerges in the forefront of the fast-growing field of self-driving cars.

The aggressive settlement demands also suggest that Waymo is not in a hurry to resolve the lawsuit, in part because of its value as a distraction for Uber leadership, said Elizabeth Rowe, a trade secret expert at the University of Florida Levin College of Law.

Waymo recently persuaded a San Francisco federal judge to delay a trial to decide the dispute from October to early December, citing the need to investigate evidence Uber had not disclosed earlier.

No further settlement talks are currently scheduled, the sources said. The judge overseeing the case mandated that the companies enter mediation with a court-appointed magistrate.

Amy Candido, a Waymo attorney, declined to comment on any settlement talks, but said the company’s reasons for suing Uber are “pretty clear.”

“Waymo had one goal: to stop Uber from using its trade secrets,” she said. “That remains its goal.”

An Uber spokesperson declined to comment.

DISRUPTIVE

Waymo sued Uber in February, claiming that former engineer Anthony Levandowski downloaded more than 14,000 confidential files before leaving to set up a self-driving truck company, called Otto, which Uber acquired soon after.

Uber denied using any of Waymo’s trade secrets.

Waymo’s lawsuit has been disruptive for Uber. U.S. District Judge William Alsup granted Waymo’s request for a pretrial injunction in May, which prohibited Levandowski from working on Lidar, a key sensor technology for self-driving cars that is the crux of the current litigation.

Uber later fired Levandowski, regarded as a visionary in autonomous technology, after he refused to return Waymo documents at the heart of the case. Levandowski has asserted his constitutional right against self-incrimination and declined to answer questions from Waymo lawyers.

Meanwhile, Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick stepped down as chief executive in June after allegations of widespread misconduct at the company became public. Kalanick has since become embroiled in a boardroom fight with fellow Uber investor Benchmark Capital.

Benchmark cited Waymo’s allegations of trade secret theft in separate litigation aimed at forcing Kalanick off Uber’s board. A Delaware judge put that lawsuit on hold and sent it to private arbitration.

On Sunday Oct. 1, the day before Kalanick was scheduled to give a deposition in the Waymo case, Kalanick’s lawyers called Waymo and asked to postpone the deposition, lawyers for both companies said in court last week.

Kalanick’s lawyers said he was in the middle of a fight to appoint new board members and was therefore too busy, Waymo attorneys said in court. Waymo refused the request, forcing Kalanick to attend the deposition.

DISTRACTING A COMPETITOR

Causing such distractions for a competitor are a clear benefit to Waymo, Rowe said. Uber has hired three law firms to litigate the case and devoted thousands of hours to probe Uber servers for Waymo confidential information.

“I‘m counting all those as good reasons to keep the lawsuit going,” Rowe said.

Waymo has estimated damages in the case at about $1.9 billion, according to court filings, which Uber disputes. Despite that figure and the big settlement demands, Waymo views winning a permanent injunction against Uber using any Waymo intellectual property as the main priority, another source familiar with the company’s thinking said.

Much of the technical evidence in the case has been filed under seal, making it impossible for outside observers to independently assess the strength of each side’s arguments. In court last week, Alsup said Uber’s product was “dissimilar” from Waymo‘s.

Even if a jury finds that Uber stole Waymo trade secrets, Uber says in court filings that its engineers have designed around the Waymo technology at issue in the case. If that is true, that would lessen the impact on Uber in the event of a defeat in court.

Waymo is skeptical of Uber’s claim, however. In a court filing on Monday, it requested an order forcing Uber to disclose its source code, or underlying software, for its Lidar products.

The Alphabet subsidiary said in the filing that it recently learned that former employees took Waymo source code when they went to work at Uber, “including software related to the ‘brains’ of the vehicle that determines how the car moves.”",Exclusive: Alphabet's Waymo demanded $1 billion in settlement talks with Uber - sources,https://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCAKBN1CH0QC-OCATC

PARIS (Reuters) - Plane giants are preparing to squeeze the last drop out of a once raging torrent of airplane orders without the razzmatazz of recent years, as the aerospace industry heads to a belt-tightening Paris Airshow looking for new sources of revenue.

The June 19-25 gathering takes place against the backdrop of surprisingly strong airline traffic driven by economic growth, but a steep drop in the appetite for new planes following robust demand for the latest fuel-efficient models in recent years.

Instead, many firms will talk up efforts to extract new revenues out of powerful data-crunching services, while the first Paris display of a U.S. stealth jet in decades, the F-35, points to a defense recovery at the world’s largest air show.

The meeting also comes amid tensions in the Gulf over a transport and economic boycott of Qatar that is fuelling questions over the resilience of a major source of demand.

Dominating an otherwise thin slate of commercial orders will be a new version of Boeing’s (BA.N) most-sold airliner, the 737.

The 190-to-230-seat Boeing 737 MAX 10, designed to narrow a gap against European rival Airbus, will be launched on Monday with over 100 orders, two people familiar with the plans said.

Analysts said one unknown quantity is how many of the MAX 10 orders may merely be replacing previous orders for other variants as Boeing rejigs its medium-haul portfolio.

Low-cost giants Lion Air of Indonesia and Ireland’s Ryanair (RYA.I) have confirmed Reuters reports of interest in the new jet, though talks with Ryanair could take longer to complete.

CDB Aviation, the aircraft leasing arm of China Development Bank, is in talks to place orders with both Boeing and Airbus and could complete at least one of the deals by the show.

It may buy 40-50 Boeings, including about 5 MAX 10s, and a similar number of Airbus jets, two sources said.

Boeing is seen anxious to win backing of major operators for the new catch-up model and has also talked to United Airlines.

""I think you'll see some activity on this in Paris and that will start the process of seeing how airlines react to it,"" said Peter Barrett, chief executive of SMBC Aviation Capital.

‘DIFFERENT DYNAMIC’

Seeking to leapfrog Airbus (AIR.PA) after a mixed few years for the MAX series, Boeing will also give more details on a larger new mid-market jet employing a novel fuselage designed to try to capture projected growth in demand for 220-270 seaters.

But few expect a repeat of the more than 400 orders and commitments at last year’s Farnborough Airshow in Britain.

“I think it is going to be a relatively quiet air show compared to previous years,” said Robert Martin, chief executive of BOC Aviation.

Instead, some of the airlines that have become synonymous with air show hoopla in previous years, such as Malaysia’s AirAsia (AIRA.KL), may return to sign up for digital services to make their new fleets more efficient to operate and maintain.

Manufacturers are exploiting breakthroughs in data storage and other technologies to cut development times by a third while offering services like “predictive maintenance” to airlines, mimicking the post-sales success of their engine suppliers.

“We have 10,000 aircraft flying and we have to apply these technologies to these aircraft,” Airbus chief operating officer and planemaking president Fabrice Bregier said.

It will also be the first air show since China and Russia successfully flew new passenger jets in recent weeks, completing a series of debuts by new entrants that also include Japan.

Mitsubishi’s MRJ90 will appear in Paris for the first time.

While there is no immediate threat to Airbus and Boeing, delegates say the feeling is taking hold in boardrooms and governments that their duopoly cannot be taken for granted.

“There is a long road from first flight to certification and all that goes with it, but I think it will be a slightly different dynamic than we might have had in previous air shows where they were paper or theoretical airplanes and now we have real aircraft,” Barrett said of the would-be challengers.

In another turning point, it may be the last major air show for Airbus super-salesman John Leahy, who has said he will retire soon. He has presided over sales of over 10,000 planes.

With the New Yorker’s departure, the swagger and deliberate baiting of rivals at such shows may become a thing of the past, but the industry is unlikely to retreat from fierce competition.

The more muted tone, and cost-cutting to focus on production after years of strong sales, are reflected in the logistics. Several firms have cut back space and host planemaker Airbus is halving staff attendance and slashing catering, insiders said.",Jetmakers hunt for new growth as order binge fizzles out,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-airshow-paris/jetmakers-hunt-for-new-growth-as-order-binge-fizzles-out-idUSKBN1961WV

The principal reason for lasting Iranian distrust of the United States since the revolution has been U.S. policies aimed at undermining and overturning the Iranian political system.
The political landscape of conservatives, moderates, and reformists in Iran is in many ways similar to the competition between Democrats and Republicans in the United States.","With the fate of the Iran nuclear deal at stake, Donald Trump has until October 15 to tell Congress if he believes Tehran is complying with the seven-nation agreement. Many expect that the U.S. president will decertify Iranian compliance with the deal -- returning U.S.-Iran relations to a state of overt hostility.

Not all in the administration seem to agree with Trump’s harder-line approach on Iran. Defense Secretary James Mattis has publicly stated that Trump “should consider staying” in the deal, while Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has reportedly argued against decertification. Speaking after his first meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, Tillerson also seemed to indicate a willingness to take a longer-term view when he told a media conference that the Washington-Tehran relationship had “never had a stable, happy moment in it.” ”Is this going to be the way it is for the rest of our lives and our children’s lives and our grandchildren’s lives,” he asked.



Tillerson’s remarks evoked an encounter told to me by Mohsen Rafiqdoost, a former Iranian Revolutionary Guards Commander, of a 1982 meeting he had with Ayatollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic.

Rafiqdoost recalled suggesting that the U.S. embassy grounds in Tehran be converted to a Revolutionary Guards base. Ayatollah Khomeini rejected the idea, asking “Why would you go there? Are we not going to have relations with America for a thousand years?”

It’s clear that decades of estrangement have led to a fundamental misunderstanding of Iran in Washington. Notwithstanding the Obama administration’s nuclear negotiations, every U.S. administration since the 1979 Iranian revolution has failed in its declared objective to contain Iran.

If Trump wishes to free future generations of anxiety over U.S.-Iran tensions, he should pay careful attention to five points in formulating his Iran policy.

Shoppers at the Grand Bazaar in the center of Tehran, Iran, August 2, 2017. Nazanin Tabatabaee Yazdi/TIMA via REUTERS

First, American officials need to stop speaking about Iran in threatening and insulting terms. The Iranian people are proud of their thousands of years of history and above all else view mutual respect as integral to their foreign relations. However, Foreign Minister Zarif told me that Trump’s speech to the United Nations General Assembly last month was the “most insulting speech of any American president toward Iran since the revolution” and that it “made any potential for dialogue with the United States meaningless.”

Second, U.S. regime-change policies have been self-defeating. The principal reason for lasting Iranian distrust of the United States since the revolution has been U.S. policies aimed at undermining and overturning the Iranian political system. In June, Tillerson openly declared that U.S. policy towards Iran included regime change -- a statement not heard from a senior U.S. official in years and which marked a sharp departure from conventional U.S. rhetoric of seeking Iranian “behavior” change.

In stark contrast, Barack Obama told the UN that “we are not seeking regime change and we respect the right of the Iranian people to access peaceful nuclear energy.” Consequently, he was able to diplomatically engage Iran on its nuclear program, and reach the July 2015 nuclear deal. The respectful letters exchanged between Obama and Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei helped set the process in motion. This would not happen today even if Trump made a similar overture, as the key to successful negotiations with Iran is to first drop regime-change policies.

Third, since the 1953 U.S.-led coup that overthrew democratically-elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddeq, Iranians have resented U.S. interference in Iran. The political landscape of conservatives, moderates, and reformists in Iran is in many ways similar to the competition between Democrats and Republicans in the United States. As such, any agreement between Washington and Tehran must be negotiated in a way that transcends the partisan divide in each country -- or else it would be inherently fragile. The challenges the nuclear deal has been subject to in Washington by the Republican Party is testament to this need. With respect to Iran too, negotiations must be carried out in a way that respects Iran’s political makeup and hierarchies.

Fourth, the Trump administration needs to accept that Iran, as a large country with immense natural resources and an educated population, has legitimate security concerns and interests in its neighborhood. Washington must recognize that U.S. policies aimed at isolating Tehran and refusing to accept a legitimate Iranian role in the region have only seen Iranian influence grow in countries such as Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and Lebanon while U.S. influence wanes in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and elsewhere. From Iran’s perspective, its post-1979 foreign policy has been driven by the aim of deterring foreign aggression and securing the country’s borders rather than the pursuit of regional hegemony. After the revolution, Iran was invaded by Saddam Hussein’s Iraq and, for much of the past decade, chaos on its thousands of miles of borders with Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan – all factors that have compelled it to play a regional role. If the United States wants to avoid scenarios where regional states aggressively compete for power it must encourage the creation of a regional security system involving the six Gulf Cooperation Council countries along with Iraq and Iran.

Finally, the record of U.S.-Iran negotiations shows that “dual track” policies of pressure and diplomacy are destined to fail. While Trump appears to be trying to bring Iran to the negotiating table in a position of weakness, Iranian policymakers tend to respond to pressure by retaliating in kind.

In a recent Washington Post op-ed, former Secretary of State John Kerry highlighted how by the time he entered into negotiations with Iran, after years of sanctions, Iran had “mastered the nuclear fuel cycle” and built a uranium stockpile large enough to make 10 to 12 bombs. “In other words, Iran was already a nuclear-threshold state,” wrote Kerry.

The lesson for Washington here is that if push comes to shove, Tehran will develop its own bargaining chips --- not capitulate in the face of whatever threats are made when Trump delivers his next policy speech on Iran.",Commentary: A former Iranian diplomat on what Trump needs to know about Iran,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mousavian-iran-commentary/commentary-a-former-iranian-diplomat-on-what-trump-needs-to-know-about-iran-idUSKBN1CE22K

REUTERS - India’s annual consumer inflation marginally eased to 3.28 percent in September from a year ago, government data showed on Thursday.

Analysts polled by Reuters had expected retail inflation to edge up to 3.60 percent last month from 3.36 percent in August.

India’s industrial output grew 4.3 percent in August from a year earlier, government data showed.

Economists surveyed by Reuters had forecast 2.4 percent growth in output compared with a revised 0.9 percent year-on-year increase in July.

COMMENTS

RUPA REGE NITSURE, GROUP CHIEF ECONOMIST, L&T FINANCE HOLDINGS, MUMBAI

Contrary to street expectations, CPI has fallen sequentially despite the fact that favourable base effect has unwound. This primarily reflects weaknesses in aggregate demand. Even services inflation has moderated marginally.

Primary contributors to September inflation are housing & fuels categories, which have hardened due to HRA effect on housing & global crude price effect on fuel prices. This means inflation trajectory remained well below the RBI target in H1, FY18.

Yet, the chances for rate cut look distant as IIP growth has accelerated to 4.3 percent, albeit due to a favourable base effect in capital goods & mining sectors.

In my opinion, IIP growth will not sustain at this level, as base effect will keep shifting. My IIP forecast was 5 percent - closest to the actual.

HITESH JAIN, ASSOCIATE VICE PRESIDENT - RESEARCH, IIFL WEALTH MANAGEMENT, MUMBAI

There is no room or scope for further easing rates for at least 3-4 months. RBI may take a call in March since it clearly sees inflation scaling higher.

Rising energy prices and implementation of farm loan waivers aggravates the inflationary pressure. All this will basically impart upside risk to the baseline inflation trajectory.

The spike in inflation in August was basically due to a rise in vegetable prices and food commodities ahead of the festive season. Now we see some moderation in food prices.

There will be improvement in aggregate demand for commodities during festive season.

People also attributed the spike in retail inflation in August to GST. I think the picture has to evolve, because the government is still contemplating changes to GST.

RADHIKA RAO, GROUP ECONOMIST, DBS, SINGAPORE

The pullback in food prices overwhelmed the uptick in non-food components, including the higher housing segment.

Headline is well within the central bank’s estimate of 2-3.5 percent range for 1H17.

Meanwhile, core inflation at 4.6 percent continues to outpace the headline reading, which might reinforce the central bank’s neutral stance.

October’s inflation might also soften on seasonality and base effects, feeding into rate cut expectations.

ANJALI VERMA, ECONOMIST, PHILLIPCAPITAL INDIA, MUMBAI

The number is better than our expectations. The lower-than-expected inflation number in September is primarily driven by a contraction in food inflation. Going ahead, the key driver of inflation will be oil. But, we also need to keep an eye on food prices.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Panasonic Corp’s autonomous driving system is expected to be launched in commercial vehicles as early as in 2022, in a move that will likely help the Japanese company narrow its gap with rival suppliers in a highly competitive market.

Panasonic, the exclusive battery cell supplier for Tesla Inc’s mass-market Model 3, has been reinventing itself as a provider of advanced auto parts to escape the price competition of smartphones and other lower-margin consumer products.

The new autonomous driving system will enable autonomous driving at low- and medium-speed ranges including self-valet parking, Panasonic said on Tuesday.

“We know we are behind our rivals right now,” said Shoichi Goto, director in charge of vision and sensing technologies at the firm’s automotive R&D division.

“But we have developed key LSI (large-scale integration) chips for advanced image processing and sonar sensing that would give us major advantages, using expertise from television sets and cameras.”

The new chips need more testing and polishing before the commercial launch of the autonomous driving system, added Goto, previously a TV engineer.

Panasonic has been pushing to expand its range of advanced driving-related products to better compete with top suppliers such as Bosch [ROBG.UL] and Continental AG.

The firm has said it plans to nearly double its automotive business revenue to 2.5 trillion yen ($22 billion) by the year to March 2022, from 1.3 trillion yen in the year to March 2017.

Panasonic established the automotive R&D division in April, transferring about 350 engineers from TV, the company’s mainstay at the time, and other consumer electronics businesses.

To bolster its push into the automotive field, Panasonic took control of Spanish auto parts maker Ficosa International SA earlier this year.

路透10月11日 - “埃及遍地必来七个大丰年，随后又要来七个荒年，甚至埃及地都忘了先前的丰收。”

圣经中，约瑟这样解读法老梦到的七头肥美的牛和七头干瘦的牛，但他可能也是在说油市。(创世纪第41章29-30节)

就像尼罗河是否泛滥决定法老的王国经历丰足还是饥馑一样，油市也在供应的短缺与过剩之间反复。

“油市的问题总是(供应)不是太多就是太少，”纽约大学经济学教授Myron Watkins在80年前写道(石油：稳定还是保护？ Watkins, 1937)。

古埃及食物供应的充足或短缺交替出现，但很少有“刚好够用”的时候，因此埃及用谷仓来储存丰年的多余供应，以备歉收时使用。

油市也把供应过剩时的库存留到供应不足时使用，油价也随之有规律地从正价差转至逆价差。

油市的自然状态不是刚刚够用，正好像埃及食物供应的自然状态也不是刚好够用。

石油输出国组织(OPEC)和包括我自己在内的其他评论人士都把限产和降低过剩库存的过程看做是市场“恢复平衡”的一环。

将调节石油生产、消费及库存的一整套复杂过程，以“再平衡”简称，虽然很便利，但这并不代表整个过程的终点就是一个“平衡”的油市。

油市很少平衡，更从来没能长期维持平衡。

在以往，油市出现一些供应过剩及正价差时期后，很快就回到供应短缺和逆价差时期。

图表：reut.rs/2kFtoix

目前看来正在上演类似的情况，布兰特及其他国际原油品种原本从2014年年中以来皆维持正价差，但在过去三个月转为逆价差。

多数分析师已开始担心重新出现供应过剩、原油库存恢复上升、以及石油输出国组织(OPEC)及其盟友2018年将如何退出现行的限产协议。

但仍存在的一个可能是，当石油需求强劲成长时，油市正要进入供应短缺时期，供应步伐将落后，而石油库存将紧俏。

**正向反馈**

油价很少能够平顺地适应石油产量或消费的变动(“Essentials of petroleum: a key to oil economics”, Frankel, 1946)。

石油产量、消费、库存、及油价之间的关系，具有循环因果或反馈过程特色(“Cybernetics, or command and control in the animal and the human”, Wiener, 1948)。

其中一些过程促进油市稳定，并倾向于抑制最初干扰(“负反馈”)，但是其他过程则破坏稳定，并且倾向于放大初始冲击(“正反馈”)。

正反馈过程可能在中短期内造成市况极其不稳。2014至2016年油市下滑期间，正反馈使得跌势更加严重并延迟了再平衡。

例如在供应方面，油价下跌导致劳动力、原材料和服务合同的价格下降，抑制了生产商对价格下降的反应(tmsnrt.rs/2xxifGQ)。

在需求方面，产油国的经济衰退，以及钻井活动萧条和全球货运放缓，都大大降低了石油消耗，尤其是柴油，结果加剧了供应过剩。

但正反馈是把双刃剑，正如它可以加深和拉长跌势，同样也可能加快和放大涨势。

油市再平衡可能会推动成本上涨，产油国的消费增长加快，以及货运活动加速成长。

在原油市场，就像法老治下的埃及一样，一切往往都同时正确(或者错误)，在商品周期内造成剧烈波动。

**上涨要素**

2018和2019年油市周期性好转的所有要素都已齐备。

全球主要经济体都在经历近十年来最强劲同步扩张，世界贸易量的增长速度也创下2011年以来最快。

全球整体经济扩张加上相对较低的油价，促成了石油需求激增，令过去三年的石油消费增速快于长期均值水平。

根据国际能源署(IEA)的数据，全球石油消费量在2017年预估将增加160万桶/日，2016年和2015年的消费增幅则分别为130万桶/日和190万桶/日。

IEA的9月报告称，预计2018年全球石油消费进一步增加140万桶/日。

受强劲需求和沙特限制供应的影响，全球原油和油品库存正在迅速下降。

库存虽然仍高于五年均值，但正在向五年均值靠拢。考虑到2012年以来惊人的消费增长，五年均值的水平终究可能还是过低。

关键的问题在于，石油生产商将以多快的速度对需求增强和石油库存趋紧做出回应。

由于大多数生产方已经接近100%的全产能运营，因此未来两年的产出增长将主要来自于沙特阿拉伯(和其亲密盟友科威特)、内乱冲突迭起的非洲，或是美国页岩油生产商。

沙特拥有闲置产能，但该国在增加市场供应前，会希望先看到油价走高，特别是在沙特阿美部分资产临近上市之际。

尼日利亚和利比亚也拥有闲置产能，但国内安全形势堪忧，使得两国未来增产存在很大的不确定性。

美国页岩油生产商也可以提高产量，但他们的成本正在升高，股东也越来越要求他们侧重于提高回报而非增加产量。

**接下来会怎样？**

2018/19年油市可能出现的景象如下：

* 如果OPEC减产协议执行率下降、美国页岩油产量又迅速增加，超过了需求增长，那么油价涨势和逆价差可能会消失。

* 如果OPEC顺利退出减产协议，页岩油产量增长追平需求增长，那么油价和日历价差可能将继续区间盘整。

* 如果消费增长超过供应，而且库存持续下降，那么至少油价会进一步上涨，逆价差也会扩大。

许多分析师和交易商的预期带有追溯性质，假设未来将重演刚刚发生的景象，所以他们往往会错过转折点。

2011-2014年繁荣期后，市场预期过于乐观，因此许多分析师和交易商没有料到跌势已经迫近，之后还低估了下跌的幅度和持续时间。

但在这次大跌后市场预期或许已经变得过于悲观，交易商目前低估了油市反弹的前景。

当然，考虑到页岩油生产商和OPEC顺利进行调整以满足需求增长，油市总是有可能拥有充足供应。

Tens of thousands of soldiers are taking part in the massive four-yearly war games that are both a drill as well as a show of strength for the West. Next time around, in 2021, those troops might be sharing their battle space with a different type of force: self-driving drones, tanks, ships and submersibles.

Drone warfare is hardly new – the first lethal attack conducted by an American unmanned aerial vehicle took place in Afghanistan in October 2001. What is now changing fast, however, is the ability of such unmanned systems to operate without a guiding human hand.

That’s a truly revolutionary shift – and one every major nation wants to be lead. Critics have long feared countries might be more willing to go to war with unmanned systems. Now, some see a very real risk control might pass beyond human beings altogether.

Tech entrepreneur Elon Musk has long warned that humanity might be on the verge of some cataclysmic errors when it comes to artificial intelligence. Last month, he ramped that up with a warning that the development of autonomous weapons platforms might provoke a potentially devastating arms race.

As if to reinforce Musk’s point, Russian President Vladimir Putin told students shortly thereafter that he believed the technology would be a game changer, making it clear Russia would plow resources into it. “The one who becomes leader in this will become ruler of the world,” Putin was quoted as saying.

China too is pushing ahead, believed by some experts to now be the global leader when it comes to developing autonomous swarms of drones.

Already, drones are able to fly themselves independently so they can stay airborne if they lose touch with human pilots. Soon they may be able to make their own tactical decisions. At Georgia Tech in the United States this summer, researchers programmed swarms of light drones to fight their own aerial dogfights. The U.S. military is trying out similar products.

That means one operator could command many, many more drones – or that they might not need direct supervision at all.

Even more important than what is happening in robotics may be the wider developments in artificial intelligence. That won’t make warfare necessarily more deadly – a bomb dropped from a drone is not in itself less lethal than one from a manned aircraft. While it’s possible that greater accuracy might reduce casualties, some analysts fear that the changes brought by new unmanned systems might themselves fuel new conflicts.

“Radical technological change begets radical government policy ideas,” concluded a July report on the topic produced for the U.S. intelligence community by Harvard University’s Belfer Center. It warned an “inevitable” AI arms race could prove as revolutionary as the invention of nuclear weapons.

Artificial intelligence could dramatically increase the efficiency of surveillance technology, allowing a single system to monitor perhaps millions of digital conversations, hacked personal devices and other sources of information. The implications could be terrifying, particularly in the hands of a state with little or no democratic oversight.

At a recent UK panel discussion, Britain’s former Special Forces director Lieutenant General Sir Graeme Lamb predicted that by 2030, technological breakthroughs – not just AI, but quantum computing and beyond – would produce entirely unpredictable changes. Special force teams, he suggested, might well have a robotic and artificial intelligence component deployed alongside them – the U.S. Army calls this “manned-unmanned teaming.”

That sounds like something out of science fiction – and it might well look like it. Last year, Russia unveiled its FEDOR humanoid military robot, which it demonstrated firing a gun.

Most countries deliberately keep their defense AI secret, ultimately fueling the arms race Musk was warning about. Some scientists already worry about a real-world version of the premise for the Arnold Schwarzenegger-starring “Terminator” film franchise in which the United States, fearing cyber attack, hands control of key military systems to the artificial intelligence Skynet. (Skynet, fearing its human creators might choose to turn it off, immediately launches a full-scale nuclear attack on humanity.)

For now, Western nations at least look keen to keep a human in the “kill chain.” Not all countries may make that choice, however. Russia has long had a reputation for trusting machines more than people, at one stage considering – and, some evidence suggests, building – an automated system to launch its nuclear arsenal should its command structure be destroyed by a first strike.

Outside of the military, there is evidence AI algorithms have already alarmed their creators. In August, Facebook shut down an AI experiment after programs involved began communicating with each other in a language the humans monitoring them could not understand.

Is this the end for ordinary human soldiering? Almost certainly not. It’s even been argued that a more complex, high-tech battlefield might require more soldiers, not fewer.

Robotic systems may be vulnerable to hacking, jamming and simply rendered inoperable through electronic warfare. Such techniques allow U.S.-led forces in Iraq to largely negate the off-the-shelf drones being used by Islamic State. Russia used similar techniques against Western-made drones in Ukraine.

That’s a worry for armed forces betting – like many industries – on automation. Britain’s new aircraft carrier has only a fraction of the sailors on its only slightly larger U.S. carrier counterparts, relying heavily on automatic systems to manage weaponry and damage control. The latest Russian tank, the T-14 Armata, has an automated turret that will usually be out of reach to most of its crew. Such techniques have clear advantages – but also mean that interfering with electronics could leave them useless.

Such technology is coming whether it is a good idea or not. Indeed, even relatively old military equipment increasingly can be retrofitted. Russian engineers have already demonstrated that they can adapt the 20-year-old T-90 tank to be controlled remotely.

Ironically, the North Korean crisis reminds us that the most dangerous technologies may well remain those invented more than 70 years ago – atomic weapons and the missiles that carry them. Even if mankind can avoid a nuclear apocalypse, however, the coming AI and robotic revolution may prove an equal existential challenge.",Commentary: The coming robot arms race,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apps-robots-commentary/commentary-the-coming-robot-arms-race-idUSKCN1BT1XN

PARIS (Reuters) - The United States announced on Thursday it was withdrawing from UNESCO, the U.N.’s cultural and educational agency, complaining about how it is run and about what Washington described as bias against Israel.

“This decision was not taken lightly, and reflects U.S. concerns with mounting arrears at UNESCO, the need for fundamental reform in the organization, and continuing anti-Israel bias,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement.

The withdrawal of the United States, which provides a fifth of UNESCO’s funding, is a severe blow for the Paris-based organization which began work in 1946 and is known for designating World Heritage sites such as the ancient city of Palmyra in Syria and the Grand Canyon National Park.

Under UNESCO rules, the withdrawal will become effective as of the end of December 2018. Until that time, the United States, which provides around $80 million to UNESCO annually, will remain a full member.

The organization, which employs around 2,000 people worldwide, most of them based in Paris, has long been the object of criticism over its use of resources and resolutions that have been perceived by Israel and other countries as biased.

Director-General Irina Bokova expressed disappointment at the U.S. decision.

“At the time when conflicts continue to tear apart societies across the world, it is deeply regrettable for the United States to withdraw from the United Nations agency promoting education for peace and protecting culture under attack,” she said.

“This is a loss to the United Nations family. This is a loss for multilateralism.”

UNESCO is in the process of selecting a new chief, whose priority will be to revive its fortunes.

The U.S. move underscores the scepticism expressed by President Donald Trump about the need for the United States to remain engaged in multi-lateral bodies. The president has touted an “America First” policy, which puts U.S. economic and nationalist interests ahead of international commitments.

Since Trump took office, the United States has abandoned the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade talks, withdrawn from the Paris climate deal and opened up a renegotiation of a decades old trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, NAFTA. Trump has also called NATO obsolete, though he has since backtracked on that.

Diplomats expressed concern about the loss of U.S. engagement.

“The absence of the United States or any large country with a lot of power is a loss. It’s not just about money, it’s promoting ideals that are vital to countries like the United States, such as education and culture,” a UNESCO-based diplomat said.

For differing reasons, Britain, Japan and Brazil are among states that have yet to pay their dues for 2017.

After three days of secret balloting that could run until Friday, Qatar’s Hamad bin Abdulaziz al-Kawari and France’s Audrey Azoulay are tied to win the top post at the organization, with Egyptian hopeful Moushira Khattab in third. Two other candidates trail.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Thursday pushed back against federal aid for Puerto Rico as the House of Representatives prepared to weigh $36.5 billion in emergency relief for the U.S. territory and other hurricane-hit areas as well as fire-ravaged California.

Lawmakers are expected to approve the bipartisan measure that will also provide relief to the storm-struck areas of Florida, Texas, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and leaders of both major parties have lauded the bill.

Trump, in several early Twitter posts, however, criticized Puerto Rico for ”a total lack of “accountability,” saying “electric and all infrastructure was disaster before hurricanes.”

While he noted it was up to “Congress to decide how much to spend,” he said: “We cannot keep FEMA, the Military & the First Responders, who have been amazing (under the most difficult circumstances) in P.R. forever!”

The content and timing of the comments, as the island struggles with the storm’s aftermath, prompted swift backlash from some Democratic lawmakers, who said such a move would amount to abandoning U.S. citizens.

“There is still devastation, Americans are still dying. FEMA needs to stay until the job is done,” Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer replied on Twitter.

Representatives for the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on what Trump meant by his tweets.

Republican U.S. Representative Scott Perry defended Trump’s statement, telling CNN federal assistance was meant to be finite and that it was “reasonable” for the island to eventually take up its own governance.

The bill includes $18.7 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s disaster relief fund. Of that amount, $4.9 billion is earmarked for loans to local governments to ensure that the cash-strapped Puerto Rico can keep government programs operating beyond Oct. 31.

Other funds include $576.5 million for the federal government’s wildfire control efforts. Some $16 billion would go toward the National Flood Insurance Program to help it cover claims after reaching its borrowing limit.

Once passed by the Republican-led House, the Senate, also controlled by Republicans, is expected to take up the package later this month after it returns from a week-long recess.

Republican and Democratic lawmakers, however, said more money would likely be needed later.

“These funds are vital right now, in the near term, to get the aid where it is needed most,” said House Appropriations Committee Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen, a Republican.

Democratic Representative Nydia Velázquez of New York, which has a large Puerto Rican community, said the relief package was “just the start” of federal aid to the island, where large areas remain without electricity or running water three weeks after Hurricane Maria made landfall.

Puerto Rico is burdened with nearly $72 billion in pre-hurricane debt being overseen by a federally created oversight board.

Velázquez said the funds earmarked for loans to local governments would assist Puerto Rico’s “liquidity crisis” and that steps must be taken to ensure that creditors are unable to access funds meant for disaster relief.","As US House weighs $36.5 billion disaster relief, Trump slams Puerto Rico",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-congress/as-us-house-weighs-36-5-billion-disaster-relief-trump-slams-puerto-rico-idUSKBN1CH1A7?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

NEW YORK (Reuters) - When reporters descended on upstate New York to ask about a stunning prison break in 2015, state police spokesman Major Charles Guess took their questions.

A dog named Trigger stepped on his owner’s 12-gauge shotgun during an Indiana waterfowl hunt just months later and shot her in the foot.

Sometimes the name fits the news story. Correspondent Julie Weed writes about legal marijuana for Forbes. This month, a front-page New York Times story on obesity was edited by Hilary Stout.

And former U.S. Representative Anthony Weiner on Monday was sentenced to prison for sending explicitly sexual pictures of a certain body part to an underage girl.

This phenomenon has secured its own line of scientific research, called nominative determinism. It even has a name of its own: aptronym.

In some cases, it may be rooted in the tradition of a profession determining a family name, such as Baker, Smith or Taylor.

Other times, it is a coincidence. But it nearly always raises an eyebrow or even a smile from those realizing the unusual pairing.

But strange synergies also can signal hope. Josh Outman now pitches for Mexico’s Triple-A Minor League Pericos de Puebla but was once with the New York Yankees, Oakland Athletics and other U.S. Major League Baseball teams.

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Thursday morning, dragged down by media companies, while results from JPMorgan and Citigroup failed to fuel the optimism that has driven indexes to record highs.

JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Citigroup (C.N), which had already talked down third-quarter expectations, reported earnings that were better than Wall Street estimates even as trading revenues fell. The shares of both companies were little changed.

“After a long stretch of consecutive highs in the market, with earnings, even if they are slightly disappointing, or an even an aspect of earnings like bond trading at JPM, is more an excuse to selloff,” said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist for Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.

With the S&P 500 up about 14 percent in 2017, investors are betting on strong earnings growth across the S&P 500.

AT&T (T.N) tumbled 3.22 percent after the company said its third-quarter results took a hit from the string of hurricanes.

The company also said it lost video subscribers in the quarter. Brokerage Guggenheim downgraded Disney (DIS.N) and Viacom (VIAB.O) on worries over subscriber declines

That sparked fresh jitters in a sector that was hit a day earlier by President Donald Trump’s suggestion to challenge TV network licenses over ‘fake news’.

Comcast (CMCSA.O) fell 2.8 percent, Disney (DIS.N) fell 1 percent. Viacom sank 6.6 percent after warning that Charter Communications subscribers may lose access to its channels as the expiration looms for a distribution deal.

Clemons said earnings will probably heighten volatility, with lack of any other major developments to drive the market.

At 9:37 a.m. ET (1337 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was down 38.19 points, or 0.17 percent, at 22,834.7, the S&P 500 .SPX was down 4.38 points, or 0.17 percent, at 2,550.86 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was down 7.33 points, or 0.11 percent, at 6,596.22.

Ten of the 11 major S&P indexes were lower, led by a more than 2 percent fall in the telecom services index .SPLRCL due to AT&T’s declines.

The biggest drag, however, was from the consumer discretionary sector .SPLRCD, which fell 0.57 percent, weighed down by media stocks.

Energy stocks also fell, dragged down by a more than 1 percent drop in crude oil prices as U.S. fuel inventories rose despite efforts by OPEC to cut production.

General Motors (GM.N) fell 1.5 percent. The Wall Street Journal reported GM planned to cut production at a Detroit plant and lay off about 1,500 workers.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Nerves are fraying in the Brexit talks, negotiators are trying to work out if the other side is bluffing about walking away, and a ticking clock is fast narrowing British options come March 2019.

Philip Hammond, Britain’s finance minister, echoed recent EU assertions when he said that a transition period to some new relationship was a “wasting asset”, the value of which would “diminish significantly” for both sides if its form remains unclear to businesses much after the start of the new year.

As negotiators in Brussels make little progress before Prime Minister Theresa May meets EU leaders next week, a warning about a breakdown in talks from a minister seen strongly to favor a business-friendly “bespoke” transition out of the EU came a day after the EU summit chair spoke of a similar new year deadline.

Donald Tusk said on Tuesday that if London fails to settle divorce terms by December, and so unlock talks on the transition and future trade pact, then the EU would reconsider its objectives. That reflects mounting doubts across Europe that any legal exit deal can be struck.

The longer the stand-off goes on, EU negotiators said, the more Britain’s choice come March 30, 2019, will be between the “hard Brexit” by which it will simply quit all EU systems and be treated like, say, Australia, and a virtual status quo, staying in most EU systems, without voting rights, rather like Norway.

“The closer we get, the less there is to discuss about a transition and the more it just goes to a standstill transition, with Britain still in everything, but without a vote,” one said.

“Pretty soon,” said another, “It will be Norway or nothing.”

While all such commentary reflects the sides’ jockeying for negotiating advantage, the evidence this week is that they remain far apart and are getting tetchy. May and the EU traded jabs over whose court “the ball” is in after the prime minister made concessions in a speech at Florence on Sept. 22.

Behind closed doors, British negotiators voiced outraged surprise that her offer was seen as insufficient to launch talks on the future relationship. “It’s hard to say it was genuine,” one EU official said of the show of emotion. “It’s a form of pressure.”

Brexit Secretary David Davis and EU negotiator Michel Barnier are due to give a news conference around noon (1000 GMT) on Thursday to give an update on the week’s progress.

BUSINESS WORRIES

Businesses are sounding the alarm. A German industry federation warned members to start preparing for a “very hard Brexit”. A senior representative of London’s financial services industry told a Brussels audience this week that a legal transition agreement must be reached by the end of this year.

“Most importantly, it must reflect the status quo,” said Catherine McGuinness of the City of London Corporation. “There is no feasibility in asking firms to transition to a transition. If uncertainty continues, businesses will vote with their feet.”

Hammond ruled out budgeting -- yet -- for more customs and border facilities, and few on the continent believe threats of a walkout they say would hurt Britain more than them.

So leaders will watch May’s struggle to unite her government and sit tight. One senior EU diplomat said British counterparts were in such a weak position that “sometimes I feel sorry them”.

For many in Brussels, that makes a virtual status quo after Brexit the increasingly likely outcome: “In March 2019, Britain will formally leave,” said another EU official.

“But de facto most of the existing arrangements will remain ... They will have their celebration of ‘independence’ and then we will sit down to talking business again.”

May insists a two-year transition period is enough to agree a new free trade pact, but many question that.

John Bruton, the former prime minister of Ireland, has recommended an alternative to either no deal at all or a virtual status quo transition -- just keeping Britain fully in the EU for four years beyond 2019.

Arguing that the two-year deadline set by Article 50 of the EU treaty raises the risk of talks collapsing, and that agreeing first a transition and then another accord is complex, Bruton said this week that Britain and the EU should agree to a six-year negotiating period, with Britain only leaving in 2023.

Neither wants any extension. But Bruton warned: “The present tight time frame ... increases the likelihood of miscalculation and of the UK leaving the EU with no deal at all.”","In Brexit poker, clock narrows transition options",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-transition/in-brexit-poker-clock-narrows-transition-options-idUKKBN1CG2O0

We’re very advanced now in terms of planning,” said Reader, the 47-year-old manager of Grace Foods UK.
Reader fears Brexit will hit his company on several fronts: increased bureaucracy, costs and delays at borders, volatile currency shifts and a slow-burn divergence between Britain and Europe over food standards and labelling.
“We will end up with two totally different companies, with a holding company at the top,” he said, sitting near a map of the Caribbean.
If the model works, the company could build its own distribution base there in time.","WELWYN GARDEN CITY, England (Reuters) - As the head of a British company that imports, exports and manufactures food, Adam Reader is at the centre of the Brexit storm, facing threats at every turn.

But unlike the majority of company bosses who are reluctant to make concrete plans when a future trade deal with Europe has not yet been decided, Reader is not going to wait.

Instead, he’s charging ahead with investments that will split his operations between Britain and Europe, a strategy he is confident will contain any damage from changes to currency, regulations and tariffs as he ships his products globally.

“We’re lucky. We have a clear path. We’re very advanced now in terms of planning,” said Reader, the 47-year-old manager of Grace Foods UK.

“A lot of the businesses I‘m talking to are not really clear about what they’re going to do come the date of Brexit,” he told Reuters at his plant north of London, where Grace’s Caribbean, Mexican and Chinese products are stored.

Britain’s 2016 vote to leave the European Union stunned many businesses, with the prospect that border delays and tariffs could fracture intricate supply chains built up across the continent over the last 40 years.

The plunge in the pound has already forced importers to cut costs and sparked concerns about consumer spending.

Those who voted in favour of Brexit argue that although the economy could be hit in the short term, Britain will ultimately prosper because it will be able to strike trade deals with other nations quickly instead of being clamped to a failed German-dominated experiment in European integration.

For the moment many companies are in limbo, however, as Prime Minister Theresa May’s party wrangles over terms of the departure, due in March 2019. The EU says future trade cannot be discussed until the terms of the divorce have been agreed, meaning a final settlement may not be unveiled until late in the day.

Only 11 percent of companies have started to implement contingency plans, a survey by the Institute of Directors said in July, meaning many may not be ready when the time comes.

Britain’s Food and Drink Federation (FDF), which speaks for an industry employing 400,000 people, says companies should be preparing for all scenarios.

“The time between now and the end of March 2019 is so short that you have to plan for the worst,” FDF Director General Ian Wright told Reuters. “People need to be prepared for what could be a series of very difficult months ahead.”

HIGH STAKES

For Grace Foods UK, a subsidiary of Jamaica’s Grace Kennedy, the stakes are high.

Based in an industrial park in Welwyn Garden City, the company imports drinks, sauces, snacks and spices from around the world, then distributes them to supermarkets, restaurants and independent retailers in Europe, Africa and around Britain. A manufacturing plant in Wales produces sauces.

Reader fears Brexit will hit his company on several fronts: increased bureaucracy, costs and delays at borders, volatile currency shifts and a slow-burn divergence between Britain and Europe over food standards and labelling.

To respond, he has taken an embryonic plan he came up with before the Brexit vote to build a presence in Europe to meet strong demand there and transformed it into a strategy to insulate his company against the expected disruption ahead.

“Brexit accelerated it and made it a ‘must do’ now, rather than a ‘nice to have’,” said Reader from a corner office near the 11,000-sq-m chilled distribution centre piled high with boxes of colourful goods, from its branded Grace “Coconut Water” to “Jerk BBQ Sauce” and “Plantain Chips”.

The company will now make the largest investment in its history to restructure, starting with a new sales base in Europe, most likely in Germany.

“We will end up with two totally different companies, with a holding company at the top,” he said, sitting near a map of the Caribbean.

The final investment has not yet been agreed but it is likely to be equal to a low single-digit percentage of Grace UK’s revenue, he said.

The company will also partner with a distributor in Europe, meaning those goods being sold on the continent can be delivered straight there to avoid paying double tariffs that could come from importing them via Britain first, Reader said.

If the model works, the company could build its own distribution base there in time.

“We could be ready to go in terms of the European operation in the next six months,” said Reader, a former accountant who worked his way up the firm since joining in 2000.

In Britain, Reader plans to ramp up processing, figuring it will be easier and cheaper in a post-Brexit world to import raw ingredients that can come into the country on lower tariffs, rather than paying a range of tariffs on ingredients and containers in fully processed goods.

TIES BUILT UP OVER DECADES

The scale of the plan shows the challenges facing the food and drinks industry, the country’s largest manufacturing sector and one of the most deeply entwined with Europe.

Around 30 percent of Britain’s food and drink comes from the EU, with fruit and vegetables often imported, while 61 percent of the food and drink exported from Britain goes to the EU.

The close ties have built up during Britain’s more than 40 years in the EU. Reader fears that over time the regulations will now diverge on issues such as labelling and food standards, which would force him to manage his stock separately.

“Experience shows how different the regulations are,” he said, comparing how the United States and EU differ on approving certain ingredients. “When you look at how the EU gets legislation through, and the dissent you have on certain pieces, it’s going to happen over here.”

Britain has proposed a two-year transition period to help companies but the EU has yet to discuss the terms. In the meantime it is preparing a customs and tax regime that could operate if it leaves the EU with no deal.

Any introduction of tariffs would push the price of food up between 5 and 10 percent, the FDF’s Wright said, while any further devaluation of the pound would jack up import costs.

What sets Grace Foods apart from many of its peers is the fact that it is growing so quickly, with its popular branded drinks such as “Grace Ginger Beer” and “Say Aloe” helping to drive up European sales by around 30 percent a year.

Nick Harrison, the global co-head of the retail practice at consultants Oliver Wyman, said food manufacturers were weighing whether to invest to adapt the business or risk customs delays in the future.

“It’s risky to start building a factory without definitely knowing that you’re going to need it,” he said. “It isn’t totally irrational to still be doing contingency planning.”","In a sea of uncertainty, one company sets its Brexit course",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-companies-insight/in-a-sea-of-uncertainty-one-company-sets-its-brexit-course-idUKKBN1CH23N?il=0

Although many financial companies have plans to transfer some jobs to continental Europe to keep serving clients in the single market once Britain leaves the European Union, Hays said they were holding off on pulling the trigger.

“The pleasing part is that leavers (in London) are being replaced. This is encouraging for the future of the financial services industry in London. It will still be a very large business when we get through the Brexit part,” he added.

Venables said London banks were replacing departing staff in most roles, including in IT and compliance.

Smaller rival Robert Walters (RWA.L) said on Tuesday that risk, regulatory, audit and cybersecurity were the strongest job functions in finance at the moment.

Hays said banks had begun moving staff from Britain to Europe, but numbers remained relatively small.

It had not received requests for large-scale financial hiring in Europe, mirroring comments from PageGroup (PAGE.L) and Robert Walters earlier this week.

UK FEE INCOME STABILISES

Hays said net fees from its UK and Ireland operations rose 1 percent in the three months ended Sept. 30 on the same period last year, showing an improvement against a 5 percent fall in the preceding quarter.

Hays said its British private sector business continued to experience modest signs of improvement, and Venables forecast that growth in the UK over the next few quarters would remain in line with the first quarter.

“There’s still very tight cost control across most companies in the UK, but some of the investments that were put on hold a year ago, a small proportion of those are now being released,” he said.

The group, which gets about three quarters of its business from outside the UK, also noted growth across its other regions, pushing quarterly group net fees up 10 percent, ahead of consensus of a 8.5 percent rise.

Whilst Hays’ quarterly performance lagged Robert Walters which has broken ahead of the pack due to growth in its outsourcing business, it was broadly in line with the 8.8 percent growth reported by PageGroup on Wednesday. PageGroup noted a sharper decline in its British business from the previous quarter.

“We believe, investors are likely to focus on the marginal growth in UK, which will come as a relief for the market, following yesterday’s weaker than expected UK figures from PageGroup,” Panmure Gordon analyst Adrian Kearsey wrote.

The brokerage has a “hold” rating and a target price of 195 pence on Hays’ stock. The group’s shares were up 0.95 percent at 191.8 pence at 0930 GMT.",Banks filling London staffing gaps before Brexit - Hays,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-hays-results/banks-filling-london-staffing-gaps-before-brexit-hays-idUKKBN1CH0N4

(Reuters) - Rafael Nadal continued to scythe his way through the Shanghai Masters on Thursday, reaching the quarter-finals with a 6-3 6-1 thrashing of temperamental Italian Fabio Fognini.

The Spaniard needed two minutes over the hour to dispatch Fognini, taking his winning streak to 14 matches since the start of the U.S. Open where he claimed a 16th grand slam title.

The 31-year-old is closing in on finishing the year as world number one for the first time since 2013.

Fognini was playing the day after being handed a suspended ban from two grand slams and $96,000 fine for verbally abusing a female umpire at the U.S. Open.

Roger Federer, who was up against tricky Ukrainian Alexandr Dolgopolov later at the Qi Zhong Centre, is the only player who can stop Nadal sealing the year-end honour for a fourth time.

Former U.S. Open champion Juan Martin del Potro won the match of the day by stopping third seed Alexander Zverev, recovering from losing the opener to win 3-6 7-6(5) 6-4.

WASHINGTON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Chinese officials probably don’t read literary critic Harold Bloom. If they do, they are ignoring his advice to “make what is implicit ... finely explicit.” A dispute over whether the government will stand behind the potential liabilities of Syngenta (SYNN.S), a Swiss seed maker acquired by a Chinese state firm earlier this year for about $43 billion, shows the problems that result from habitual murkiness.

Syngenta is potentially on the hook for a big legal bill after U.S. farmers and agricultural firms claimed it sold them seeds for a strain of corn unapproved for export to the People’s Republic. China’s State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, which oversees central state-owned companies such as Syngenta’s parent, ChemChina, says the government won’t foot those costs. Rating agency Standard & Poor’s is now hinting it could strip away Syngenta’s prized investment-grade status. The seed maker’s immediate parent may be too indebted to help, with adjusted total debt of about 11 times EBITDA, according to Moody’s Investors Service.

At issue is a dynamic that plays out across China’s financial sector: implicit guarantees. It’s particularly rampant in local government financing, where investors assume – but without any actual confirmation – that the central government stands behind local governments, which in turn stand behind the companies they set up to fund projects. Even though Beijing’s actual support is uncertain, bond spreads between local governments and their financing vehicles, of which Fitch reckons around 4 trillion yuan ($610 billion) issued domestically since 2015 remain outstanding, are narrow.

That equilibrium works to Beijing’s interest. The official line keeps the door open for regulators to allow selective defaults, but avoid widespread blowups. Financially speaking, the unspoken promise that officials will step in if a crisis erupts keeps borrowing costs low.

In practice, Syngenta is now part and parcel of a state company. It would be better for the government to accept that, and show investors where the line really lies. Implicit guarantees distort capital flows and encourage investors to underprice risk. Then again, at a time when politicians and capital providers alike worry about the real levels of debt in China’s financial system, keeping things murky may seem like the safest strategy.",Breakingviews - Syngenta puts Beijing’s unspoken promises to test,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-syngenta-credit-rating-breakingviews/breakingviews-syngenta-puts-beijings-unspoken-promises-to-test-idUSKBN1CG0I6

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus directors publicly backed Chief Executive Tom Enders on Thursday in the face of European investigations into the use of middlemen in airplane sales and a $2 billion fighter deal.

But in a sign of the disquiet within the aerospace group, the board only declared its support for Enders after its own review of senior management, two people familiar with the matter said.

The investigations by Britain’s Serious Fraud Office and later its French counterpart were triggered by Airbus in 2016 when it reported itself to UK authorities after uncovering flawed documents over the use of intermediaries in airplane sales.

Enders and legal counsel John Harrison have come under fire from within Airbus and in the French media for opening the floodgates to widening investigations and for overseeing what several insiders have called an internal witch-hunt.

The Airbus board defended the decision to alert UK authorities to its initial findings.

“These decisions were made with the board’s unanimous approval and actions were all directed by Tom Enders, the company’s CEO,” it said in a statement.

“The Board has full trust and confidence in Tom and depends on his leadership to continue the transformation of the company and in particular our compliance program alongside our General Counsel, John Harrison,” it added.

The board’s own assessment of the group’s top executives was carried out over the summer and was commissioned to evaluate whether senior managers played any role that created risks for the company. No such evidence was discovered, the people said.

Enders has been placed under separate investigation in Vienna over a 2003 Eurofighter sale to Austria, but has denied any wrongdoing and says the probe is politically charged.

The board’s decision to examine its own top management highlights efforts being taken to restore stability after months of tension as the corruption row deepens.

Airbus Chairman Denis Ranque continues to support Enders, but people familiar with the discussions say he is choosing his words carefully pending the outcome of the probe.

“There is certainly some alarm at board level,” a person familiar with the discussions said.

Enders has promised to drive through sweeping changes in the company’s culture as legal experts say Airbus is preparing the ground for what it hopes could be a deal with UK prosecutors.

He told staff in a letter disclosed to Reuters last week to prepare for turbulence and that he and Harrison had the board’s unanimous backing to lead Airbus out of the legal crisis.",Airbus board backs CEO after reviewing top management,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-airbus-board/airbus-board-backs-ceo-after-reviewing-top-management-idUSKBN1CH180?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

As Reuters recently reported, the White House is preparing to shift oversight of the sale of American-manufactured small arms from the diligent State Department review process to the business-friendly Commerce Department. By loosening the inter-agency guidelines in an attempt to boost America’s share in the global marketplace, the Trump administration runs the risk of fueling the civil wars currently bringing misery to millions worldwide.

The aim of this policy is to enable U.S. weapons manufactures to sell their products overseas quickly by trimming the bureaucratic red tape now governing the export of non-military grade weapons and ammunition. According to the Reuters report, the new plan would mean that commercial gun exports would no longer be given the same scrutiny as missile and fighter jet sales, which often require congressional approval. The shift would also move weapons like assault rifles and handguns from the State Department’s tightly-restricted Munitions list to the Commerce Control Lists, which allows for more streamlined licensing for international sales. While the administration has explained these new procedures as a logical extension of a U.S. president who is solidly pro-business, the transfer of authority from Foggy Bottom will have unintended and damaging foreign policy repercussions.

In contrast to the significant decline in major conventional conflicts over the last 50 years, unconventional conflicts within a sovereign state’s territory, such as the current war in Syria, have become the new normal. Small weapons like AK-47’s assault rifles, Kalashnikovs, sniper rifles, and low-grade explosives are used in most of these confrontations. Indeed, the ease with which a combatant with little military training can use semi-automatic weapons on the battlefield is part of the weapons’ appeal.

Light arms have many advantages for guerilla armies: an AK-47 is a lot cheaper than a tank, a missile defense system, or a fighter aircraft and it can be smuggled across porous borders. As Senators Ben Cardin, Patrick Leahy, and Dianne Feinstein wrote in a letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in opposing the new rules, the civil wars and rebellions currently taking place are being fueled by the illegal sales of what many Americans would categorize as sports rifles or hunting equipment.

Relaxing the rules on small arms exports is counterproductive to the U.S. objective of de-escalating these conflicts. The new administration policy has the potential to squander the inclusive diplomatic processes Washington has encouraged in order to promote peaceful approaches to conflict resolution in states as varied as South Sudan, Ukraine, and Colombia. Multiple agencies and departments within the U.S. government would in effect be working against one another, with the State Department hoping to end the very hostilities that are sustained by American-manufactured weapons.

Washington would not be deliberately arming combatants in a civil war, but the handguns and assault rifles American firearms manufacturers sell on the open market could find their way to a conflict zone through smuggling and diversion. In one highly-publicized case last year, corrupt Jordanian intelligence officers sold a cache of rocket-propelled grenades and Kalashnikov rifles that were destined for the moderate Syrian opposition to arms merchants on the underground market. The FBI later determined that one of those weapons was likely to have been responsible for the shooting deaths of two American contractors in Jordan that same year.

The civil war in Libya illustrates the insecurity that can result when governments send weapons into a conflict zone without crafting the necessary oversight and security measures that help prevent them from being sold off elsewhere. During the 2011 armed rebellion against Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, Washington's Arab partners – with the secret blessing of the Obama administration – delivered military assistance to the rebels trying to oust the regime. While the military aid helped to drive Gaddafi from power after eight months of combat, that same equipment eventually helped fuel the civil war still ravaging Libya. Libyan militias previously concerned with overthrowing Qaddafi began stockpiling arms to increase their political leverage for later internal battles. The availability of weapons in Libya remains so overwhelming that U.N. experts have categorized the North African country as a regional weapons bazaar. Weapons that were sent into the country to aid the Libyan rebellion have been diverted to other regional conflicts, either through arms smuggling across lightly defended borders or through illicit arms deals. African officials claim that some of these arms likely assisted the jihadist Boko Haram group to recover after serious territorial losses against the Nigerian army.

According to the Small Arms Survey, the United States is already the world’s top exporter of small arms, having reached a total of $1.1 billion in 2014. While this figure is small compared to the far larger conventional weapons contracts U.S. defense manufacturers sign every year, the possibility that even a fraction of these commercial weapons could leak into a conflict zone would have a deeply negative impact.

The question is whether the monetary benefits that are likely to result from the administration’s new rules are enough to compensate for the instability and violence that are likely to increase with more small arms available for sale around the world. The ease with which U.S. arms companies will now be able to export their products may be terrific from a business perspective. But from the standpoint of international peace and security, this policy is a dangerous gamble for the White House to take.

WARSAW (Reuters) - South Korea’s LG Chem will open Europe’s largest lithium-ion battery factory in Poland next year as the region’s auto industry gears up to mass produce electric cars.

Tumbling battery prices and growing pressure to cut exhaust emissions have led carmakers to embrace electric vehicles. Manufacturers from VW Group (VOWG_p.DE) to Volvo Cars, Daimler and BMW plan to roll out a raft of new electric models in coming years.

But Europe lacks big-scale battery cell production facilities so those components are mostly imported from China and South Korea.

Calls are now growing for the region to develop its own battery industry to preserve jobs and profits, though Asian producers have a huge head start in development and scale.

LG Chem plans to spend 5.9 billion zlotys ($1.63 billion) on the factory near the southwestern city of Wroclaw, according to Polish state industry agency ARP.

Wroclaw is 190 kilometers (118 miles) from the border with Germany, home of VW Group which plans to invest more than 20 billion euros ($24 billion) in zero-emission vehicles by 2030 and make 3 million electric vehicles (EVs) a year by 2025.

LG Chem expects to produce up to 100,000 EV batteries in Poland annually from next year, it said on Thursday in a statement.

The factory will employ 2,500 people. LG Chem, a subsidiary of Korea’s LG Corp, did not name the likely customers but said they would include top car companies.

“The company has chosen Poland as the most competitive location for production to satisfy the needs of European and global car producers,” said Chang-Beom Kang, vice president at LG Chem.

It was not immediately clear if the factory would produce all the basic battery cells from scratch or import some components, but the statement said the site would include a research and development center employing “about 400 engineers from various specializations: automation, electronics, chemistry and IT”.

Asked about the source of lithium and other raw materials, a representative of LG Chem’s local arm said they would first be imported from the parent company in Korea and then hopefully from Polish suppliers.

DEMAND SURGE

The factory’s planned capacity is just a fraction of expected future demand.

Based on the typical capacity of a mid-market compact car like Nissan Leaf, 100,000 car batteries are equivalent to 4 GWh per year. This means the factory’s capacity could be slightly more than 10 percent of the production capacity that Tesla’s U.S. based “Gigafactory” is to reach in 2018.

Battery costs have been prohibitive but are falling rapidly. Average battery costs have come down from over $1,000 per kilowatt hour in 2010, to around $227 in 2016, according to analysts at Barclays.

In 2016, only 0.2 percent of new passenger cars sold in Europe were fully electric.

But Britain and France say they will ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2040 in an attempt to reduce air pollution, ending use of the fossil fuel-guzzling internal combustion engine.

LG’s Polish plant may not remain Europe’s largest car battery plant for long.

In September, Swiss engineering group ABB said it had joined a project to build Europe’s largest lithium-ion battery factory in Sweden targeting annual cell production equivalent to 32 gigawatt-hours by 2023, over 90 percent of Tesla’s Gigafactory target.

That project, named Northvolt, is led by a former manager at Tesla, which also plans to build a Gigafactory in Europe, though it has not said where.",LG to open Europe's biggest car battery factory next year,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lgchem-factory-poland/lg-to-open-europes-biggest-car-battery-factory-next-year-idUSKBN1CH21W?il=0

That hero, widely available in factories across the world, was the Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine.

Big, grey and boxy, CNC machines use pre-programmed guides to produce intricate parts for everything from automobiles and mobile phones to furniture and clothes. They offer accuracy that human machine tool operators are unable to achieve.

In North Korea, thanks to a combination of homemade technology and reverse engineering, the machines now play a critical role in the weapons programs. They allow Kim Jong Un to build nuclear bombs and missiles without relying as heavily on outside technical aid or imports.

Nuclear weapons experts say this has helped him accelerate missile and nuclear testing despite international sanctions on the transfer of sensitive equipment.

Interactive: Kim’s latest act of defiance

“North Korea’s centrifuges and new missiles all depend on components made with CNC machine tools,” said Jeffrey Lewis, head of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of Strategic Studies at Monterey, California.

“(They) are the essential underlying technology for producing missiles and nuclear weapons,” said Lewis.

Since 1996, CNC machines have been included in the Wassenaar Arrangement – an international arms control regime aimed at stopping the proliferation of equipment with both civilian and military uses. North Korea is not a signatory.

The country’s celebrations of its CNC technology have been fulsome. Hundreds of dancers in luminous orange and green performed the CNC pop song, titled “Break through the cutting edge,” at a Korean Workers’ Party celebration in 2010. In 2012, the year the South Korean hit “Gangnam Style” was released, the North’s CNC title was on karaoke machines nationwide, according to Choson Exchange, a Singapore-based company that trains North Koreans in business skills. The official video for the song opens with a long-range North Korean rocket soaring into a blue sky.

CUTTING EDGE

North Korea likely started to develop its own CNC machines in the early 1990s as part of a drive to build sophisticated missiles and nuclear weapons, nuclear experts say. It probably learned how to make them by taking apart machines it had imported from the Soviet Union.

Its first homemade CNC machine was introduced in 1995. Former leader Kim Jong Il gave the machine the “Ryonha” brand, according to a 2009 article in the country’s official newspaper, Rodong Sinmun. That was the first time state media mentioned the technology.

By 2009, the machines had become a mainstay of North Korean propaganda, as Pyongyang launched a nationwide campaign to boost domestic industry. Sanctions were mounting after its second nuclear test and a long-range missile launch that year.

At the time, arms control experts raised concerns about a visit by former leader Kim Jong Il to a North Korean factory where homemade CNC machines appeared to be producing aluminum tubes. These could be used for nuclear centrifuges.

“By around 2010, it seemed they were capable of manufacturing various types of CNC machines,” said Kim Heung-gwang, a North Korean defector who taught at Pyongyang’s Hamhung Computer Technology University before defecting to South Korea.

But it wasn’t until 2013 that the Korea Ryonha Machinery Joint Venture Corporation, which produced the machines, was blacklisted by the U.N. Security Council for supporting the weapons programs.

And it was only in August this year that U.S. intelligence officials told Reuters North Korea likely has the ability to produce its own missile engines themselves. (Full Story)

Now, Kim Heung-gwang estimates, North Korea has about 15,000 CNC machines. He bases this on North Korean state media reports and photos as well as interviews with more than a dozen defectors who were scientists, professors or factory workers.

MASS PRODUCTION

Pyongyang hailed the homemade machines as a triumph for its governing ideology of “Juche”, which champions self-sufficiency. But that wasn’t strictly true.

In August 2016, state media released photos of Kim Jong Un visiting a factory using CNC machines with the logo of Swiss engineering firm ABB ABB.UL, one of the leading players in the global CNC machine market. It’s not clear when or how the machine reached North Korea.

ABB said the firm respects all applicable trade sanctions against North Korea, and undertakes not to deliver ABB equipment to the country. “That said, we cannot rule out that some of our equipment may have been resold to DPR of Korea without our knowledge or permission,” the company said in response to a Reuters inquiry, using North Korea’s official title.

A United Nations panel monitoring sanctions on North Korea said in a report this year that Tengzhou Keyongda CNC Machine Tools Co of China had been a supplier of Pyongyang’s new CNC machines. A sales representative for Tengzhou Keyongda told Reuters the company stopped selling CNC machines to North Korea four years ago, and no longer maintains trade relations with the country.

Despite sanctions, CNC machines are commonplace across North Korean manufacturing and can be brought in through China and Russia, said Lee Choon-geun, a senior fellow at the Science and Technology Policy Institute in South Korea.

The biggest loophole has been that while some CNC machines are banned because they can have both military and civilian functions, most serve civilian industry. “Given their dual-use capability, you could even import the machines for other purposes, take them to pieces and use them however you want,” said Lee.

The CNC song highlights this in its opening line: “Whatever it is, once we put our mind to it, there’s a program to make it,” it says.",How a homemade tool helped North Korea's missile program,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1CH1I4-OCATP

U.S., Canadian and Mexican negotiators are meeting in Arlington, Virginia, this week for a fourth round to try to revise the 23-year-old agreement, which allows the tariff-free flow of vehicles and parts across the three borders.

U.S. President Donald Trump has criticized NAFTA for luring U.S. manufacturing jobs to low-wage Mexico and has vowed to quit the pact or revise it to reduce his country’s $64 billion trade deficit with its southern neighbor.

Ending NAFTA, however, would result in a full reversion to tariffs under World Trade Organization rules, according to the Boston Consulting Group study sponsored by the Motor Equipment Manufacturers Association. The U.S. auto parts industry employs about 870,000 workers.

Mexico and Canada would fare better because they previously charged higher tariffs than the United States and would revert to those levels. And with no trade incentive to manufacture in the United States other than to avoid the 25 percent truck tariff, more full vehicle production would migrate to low-cost countries such as China, auto experts say.

Job losses could be as much as 24,000 if renegotiations lead to requirements for content from North American and specifically the United States, according to the study.

NAFTA negotiators face tough new U.S. demands to increase regional content for autos to 85 percent from 62.5 percent, with 50 percent from the United States, according to people briefed on the plan.

The rules of origin demands are among several conditions that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has labeled “poison pill proposals” that threaten to torpedo the talks.

The auto parts study was conducted before these targets were revealed.

Raising the automotive content thresholds and forcing automakers to verify the North American origin of more electronics and other parts now sourced from Asia would cause some parts manufacturers to forego NAFTA benefits, said Ann Wilson, the association’s head of government affairs.

Instead, companies may ship in more products from low-cost countries outside the region, paying U.S. tariffs ranging from 2.5 to 5.0 percent.

“Instead of encouraging more U.S. content, these provisions will lead to less U.S. content,” Wilson said.","Ending NAFTA could cost U.S. up to 50,000 auto parts jobs: study",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trade-nafta-autos/ending-nafta-could-cost-u-s-up-to-50000-auto-parts-jobs-study-idUKKBN1CH1Z4

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian home resale prices in September staged their biggest fall in seven years, while new home prices were flat in August in the once red-hot markets of Toronto and Vancouver, adding to evidence that the country’s housing boom continued to cool, data showed on Thursday.

Prices dropped 0.8 percent in September from August, the first monthly decline since 2016 and the biggest since September 2010, according to the Teranet-National Bank Composite House Price Index, which measures changes for repeat sales of single-family homes.

National price gains also slowed on an annual basis, with prices up 11.4 percent from last year, compared to an annual increase of 13.1 percent in August.

Two recent interest rate hikes by the Bank of Canada have helped rein in demand, and analysts are divided over whether the market will manage a soft landing or see a U.S. style housing crash.

Price increases of more than 30 percent in Toronto early in the year sparked fears of a housing bubble, and the provincial government slapped a 15 percent foreign buyers tax on purchases in the city to cool speculation.

A separate report from Statistics Canada showed new home prices, excluding apartments and condominiums, nationally rose 0.1 percent in August, shy of forecasts for a 0.3 percent gain.

Prices were unchanged in 15 out of 27 markets, including Vancouver and Toronto.

It was the third month in a row showing unchanged new home prices in Toronto, Canada’s largest city.

In the home resale market, Toronto led September’s price decline with a 2.7 percent monthly drop, according to Teranet.

“Many might worry about the fact that the last time we saw a string of monthly (Toronto) declines of such magnitude was during the last economic recession. They should not ... market conditions appear to have stabilized over the last four months,” National Bank Financial economist Marc Pinsonneault said in a note to clients.

“If that is the case, a large part of the price correction to be seen in the Toronto home resale market might be behind us,” he added.

In Vancouver, where British Columbia implemented its own foreign buyers tax last year, prices were up 1.3 percent, Teranet said.

SAN JOSE, Calif. (Reuters) - Facebook Inc has begun overhauling how it handles political ads on its platform and may put some changes in place before U.S. elections next year, Facebook’s chief technology officer said on Wednesday.

U.S. congressional and state elections set for November 2018 present a deadline of sorts for Facebook and other social media companies to get better at halting the kind of election meddling that the United States accuses Russia of.

“We are working on all of this stuff actively now, so there is a big focus in the company to improve all of this on a regular basis,” Facebook CTO Mike Schroepfer said in an interview.

“You’re going to see a regular cadence of updates and changes,” he said, speaking on the sidelines of a conference that Facebook is hosting about virtual reality technology.

Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said last month that the company would begin treating political ads differently from other ads, including by making it possible for anyone to see political ads, no matter whom they target. U.S. lawmakers had begun calling for regulations.

Disclosures by Facebook, Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google that their products were battlegrounds for Russian election meddling last year have turned into a crisis for Silicon Valley.

Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, is in Washington this week meeting U.S. lawmakers.

Moscow has denied allegations of meddling in last year’s U.S. presidential election.

Implementing changes is tricky, Schroepfer said, because Facebook does not want to stifle legitimate speech and because of the volume of material on Facebook, the world’s largest social network with 2 billion users and 5 million advertisers.

“We’re investing very heavily in technical solutions, because we’re operating at an unprecedented scale,” he said.

Facebook is also using humans. The company said this month it would hire 1,000 more people to review ads and ensure they meet its terms.

Schroepfer, 42, has been Facebook’s CTO since 2013 and previously was director of engineering. He also sits on Facebook’s board of directors.

Facebook has dealt with problematic user-generated content in the past, he said.

“We don’t want misuse of the platform, whether that’s a foreign government trying to intercede in a democracy - that’s obviously not OK - or whether it’s an individual spewing hate or uploading pornography,” he said.",Facebook pushes ad overhaul before 2018 U.S. election: executive,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-advertising/facebook-pushes-ad-overhaul-before-2018-u-s-election-executive-idUKKBN1CH08U

The failure by Prime Minister Theresa May to win a parliamentary majority in last week's election has pushed the world's fifth largest economy toward a level of political uncertainty not seen since the 1970s.

May called the election to secure a mandate for her vision of a “hard Brexit” -- driving down migration by taking Britain out of the single market and the customs union.

Instead, she got a hung parliament in which no single party has a majority. Business leaders demanded a re-think.

“The UK has had a reputation, earned over the generations, for stability and predictability in its government,” a senior executive at a multi-national company listed on the London FTSE 100 told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

“That reputation in 12 months has been destroyed, truly destroyed. First by Brexit and now through this election.”

A survey by the Institute of Directors (IoD) found only 20 percent of its nearly 700 members were now optimistic about the British economy over the next 12 months, compared with 57 percent who were quite or very pessimistic.

The IoD survey, taken after the election, found a negative swing of 34 points in confidence in the economy from its previous survey in May.

“It is hard to overstate what a dramatic impact the current political uncertainty is having on business leaders, and the consequences could – if not addressed immediately – be disastrous for the UK economy,” said Stephen Martin, director general of the IoD.

The collapse in confidence, which follows a short-term drop after last year’s Brexit vote, coincides with a slowdown in the wider economy that has taken hold since the start of this year, as rising inflation pushes up the price of goods.

Figures from credit card firm Visa showed British consumers turned more cautious even before the shock election result, with households cutting their spending for the first time in nearly four years last month.

The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) warned there was now a risk businesses would cut back on investment which has largely held up since last year’s Brexit vote.

And the trade group that represents manufacturers, the EEF, said its members were having to navigate the most uncertain political territory in Britain for decades.

Both groups called on the government to rethink its approach to Brexit, saying the country needed tariff-free access to the single market and a steady flow of migrant workers.

Some executives hoped the political paralysis would lead to a ‘softer Brexit’, with access to markets prioritized over a clamp down on immigration.

“Here we are again: another bolt from the blue, a political earthquake that we didn’t think used to happen in the UK,” CBI Director General Carolyn Fairbairn said at a conference hosted by the Resolution Foundation.

“But I do think there are opportunities in this, and it is an opportunity to refocus back on the economy to talk about jobs, growth, future prosperity.”

Having slid to its lowest for nearly two months against the dollar on Friday, the pound fell broadly again on Monday.

LEFT IN LIMBO

Business executives warned the political uncertainty could be felt across a wave of sectors.

Leaders of the drugs industry warned of the hazards of government limbo at a critical time for the highly regulated sector as companies seek clarity on the rules that will govern their business after Brexit.

Andy Bruce, the CEO of Lookers (LOOK.L), one of Britain’s biggest car dealerships, said the lack of a clear result meant the highly successful industry had now entered “uncharted waters” in terms of how many new cars it could sell.

And Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP (WPP.L), the world’s largest advertising agency, told Reuters he feared increased economic uncertainty, which meant “weak investment and postponement of decision making.”

“Now it seems that we could have no deal because of the short time fuse and lack of decisive government decision making, or a soft Brexit, the latter with more movement and membership of the single market,” he said.

Bankers, at the heart of London’s huge financial center, cautioned of the impact on takeover activity.

“So long as uncertainty is there I don’t see that as particularly positive for M&A in the short term,” Karen Cook, chairman of investment banking at Goldman Sachs said at the Reuters Global M&A summit.

Gareth Vale, marketing director at recruitment group Manpower, said its clients were very apprehensive, and had not yet fully grasped the impact that Brexit would have.

“I think the uncertainty around Brexit, and more recently the general election, has created a sense of almost inertia, which has prevented them from considering some of the bigger seismic shifts that are on the horizon.”",Business confidence plummets as political crisis grips Britain,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-economy/business-confidence-plummets-as-political-crisis-grips-britain-idUSKBN1931P9

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Nerves are fraying in the Brexit talks, negotiators are trying to work out if the other side is bluffing about walking away, and a ticking clock is fast narrowing British options come March 2019.

Philip Hammond, Britain’s finance minister, echoed recent EU assertions when he said that a transition period to some new relationship was a “wasting asset”, the value of which would “diminish significantly” for both sides if its form remains unclear to businesses much after the start of the new year.

As negotiators in Brussels make little progress before Prime Minister Theresa May meets EU leaders next week, a warning about a breakdown in talks from a minister seen strongly to favor a business-friendly “bespoke” transition out of the EU came a day after the EU summit chair spoke of a similar new year deadline.

Donald Tusk said on Tuesday that if London fails to settle divorce terms by December, and so unlock talks on the transition and future trade pact, then the EU would reconsider its objectives. That reflects mounting doubts across Europe that any legal exit deal can be struck.

The longer the stand-off goes on, EU negotiators said, the more Britain’s choice come March 30, 2019, will be between the “hard Brexit” by which it will simply quit all EU systems and be treated like, say, Australia, and a virtual status quo, staying in most EU systems, without voting rights, rather like Norway.

“The closer we get, the less there is to discuss about a transition and the more it just goes to a standstill transition, with Britain still in everything, but without a vote,” one said.

“Pretty soon,” said another, “It will be Norway or nothing.”

While all such commentary reflects the sides’ jockeying for negotiating advantage, the evidence this week is that they remain far apart and are getting tetchy. May and the EU traded jabs over whose court “the ball” is in after the prime minister made concessions in a speech at Florence on Sept. 22.

Behind closed doors, British negotiators voiced outraged surprise that her offer was seen as insufficient to launch talks on the future relationship. “It’s hard to say it was genuine,” one EU official said of the show of emotion. “It’s a form of pressure.”

Brexit Secretary David Davis and EU negotiator Michel Barnier are due to give a news conference around noon (1000 GMT) on Thursday to give an update on the week’s progress.

BUSINESS WORRIES

Businesses are sounding the alarm. A German industry federation warned members to start preparing for a “very hard Brexit”. A senior representative of London’s financial services industry told a Brussels audience this week that a legal transition agreement must be reached by the end of this year.

“Most importantly, it must reflect the status quo,” said Catherine McGuinness of the City of London Corporation. “There is no feasibility in asking firms to transition to a transition. If uncertainty continues, businesses will vote with their feet.”

Hammond ruled out budgeting -- yet -- for more customs and border facilities, and few on the continent believe threats of a walkout they say would hurt Britain more than them.

So leaders will watch May’s struggle to unite her government and sit tight. One senior EU diplomat said British counterparts were in such a weak position that “sometimes I feel sorry them”.

For many in Brussels, that makes a virtual status quo after Brexit the increasingly likely outcome: “In March 2019, Britain will formally leave,” said another EU official.

“But de facto most of the existing arrangements will remain ... They will have their celebration of ‘independence’ and then we will sit down to talking business again.”

May insists a two-year transition period is enough to agree a new free trade pact, but many question that.

John Bruton, the former prime minister of Ireland, has recommended an alternative to either no deal at all or a virtual status quo transition -- just keeping Britain fully in the EU for four years beyond 2019.

Arguing that the two-year deadline set by Article 50 of the EU treaty raises the risk of talks collapsing, and that agreeing first a transition and then another accord is complex, Bruton said this week that Britain and the EU should agree to a six-year negotiating period, with Britain only leaving in 2023.

Neither wants any extension. But Bruton warned: “The present tight time frame ... increases the likelihood of miscalculation and of the UK leaving the EU with no deal at all.”","In Brexit poker, clock narrows transition options",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-transition/in-brexit-poker-clock-narrows-transition-options-idUSKBN1CG2O2?il=0

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Thursday morning, dragged down by media companies, while results from JPMorgan and Citigroup failed to fuel the optimism that has driven indexes to record highs.

JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Citigroup (C.N), which had already talked down third-quarter expectations, reported earnings that were better than Wall Street estimates even as trading revenues fell. The shares of both companies were little changed.

“After a long stretch of consecutive highs in the market, with earnings, even if they are slightly disappointing, or an even an aspect of earnings like bond trading at JPM, is more an excuse to selloff,” said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist for Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.

With the S&P 500 up about 14 percent in 2017, investors are betting on strong earnings growth across the S&P 500.

AT&T (T.N) tumbled 3.22 percent after the company said its third-quarter results took a hit from the string of hurricanes.

The company also said it lost video subscribers in the quarter. Brokerage Guggenheim downgraded Disney (DIS.N) and Viacom (VIAB.O) on worries over subscriber declines

That sparked fresh jitters in a sector that was hit a day earlier by President Donald Trump’s suggestion to challenge TV network licenses over ‘fake news’.

Comcast (CMCSA.O) fell 2.8 percent, Disney (DIS.N) fell 1 percent. Viacom sank 6.6 percent after warning that Charter Communications subscribers may lose access to its channels as the expiration looms for a distribution deal.

Clemons said earnings will probably heighten volatility, with lack of any other major developments to drive the market.

At 9:37 a.m. ET (1337 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was down 38.19 points, or 0.17 percent, at 22,834.7, the S&P 500 .SPX was down 4.38 points, or 0.17 percent, at 2,550.86 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was down 7.33 points, or 0.11 percent, at 6,596.22.

Ten of the 11 major S&P indexes were lower, led by a more than 2 percent fall in the telecom services index .SPLRCL due to AT&T’s declines.

The biggest drag, however, was from the consumer discretionary sector .SPLRCD, which fell 0.57 percent, weighed down by media stocks.

Energy stocks also fell, dragged down by a more than 1 percent drop in crude oil prices as U.S. fuel inventories rose despite efforts by OPEC to cut production.

General Motors (GM.N) fell 1.5 percent. The Wall Street Journal reported GM planned to cut production at a Detroit plant and lay off about 1,500 workers.

J.Jill (JILL.N) nearly halved to hit a record low of $4.96 after the women’s fashion retailer slashed its third-quarter forecast.

(Reuters) - Citigroup Inc’s (C.N) quarterly profit and revenue beat Wall Street expectations as the bank kept a tight lid on costs, booked a gain from an asset sale and saw strength in equity underwriting.

The bank’s trading revenue, despite falling 11 percent, was better than the 15 percent decline Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach forecast three weeks ago.

Trading revenue has cast a dark cloud over bank results. Rival JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) said its trading revenue fell 21 percent.

Citigroup shares were slightly higher at $75 in pre-market trade, while JPMorgan was up at $97.67. Wall Street banks have seen major declines in market trading activity, which was boosted last year on global macroeconomic uncertainty, especially around Brexit and the U.S. presidential election.

The fourth-biggest U.S. bank by assets said on Thursday total revenue rose about 2 percent to $18.17 billion, topping expectations of $17.90 billion. But revenue from fixed-income trading fell 16 percent to $2.88 billion.

There were bright spots as the bank’s much smaller equities trading business saw a 16 percent increase in revenue and investment banking, which includes equity underwriting, rose 14 percent.

Net income rose 7.6 percent to $4.13 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30. Earnings per share rose about 15 percent to $1.42 and trumped analysts’ average estimate of $1.32, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Expenses at the bank were $10.17 billion, 2 percent lower than last year.

Since taking over five years ago, Chief Executive Michael Corbat has been trying to boost shareholder value by cutting expenses, consolidation and buying back stock.

Return on tangible common equity rose to 8.4 percent from 7.8 percent. Corbat’s target for the measure of profitability is 10 percent in 2019 and 14 percent longer term.

Consumer credit is a cause for concern for the bank as Citigroup said its company-wide net credit losses rose 17 percent from a year earlier. It added $194 million to its loan loss reserves.

Total credit costs rose 15 percent to $2 billion.

Citigroup’s tangible book value per share, an accounting measure of net worth, was $68.55 at the end of September, up 6 percent from a year earlier.

While the referendum is non-binding and the final vote tally may not be known for several days (though it will certainly be “yes” to independence), the true results of America’s decades of war in Iraq are already clear.

Along with the ongoing decimation of Iraq's Sunni population, the referendum means that in practice ""Iraq"" no longer exists. In its place is a Shiite state dominated by Iran, the de facto new nation of Kurdistan, and a shrinking population of Sunnis tottering between annihilation or reservation-like existence, depending on whether the United States uses the last of its influence to sketch out red lines or abandons the people to fate.

The waste comes in that a better version of a de facto tri-state Iraq was available in 2006. Every life lost (out of a million some, including 4,424 Americans), every dollar spent (in the trillions), and every unanticipated outcome suffered (rise of Islamic State, conflict in Syria, de-democratization of Turkey) since then has been unnecessary.

Tania Karas: At the UN, Trump’s silences spoke volumes

The post-World War One failure to create a Kurdish state resulted in 30 million Kurds scattered across modern Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Syria. The 2003 American invasion of Iraq destroyed civil order in much of the area populated by those Kurds, and opened the door to Iranian influence. Iran and its Iraqi Shiite allies directed political violence against Iraqi Sunnis, paving the way for a Sunni protector, Islamic State, to move in.

When the American-trained (cost: $25 billion) Iraqi national army dropped its weapons and ran in 2014, and Shiite militias proved too weak to fill the breach, Obama reinserted the American military into Iraq, saving the Kurds, by then also under threat from Islamic State. The United States subsequently turned those Kurdish fighters loose in Iraq and later Syria against Islamic State. It was expediency over strategy; there was no force otherwise available in bulk.

And it kind of worked. In the short run.

The Kurds, with American help, blunted Islamic State’s progress. The problem was that while American diplomacy, the carrot-and-stick of aid, and the difficulty of maintaining long-distance logistics saw the Kurdish forces replaced by Shiite militias in some locations, the Kurds held on to their gains in the north, having in most instances displaced Iraqi Sunnis. Victorious and bloodied, the Kurds were not about to renounce their hard-earned gains.

The need for American arms did force Kurdish leaders to postpone an independence referendum, opposed by Washington, in 2014. Three years later, with Islamic State mortally weakened, Washington no longer holds sway over Kurdish ambitions. And although the Sept. 25 referendum has no legal force, Kurdish leaders will use the vote to push Baghdad for full autonomy. Donald Trump, the fifth consecutive American president to make war on Iraq, may be the last simply for lack of an Iraq to fight over.

The ground truth of autumn 2017 -- a Kurdistan in the north, a Shiite state in the south, a marginalized Sunni population out west -- is pretty much the deal that could have been had in 2006 when then-Senator Joe Biden proposed dividing Iraq into statelets. Biden wanted the United States to leave a ""residual force to combat terrorists and keep the [three] neighbors honest.” The Senate actually passed a resolution supporting Biden's idea.

It probably would have stabilized the region. The Middle East in 2006 was a very different place.

In 2006 Iran faced an American military as yet undamaged by an additional decade of grinding war. That military sat on both Iran's western border with Iraq and its eastern border with Afghanistan. The Iranian nuclear program was years behind where it is today. Syria was a relatively stable place under not-then-yet-enemy of the free world Bashar al-Assad; indeed, the British-educated Assad was initially seen as a minor reformer. Turkey was stable. Russia was not a major player in the Middle East.

With many of 2017's regional Pandoras still in the box, by Middle Eastern standards security in a divided Iraq would have been manageable via a modest American military presence.

Instead, events of the last decade mean the chance of Kurdish independence adding to regional stability is near zero. Iran, fearing that an independent Kurdish state could threaten its own sectarian balance, is already conducting maneuvers on the border, has canceled flights to and from Kurdistan, and will push its proxies in Baghdad to take action. Will Turkey, now politically distant from NATO, move to open war over disputed borderlands with Kurdistan? The Turkish parliament just extended its authorization for cross-border incursions for another year. Will Kurdish minorities in Turkey and Iran see this all as their moment to rise? Will Israel, which backs Kurdish independence in its search for regional allies, supply weapons?

In a best-case scenario, where everyone tacitly acknowledges Kurdistan while maintaining the status quo (as with Taiwan, which officially exists as a part of China even as it acts like an independent nation) there may be a measure of stability in the near term. Baghdad will talk tough even as it allows the Kurds a surprising amount of free reign -- for example, Baghdad has withdrawn its police from contested Kirkuk, leaving Kurdish forces fully in charge of the oil-rich city. Kurdistan already has full control over its own education, security, military, taxes, and diplomatic representation. Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdistan regional government, has experimented with diplomatically vague language, saying “self-determination wouldn't mean a direct separation from Iraq.”

Darker predictions involve Syrian-Russian forces contesting Kurdish occupiers inside Syria. Iranian-backed Shiite militias have signaled plans to re-enter Kirkuk, and Turkey already has a running war with Kurdish fighters; tank maneuvers are ongoing with new threats gushing out of Ankara.

American policy has been a blurry gray for some time, calling for the referendum to be postponed without actually supporting or opposing independence. Traditionally the State Department favored a united Iraq somehow, while the Pentagon, with its history of in-the-dirt cooperation with Kurdish fighters stretching back to the 1991 no-fly zone and Operation Provide Comfort that essentially established the preliminary borders of Kurdistan, has been more sympathetic towards independence. The wording of America’s reaction (there has been no post-election statement issued as this is written) to the referendum could signal which part of government is making foreign policy in Iraq these days.

What seems clear is the American role going forward will be mostly limited to diplomacy, and that, regardless of who is carrying out the task, is not the country’s strong suit these days. There seems no appetite in Washington for large-scale troop redeployments, the kind of boots-on-the-ground necessary to decisively shape events.

The American military, which once could have played a role similar to its help in bringing peace to former Yugoslavia, instead will exist as a crumple zone among its own warring semi-allies.

MUMBAI/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Profits from India’s top firms are expected to have swung back to growth in July-September from a decline in the previous quarter, though economic headwinds are likely to have kept the pace of growth sluggish.

The latest results are critical for investors, marking the first quarter since the rollout of a national goods and services tax (GST) on July 1 and coming amid a wider retreat in share markets on investor concern about stocks being overvalued.

Forecasts compiled by Reuters show net profits are expected to rise 12.8 percent in the latest quarter for members of the main NSE index, known as Nifty, marking a recovery from the 1 percent fall in net profits in April-June.

That would be less than half the 33 percent increase posted in the January-March quarter and lag the 17.7 percent rise in October-December last year.

Profits are expected to be driven by energy and metals firms benefiting from stronger commodity prices, while telecoms are expected to post weak results due to aggressive competition. Drug makers profits are also likely to have suffered, mostly from regulatory challenges in the key U.S. market.

However, the impact of India’s new GST on earnings remains the biggest unknown for investors positioning themselves for the earnings season.

Uncertainty caused by companies rushing to prepare for the new tax and cutting production dented profits in the April-June quarter more than analysts had initially expected.

Fund managers now warn another disappointing set of results could hurt India’s recent bull run.

Nilesh Shah, managing director at Kotak Mahindra Asset Management, said markets were pricing in a recovery in earnings in the next 3-5 quarters.

He said markets would correct if earnings don’t show a solid recovery.

Meanwhile, operating profits are expected to rise 11.5 percent from a year earlier, while revenues are expected to advance 6.5 percent.

The results come at a time of deep uncertainty for markets. The Nifty has fallen about 1.9 percent since hitting a record high on Sept. 19, amid heavy foreign selling and rising worries as economic growth slows to its weakest pace in three years.

The Nifty is trading at a price to current fiscal year’s earnings (PE) ratio of 21.3, a healthy premium over the historic five-year average of 16.8.

Investors say the GST’s impact is hard to measure given it can affect virtually every aspect of the economy from consumer purchases to industrial production. Some manufacturers are expected to have restored inventory levels in the latest quarter.

“We had seen an uptick in terms of re-stock in July, which was positively received by the markets,” said Sunil Sharma, chief investment officer at Sanctum Wealth Management.

(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) said it would hire 120,000 workers in the United States this holiday season, same as last year, as the online behemoth prepares for the holiday shopping frenzy.

Shoppers this year will shell out more on gifts during the holidays, according to industry surveys, as a tightening job market, rising home prices and stock markets that are hovering at record highs boost consumer confidence, increasing their intent and ability to spend.

Amazon on Thursday said the seasonal jobs will be spread out over more than 75 fulfillment centers countrywide to help pick, pack and ship holiday orders. It also said it expects to convert thousands of these positions to full-time roles.

U.S. shoppers will spend between $678.75 billion and $682 billion on holiday shopping this year, a growth of 3.6 percent to 4 percent over last year, according to the National Retail Federation (NRF).

This forecast includes online shopping, which is expected to accelerate its pace of growth to 11-15 percent to about $140 billion.

As a result, several U.S. retailers, including Macy’s Inc (M.N) and Kohl’s Corp (KSS.N), have been focusing on their online businesses and have ramped up hiring seasonal workers to man their distribution centers that support online operations.

Department store operator Target Corp (TGT.N) was the most bullish employer for the holiday season, hiring 43 percent more temporary workers this year than last year.

Target said it would hire 100,000 temp workers, banking on its successful turnaround efforts, which saw it report its first rise in comp sales in more than a year in August.

The U.S. government has sanctioned individuals and entities with ties to the Guard in the past, including a special forces unit in 2007. But historically Washington has shied away from labelling as terrorists any military belonging to a recognized government, partly because it would open up American troops to the same label. Analysts say the move can be risky as it means soldiers on both sides lose protections granted by the Geneva Convention. For example, American civilians detained in Iran have often received long and harsh treatment in the past, but when a U.S. Navy crew was captured in Iranian waters last year it was an embarassment, but the sailors were released the next day.

(Reuters) - Firefighters struggled overnight to halt the spread of wildfires known to have killed 23 people in North California, preparing for winds to shift after one town threatened by flames evacuated all residents.

The edge of the deadly Tubbs fire was less than two miles (3km) from Calistoga, a Napa Valley community whose 5,000 residents left their homes on Wednesday.

Whether the town burns “is going to depend on the wind,” its Fire Chief Steve Campbell told Reuters early on Thursday. “High winds are predicted, but we have not received them yet.”

Tubbs is one of nearly two dozen fires spanning eight counties that, raging largely unchecked since igniting on Sunday, have left hundreds of residents unaccounted for.

They have also charred around 170,000 acres (69,000 hectares) of land and destroyed some 3,500 buildings since.

While their cause has not been conclusively determined, they are thought to have been sparked by power lines toppled by gale force winds, and fanned by hot, dry “Diablo” winds that blew into northern California toward the Pacific.

New advisory evacuations were also issued in Sonoma County late on Wednesday for parts of Santa Rosa, the largest city in the state’s world-renowned wine country, and Geyserville, an unincorporated town of 800 people.

“The winds are predicted to be very erratic,” said county spokesman Barry Dugan. “There will be burst of high gusts that can be ... very unpredictable and difficult when you are fighting a fire and also for residents who we are trying to keep posted.”

Wildfires have damaged or demolished at least 13 Napa Valley wineries, a vintners’ trade group said on Tuesday.

Around 25,000 people remained under evacuation on Wednesday as the fires belched smoke that drifted south over the San Francisco Bay area, where some residents donned face masks.

STILL MISSING

More than 285 people were still missing in Sonoma County late on Wednesday night, the sheriff said on Twitter. It was unclear how many might be fire victims rather than evacuees who had not checked in with authorities.

In Santa Rosa, blocks in some neighborhoods resembled war zones, with little left but charred debris, broken walls, chimneys and the steel frames of burned-out cars.

The 23 recorded deaths make the fires the deadliest in the state since 1991, with Tubbs, which has accounted for 13 fatalities, the worst single blaze since 2003, according to state data.

In addition to high winds, the fires have been stoked by an abundance of thick brush left tinder dry by a summer of hot, dry weather.

Matt Nauman, spokesman for the region’s main utility, Pacific Gas & Electric, said many power lines had fallen during gales that packed gusts in excess of 75 miles (120km) per hour.

California Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency in several northern counties, as well as in Orange County in Southern California, where a fire in Anaheim destroyed 15 structures and damaged 12.

Ankara/Washington (Reuters) - Die Türkei hat den USA vorgeworfen, einen Verdächtigen in der amerikanischen Vertretung in Istanbul zu verstecken.

Die Polizei suche die Person im Zusammenhang mit dem gescheiterten Militärputsch, sagte Präsident Recep Tayyip Erdogan am Donnerstag. Damit verschärft sich der Visa-Streit zwischen den Nato-Verbündeten. Für den Konflikt sei der US-Botschafter in der Türkei verantwortlich, ergänzte Erdogan. Er hatte am Dienstag erklärt, John Bass nicht mehr als US-Vertreter anzuerkennen. Die USA hatten am Sonntag angekündigt, dass ihre Botschaft in Ankara die Vergabe von Visa vorübergehend einstelle. Anlass war die Festnahme eines türkischen Mitarbeiters des US-Konsulats in Istanbul. Wenig später kündigte die türkische Vertretung in Washington ebenfalls einen vorläufigen Visa-Stopp an.

“Es ist inakzeptabel, dass die USA einen strategischen Partner für einen Botschafter opfert, der seinen Platz nicht kennt”, sagte Erdogan vor Provinz-Gouverneuren in Ankara. Der Verdächtige habe Verbindungen zu dem in den USA lebenden türkischen Geistlichen Fethullah Gülen. Dieser ist nach Darstellung der Türkei der Drahtzieher des Putschversuchs im vergangenen Jahr. Auch der inhaftierte US-Botschaftsmitarbeiter soll über entsprechende Verbindungen verfügen. Die USA haben dessen Festnahme als ungerechtfertigt bezeichnet. Gülen weist die Vorwürfe zurück.

Türkische Regierungsvertreter erklärten zuletzt, der Streit könne schnell gelöst werden. Erdogans Sprecher Ibrahim Kalin sagte in Istanbul, die Krise “könnte an einem Tag beigelegt werden”. Am Mittwoch hatte der türkische Vize-Ministerpräsident Mehmet Simsek in Washington erklärt, der Streit sei übertrieben. Er gehe davon aus, dass das Problem bald behoben werde. Für seine Regierung habe die Sicherheit der US-Diplomaten und von deren Angestellten in der Türkei “Top-Priorität”.

Trading revenue has cast a dark cloud over bank results. Rival JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) said its trading revenue fell 21 percent.

Citigroup shares were slightly higher at $75 in pre-market trade, while JPMorgan was up at $97.67. Wall Street banks have seen major declines in market trading activity, which was boosted last year on global macroeconomic uncertainty, especially around Brexit and the U.S. presidential election.

The fourth-biggest U.S. bank by assets said on Thursday total revenue rose about 2 percent to $18.17 billion, topping expectations of $17.90 billion. But revenue from fixed-income trading fell 16 percent to $2.88 billion.

There were bright spots as the bank’s much smaller equities trading business saw a 16 percent increase in revenue and investment banking, which includes equity underwriting, rose 14 percent.

Net income rose 7.6 percent to $4.13 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30. Earnings per share rose about 15 percent to $1.42 and trumped analysts’ average estimate of $1.32, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Expenses at the bank were $10.17 billion, 2 percent lower than last year.

Since taking over five years ago, Chief Executive Michael Corbat has been trying to boost shareholder value by cutting expenses, consolidation and buying back stock.

Return on tangible common equity rose to 8.4 percent from 7.8 percent. Corbat’s target for the measure of profitability is 10 percent in 2019 and 14 percent longer term.

Consumer credit is a cause for concern for the bank as Citigroup said its company-wide net credit losses rose 17 percent from a year earlier. It added $194 million to its loan loss reserves.

Total credit costs rose 15 percent to $2 billion.

Citigroup’s tangible book value per share, an accounting measure of net worth, was $68.55 at the end of September, up 6 percent from a year earlier.

BRASÍLIA (Reuters) - Com o voto de desempate da presidente do Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF), Cármen Lúcia, a corte definiu que a adoção de medidas cautelares que restrinjam a atuação de um parlamentar, como o afastamento dele de suas atividades legislativas, precisa do aval da Câmara dos Deputados ou do Senado.

Cármen deu o sexto e decisivo voto a favor de que a decretação pelo Supremo desse tipo de cautelar contra deputado e senador tem de ser submetida à autorização posterior da respectiva Casa Legislativa.

A posição da presidente do Supremo, uma espécie de voto intermediário, terá repercussão direta no caso do senador Aécio Neves (PSDB-MG). O tucano foi afastado pela segunda vez este ano das suas atividades, a mais recente delas por decisão da Primeira Turma do STF.

Cármen Lúcia articulou pessoalmente uma solução a fim de diminuir a tensão entre o Judiciário e o Senado, tendo conversado com o presidente da Casa, Eunício Oliveira (PMDB-CE), e colocado em pauta o julgamento desta quarta. O Senado marcou uma sessão para a próxima terça-feira, dia 17, a fim de decidir se revoga a decisão da Turma do Supremo que afastou Aécio.

O STF julgou uma ação movida por PP, PSC e Solidariedade que pretendiam garantir que medidas cautelares do Supremo têm de ser enviadas para a Câmara ou Senado a fim de que eles decidam em até 24 horas sobre a sua aplicação, nos mesmos moldes do que prevê a Constituição para o caso de prisão em flagrante de parlamentar por crime inafiançável.

INAPLICÁVEL

No início do julgamento, o relator da ação, ministro Edson Fachin, havia votado contra a necessidade de o STF precisar de uma autorização posterior para a validade de medidas cautelares contra parlamentares.

Para Fachin, é “evidentemente inaplicável” qualquer submissão de uma decisão cautelar do Judiciário ao crivo do Poder Legislativo. Isso significaria, destacou, uma indevida ampliação da imunidade do parlamentar, interferindo na independência do Judiciário.

“Estender essa competência para permitir a revisão, por parte do Poder Legislativo, das decisões jurisdicionais sobre medidas cautelares penais, significa ampliar referida imunidade para além dos limites da própria normatividade que lhe é própria, em ofensa ao postulado republicano e à própria independência do Poder Judiciário”, afirmou o relator, em seu voto.

Primeiro a votar após o relator, contudo, o ministro Alexandre de Moraes divergiu de Fachin e votou a favor de que cabe à Câmara e ao Senado decidir se concorda com a adoção da medida cautelar.

Em seu longo voto, Moraes fez uma digressão histórica para destacar que a imunidade é uma prerrogativa que existe há mais de 400 anos para impedir qualquer tipo de restrição à atividade do parlamentar.

Para ele, o Supremo tem de se preocupar com a defesa da separação de Poderes e suas prerrogativas, mesmo diante das críticas da população em geral contra a atuação do Congresso.

“No momento em que vive o Parlamento brasileiro, no gravíssimo momento, com inúmeros deputados e senadores sendo investigados, processados, perdendo mandato, com a população corretamente desgostosa com a atuação parlamentar, nesse momento mais ainda que esta Casa, o Supremo Tribunal Federal, se preocupar com o continenti e não com o conteúdo”, destacou.

Os ministros Dias Toffoli, Ricardo Lewandowski, Gilmar Mendes, Marco Aurélio Mello e Cármen Lúcia acompanharam-no. Toffoli, por exemplo, defendeu que nesses casos o ato emanado do Poder Judiciário deverá ser submetido ao controle político da Casa Legislativa.

“O Supremo Tribunal Federal não pode atuar como fomentador de tensões institucionais, porque, a meu ver, viria a ocorrer caso se suprimisse do poder Legislativo o legítimo controle de medidas”, avaliou.

OLIMPO

No voto decisivo, Cármen Lúcia afirmou que não se trata de um desrespeito a submissão de uma medida cautelar que restringe a atuação do parlamentar à respectiva Casa Legislativa. Para ela, contra uma decisão judicial cabem recursos, mas não desacatos.

“Todos os Poderes atuam livre e igualmente e é dessa harmonia que podemos ter essa condição de uma democracia. Qualquer interpretação de que um dos Poderes possa atuar desconhecendo a atuação do outro é uma interpretação equivocada”, disse.

“Estamos falando de um Estado e não um olimpo, nenhum poder está acima dos outros”, completou.","Por 6 votos a 5, STF define que afastamento de parlamentar precisa de aval do Congresso",https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idBRKBN1CH03J-OBRDN

FRANKFURT/BERLIN (Reuters) - Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) reinforced its position as Germany’s largest airline on Thursday by signing a 210 million euro ($249 million)deal to buy large parts of insolvent Air Berlin (AB1.DE).

Lufthansa plans to use the Air Berlin assets to quickly expand its Eurowings budget business. News of the deal pushed Lufthansa shares up more than 3 percent to their highest level in nearly 17 years.

Air Berlin, which has struggled to turn a profit over the last decade, filed for insolvency on Aug. 15, and a government loan has kept its planes aloft while its administrator negotiated with prospective buyers for parts of the business.

Lufthansa has agreed to acquire Air Berlin’s Austrian leisure travel airline Niki, its LG Walter regional airline and 20 additional aircraft, Air Berlin said in a statement.

“This contract provides new opportunities for jobs for a large part of our workforce. But we can only really breathe again when the EU Commission approves the deal,” Air Berlin Chief Executive Thomas Winkelmann said.

Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr said earlier he expected the European Union to approve the transaction by the end of 2017.

Talks to sell some of Air Berlin’s remaining assets to Britain’s easyJet (EZJ.L) and other bidders are continuing, Air Berlin said, without providing details.

EasyJet, which has a base at Berlin’s Schoenefeld airport, has been discussing acquiring 27 to 30 planes. Air Berlin previously said others, such as Thomas Cook’s (TCG.L) Condor, could pick up some parts of the business.

EasyJet declined to comment on the progress of talks on Thursday.

BIG INVESTMENTS

Lufthansa CEO Spohr told a German paper earlier that his airline would be investing around 1.5 billion euros in total as a result of the Air Berlin deal.

That sum includes investment in new planes, for which the board freed up 1 billion euros of funds last month, the purchase price and the costs of taking on new staff.

LONDON (Reuters) - Liverpool and Manchester United’s globe-trotting squads must shake off the effects of international duty for one of English football’s most eagerly-anticipated clashes on Saturday.

According to Sky Sports their players clocked up 139,000 miles taking part in World Cup qualifiers since the last Premier League action, but all roads lead to Anfield as the English top flight resumes after a two-week hiatus with a potential cracker.

The stoppage was badly-timed for United who won their last three Premier League games with nine goals scored and none conceded, albeit against sides in the lower half of the table.

Jose Mourinho’s side, joint leaders on 19 points from seven games with Manchester City, will hope to continue that momentum in what will be their biggest test of the season to date.

Liverpool’s form has been less impressive and Juergen Klopp’s side, beset by defensive problems, are seven points off the searing pace being set by the two Manchester rivals.

They are also without a Premier League victory over bitter adversaries United in their last six meetings but Mourinho says recent history will have no bearing on Saturday.

“These kind of matches, every single moment plays a part,” Mourinho told Sky Sports. “We are playing against a good team with very good players. Form doesn’t matter, the moment doesn’t matter. It’s a match of three points.”

United will be missing midfielder Marouane Fellaini, who hurt his knee playing for Belgium against Bosnia, while Paul Pogba is still absent with an injury.

Liverpool have a potentially more significant absentee, however, with forward Sadio Mane facing a six-week layoff after injuring his hamstring representing Senegal.

City, who have built up a goal difference of plus 20 during a stunning start to the campaign, host Stoke City with striker Sergio Aguero possibly in contention for a squad place after recovering from injuring his ribs in a car accident last month.

Tottenham Hotspur, in third place, will attempt to lay their Wembley jinx in the league at the fourth time of asking as they host Bournemouth, while fourth-placed champions Chelsea, beaten by City before the international break, visit Crystal Palace.

Toothless Palace are the first top-flight side to lose their opening seven games since Portsmouth in 2009 and the first in 129 years of the Football League to do so without scoring.

Fifth-placed Arsenal are at Watford, while Burnley, the surprise package so far in sixth, will fancy their chances of when they tackle West Ham United at Turf Moor.

West Ham boss Slaven Bilic has leapfrogged Everton’s Ronald Koeman as favourite to be the next managerial casualty after his side’s woeful start.

Liberals have a tricky task ahead, to address two different publics: one alarmed by hate speech and militant messages, the other by measures to stop them.","In a flurry of confident pronouncements within an hour of the massacre at a Las Vegas country music festival, conservative commentators and activists linked the perpetrator, Stephen Paddock, to liberal or Islamist influences. Rush Limbaugh, still the doyen of right-wing talk radio, credited Islamic State with being Paddock’s ideological home, arguing that it was disguised by the liberal media because “for the American left, there is no such thing as militant Islamic terrorism.” Pat Robertson, the socially conservative activist and televangelist, said the shooting stemmed from the news media’s and liberal protesters’ “profound disrespect for our president” and other institutions.

On the other side of the American culture war, a CBS vice president and legal counsel, Hayley Geftman-Gold, posted a Facebook comment that she was “not even sympathetic” to the victims because “country music fans often are Republican gun toters.” Unlike her right wing opposites, she suffered for her opinion: she was fired from what must have been a lawyer’s dream job.

Should any of these comments ­­­− the work of, at most, a few minutes when not that of a few seconds − be the concern of the state? They easily fall into the category of bad taste. Some remarks, especially Geftman-Gold’s sneeringly callous comment – for which she has since apologized – could cause further misery in those seeking to cope with the trauma of injury or loss of someone close to them.

The general opinion, especially in the United States, is that governments should stay out of it. For Washington, the anger such remarks may rouse and the distress they may cause must be endured in deference to the near-absolute right of free speech protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

But should we tolerate such verbal brutality? Can it not be “cured?” Do people have to suffer distress because of the voiced prejudices of others who often – as Limbaugh does – make a rich living from their display? There’s a growing faction saying no, and it has reached, at least in Europe, the stage of state action. The European Union Justice Commissioner, Vera Jourova has told the social media giants, such as Facebook and Twitter, that they must eliminate both hate speech and fake news, or face legislation criminalizing them for not doing so. That’s a sweeping statement: unpacking what it might mean in practice takes us deep into an area which should be marked with signs saying: “Danger! Free speech in Peril!”

Fake news is not the same as hate speech, but it can also be used to inflame social tensions. In Italy, the anti-trust chief Giovanni Petruzella has said that EU countries should create government-appointed bodies to remove fake news and even fine the media for violations. But how is fake news to be distinguished, by either artificial or human intelligence, from true news? It’s a delicate operation, since much news striving to be “true” contains false information, and much fake news has the ring of truth and would take careful investigation to disprove.

In Germany, a new law came into force this month criminalizing some digital platforms being used for hate speech. Called, challengingly, the Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz, NetzDG for short, it commands that Facebook and Twitter take down “blatantly illegal” hate speech within 24 hours or, if the offending material is less obviously illegal, in a week – on pain of a fine of up to 50 million euro ($58.6 million). The problem with it, critics claim, is that it is imprecise about what constitutes hate speech. It merely points to the passage in the German Criminal Code which declares the ""defamation of religions, religious and ideological associations"" illegal. What is defamation? When is one person’s unbearable insult another’s opinion?

Sticks and stones may break my bones/But words will never hurt me” has been a comfort of sorts to those who have been the victims of taunting and insult, but modern psychiatry claims it isn’t so. Lisa Feldman Barrett, professor of psychology at Northeastern University, in a careful parsing of what constitutes harmful speech, argues that “there is a difference between permitting a culture of casual brutality and entertaining an opinion you strongly oppose. The former is a danger to a civil society (and to our health); the latter is the lifeblood of democracy.” Speech of the first kind, which “bullies and torments,” is “from the perspective of our brain cells… literally a form of violence.”

Put that way, it appears obvious: the speech which harms should be criminalized, as much as a physical assault, and in parts of Europe it is being so. Facebook, Twitter and Google are now under increasing state and public pressure to clean up their sites, to stop posting material that causes more than distress but, apparently, real damage to the brain. Embattled UK Prime Minister Theresa May spoke out at the United Nations last month, calling on the tech companies to go much further and faster in combating the dangerous messages they carry.

At a background-only session with Google staff in London this past week, where these issues were broached, I was told that the concerns of governments and the public were registered, and reform was on the way.

When I quoted the view of Fiyaz Mughal, head of the anti-extremist British advocacy organization Faith Matters, that the companies with which he had been working are “not dealing with the problem” because their “bottom line is money,” I was met with an assurance that this was not so. The automatic default of the communications behemoths to absolutism in free speech has been replaced, it was said, by a finer-grained examination of cause and effect, and of what could reasonably be done to address concerns.

It’s true that to juggle the demands of free speech and those of security now constitutes one of the largest ethical and practical problems facing democratic states − and the tech corporations. And it’s also true that even if Mughal is right that the companies’ first care is the bottom line – for which corporation is that not true? – the large fines now being prepared for not heeding the call to reform would be a large incentive to change.

Yet in the course of this complex balancing act, between security and liberty, profit and regulation, there is the danger of substantial damage to the freedoms of speech and the news media which democracies have been able to safeguard for most of the post-World War Two period.

LONDON (Reuters) - HSBC (HSBA.L) has chosen John Flint as its next chief executive, with its newly arrived chairman promoting an insider to drive revenue growth at Europe’s biggest bank.

Flint, who runs HSBC’s retail and wealth management business out of London, will take over as CEO in February next year when Stuart Gulliver, 58, retires after seven years in the job.

The appointment is the first major decision taken by former AIA Group (1299.HK) chief Mark Tucker, who officially took up his post at HSBC just 12 days ago as its first externally-appointed chairman.

Flint, who is not related to Tucker’s predecessor Douglas Flint, is viewed by other HSBC executives as the safe option, having worked at the bank since 1989.

During his career at HSBC Flint, 49, has worked across most of its businesses and spent his first 14 years in Asia, giving him the breadth of experience seen as vital for the CEO role.

“He has a great understanding and regard for HSBC’s heritage, and the passion to build the bank for the next generation,” Tucker said in a statement.

Flint emerged as the forerunner in the past six months as expectations HSBC could appoint its first external CEO in its 150-year history waned on the back of a rally in its share price.

The bank’s stock is up 14 percent so far this year, though was little moved on Thursday following the announcement of Flint’s appointment.

“It’s good news - it’s important to mix an insider with the new outside chairman and continue on the path set by the current team,” said Hugh Young, head of Asia at Standard Life Aberdeen, one of the bank’s top ten shareholders.

PUSH FOR GROWTH

Flint will be paid a base salary of 1.2 million pounds ($1.6 million) a year, as well as a fixed pay allowance of 1.7 million pounds and an annual pension allowance of 360,000 pounds.

He will also be entitled to an annual bonus worth up to 215 percent of his base pay and a long-term incentive award of up to 320 pct of his base pay.

His main task will be to grow revenues across HSBC’s businesses, as it seeks to grow profits again following a period of restructuring after the 2008-9 financial crisis.

HSBC’s previous management duo of Gulliver and Douglas Flint spent the years since their appointment in 2010 shrinking HSBC, after a period of empire-building in the run-up to the 2008 global financial crisis left the bank over-extended.

In July, HSBC announced its third share buyback in a year and rising profits, in a sign of its turnaround.

But the bank still faces a tough challenge to meet its long term goal of making a better than 10 percent return on equity.

In August last year HSBC abandoned a timetable for achieving that target, as increased regulatory requirements on capital, low interest rates and rising competition from low-cost competitors pressure lenders’ profits worldwide.

Investors will watch closely to see whether Flint continues Gulliver’s shift toward the bank’s second home market of Asia.

HSBC said in 2015 it would hire 4000 staff and lend more in China’s southern Pearl River Delta region, a plan that has since encountered some setbacks as China’s growth slowed.

It has also lost market share in its Asian life insurance business, a trend which analysts expect the bank’s new chairman to attempt to reverse given his background in the industry.

Flint spent much of his early carer in Asia, and has done stints in Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, and India as well as the United States and Britain.

Before taking on his retail and wealth role in 2013, he was HSBC’s head of strategy and planning having previously run its global asset management business and was deputy head of its markets business as well as serving as Group Treasurer.",HSBC picks company veteran John Flint as new chief executive,https://www.reuters.com/article/hsbc-ceo/hsbc-picks-company-veteran-john-flint-as-new-chief-executive-idINKBN1CH1B9?il=0

PARIS (Reuters) - Paris authorities plan to banish all petrol- and diesel-fueled cars from the world’s most visited city by 2030, Paris City Hall said on Thursday.

The move marks an acceleration in plans to wean the country off gas-guzzlers and switch to electric vehicles in a city often obliged to impose temporary bans due to surges in particle pollution in the air.

Paris City Hall said in a statement France had already set a target date of 2040 for an end to cars dependent on fossil fuels and that this required speedier phase-outs in large cities.

“This is about planning for the long term with a strategy that will reduce greenhouse gases,” said Christophe Najdovski, an official responsible for transport policy at the office of Mayor Anne Hidalgo.

“Transport is one of the main greenhouse gas producers...so we are planning an exit from combustion engine vehicles, or fossil-energy vehicles, by 2030,” he told France Info radio.

The French capital, which will host the Olympic Games in the summer of 2024 and was host city for the latest worldwide pact on policies to tame global warming, had already been eyeing an end to diesel cars in the city by the time of the Olympics.

Paris City Hall, already under attack over the establishment of no-car zones, car-free days and fines for drivers who enter the city in cars that are more than 20 years old, said it was not using the word “ban” but rather introducing a feasible deadline by which combustion-engine cars would be phased out.

There are about 32 million household cars in France, where the population is about 66 million, according to 2016 data from the Argus, an automobile industry publication.

Many Parisians do not own cars, relying on extensive public transport systems and, increasingly, fast-burgeoning networks offering bikes, scooters and low-pollution hybrid engine cars for shot-term rental.

The ban on petrol-fueled, or gasoline-engine vehicles as they are known in the United States, marks a radical escalation of anti-pollution policy.

An der Börse in Madrid zeigten sich die meisten Anleger aber weiterhin beruhigt. Der Leitindex verharrte auf dem Niveau vom Mittwoch. Unterstützt wurde er von einer Empfehlung der Deutschen Bank für spanische Aktien. Die Analysten sehen ein geringeres Risiko für ein Auseinanderbrechen des Landes.

Die Stimmung an den europäischen Börsen litt auch unter dem hohen Euro, der die Absatzchancen der Exportunternehmen auf dem Weltmarkt verringert. Die Gemeinschaftswährung zog zeitweise um 0,2 Prozent auf ein Zweieinhalb-Wochen-Hoch von 1,1880 Dollar an. Am Finanzmarkt wächst nach Einschätzung von Analysten die Skepsis über den geldpolitischen Zeitplan der US-Notenbank Fed.

LUFTHANSA FLIEGEN MIT AIR BERLIN IMMER HÖHER

Spitzenreiter im Dax waren Lufthansa mit einem Aufschlag von fast vier Prozent auf 25,54 Euro, womit die Kranichlinie an der Börse so hoch wie seit Februar 2001 nicht mehr flog. Noch im Tagesverlauf sollten die Verträge zur Übernahme großer Teile der insolventen Air Berlin unterzeichnet werden, kündigte Lufthansa-Chef Carsten Spohr an. Die Veränderungen bei der Lufthansa sähen “zu gut aus, um wahr zu sein”, kommentierten die Analysten der Bank HSBC. Der Aktienkurs von Air Berlin liegt nur noch bei 25 Euro-Cent. In London gewannen die Titel von Easyjet 2,4 Prozent. Die britische Airline steht ebenfalls in Verhandlungen mit Air Berlin.

In New York drehte sich alles um die Quartalsberichte der Großbanken JP Morgan und Citi. Erstere profitierte von den steigenden Zinsen in den USA und einer stärkeren Kreditvergabe und wies einen um sieben Prozent gestiegenen Milliardengewinn aus. Citi halfen dagegen vor allem ein Einmaleffekt und Kostensenkungen. Börsianern reichte das zunächst nicht, JP Morgan und Citi gaben im vorbörslichen US-Handel nach. Anleger erhoffen sich von den US-Bankbilanzen Rückschlüsse auf das Zahlenwerk der deutschen Geldhäuser. Deutsche Bank und Commerzbank berichten Ende Oktober beziehungsweise Anfang November über ihre Geschäfte im dritten Quartal.

(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) easily beat Wall Street’s third-quarter profit expectations on Thursday, with loan growth and higher interest rates more than offsetting weakness in its markets-related unit.

Executives at the largest U.S. bank touted the diverse mix of businesses that allow JPMorgan to weather a dip in one area or another, and downplayed a 27 percent drop in bond trading revenue even though weakness has continued into the fourth quarter.

Overall, JPMorgan’s profit rose 7.1 percent in the third quarter compared with the year-ago period, to $6.73 billion, or $1.76 per share. Analysts had expected earnings of $1.65 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The bank’s total revenue of $25.33 billion also topped the average analyst estimate of $25.23 billion.

In early notes to clients, analysts characterized the results as “solid” or “pretty good,” given problems in bond trading that have affected Wall Street banks for some time.

“The results were solid but not exceptional,” said Morningstar analyst Jim Sinegal.

JPMorgan shares were down 0.4 percent at $96.48 in morning trading.

Growth in credit cards, auto loans, commercial banking and corporate advisory fees drove the results, with average core loans up 7 percent during the quarter. JPMorgan’s net interest income, or the difference between what it pays for funds and collects from lending them out, rose 10 percent.

However, markets revenue fell 21 percent as the slump in bond trading outweighed a more modest dip in equities, slightly worse than the roughly 20 percent drop Chief Executive Jamie Dimon had forecast at an event in September.

Wall Street banks have been grappling with bond market challenges for most of the past seven years, as client volumes have been depressed for a number of reasons and new regulations have restricted certain activities and made trading more expensive.

JPMorgan fared worse last quarter than rival Citigroup Inc (C.N), which reported a 16 percent decline in bond trading on Thursday. The trends bode poorly for Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), which has struggled more in bond trading recently than other Wall Street banks.

JPMorgan’s markets revenue is likely to drop again in the fourth quarter because the year-ago period was strong, Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said on a conference call with analysts.

Trading revenue during the fourth quarter of 2016 benefited from a surge in trading activity following the U.S. election.

Still, management maintained earlier guidance for full-year net interest income, expenses, charge-offs and loan growth, indicating that they expect JPMorgan’s other businesses to continue to offset capital markets pain.

During a call with reporters, Lake cited “the benefits of diversification and scale,” while Daniel Pinto, who runs JPMorgan’s investment bank, pointed to “balanced strength across diverse businesses” in a memo to employees.",Loan growth helps JPMorgan beat expectations despite trading decline,https://www.reuters.com/article/jpmorgan-results/loan-growth-helps-jpmorgan-beat-expectations-despite-trading-decline-idINKBN1CH1JF?il=0

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Humanity no longer needs God but may with the help of artificial intelligence develop a new form of collective consciousness that fulfils the role of religion, U.S. author Dan Brown said on Thursday.

Brown made the provocative remark at the Frankfurt Book Fair where he was promoting his new novel, “Origin”, the fifth outing for Harvard “symbology” professor Robert Langdon, the protagonist of “The Da Vinci Code”, a book that questioned the history of Christianity.

“Origin” was inspired by the question “Will God survive science?”, said Brown, adding that this had never happened in the history of humanity.

“Are we naive today to believe that the gods of the present will survive and be here in a hundred years?” Brown, 53, told a packed news conference.

Set in Spain, “Origin” opens with Langdon arriving at the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao for an announcement by a reclusive billionaire futurist that promises to “change the face of science forever”.

Events quickly take an unexpected turn, providing a plot vehicle for Langdon to visit the historic sites of Spain - including Barcelona, capital of the northern region of Catalonia that is now in the grip of a secession crisis.

Brown, who studied art history in Seville, expressed his concern and sympathy for both sides in the political stand-off.

“I love Catalonia. I love Spain. I hope they work it out. It’s a heartbreaking situation, but it’s also a sign of the times,” said Brown, adding the crisis also reflected the tension in society between the ancient and the modern.

Brown, who has sold 200 million books in 56 languages, admitted to not having read a novel in five years. But he investigated deeply and spent a lot of time talking to futurists to come up with the storyline for “Origin”.

He recognized that his views may not be welcomed by clerics, but called for greater harmony between the world’s great religions and those who profess no faith.

“Christianity, Judaism and Islam all share a gospel, loosely, and it’s important that we all realize that,” he said. “Our religions are much more similar than they are different.”

Turning to the future, Brown said technological change and the development of artificial intelligence would transform the concept of the divine.

“We will start to find our spiritual experiences through our interconnections with each other,” he said, forecasting the emergence of “some form of global consciousness that we perceive and that becomes our divine”.

“Our need for that exterior god, that sits up there and judges us ... will diminish and eventually disappear.”",Collective consciousness to replace God: author Dan Brown,https://in.reuters.com/article/us-germany-bookfair-dan-brown/collective-consciousness-to-replace-god-author-dan-brown-idINKBN1CH1O1

Minutes from a September meeting by the U.S. Federal Reserve showed policymakers had a prolonged debate about the prospects of a pickup in inflation and slowing the path of future interest rate rises if it did not.

The dollar was steady but was stuck near two-weeks lows against a basket of currencies on Thursday following the news.

Gold is highly sensitive to rising interest rates, as these tend to boost the dollar, in which the metal is priced.

Several policymakers said they would focus on upcoming inflation data over the next few months when deciding on the central bank’s future rate hike path.

Political uncertainty also helped to support gold, which investors turn to during periods of turmoil, analysts said.

“If people are not too worried about the Fed’s policy, we have North Korea. Surely, geopolitical tensions are supporting prices ... we may try $1,300 next week,” Yuichi Ikemizu, Tokyo branch manager at CIBC Standard Bank, said.

Silver rose 0.2 percent to $17.19 an ounce after touching a three-week high.

Platinum was 0.5 percent higher at $932.45 an ounce, after hitting a more than two-week high earlier in the session.

Palladium jumped 1.6 percent to $974, its highest since Sept. 6.

Discussions over a possible substitution between platinum group metals in auto catalysts will likely gather pace if the palladium continues to trade at a premium to the platinum, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a note earlier this month.",Gold rises as dollar sinks before U.S. inflation data,https://www.reuters.com/article/global-precious/gold-steady-ahead-of-u-s-inflation-data-idINKBN1CH1RT?il=0

O Departamento do Trabalho informou que o aumento nas tarifas de energia provavelmente resultou da “redução da capacidade de refinamento na área da Costa do Golfo do México devido ao furacão Harvey”.

O impacto do Harvey e do Irma, que ocorreram no final de agosto e início de setembro, na economia provocou uma perda de empregos pela primeira vez em sete anos.

SINGAPORE/LONDON (Reuters) - When OPEC leader Saudi Arabia pledged in May to do “whatever it takes” to defend world oil prices, it didn’t expect the market to be testing its resolve just one month later.

As the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended oil production cuts, oil prices fell 18 percent in just 20 days. OPEC members appear determined not to rush into deeper output curbs despite market pressure.

Oil traders have chosen to ignore bullish news for prices - including a long-awaited decline in U.S. oil stocks on Wednesday - and focused instead on negative factors such as a stubborn global glut.

As a result, the oil market posted its worst performance in the first six months in two decades effectively signaling its refusal to accept the effectiveness of the OPEC statement and its desire for further production cuts.

The “whatever it takes” pledge was made by Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur in early May, echoing a promise by European central banker Mario Draghi five years ago during his successful fight to defend the euro.

“You cannot fight the Federal Reserve but you can fight OPEC,” said Bob McNally, President of the Rapidan Group, a Washington-based energy market and policy consultant. “Somebody at OPEC has to cut further but no one is willing.”

The oil price decline and Saudi’s ability to defend prices also puts in the spotlight Saudi Arabia’s future king, 31-year-old Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who on Wednesday was made next in line to the throne by his father King Salman.

Prince Mohammed has been the ultimate Saudi energy decision-maker in the last two years and his strategy has shifted from orders to raise oil production to defend OPEC market share to curbing output to prop up prices.

WAITING IT OUT

Falih and other OPEC ministers and officials have said the cartel would not rush to deepen production cuts from the current four percent to arrest the price decline.

They said the group would rather wait until existing joint cuts with non-OPEC Russia finally result in a global stocks decline during the third quarter when demand for crude oil is usually strong.

OPEC and Russian sources also told Reuters there were few signs the group is preparing any extraordinary action ahead of a joint ministerial monitoring committee meeting in Russia at the end of July.

“We are in discussions with OPEC members to prepare ourselves for a new decision,” Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Wednesday. “But making decisions in this organization is very difficult because any decision will mean production cuts for the members,” he added.

An oil price surge at the end of the last decade and the start of this one spurred multiple oil production projects around the world, including from U.S. shale formations, resulting in global oversupply which sent prices tumbling from $120 per barrel in 2014 to below $30 per barrel last year.

OPEC and Russia tried to stabilize prices with cuts at around $50-$60 per barrel, but this week Brent prices fell toward $44 per barrel on persistent oversupply worries.

Traders and investors have raised their bets that the oil price will remain under pressure. The U.S. crude options market shows that the largest change since the OPEC meeting in holdings of derivatives maturing in December this year is in put, or sell, options at $45 a barrel.

Open interest, which shows the number of contracts that are open that have been traded but not yet liquidated, has risen by more than 5,000 lots in the last month to nearly 38,000 lots, equivalent to 38 million barrels of oil.

SHALE RETURNS AT FULL FORCE

""Global supply outages have fallen to a new low not seen in years. U.S. shale is returning at full force ... (and there are) high storage levels afloat and on land,"" said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for oil trading company Strong Petroleum.

The United States is not part of any supply reduction deals and is expected to increase production from shale formations by up to one million barrels per day or almost 10 percent of the country’s total crude output.

Berentsen said that unless OPEC deepened cuts or there was a large, unexpected production stoppage, prices will remain low.

“A deeper cut could arrest the price decline but OPEC needs to actually do it rather than just talk about it,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader.

OPEC sources have said that one of the options could be to include sooner rather than later OPEC members Nigeria and Libya in output cuts after their production grew steeply in recent months from levels previously depressed by unrest. At the moment Nigeria and Libya are exempt from the production cuts agreement.

MISTAKES OF THE PAST

Saudi Arabia, which has the cheapest production costs in the world, has repeatedly said it had learned from its mistakes of the past, when it drastically cut production in the 1980s to prop up prices but lost market share to rivals.

Earlier this year, Saudi officials told top independent U.S. oil firms in a closed-door meeting they should not assume OPEC would extend curbs to offset rising U.S. output.

Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA, said OPEC’s other choice would be to allow oil prices to drop to levels at which even “the newly slimline U.S. shale industry struggles to break even at”.

That may not be far off as prices approach cost levels for U.S. shale drillers, who are responsible for a rise in production that has undermined OPEC efforts.

“For the (Bakken shale), wells completed in 2016-2017, wellhead break-evens average around $38 per barrel,” said consultancy Rystad Energy, which specialises in exploration and production.

Besides closely following production patterns of its rivals, OPEC needs to keep a keen eye on global demand.

While major forecasters including the International Energy Agency sees global oil demand growing by a healthy 1.5 percent next year, there are signs growth is slowing in major Asian hubs China and India, the engines of demand growth in recent years.",Traders test OPEC 'whatever it takes' resolve to defend oil price,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-markets-slump/traders-test-opec-whatever-it-takes-resolve-to-defend-oil-price-idUSKBN19D1PX

SAN JOSE, Calif. (Reuters) - Facebook Inc is launching a new virtual reality headset that does not require a separate computer to operate, allowing more mobile uses than the company’s existing Oculus Rift product, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said on Wednesday.

Zuckerberg, speaking at a conference for virtual reality developers, said the “Oculus Go” device would cost $199 and ship early next year, too late for this year’s holiday shopping season but likely ahead of rivals.

Facebook has invested heavily in virtual reality hardware in hopes the technology, which offers a 360-degree panoramic view of faraway or imaginary spaces, will move from a niche interest to a widely used platform for gaming, communication and business applications.

In 2014, Facebook paid $3 billion to acquire Oculus and retain its employees.

The Oculus Go is billed as simpler than the Rift, which went on sale last year, or the Vive system made by HTC Corp. Both of those require desktop computers to operate.

“I think you’re going to see these a lot on airplanes, because it’s way better than the back-of-the-seat monitor or my phone,” Mike Schroepfer, Facebook’s chief technology officer, said in an interview.

Schroepfer said the device is aimed at people who do not have Samsung smartphones. Oculus and Samsung Electronics Co already sell a device, named Gear VR, that when paired with certain Samsung phones is similar to Oculus Go.

Alphabet Inc offers a rival headset, Google Daydream, that works with yet more smartphones.

“The Oculus Go has potential to be a huge driver of growth,” if people like the titles and apps on it, Stephanie Llamas, vice president of research at Super Data, said in an email.

Facebook will permanently cut the price of the Rift system to $399 from $499, the company said.

Facebook is expected to ship 213,000 Rift systems this year, while HTC is expected to ship 305,000 Vive systems, according to Super Data research.

Beyond price cuts and new products, Facebook is trying different ways to attract people to the virtual-reality medium.

The company is developing software known as Facebook Spaces that allows friends to meet in virtual rooms, and it said it will soon integrate live video.

On Wednesday, the company said it was releasing technology to create better, customised facial images, or avatars, and would soon add the ability to use playing cards in Facebook Spaces, in addition to the dice it already has.",Facebook to sell portable headset for virtual reality,https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-facebook-tech-virtualreality/facebook-to-sell-portable-headset-for-virtual-reality-idUKKBN1CG2G4

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The global economic recovery has strengthened financial stability but easy monetary and financial conditions against a backdrop of sluggish inflation is elevating medium-term risks, the International Monetary Fund said on Wednesday.

The IMF, whose autumn meetings with the World Bank get under way in Washington later this week, also noted risks are rotating from banks, which have fortified their balance sheets, to financial markets as credit spreads compress, volatility declines and asset prices rise.

“While increased risk appetite and search for yield are a welcome and intended consequence of unconventional monetary policy measures...there are risks if these trends extend too far,” the IMF said in its biannual global financial stability update.

A prolonged search for yield has raised the sensitivity of the financial system to market and liquidity risks, the Fund said, keeping those risks elevated.

The IMF urged national regulators to consider carefully any proposals that would substantially ease capital, liquidity or prudential standards in “light of their potential to damage the agenda of global regulatory harmonization.”

The improvement in near-term financial stability has been underpinned by a broad-based global economic upswing.

On Tuesday, the IMF upgraded its global economic growth forecast for 2017 by 0.1 percentage point to 3.6 percent, and to 3.7 percent for 2018, from its April and July outlook, driven by a pickup in trade, investment, and consumer confidence.

But global central banks have found themselves at different stages in removing monetary policy accommodation, which has been complicated by overall sluggish inflation.

The U.S. Federal Reserve has picked up the pace of interest rate rises since it began a tightening cycle in late 2015, but the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan have yet to move away from negative rates and bond buying.

“Too quick an adjustment in monetary policies could cause unwanted turbulence in financial markets and set back progress toward inflation targets,” the IMF said in its report, while keeping rates low for too long may cause a harmful buildup in market and credit risks.

Elsewhere, the Fund warned that leverage in the non-financial sector was now higher than before the financial crisis across the so-called G20 advanced economies as a whole.

Such leverage made households and companies more vulnerable to changes in interest rates and weaker economic activity.

“The key challenge confronting policymakers is to ensure that the buildup of financial vulnerabilities is contained while monetary policy remains supportive of the global recovery,” the IMF warned. “Otherwise, rising debt loads and overstretched asset valuations could undermine market confidence in the future, with repercussions that could put global growth at risk.”","Global financial stability has improved, but risks ahead: IMF",https://www.reuters.com/article/imf-g20-stability/global-financial-stability-has-improved-but-risks-ahead-imf-idINKBN1CG1IG

With post-Maria Puerto Rico the latest example of that trope, it’s time for a better understanding of how disaster management works.

A disaster destroys in hours infrastructure that took decades to build. Millions of people lose the services that separate a middle-class suburb from an impoverished slum – clean water, sewers, power, hospitals, roads. And Maria was the strongest storm to strike the area in 80 years.

Meanwhile, the media tends to focus on drama and controversy. They often overplay the story via anecdotal reporting (“Here’s Mrs. Hernandez without electricity,” says the reporter [pause], “with no help in sight”) and underplay the work being done, especially at the beginning of the response where progress is hard to see. First responders on laptops methodically solving supply problems are not very mediagenic, after all.

At the moment of any disaster, needs are at 100 percent while the response is at a zero point. The response starts in deficit. It always looks grim, especially to participants and outside observers unfamiliar with the process. They want what is a marathon to play out like a sprint.

In dealing with a major disaster, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the military follow a standard playbook. I know, I worked with both on and off for two decades while with the State Department. I trained with them, and was on the ground for relief efforts after the 1995 Kobe, Japan earthquake (more than 6,000 dead) and 2004 Asian tsunami (280,000 dead.) I worked the Washington DC-end of many other disasters. I read after-action reporting from 20-30 other such events.

The critical initial step is a needs assessment, from which everything else flows. Everyone wants to jump in and do something, but responders need time to visit sites, confer with local officials, and determine what is needed and where the needs are greatest. It is a slow process in a chaotic environment, delayed by weather, roads, and communications. From the outside it can look like nothing is being done; Mrs. Hernandez still doesn’t have electricity even as helicopters are flying around, apparently ignoring her!

The needs assessment gets the right help to the right places in order of priority. As an example, I was part of a liaison team with the American Navy at Phuket, Thailand following the Asian tsunami of 2005. Without any local input, the U.S. first helicopters brought in huge fresh water bladders. It turned out most of the water was unneeded; the city had warehouses full of the bottled version.

It took a day for us to track down, but the most urgent need the Navy could address was a buildup of medical waste at local hospitals. Waste pre-disaster was trucked out daily; the tsunami wrecked the roads, and so boxes of soiled bandages and infected sharps accumulated. When American resources turned to help dispose of that, hospitals were able to run at peak capacity. Lives were saved. The water bladders lay abandoned in parking lots around town.

Other decisions that can flow from a needs assessment might include restoring power to one school to shelter 50 families before fixing 50 individual homes. It can mean blocking people from calling internationally so limited cell capacity can be directed to local emergency calls. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, for example, set as a priority reopening dialysis centers across Puerto Rico. Somebody else didn’t get helped first to make that possible.

At the early-to-intermediate stages of a disaster response people in less affected areas will wait in long lines for supplies. It looks bad on TV, but can actually mean the system is working, as help was directed to a higher priority. It takes good reporting to know if that’s the case. Instead, progress is often too quickly defined as “make everything back to the way it was before the storm.”

The military plays a key role in disaster response. The problem is Americans are conditioned to believe there are unlimited resources of all types, instantly movable across notable distances.

Military units tend to have war fighting as their primary job, and most are somewhere doing that, or training to do that. Shifting to a disaster mission can happen quickly but not instantly. It’s also essential to gather people with the right skills – electrical engineers, teams that desalinate sea water for drinking, and sewage crews (3.4 million people’s waste festering with fecal-borne disease is a dreaded secondary killer in this disaster.)

Much mockery has been directed at Trump’s statement about Puerto Rico being an island, surrounded by “big water.” His phrasing was callous, but the fact Puerto Rico is an island is significant. Unlike Texas or Florida, no one can self-evacuate, by car or even on foot. Same for incoming aid. Everything must travel by plane, or, more likely, ship.

Puerto Ricans now need some two million gallons of fresh water a day. A gallon weighs about eight pounds, so that’s 16 million pounds of water. A C-130 cargo plane can carry some 42,000 pounds. So that’s 380 flights a day, every day, just for water. There are bigger aircraft, but the bottom line is always the same: you simply have to move the epic quantities required to respond to an epic island disaster by ship to a port, then inland by truck.

That last step, moving supplies from a port (or airport) to those who need them is known as the “last mile” problem. It haunts every disaster response.

Success with the last mile depends on local infrastructure. If it was neglected before the disaster, it will never be better (and often worse) during the disaster response. Next comes the need for trucks, fuel for those trucks, drivers, security, and personnel and equipment to offload the ships and load the vehicles. If you’re missing one link in the chain, the aid does not move.

These are tough realities, not excuses for why more hasn’t been done for desperate people. It can be a complex, methodical process, addressing a single problem (get water to that village) as a cascading string of nested problems. While the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s remark that Puerto Rico relief is the “most logistically challenging event” the United States has ever faced seems exaggerated, it does underscore the size of the job at hand.

So don’t be distracted by the apocalyptic tweets between Trump and his critics; they exist independent of the ground truth. Because while no response is ever fast and robust enough, the systemic breakdowns that hit New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina have largely been fixed, well-before Trump even took office.

Responses are always imperfect; lack of drinking water remains a critical issue. The loss of life in Puerto Rico is sure to rise from 16, as rescuers reach more remote areas. For Harvey, the death toll was at least 70, Irma 72. Katrina saw 1,836 fatalities with over 700 people still missing.

But a tipping point will take place, where adequate services are restored and people will start to receive the help they need. Problems will reduce from regions without power to villages without power to an isolated home without power. The principles of disaster management should not be lost in the politics surrounding events in Puerto Rico. Everything else right now seems to be just Twitter wars.","Commentary: For hurricane-hit Puerto Rico, an insider’s guide to disaster management",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-vanburen-disaster-commentary/commentary-for-hurricane-hit-puerto-rico-an-insiders-guide-to-disaster-management-idUSKCN1C805X

“Similar to action taken by other hospitality companies, Airbnb listings in certain areas in Beijing will be temporarily unavailable throughout October,” the company said in a statement to Reuters.","BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. short-term rental service Airbnb Inc has removed listings in Beijing as the capital prepares to host a five-yearly Party Congress later this month, the most important event on China’s political calendar during which security is at its highest.

A Reuters search on Wednesday of Airbnb listings in the city’s center yielded “zero” results for all of October. Listings were present as recently as Tuesday evening for periods including the congress dates of Oct. 18 to 31.

“Due to external circumstances, homes in certain areas in Beijing are unavailable through October 31,” Airbnb said in an email to hosts reviewed by Reuters.

The move, mirrored by local rental firms, comes a week before the congress where President Xi Jinping is widely expected to consolidate power in a leadership reshuffle.

Such high-profile events are often accompanied by increased surveillance and online censorship. During the last Congress, in 2012, access to Alphabet Inc’s Google search engine was cut off. Google services have since been blocked in China.

For this year’s event, authorities have stepped up ID checks at metro stations and elsewhere in an effort to detain unregistered workers and others illegally residing in Beijing.

“EXTERNAL CIRCUMSTANCES”

Four Airbnb hosts in the capital told Reuters they had received notices from the U.S. firm late on Tuesday, which said properties in certain areas of the city would be removed from its website until the end of the month due to “external circumstances”.

“Similar to action taken by other hospitality companies, Airbnb listings in certain areas in Beijing will be temporarily unavailable throughout October,” the company said in a statement to Reuters.

Short-term rentals were also unavailable during the same period via local services Xiaozhu.com and Tujia.com. Neither firm responded to requests for comment.

Airbnb and other home-stay sites occupy a legal grey area in China, where tourists are required to register accommodation with local police using a passport or identification card. The requirement is harder to enforce with short-term rentals.

The Ministry of Public Security and Beijing’s city police did not respond to faxed requests for comment.

“(The congress blackout) is a pain, but it’s not for such a long time,” said a 28-year-old press relations worker surnamed Liu, who rents out two flats on both Xiaozhu and Airbnb. “As long as (bookings) open again eventually, I don’t mind.”",No Vacancies: Airbnb shutters Beijing rentals ahead of Party Congress,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-china-congress-airbnb/no-vacancies-airbnb-shutters-beijing-rentals-ahead-of-party-congress-idUKKBN1CG17K?il=0

The center-left coalition, supported by most mainstream opposition center-right parties, says the reform is needed to harmonize disparate voting systems in the upper and lower houses of parliament.

The so-called ‘Rosatellum’ favors parties which group together ahead of the election. The 5-Star refuses to join any alliance and says the reform could cost it at least 50 seats in the next parliament, hobbling its chances of taking power.

The bill now faces a secret ballot by the same parliamentarians in the lower house, giving dissident parliamentarians of all colors a chance to shoot it down, as happened in June to a previous electoral proposal.

It is expected to be held by Friday.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Apple may proceed to build a 850 million euro ($1 billion) data centre in Ireland, the High Court ruled on Thursday, bringing relief for the government after a two-year planning delay which it feared could hurt its reputation with investors.

Apple in February 2015 announced plans to build the data centre in a rural location in the west of Ireland to take advantage of rich green energy sources nearby.

Planning permission was granted by the local council six months later, but a series of appeals blocked Apple from beginning work.

High Court judge Paul McDermott on Thursday dismissed two separate appeals against the planning permission, clearing the way for the project to proceed.

Ireland relies on foreign multinational companies for the creation of one in every 10 jobs across the economy and sees major investments such as data centres as a means of securing their presence in the country.

A similar Apple centre announced at the same time in Denmark is due to begin operations later this year and Apple has announced it will build a second data centre there.

Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar met Apple executives last month and said they had made clear their frustration with the planning and judicial delays and warned the process would colour decisions that they might make about future investments.

The government has said it is considering amending its planning laws to include data centres as strategic infrastructure, thus allowing them to get through the planning process much more quickly.

It has said it will be one of the biggest capital investment projects in the west of Ireland, providing 300 construction jobs and 150 on-site permanent jobs.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Mitch Golden scrutinizes hedge fund managers and their investment ideas in a variety of settings from the back of a motor scooter in Ho Chi Minh City to a park bench in New York’s Central Park. The lieutenant of billionaire investor David Einhorn says it gives him the sort of perspective he can’t get from sitting in an office.

“This is a really hard job to do by just looking at the stuff that comes across your desk. You have to go out and find it,” the 45-year old portfolio manager told Reuters.

His approach is paying off. Golden, who runs an $800 million portfolio for Einhorn's $8.3 billion hedge fund firm Greenlight Capital, is producing some of the best numbers in the fund of funds industry and also, in the past two years, beating his boss.

Infographic ID: '2s8LJrm'

Greenlight Masters beat or matched the benchmark in 12 out of the last 15 years of its existence and its average annualized return of 7.7 percent through the end of 2016 handily exceeded Hedge Fund Research’s HFRI Fund of Funds Composite Index’s 3.3 percent return over the same period.

It is rare for a company to run a so-called fund of funds alongside a hedge fund. By doing so, the Greenlight Masters portfolio offers clients valuable access to star investors such as Einhorn plus those still unknown on Wall Street, says Steve Algert, managing director and assistant treasurer at The J. Paul Getty Trust, one of Golden’s clients.

Golden is known for the time he takes – sometimes years - and the lengths he will go to in researching potential managers. If he believes in their ideas he will wait for them to pay off - a rarity in an industry where skittish investors often pull out at the first sign of trouble.

He can afford to do that because a significant amount of the capital in the portfolio comes from Einhorn and his partners at Greenlight Capital.

“Mitch hustles hard to know who’s out there and to develop relationships with people even if Greenlight Masters isn’t ready to invest immediately,” said Firefly Value Partners partner Ariel Warszawski, whose fund has been in the Greenlight Masters’ portfolio for a decade.

To beat the market, a manager has to be contrarian, Golden says, but he is wary of big egos and is looking for a dose of humility in candidates.

“We look for people who have confidence in their work and can pick a fight with the markets,” Golden said. “It is a very subtle balance.”

Brian Shapiro, whose firm Simplify LLC performs due diligence on hedge funds for wealthy clients, values Golden for his cool-headed analysis. “For him, if it is not in the numbers, it is not real.”

The native New Yorker likes to go beyond the usual interactions between managers and would-be investors in conference rooms which he describes as a “Kabuki dance” in reference to a Japanese dance-drama that involves stylized expressions and melodramatic plots.

Sometimes that means accompanying fund managers on company visits to gauge how they interact with management.

Earlier this year, he zipped around Vietnam’s biggest city on the back of a scooter to visit a company that one of his managers was considering investing in. He declined to name the company.

PLAYGROUND CHATS

On Saturday mornings, Golden says he will sometimes sit in a playground in Central Park talking stocks with one of his portfolio managers as their children careen down the slides.

Unlike many other funds of funds, Greenlight Masters does not automatically sell if a portfolio fund falls by a certain amount or steadily declines over a longer period.

In 2015, for example, Golden stuck with energy-focused funds despite plunging oil prices and Greenlight Masters lost 8.4 percent that year. Those funds roared back in 2016, helping it gain 13.4 percent and beat the 9.4 percent returned by Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital and a flat performance by the average fund of funds.

He has 18 funds in the portfolio now, having exited three and added two last year. Thomas Hill’s $110 million PlusTick Partners and Nathaniel August’s $750 million Mangrove Partners, which invest in distressed energy assets, were Golden’s top performers in 2016 with gains of more than 50 percent each.

Golden acknowledges that the downside to the prolonged scrutiny is that sometimes promising fund managers will not wait and seek capital elsewhere or Greenlight Masters misses out on candidates’ early dramatic gains.

“That can be very costly,” he said, declining to name the opportunities he had missed.

Greenlight Masters is Einhorn’s brainchild, created in 2002, to uncover the next generations of stars and to give his partners a chance to diversify their holdings.

Golden joined it in 2012 as a co-portfolio manager after earlier stints as an analyst at two hedge funds and the manager of his own firm, and has run Greenlight Masters on his own since 2013.

After many months spent analyzing investments on his own, Golden brings promising candidates to a “D-meet” with Einhorn at Greenlight’s midtown Manhattan offices.

“It is nice that I get to have someone like David Einhorn and other members of the investment team pick apart their ideas,” he said.",Scooters instead of boardroom 'kabuki': how one fund manager picks winners,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hedgefunds-greenlightmasters/scooters-instead-of-boardroom-kabuki-how-one-fund-manager-picks-winners-idUSKBN1930DA

(Reuters) - Rafael Nadal continued to scythe his way through the Shanghai Masters on Thursday, reaching the quarter-finals with a 6-3 6-1 thrashing of temperamental Italian Fabio Fognini.

The Spaniard needed two minutes over the hour to dispatch Fognini, taking his winning streak to 14 matches since the start of the U.S. Open where he claimed a 16th grand slam title.

The 31-year-old is closing in on finishing the year as world number one for the first time since 2013 but Roger Federer, the only man who can stop him, is looking equally impressive.

Federer delighted his small army of Chinese fans inside the Qi Zhong Centre with an emphatic 6-4 6-2 defeat of tricky Ukrainian Alexandr Dolgopolov.

Fognini was playing the day after being handed a suspended ban from two grand slams and $96,000 fine for verbally abusing a female umpire at the U.S. Open.

But there was little fight from the 30-year-old as Nadal lost only six points on serve in the opening set.

While a Nadal-Federer final looms, Argentina’s Juan Martin del Potro could ruin the script, as he did at the U.S. Open where he defeated Federer in the quarter-finals when a semi-final between the two greats looked likely.

The former U.S. Open champion stopped third seed Alexander Zverev, recovering from losing the opener to win 3-6 7-6(5) 6-4.

“I think he played a great match, maybe one of the best of the season,” Zverev said.

Sixth seed Grigor Dimitrov, who saved match points on Wednesday against Ryan Harrison, had a more comfortable day as he beat American 10th seed Sam Querrey 6-3 7-6(3).

Source: University of Chicago Booth

LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - What do you get when you merge psychology with economics? Richard Thaler, who just won the Nobel Memorial Prize in the latter field, has an answer, which he calls behavioural economics. The University of Chicago professor’s approach to the study of the mind is more dismal than cheerful. He made his reputation pointing out some of the ways that people do not think straight.

Psychology, though, is a far more than a catalogue of human confusions. The economic benefits of psychological research are far greater than most of today’s behavioural economists seem to realise.

Take the standard economic model of how corporate bosses choose their investments. They are supposed to invest if – and only if – the expected return on a project is higher than the weighted average cost of the capital required to finance it. In fact, the future is far too opaque for the needed estimates to be more than educated guesses. Indeed, the model-makers don’t even bother to keep up with changes in the real world. As Breakingviews’ Swaha Pattanaik pointed out (here), the typical estimated cost of capital has not declined along with nominal and real interest rates.

The models are accurate to within a 10th of 1 percent, but the results almost always confirm the intuition of the boss. That insight comes from applying some not always well understood rules of thumb to the limited data that is actually available.

Academic psychology can help with those rules of thumb, which it studies as heuristics. In many professions, machines can replicate and even improve on human intuition. Automatons can integrate more data than people, and can be trained to learn from mistakes. If these expert systems can help doctors give better diagnoses, they can probably help companies make better investments. It’s certainly worth a try.

Or take thinking about statistics. The normal human brain seems to struggle to find good heuristics for the science of probabilities and statistical significance. Scientists are often no more naturally statistical than lay people. It took decades to persuade doctors to prefer studies of statistically significant sample groups to anecdotal experience.

A firmer grasp on the psychology of learning could help avoid awesomely bad statistical heuristics, such as that shown by David Viniar as the financial crisis started a decade ago. The chief financial officer of Goldman Sachs said the bank’s traders had suffered “25-standard deviation moves, several days in a row”. In lay terms, he was saying that they suffered from incredible bad luck. That is a terrible explanation. Such a level of misfortune would be as likely to occur by chance as often as winning the big prize in the UK’s National Lottery 42 days in a row.

The typical economist is probably better than average in understanding what statistics can and cannot explain. A remarkable proportion of current research in the field is dedicated to using sophisticated statistical techniques to find hidden patterns in vast amounts of data. Still, deeper study of how to think about statistics could help economists think more clearly, and avoid the all-too-common mistake of confusing correlation with causality.

Better statistical intuition might also help economists analyse trade-offs, such as between higher costs and less pollution. Ultimately, though, such debates require the use of a different part of the mind: the ethical or moral faculty. Economists generally claim to be ethically neutral, but without a clear method to debate what makes an economy or a society truly good, they typically fall back on ethically sloppy goals such as maximising efficiency or output.

When psychologists talk about morality, they are essentially philosophers. Economists would gain from joining them. The millennia of philosophical debate about the nature of the good life and the good society may not have reached any definitive conclusions. But studying the works of Plato and John Stuart Mill makes Thaler’s criticisms of the classic economists’ ideal of rational actors maximising their utility seem pretty trivial.

A truly informed psychological economics would elevate current debates. Take the furore over inequality. With better heuristics, researchers could give policymakers a clearer idea of the likely effects of changes in taxes, pay structures and migration policy. With better statistical reasoning, more people could understand the significance of measures of, say, income differentials and intergenerational social mobility.

And with deeper moral thinking, questions of justice, which are hardly broached in the current inequality debate, could be addressed more intelligently. The difference between equality of opportunity and of outcome deserves more attention, as does the possible obligation of residents in rich countries to help narrow the gap with poor countries. Branko Milanovic, a researcher at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, has shown that this cross-border gap creates far more global income inequality than is found inside rich lands.

Behavioural economics is a fairly modest step in the right direction for a profession that is too often isolated from other currents of modern thought. A true psychological economics, with a touch of philosophy, would be a much larger improvement.",Breakingviews - Hadas: Economists need more psychological abuse,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-economics-theory-breakingviews/breakingviews-hadas-economists-need-more-psychological-abuse-idUSKBN1CG276

Republicans in Congress and the White House haven’t been able to get any major legislation passed yet. But they're betting they can pull it off with a bare-bones proposal for tax reform outlined last week, which they claim will help the middle class despite the evidence that it will overwhelmingly benefit the rich.

Their plan to overhaul what they call a broken tax code leaves out many key details. But one point gets hammered home: Republicans say they want to make filing taxes easier. The first principle for President Trump’s tax plan, their outline states, is to “make the tax code simple, fair and easy to understand.” There are a dozen more references to simplification throughout the rest of the document.

The Republican promise is that they want to make filing taxes as easy as mailing a postcard. But their plan doesn’t get anywhere close to that, while overlooking a straightforward reform that would. Instead of reducing complexity, the GOP plan mostly lowers and flattens rates. For example, it reduces the number of personal income tax brackets from seven to three.

However, the effort of filing taxes has nothing to do with how many brackets there are -- figuring out which bracket you fall in is the easy part. What makes doing taxes complicated is figuring out which deductions, credits, and loopholes to claim. Republicans would close some loopholes, but they would open others -- including a lower tax rate on pass-through businesses that will entice rich people with the right accounting team to get creative in order to reap the rewards. (Tycoons with family-owned businesses, such as Donald Trump, especially stand to benefit from this change, which would allow law firms, hedge funds, and real estate brokerages to file under a much lower rate.) Such loopholes make the code more complex to navigate, not less.

Simple tax filing isn’t a hopeless goal, however. There’s something Congress could do that would radically simplify the process of filing taxes for the vast majority of U.S. taxpayers.

It’s called return-free filing. In countries such as Chile, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Japan, Norway, Sweden, and Spain, the government basically prepares tax returns for its citizens. It already has most of the information it needs: Employers have to tell tax authorities how much they pay their employees, while forms like W-2s and 1099s provide other necessary details. In Japan, for example, the country’s tax agency sends everyone a document with how much they earned, how much was withheld, and how much they owe or are owed in taxes.

If Washington adopted this policy, the government would fill out a return for every resident with the information it already keeps on file. Taxpayers who wanted to itemize their returns or dispute the numbers would be free to do so, but otherwise they could simply sign off on the government’s math. In some countries, merely taking no action constitutes an approval and therefore counts as doing your taxes.

Instead, in the United States it’s up to every taxpayer to gather their forms, enter all the numbers into a long document, ensure that everything has been calculated accurately, and send it all in. It takes a collective 2.6 billion hours to get this done. Americans pay an average $200 each for the pleasure of doing their taxes, or around 10 percent of the average federal tax refund.

Return-free filing, on the other hand, could save an estimated collective 225 million hours of tax filing work and $2 billion in costs. Up to 60 million households would no longer have to file any returns.

The concept is not entirely foreign to the United States. President Ronald Reagan called for something just like it in his 1985 Tax Reform Act, arguing that Americans should “not even have to fill out a return.” Since then, Senator Elizabeth Warren has taken up the crusade, introducing legislation two years in a row that would instruct the IRS to develop a free, online return-free filing option, allowing taxpayers to download their information straight from the government and into a form. The idea is even supported by conservative anti-tax activist Grover Norquist.

But it hasn’t moved forward; last year, Warren’s bill didn’t even make it out of committee.

That’s because some deep-pocketed companies have worked tirelessly to bury it. If most Americans no longer needed help doing their taxes, business would dry up for tax preparers such as H&R Block and TurboTax. More than half of all individual tax returns filed in 2014 were prepared by a tax professional, while about 80 percent of Americans use either software or a preparer.

These companies have said as much publicly. Intuit, the software company that makes TurboTax, has said in filings that it “opposes IRS government tax preparation” and that such legislation “may present a continued competitive threat to our business in the foreseeable future.” Liberty Tax Service stated in 2015 that “demand for our products is related to the complexity of tax return preparation.”

So they’ve spent heavily to campaign against return-free filing. H&R Block, which ProPublica says spent $3 million on lobbying last year, fought hard against Warren’s bill. Intuit spent $2 million in the same year, much of it in favor of legislation that would block the government from offering return-free filing. The firm has lobbied in favor of a number of similar past bills.

Republicans have long claimed that they want to make taxes simpler, yet their proposals never live up to such promises. It’s not impossible, though; the answer is staring us right in the face. It would just require the government to put the interests of everyday taxpayers over big-spending corporate lobbyists.

FRANKFURT/BERLIN (Reuters) - Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) reinforced its position as Germany’s largest airline on Thursday by signing a 210 million euro ($249 million)deal to buy large parts of insolvent Air Berlin (AB1.DE).

Lufthansa plans to use the Air Berlin assets to quickly expand its Eurowings budget business. News of the deal pushed Lufthansa shares up more than 3 percent to their highest level in nearly 17 years.

Air Berlin, which has struggled to turn a profit over the last decade, filed for insolvency on Aug. 15, and a government loan has kept its planes aloft while its administrator negotiated with prospective buyers for parts of the business.

Lufthansa has agreed to acquire Air Berlin’s Austrian leisure travel airline Niki, its LG Walter regional airline and 20 additional aircraft, Air Berlin said in a statement.

“This contract provides new opportunities for jobs for a large part of our workforce. But we can only really breathe again when the EU Commission approves the deal,” Air Berlin Chief Executive Thomas Winkelmann said.

Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr said earlier he expected the European Union to approve the transaction by the end of 2017.

Talks to sell some of Air Berlin’s remaining assets to Britain’s easyJet (EZJ.L) and other bidders are continuing, Air Berlin said, without providing details.

EasyJet, which has a base at Berlin’s Schoenefeld airport, has been discussing acquiring 27 to 30 planes. Air Berlin previously said others, such as Thomas Cook’s (TCG.L) Condor, could pick up some parts of the business.

EasyJet declined to comment on the progress of talks on Thursday.

BIG INVESTMENTS

Lufthansa CEO Spohr told a German paper earlier that his airline would be investing around 1.5 billion euros in total as a result of the Air Berlin deal.

That sum includes investment in new planes, for which the board freed up 1 billion euros of funds last month, the purchase price and the costs of taking on new staff.

Air Berlin, Germany’s second largest carrier, will cease operating flights this month, capping a turbulent summer for European carriers.

Italy’s national airline Alitalia [CAITLA.UL] is in administration and seeking investors too, British leisure airline Monarch collapsed at the start of this month.

Lufthansa’s Spohr said on Thursday while he was not interested in the Italian carrier in its current shape he would be interested in talks to create a new Alitalia.

Shares in Lufthansa were up 3.3 percent at 25.38 euros, the top gainer in Germany’s DAX market index <0#.GDAXI> by 1340 GMT.

Analysts at Bernstein Research raised their rating on Lufthansa’s shares to “outperform” from “market-perform”, saying they expected a deal with Air Berlin to add around 70 to 90 million euros to annual operating profits at Lufthansa’s budget unit Eurowings in the medium term.

HSBC analysts lifted their target share price to 29 euros from 25 euros, citing the imminent agreement with Air Berlin, a new multi-year labor deal with pilots announced this week and a positive trading performance this year.",Lufthansa spreads wings by snapping up parts of failed Air Berlin,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-air-berlin-lufthansa/lufthansa-spreads-wings-by-snapping-up-parts-of-failed-air-berlin-idUSKBN1CH0SS?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Apple may proceed to build a 850 million euro ($1 billion) data center in Ireland, the High Court ruled on Thursday, bringing relief for the government after a two-year planning delay which it feared could hurt its reputation with investors.

Apple in February 2015 announced plans to build the data center in a rural location in the west of Ireland to take advantage of rich green energy sources nearby.

Planning permission was granted by the local council six months later, but a series of appeals blocked Apple from beginning work.

High Court judge Paul McDermott on Thursday dismissed two separate appeals against the planning permission, clearing the way for the project to proceed.

Ireland relies on foreign multinational companies for the creation of one in every 10 jobs across the economy and sees major investments such as data centers as a means of securing their presence in the country.

A similar Apple center announced at the same time in Denmark is due to begin operations later this year and Apple has announced it will build a second data center there.

Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar met Apple executives last month and said they had made clear their frustration with the planning and judicial delays and warned the process would color decisions that they might make about future investments.

The government has said it is considering amending its planning laws to include data centers as strategic infrastructure, thus allowing them to get through the planning process much more quickly.

It has said it will be one of the biggest capital investment projects in the west of Ireland, providing 300 construction jobs and 150 on-site permanent jobs.",Irish court gives $1 billion Apple data center green light,https://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCAKBN1CH1EC-OCATC

The wealthy region’s intention to break away has plunged Spain into its worst political crisis since an attempted military coup in 1981, with Madrid threatening to sack the Catalan government if it goes ahead.

On Thursday, a military parade to mark the anniversary of explorer Christopher Columbus’s arrival in the Americas on behalf of the Spanish crown took place in a city already festooned with flags hung by Spaniards in a display of unity.

Tension remains high between the central government and Catalonia after the region’s leader signed a symbolic declaration of independence on Tuesday, citing the results of an Oct. 1 referendum which had been declared illegal by Madrid.

Catalan government chief Carles Puigdemont had stopped short of moving a motion of independence in the regional parliament, disappointing many of his own supporters.

Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has given Puigdemont eight days to drop his push for independence or face the suspension of its political autonomy.

Related Coverage China offers support to Spanish government amid Catalonia crisis

If Puigdemont does not respond in time or confirms a will to secede, Rajoy can turn to article 155 of the 1978 constitution which allows him to sack the regional government.

“Ask for dialogue and they answer you by putting the 155 on the table. Understood,” Puigdemont tweeted late on Wednesday.

Uncertainty remains over what article 155, which has never been invoked before, would mean in practice.

“I can’t tell you exactly what the measures are,” Foreign Minister Alfonso Dastis told France’s CNews TV channel.

“Article 155 is... quite large. It can be fine-tuned, and that’s certainly what the government will do, acting prudently as it has been,” Dastis said.

Political analysts expect Rajoy’s next step would be to call a snap regional election to plot a path out of the crisis.

People were also expected to gather on Thursday at Plaza Catalonia in central Barcelona, the Catalan capital.

Hundreds of thousands have marched though Spain’s main cities in recent weeks during the crisis, which was exacerbated by a police crackdown during the banned vote on Oct. 1.

In Barcelona last weekend, crowds waved Spanish and Catalan flags, describing themselves as the “silent majority” opposed to independence.

Puigdemont said 90 percent of voters in the referendum backed secession, but turn-out was only 43 percent. Polls conducted beforehand had suggested around 40 percent of residents in Catalonia backed independence.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan’s army said on Thursday it had rescued a kidnapped U.S.-Canadian couple and their three children after receiving intelligence from the United States, nearly five years after the couple was abducted in Afghanistan.

American Caitlan Coleman, her Canadian husband Joshua Boyle and the children born in captivity were believed to be held by the Taliban-allied Haqqani network, which the United States has long accused Pakistan of not doing enough to fight.

Coleman and Boyle were kidnapped while backpacking in Afghanistan in 2012. Coleman was pregnant at the time, and a video released by the Taliban in December showed their two sons born while they were hostages.

Thursday’s statement was the first mention of a third child.

The rescue came as Pakistan and the United States, uneasy allies in fighting Taliban and other Islamist extremists in the region, are experiencing one of the worst lows in relations.

“We welcome media reports that a family including U.S. citizens has been released from captivity,” a U.S. Embassy spokesman said on Thursday evening, referring other questions to Washington.

Pakistan touted the success of the operation as proof of the strength of the alliance.

“The success underscores the importance of timely intelligence sharing and Pakistan’s continued commitment toward fighting this menace through cooperation between two forces against a common enemy,” the Pakistani army statement said. The family were released from “terrorist custody”.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Carlos Arthur Nuzman renunciou à presidência do Comitê Olímpico do Brasil (COB), órgão que ele comandava há 22 anos, e será substituído pelo vice Paulo Wanderley Teixeira, informou o COB nesta quarta-feira, uma semana após a prisão do dirigente.

Nuzman, que tinha mandato até 2020, está preso preventivamente acusado de intermediar a compra de votos para a cidade do Rio de Janeiro ganhar o direito de sediar os Jogos Olímpicos de 2016.

O anúncio da renúncia foi feito através de uma carta encaminhada pelo dirigente à Assembleia Geral Extraordinária do COB, que acontece nesta quarta-feira e que foi convocada para tratar do caso envolvendo a prisão de Nuzman.

O dirigente alegou que precisa de tempo para se defender da acusação de intermediar a compra de votos para a Rio 2016.

“Considerando-se, todavia, a necessidade de dedicar-me, integralmente, ao pleno exercício do meu direito de defesa, renuncio de modo irrefutável e irretratável ao cargo de presidente do Comitê Olímpico Brasileiro bem como ao de membro honorário de sua Assembleia Geral”, diz a carta assinada por Nuzman.

No fim de semana, o COB já tinha divulgado um pedido de afastamento temporário de Nuzman da presidência da entidade e do Comitê Organizador dos Jogos de 2016.

Nuzman foi preso temporariamente na última quinta-feira, em sua casa, no Rio de Janeiro, e na segunda-feira a prisão foi convertida em preventiva, equivalente a uma detenção por tempo indeterminado.

A defesa de Nuzman já protocolou na Justiça do Rio de Janeiro pedidos de habeas corpus do dirigente esportivo.

Brüssel (Reuters) - Die Brexit-Gespräche über die finanziellen Verpflichtung Großbritanniens beim Austritt aus der EU kommen nicht voran.

“Bei den Thema stecken wir in einer Sackgasse”, sagte EU-Chefunterhändler Michel Barnier an Donnerstag in Brüssel. Die Zahlungen seien sehr wichtig. Obwohl die britische Premierministerin Theresa May in einer Grundsatzrede in Florenz zugesagt habe, dass das Land sich an die Verpflichtungen halten wolle, habe es keine Gespräche darüber gegeben.

“In dieser Woche hat Großbritannien uns gesagt, dass sie die Zahlungen nicht benennen können”, sagte der Franzose, der die Verhandlungen für die EU führt. Damit ging die fünfte Brexit-Verhandlungsrunde erfolglos zu Ende - 15 Monate nach dem Votum der Briten für einen Austritt aus der EU.

Die britische Regierung wollte eigentlich erreichen, dass parallel zu den Austrittsverhandlungen auch über die künftigen Beziehungen zwischen der EU und Großbritannien gesprochen wird - also vor allem über ein Freihandelsabkommen. Doch die EU beharrt auf belastbaren Fortschritten bei drei Kernthemen: der Scheidungsrechnung, der künftigen Grenze zwischen EU-Mitglied Irland und dem britischen Nordirland und Zusagen für EU-Bürger, die nach dem Brexit im Vereinigten Königreich weiter leben wollen. Bei letzteren gebe es aber Fortschritte, sagte der britische Unterhändler David Davis.

Auf dem EU-Gipfel nächste Woche sollte der Start der sogenannten zweiten Phase eingeläutet werden. Doch nach Aussagen von Barnier ist man davon noch weit entfernt.

CHAOS-BREXIT DROHT

Damit steuern beiden Seiten ins Ungewisse. Denn ohne Einigung mit der EU würde Britannien beim Austritt im März 2019 über Nacht den uneingeschränkten Zugang zum größten und reichsten Wirtschaftsblock der Welt verlieren - der EU. Der Sturz ins Bodenlose würde für beide Kontrahenten den Austausch von Waren und Dienstleistungen massiv verteuern, da danach die wesentlich ungünstigeren WTO-Handelsregeln gelten würden.

In der EU geht man aber davon aus, dass der Chaos-Ausstieg die Briten wesentlich härter treffen würde. Das sorgt vor allem bei Unternehmern dort für Unruhe.

Als Alternative zu einem Freihandelsabkommen mit der Union nach dem Brexit erwägt die britische Regierung einem Bericht des “Daily Telegraph” vom Dienstag zufolge den Beitritt zur nordamerikanischen Freihandelszone Nafta.

May hingegen hatte im September eine zweijährige Übergangsphase ins Spiel gebracht, die nach dem Austritt Großbritanniens gelten soll. Die EU will dafür aber bezahlt werden, was Britannien ablehnt. “Man ist in London noch nicht in der Realität angekommen”, sagte ein EU-Diplomat dazu. Die Verhandlungen würden dadurch erschwert, dass die Insel die Austrittsrechnung mit der Zahlung für den Zugang zum Binnenmarkt vermische.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump finds himself under immense pressure as he considers de-certifying the international nuclear deal with Iran, a move that would ignore warnings from inside and outside his administration that to do so would risk undermining U.S. credibility.

Trump is expected to unveil a broad strategy on confronting Iran this week, likely on Friday. There was always the chance he could still have a last-minute change of heart and certify Iran’s compliance with the 2015 accord, which he has called an “embarrassment” and the “worst deal ever negotiated.”

Senior U.S. officials, European allies and prominent U.S. lawmakers have told Trump that refusing to certify the deal would leave the U.S. isolated, concede the diplomatic high ground to Tehran, and ultimately risk the unraveling of the agreement.

Signed by the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China, the European Union and Iran, the deal relieved sanctions on Tehran in exchange for curbing its disputed nuclear program.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) concluded that Iran secretly researched a nuclear warhead until 2009, which Tehran denies. Iran has always insisted that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes and denies it has aimed to build an atomic bomb.

After Trump made clear three months ago he would not certify Iran’s compliance with the deal, his advisers moved to give him options to consider, a senior administration official said.

“They came up with a plan that protects the things they are concerned about but doesn’t recertify, which the president made clear he was not going to do. That ship has sailed,” according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

The official said Trump has been telling foreign leaders and U.S. lawmakers that his refusal to certify the Iran deal would not blow it up.

“He’s not walking away from it. The chances of him walking away from it go down if they work with him on making it better,” the official said.

White House officials said Trump is expected to announce a broad, more confrontational policy toward Iran directed at curbing its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and financial and military support for Hezbollah and other extremist groups.

Trump has said he believes the nuclear deal is too generous toward Iran and would not stop it from trying to develop a nuclear weapon.

He has criticized the agreement’s “sunset clauses,” under which some restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program would expire over time. He also wants to toughen language on ballistic missiles and inspections. The International Atomic Energy Agency says Iran is complying with the agreement.

NO RENEGOTIATION

European officials have categorically ruled out renegotiating the deal, but have said they share Trump’s concerns over Iran’s destabilizing influence in the Middle East.

Several diplomats have said Europe would be ready to discuss sanctioning Iran’s ballistic missile tests and forming a strategy to curb Iran’s influence in the region.

Officials have also said there could be room to open a new negotiation for what happens once some of the core terms of the deal begin expiring in 2025, although there is no reason to believe Iran would be ready to enter in such a negotiation. Iran has said it may exit the deal if the U.S. withdraws.

De-certifying would not withdraw the United States from the deal but it would give the U.S. Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose the sanctions on Tehran that were suspended under the agreement.

One U.S. official involved in administration said that declining to certify Iran’s compliance would probably leave all of the parties to the deal on one side and the United States on the other.

“That means that while the French and others are also interested in curbing Iran’s destabilizing activities, they may be less likely to follow (the U.S.) lead at the risk of the agreement blowing up,” the official said.

British Prime Minister Theresa May and French President Emmanuel Macron both spoke to Trump this week to express their concerns about the potential decision not to recertify the Iran deal.

“If the feeling is that the United States no longer supports the agreement, then the political reality is that the agreement will be in serious jeopardy and its implementation will be very difficult,” a senior French diplomat said.

Two other U.S. officials, who also requested anonymity, said Trump’s bellicose rhetoric on a number of fronts is troubling both many of his own aides and some of America’s closest allies, a few of whom have asked U.S. officials privately if Trump’s real objective is attacking Iran’s nuclear facilities.

One of the officials said that like the heated rhetoric with North Korea on its nuclear program, the Iran discussion has vexed White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson “who have tried to advise the President that there are significant risks in the course he’d prefer to pursue.”

“At the end of the day, though, everyone recognizes that he’s the decider.”

Trump allies who oppose the deal have watched the president closely to see if he might buckle under pressure.

“He’s not going to re-certify,” said Sebastian Gorka, a former Trump national security aide. “I‘m not worried. His gut instinct is absolutely right.”",Trump resists pressure to soften stance on Iran nuclear deal,https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1CH01B

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Thursday morning, dragged down by media companies, while results from JPMorgan and Citigroup failed to fuel the optimism that has driven indexes to record highs.

JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Citigroup (C.N), which had already talked down third-quarter expectations, reported earnings that were better than Wall Street estimates even as trading revenues fell. The shares of both companies were little changed.

“After a long stretch of consecutive highs in the market, with earnings, even if they are slightly disappointing, or an even an aspect of earnings like bond trading at JPM, is more an excuse to selloff,” said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist for Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.

With the S&P 500 up about 14 percent in 2017, investors are betting on strong earnings growth across the S&P 500.

AT&T (T.N) tumbled 3.22 percent after the company said its third-quarter results took a hit from the string of hurricanes.

The company also said it lost video subscribers in the quarter. Brokerage Guggenheim downgraded Disney (DIS.N) and Viacom (VIAB.O) on worries over subscriber declines

That sparked fresh jitters in a sector that was hit a day earlier by President Donald Trump’s suggestion to challenge TV network licenses over ‘fake news’.

Comcast (CMCSA.O) fell 2.8 percent, Disney (DIS.N) fell 1 percent. Viacom sank 6.6 percent after warning that Charter Communications subscribers may lose access to its channels as the expiration looms for a distribution deal.

Clemons said earnings will probably heighten volatility, with lack of any other major developments to drive the market.

At 9:37 a.m. ET (1337 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was down 38.19 points, or 0.17 percent, at 22,834.7, the S&P 500 .SPX was down 4.38 points, or 0.17 percent, at 2,550.86 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was down 7.33 points, or 0.11 percent, at 6,596.22.

Ten of the 11 major S&P indexes were lower, led by a more than 2 percent fall in the telecom services index .SPLRCL due to AT&T’s declines.

The biggest drag, however, was from the consumer discretionary sector .SPLRCD, which fell 0.57 percent, weighed down by media stocks.

Energy stocks also fell, dragged down by a more than 1 percent drop in crude oil prices as U.S. fuel inventories rose despite efforts by OPEC to cut production.

General Motors (GM.N) fell 1.5 percent. The Wall Street Journal reported GM planned to cut production at a Detroit plant and lay off about 1,500 workers.

J.Jill (JILL.N) nearly halved to hit a record low of $4.96 after the women’s fashion retailer slashed its third-quarter forecast.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Brexit talks are deadlocked over money, the EU’s Michel Barnier said on Thursday as he ruled out discussions on future trade being launched by EU leaders next week but spoke of possible progress by December.

Barnier and his British counterpart, Brexit Secretary David Davis, told reporters there had been some progress this week on the other two issues around Britain’s March 2019 withdrawal from the bloc on which the EU demands “sufficient progress” before it will agree to discuss a transition and future relationship.

Davis renewed his call for EU leaders to give a green light to those talks when they meet Prime Minister Theresa May at an EU summit in Brussels next Thursday.

Barnier made clear, however, that despite new momentum from concessions given by May in a speech at Florence lsat month 22, British proposals on expatriate citizens’ rights and the Irish border still failed the EU test, while London’s refusal to spell out a detailed cash offer was “very worrying” for business.

May said Britain would ensure the other 27 countries did not lose out financially from Brexit in the current EU budget period to 2020 and would honor commitments -- but Barnier said London was failing to spell out just what it was ready to pay.

“Regarding that question, we are at an impasse, which is very worrying for thousands of projects everywhere in Europe and also worrying for those who contribute,” he said.

Nonetheless, he offered hope: “I am still convinced that, with political will, decisive progress is within reach in the coming two months. With David Davis, we will organize several negotiating meetings between now and the end of the year.”

With signs that nerves are fraying on both sides and some hardline Brexit supporters demanding that May just walk out of talks, both negotiators repeated that they were ready for any eventuality including a collapse. But, Barnier warned, “no deal would be a very bad deal”.

RESIDENCE RIGHTS

Davis announced a “streamlined” new system for the 3 million EU citizens in Britain to claim residence rights, answering EU concerns, and said he expected good further progress on other issues. Barnier repeated that Brussels stills wants them to have recourse to EU judges to safeguard their rights and said there were still differences on rights for future family members.

A British demand for its million or so citizens on the continent to have lifetime rights to move to any of the bloc’s 27 countries after Brexit is held up by doubts among the member states. Barnier said those are rights to do with post-Brexit decisions and should be dealt with in the next phase of talks.

Slideshow (3 Images)

“I make no secret of the fact that to provide certainty we must talk about the future,” Davis said, stressing his demand for trade talks. “I hope the leaders of the 27 will provide Michel with the means to explore ways forward with us on that.”

“As we look to the October Council next week, I hope the member states will recognize the progress we’ve made and take a step forward in the spirit of the prime minister’s Florence speech.”

Barnier was pressed to say in public whether he would ask EU leaders’ permission to make some preliminary exploration of what a transition after March 2019 would look like. EU officials and diplomats say he has raised that issue with governments.

However, he told the news conference that he would follow a mandate ruling out any discussion of the future before issues arising from Britain’s past membership are settled and said it was important to respect the “sequencing”.

With the talks poised at a delicate stage, EU officials say it is unclear what leaders will tell May next week.

Although versions of this legislation had been introduced in prior years, the bill did not go anywhere while President Barack Obama stood ready to veto it. But now that President Donald Trump, whose actions have demonstrated hostility to civil rights, occupies the White House, the proposal presents a real risk of passage. If Republicans in Congress do eviscerate the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), it will be the culmination of their recent abandonment of the bipartisan consensus in favor of inclusion and equality for disabled persons.

Although the partisan divide in Washington has often seemed unbridgeable, disability rights long united lawmakers. Republican President George H.W. Bush referred to the ADA, which he signed in 1990, as one of his “proudest achievements.” The law guaranteed that people with disabilities would have access to, and be free from discrimination by, employers, businesses, and government agencies. In 2008, after a series of court decisions that gave a narrow reading to the ADA, a Democratic Congress passed amendments to the ADA reasserting the statute’s broad coverage - and President George W. Bush signed it.

The Trump administration is hacking away at disability rights online and in the workplace, while Trump and congressional Republicans work to gut funding for programs people with disabilities rely on such as Medicaid. The partial ADA-repeal bill is only the most overt assault on disability rights - the culmination of a shift that began when, in December 2012, 38 Republican senators denied the two-thirds vote needed for ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which was modeled on the ADA and ardently supported by disabled GOP luminaries such as former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole. But while that action was merely symbolic red meat for their base – conservatives worried it would inhibit homeschooling and infringe U.S. sovereignty - this new proposal could cause tangible and long-lasting harm.

The current bill, misleadingly titled the “ADA Education and Reform Act of 2017,” would render largely unenforceable key ADA requirements that businesses be accessible to disabled consumers – requirements that they provide ramps instead of stairs where possible, that doorways be wide enough for wheelchairs and so forth.

For wheelchair users, a single step – or a door that is a bit too narrow – can be the barrier that prevents them from patronizing a store. A few inches can make the difference between being full participants in civic and economic life and being dependent on others and shut off from the community.

Businesses have had 27 years to learn about and conform to the ADA’s requirements. But too many still fail to comply with the law, because enforcement relies principally on suits by disabled individuals. Wheelchair users, blind persons, and other people with disabilities encounter inaccessible businesses on a daily basis. According to 2016 Department of Labor statistics, only 31.2 percent of working-age Americans with disabilities had jobs, compared to 76.4 percent of working-age nondisabled Americans. The failure of employers, including stores and restaurants, to provide required accommodations is one of the key reasons for this persistent gap. Surveys show inaccessibility also causes people with disabilities to eat out less often.

The ADA does not give a disabled customer the right to receive damages for a denial of service, just an injunction that requires the owner to remove the barrier. This limitation already creates an incentive for inaccessible businesses to wait until they are sued before complying. Under the bill that recently passed the judiciary committee, the incentive to wait and see will be even greater. The proposal would prevent a disabled person from suing a business that violates the ADA as long as the business makes “substantial progress in removing the barrier,” within six months of being notified. A business might be able to avoid ever complying with the ADA or facing a lawsuit. It’s a system designed to allow businesses to delay until the victim runs out of energy or money to keep pursuing them.

Sponsors of the “ADA Education and Reform Act,” such as Texas Republican Ted Poe, say that the bill is necessary to stop unscrupulous lawyers from bringing frivolous or abusive ADA cases against small businesses. But state bars, and individual judges, already have ample authority to sanction attorneys who engage in such unprofessional conduct. And the ADA itself protects the interests of business owners by providing that an existing facility need not remove accessibility barriers unless doing so is easy to accomplish without significant expense.

Rather than protecting legitimate business interests, the bill pending in Congress would give a reprieve to enterprises that have had 27 years to comply with the law but have not yet done so. That is a betrayal of the basic promise of the ADA – that people with disabilities would be treated as equal citizens, with full access to America’s civic and economic life.

It is just the latest Republican betrayal of the historic bipartisan support for disability rights. In the Trump administration, attacks on disability rights have accelerated. Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ Justice Department has already reversed course in a key lawsuit, prosecuted by the Obama administration, involving the rights of disabled workers to retain their jobs. The White House has also signaled a halt to the Obama-era efforts to adopt regulations ensuring that the Internet is accessible to blind people and others with disabilities.

Perhaps the biggest threat to disability rights isn’t even in the realm of civil rights law, but healthcare: the GOP’s endless efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and cut funding for Medicaid. If they succeed Republicans would remove benefits that allow people with disabilities to access health insurance and home health services. Instead of staying in their communities and possibly working, many would be institutionalized. Trump has also proposed in his budget to cut drastically into Social Security Disability Insurance, the only source of income for millions of Americans unable to work.

The bipartisan consensus favoring disability rights represented the best of America’s ideals of equality, opportunity, and fair play. The Republican Party’s turn against disability rights is a rejection of those core American values.

In a 42-minute address that stunned many listeners, Trump called the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un “Rocket Man on a suicide mission” and vowed to “totally destroy” the country if it attacks the United States. He promised to crush “loser terrorists.” He called the Iran nuclear deal an “embarrassment” and said portions of the world are “going to hell.”

The overarching theme of Trump’s speech was sovereignty – a word he used 21 times. It was a strange emphasis in an increasingly interconnected, globalized world. Though in line with his ""America first"" platform, it was highly unusual for a U.S. leader speaking in a global forum that stands for peace through cooperation. What Trump left out was just as important: he did not offset his emphasis on sovereignty — with its implication that what a nation does within its borders is of no concern to the international community — with an assertion of the primacy of universal human rights or Washington’s commitment to promoting democracy.

Indeed, Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, their vast ideological differences notwithstanding, sounded far more similar to each other when addressing the UN than Trump did to either of them or his other predecessors.

The three most glaring omissions were climate change, human rights and Russia’s efforts to destabilize Western democracies. Trump’s ignoring climate change was no surprise, given his rejection of climate science and planned withdrawal from the UN-sponsored Paris climate agreement. President Obama, by comparison, frequently argued for international climate cooperation in his UN speeches.

But the other subjects Trump avoided were less expected. American commitment to helping the UN advance human rights has long been a staple in UN addresses by presidents, no matter their political party. Although Trump said that he intends to work hard on an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal at a Wednesday meeting with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, the fact that a settlement wasn’t mentioned during the UN address suggests the issue is no longer a White House priority.

In his UN speech Trump also offered no direct condemnation of China or Russia, despite their recent actions that have undermined — and antagonized — the United States on the world stage.

These omissions were a stark departure from past U.S. presidents. Though Trump’s condemnation of North Korea, Iran and Venezuela echoed Bush’s “axis of evil,” Bush’s annual UN addresses promoted the spread of democracy and nation-building abroad. Obama, meanwhile, emphasized diplomacy and international institutions to resolve conflict, achieve peace and protect human rights.

Any call for the respect of rights in Trump’s speech was reserved for nations, not people. “Our success depends on a coalition of strong and independent nations that embrace their sovereignty, to promote security, prosperity, and peace, for themselves and for the world,” he said, adding that he expects nations to “uphold these two core sovereign duties: to respect the interests of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation.”

For all the president’s focus on sovereignty, he ignored threats to from Russia, such as its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, and what U.S. intelligence agencies say was Moscow’s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and hacking of French election infrastructure.

As for China, Trump made only a vague reference to its threat in the South China Sea, where Beijing has built up islands and military outposts in an area the United States regards as international waters. Trump did, however, thank both Russia and China by name for their recent UN Security Council votes for more sanctions on North Korea. His choice of words could perhaps be interpreted as recognition of how much he will need their support facing down the Kim regime.

Trump’s only explicit mention of human rights was to condemn — without naming names — the “governments with egregious human rights records” that sit on the UN Human Rights Council. China and American allies such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar are the obvious suspects. (Trump did say, “We call for the full restoration of democracy and political freedoms in Venezuela,” but his overwhelming focus regarding Venezuela was on attacking its socialist economy.)

He did not raise the humanitarian crisis in Myanmar, where more than 420,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled to Bangladesh in what the United Nations called “a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.” Calling out Myanmar would have carried little political risk for Trump and would have gone a long way toward pressuring the country to drop its brutal campaign.

The focus on sovereignty conjured a picture of a world where every nation only looks out for itself. It is also a world where the United States abandons its role as a leader.

What Trump did not say, therefore, is just as much of a threat to human rights as what he did. He repeatedly extolled the virtues of strong nations over strong international institutions and held up the nation-state as “the best vehicle for elevating the human condition.” What’s unclear just how this is supposed to work. His rhetoric of sovereignty gives oppressive regimes permission to violate their citizens’ rights, and tells the rest of the world it’s okay to turn a blind eye.","Commentary: At the UN, Trump’s silences spoke volumes",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-karas-trump-commentary/commentary-at-the-un-trumps-silences-spoke-volumes-idUSKCN1BW2AC

LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Goldman Sachs is trying to extricate itself from a box by thinking outside it. The Wall Street firm has set up a small team in what’s known internally as the Innovation Lab, to cook up supposedly clever ideas for big clients. The resulting acquisitions may end up destroying value for the shareholders of the companies involved, but Goldman’s own investors should be pleased the investment bank is trying new things.

Giving advice is at the core of the $94 billion institution run by Lloyd Blankfein, which routinely ranks atop the closely watched league tables. Clients such as ride-hailing app Uber and e-commerce giant Amazon turn to Goldman for assistance. Competition is fierce, though, especially since smaller shops started gobbling more market share after the financial crisis. And fees are shrinking.

Dealmaking in the United States is equivalent to 6 percent of total company market value, according to data collated by Credit Suisse. That’s stubbornly below the historical 9 percent average. Adding to the sense of urgency perhaps is Goldman’s trading operation. It makes up a bigger share of the top line, and has been lackluster.

Revenue from buying and selling bonds, yen, oil and the like fell 40 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier. Earnings due next week are likely to be glum again amid low levels of volatility and a market that, most banks warn, is down around 15 percent.

Adding some luster to the M&A franchise therefore makes sense. The trouble is that for a big institution, small initiatives can take years to show results. Goldman is also growing its retail-bank offering, Marcus, which could generate returns on equity that surpass 15 percent, it says – but is still too small to require separate disclosure. That, and Goldman’s plans to freshen up its trading arm, will command far more attention than whatever may come out of the Innovation Lab. At this point, though, experimentation is to be encouraged.",Breakingviews - Goldman necessity mothers M&A invention,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-goldman-sachs-m-a-breakingviews/breakingviews-goldman-necessity-mothers-ma-invention-idUSKBN1CG2FU

ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan accused the United States on Thursday of mistreating a strategic ally, in a blistering speech which appeared to rule out swift resolution to a dispute between two NATO members jointly fighting Islamic State.

Hours after Ankara announced officials would meet soon to settle differences, Erdogan accused the U.S. consulate in Istanbul of hiding an individual with links to a network he blames for last year’s failed coup.

He also condemned U.S. support for Kurdish fighters in Syria and separate U.S. court cases against a senior Turkish banker and the president’s own security guards, mocking what he said was Washington’s claim to be “the capital of democracy”.

Turkey’s relations with the United States and many Western countries have been strained since last year’s failed military coup against Erdogan, in which more than 240 people were killed.

Turkey felt many allies were slow to condemn the coup attempt and failed to appreciate the danger it faced. Western countries have grown alarmed at the scale of Turkey’s post-coup crackdown, with 50,000 people detained and 150,000 suspended from work.

Ties with the United States hit a low when Turkey detained a locally employed worker at the U.S. consulate in Istanbul last week.

The United States says it is still seeking an explanation for the arrest - the second detention of a consulate worker this year. It suspended most visa services in Turkey, saying it needed to review Turkey’s commitment to the security of its mission and staff. Turkey reciprocated within hours.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson spoke with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu on Wednesday and expressed his “profound concern”, the U.S. State Department said.

Erdogan has blamed outgoing U.S. ambassador John Bass, saying he was putting at risk a decades-old alliance.

“Let me be very clear, the person who caused this is the ambassador here. It is unacceptable for the United States to sacrifice a strategic partner to an ambassador who doesn’t know his place,” Erdogan told provincial governors meeting in Ankara.

TURKISH GRIEVANCES

Earlier, Deputy Prime Minister Bekir Bozdag said Turkish and U.S. officials would meet to work on resolving the crisis and described talks between their foreign ministers as constructive.

But Erdogan aired a list of grievances, accusing Washington of sheltering suspected members of the outlawed Kurdish Workers Party (PKK), and supporters of Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen he blames for last year’s coup attempt. Gulen denies involvement.

“On the one hand you say you are the capital of democracy, but you hide PKK and FETO members,” Erdogan said, using the label his government has given to Gulen’s network.

He said Washington was defending a “FETO-linked person hiding in your consulate”, and said a Christian pastor arrested in western Turkey last year was also “clearly linked” to Gulen.

Ambassador Bass said this week no one was hiding in the U.S. consulate, and that he had seen nothing of merit in the charges against the pastor, Andrew Brunson.

Erdogan said U.S. authorities had wrongly arrested the former head of Turkey’s majority state-owned Halkbank, and were trying to use a detained Turkish gold trader “as an informant”. Both men were arrested on charges of sanctions violations.

Referring to a U.S. grand jury indictment of 15 Turkish security officials who clashed with protesters during his visit to Washington in May, Erdogan said most of them had never set foot on U.S. soil. “You issue arrest warrants for 13 of my security staff who have never seen the United States,” he said.

The leadership reshuffle at the Chinese Communist Party Congress, a meeting held once every five years set to kick off on October 18, will see most of the country’s top officials step down. All eyes will be on President Xi Jinping, who could upend decades of party tradition by seizing more power. Some hope a stronger Xi will put China back on the liberalization path. The fear is he will dismantle the consensus-based checks and balances put in place to prevent a return to the excesses of the Mao era.

The president’s boosters think that if Xi can put more trusted lieutenants into position, he will finally overpower so-called vested interests and deliver more aggressive reforms in financial markets and the state-owned sector. Skeptics question how market-oriented Xi is, and suspect he is angling to stay on after his term is due to end in 2022.

The debate will be settled at the end of the conference, when members of the next Politburo Standing Committee walk out on stage in a prearranged order. These individuals will in turn help pick new leaders of key financial and economic regulatory institutions.

There are four key measurements of how much power Xi accrues at the congress.

CAN XI PERSUADE THE POLITBURO TO IGNORE THE AGE LIMIT RULE?

Since the early 2000s, Politburo members have adhered to a “seven up, eight down” rule: officials aged 67 or younger at the time of the congress are eligible for promotion, while those 68 or over step down.

Proponents say this mechanism ensures peaceful transitions of institutional power in China; a tacit agreement among the elite to restrain the executive.

However, the limit is informal, and critics note it originated in gutter politics. Former President Jiang Zemin used the rule to knock opponents out of position. An official from a party think tank said last year the age limit is “folklore” and traditions could be “adjusted.”

At this congress, this question boils down to whether Wang Qishan, the country’s anti-corruption czar, stays or goes. Wang is competent, but he’s 69. The president might use Wang’s extension as a stalking horse, as Xi himself will approach the age limit in 2022. If Wang walks out on stage, it will be an unambiguous sign of Xi’s authority.

CAN HE INSERT “XI JINPING THOUGHT” INTO THE PARTY CONSTITUTION?

While less debated than the age limit, amendments to the party constitution are important; it’s the party’s way of saying how its leaders stack up.

The latest version says the party is committed to “Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, the important thought of the Three Represents, and the Scientific Outlook on Development.” What’s missing from this turgid phrase: any mention of former presidents Jiang and Hu Jintao. Their slogans – “Three Represents” and “Scientific Development,” respectively – are given pride of place, but Hu and Jiang’s names only appear later. The implication is that collective ideas are more important than individuals.

If one of Xi’s signature ideas is included in the amended party constitution without his name, that would be a sign of either institutional restraint on his authority or his own unwillingness to challenge orthodoxy. However, if the party constitution is revised to include something along the lines of “Xi Jinping Thought,” the message would be clear: the era of collective leadership is winding down, and Xi is now China’s most important leader since Mao.

WILL XI REPLACE PREMIER LI KEQIANG?

The Li Keqiang question has consumed Beijing’s rumor mill since around 2015, when whispers surfaced of a falling out with Xi. Li is a veteran of the Communist Youth League, a political faction that the president has cut down to size in recent years.

The odds currently look in favor of Li staying put. The relationship between president and premier now seems less fractious than the rumor mill initially suggested, and Xi has already sidelined Li on economic policy anyway. Plus a scapegoat might be useful if the economy falters. If Xi were to replace the premier, however, it would suggest the president is unwilling to tolerate all but the most loyal lieutenants in positions of power.

DO ANY SUCCESSORS FOR XI LAND IN PUBLIC VIEW?

The Politburo age limits usually means two relatively young leaders are “helicoptered” into the Politburo Standing Committee at the halfway mark of an administration. One is meant to replace the president, and another to take over from the premier.

The running bet is that Chongqing Party Secretary Chen Miner will land the successor spot for president, and perhaps Guangdong Party Secretary Hu Chunhua as the next premier. But if no young faces emerge in the Politburo Standing Committee at the end of the congress, it would suggest Xi plans to stay for another term.",Breakingviews - Breakdown: Xi and China’s leadership reshuffle,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-congress-breakingviews/breakingviews-breakdown-xi-and-chinas-leadership-reshuffle-idUSKBN1CF0A1

FRANKFURT/BERLIN (Reuters) - Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) reinforced its position as Germany’s largest airline on Thursday by signing a 210 million euro ($249 million)deal to buy large parts of insolvent Air Berlin (AB1.DE).

Lufthansa plans to use the Air Berlin assets to quickly expand its Eurowings budget business. News of the deal pushed Lufthansa shares up more than 3 percent to their highest level in nearly 17 years.

Air Berlin, which has struggled to turn a profit over the last decade, filed for insolvency on Aug. 15, and a government loan has kept its planes aloft while its administrator negotiated with prospective buyers for parts of the business.

Lufthansa has agreed to acquire Air Berlin’s Austrian leisure travel airline Niki, its LG Walter regional airline and 20 additional aircraft, Air Berlin said in a statement.

“This contract provides new opportunities for jobs for a large part of our workforce. But we can only really breathe again when the EU Commission approves the deal,” Air Berlin Chief Executive Thomas Winkelmann said.

Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr said earlier he expected the European Union to approve the transaction by the end of 2017.

Talks to sell some of Air Berlin’s remaining assets to Britain’s easyJet (EZJ.L) and other bidders are continuing, Air Berlin said, without providing details.

EasyJet, which has a base at Berlin’s Schoenefeld airport, has been discussing acquiring 27 to 30 planes. Air Berlin previously said others, such as Thomas Cook’s (TCG.L) Condor, could pick up some parts of the business.

EasyJet declined to comment on the progress of talks on Thursday.

BIG INVESTMENTS

Lufthansa CEO Spohr told a German paper earlier that his airline would be investing around 1.5 billion euros in total as a result of the Air Berlin deal.

That sum includes investment in new planes, for which the board freed up 1 billion euros of funds last month, the purchase price and the costs of taking on new staff.

Air Berlin, Germany’s second largest carrier, will cease operating flights this month, capping a turbulent summer for European carriers.

Italy’s national airline Alitalia [CAITLA.UL] is in administration and seeking investors too, British leisure airline Monarch collapsed at the start of this month.

Lufthansa’s Spohr said on Thursday while he was not interested in the Italian carrier in its current shape he would be interested in talks to create a new Alitalia.

Shares in Lufthansa were up 3.3 percent at 25.38 euros, the top gainer in Germany’s DAX market index <0#.GDAXI> by 1340 GMT.

Analysts at Bernstein Research raised their rating on Lufthansa’s shares to “outperform” from “market-perform”, saying they expected a deal with Air Berlin to add around 70 to 90 million euros to annual operating profits at Lufthansa’s budget unit Eurowings in the medium term.

The Protivin brewery in South Bohemia has placed the creatures, which react quickly to changes in their aquatic environment, in fish tanks through which is pumped water from the same natural source that the brewery uses.

The animals are fitted with infrared bio-sensors which monitor their heartbeat and movement. Data is analyzed by a computer, and any changes in the animals’ body or behavior flags a change in the purity levels of the water in its tank.

“When three or more crayfish are moving or change their pulse activity, we know that the water parameters have changed. We can react quickly because we have the result within three minutes,” head brewer Michal Voldrich told Reuters.

The water system was developed and patented by scientists at the Faculty of Fisheries and Protection of Water at South Bohemia University at Vodnany.

“We are using crayfish like a living chemical laboratory – like a bio indicator and bio sensor together,” said Pavel Kozak, Director of the university’s Research Institute of Fish Culture and Hydrobiology.

“The crayfish react very fast on any non-specific change, which is different than any other detectors, which react fast on a very low concentration (of pollution) but only on one specific agent.”

Researchers aim to upgrade the technology used in the scheme, and plan to use special cameras to monitor the animals’ hearts.

Five months into Trump’s presidency, the survey spanning 37 nations showed U.S. favorability ratings in the rest of the world slumping to 49 percent from 64 percent at the end of Barack Obama’s eight years in the White House.

But the falls were far steeper in some of America’s closest allies, including U.S. neighbors Mexico and Canada, and European partners like Germany and Spain.

Trump took office in January pledging to put “America First”. Since then he has pressed ahead with plans to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, announced he will pull out of the Paris climate accord, and accused countries including Canada, Germany and China of unfair trade practices.

On his first foreign trip as president in early June, Trump received warm welcomes in Saudi Arabia and Israel, but a cool reception from European partners, with whom he clashed over NATO spending, climate and trade.

Just 30 percent of Mexicans now say they have a favorable view of the United States, down from 66 percent at the end of the Obama era. In Canada and Germany, favorability ratings slid by 22 points, to 43 percent and 35 percent, respectively.

In many European countries, the ratings were comparable to those seen at the end of the presidency of George W. Bush, whose 2003 invasion of Iraq was deeply unpopular.

“The drop in favorability ratings for the United States is widespread,” the Pew report said. “The share of the public with a positive view of the U.S. has plummeted in a diverse set of countries from Latin America, North America, Europe, Asia and Africa”.

BELOW PUTIN AND XI

The survey, based on the responses of 40,447 people and conducted between Feb. 16 and May 8 this year, showed even deeper mistrust of Trump himself, with only 22 percent of those surveyed saying they had confidence he would do the right thing in world affairs, compared to 64 percent who trusted Obama.

Both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, with confidence ratings of 27 percent and 28 percent respectively, scored higher than Trump. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, with a confidence rating of 42 percent, scored highest among the four leaders in the survey.

The countries with the lowest confidence in Trump were Mexico, at 5 percent and Spain at 7 percent. The only two countries where ratings improved compared to Obama were Russia, where confidence in the U.S. president surged to 53 percent from 11 percent, and Israel, where it rose 7 points to 56 percent.

Globally, 75 percent of respondents described Trump as “arrogant”, 65 percent as “intolerant” and 62 percent as “dangerous”. A majority of 55 percent also described him as a “strong leader”.

The survey showed widespread disapproval of Trump’s signature policy proposals, with 76 percent unhappy with his plan to build the wall on the border with Mexico, 72 percent against his withdrawal from major trade agreements and 62 percent opposed to his plans to restrict travel to the U.S. from some majority-Muslim countries.

PARIS (Reuters) - The United States announced on Thursday it was withdrawing from UNESCO, the U.N.’s cultural and educational agency, complaining about how it is run and about what Washington described as bias against Israel.

“This decision was not taken lightly, and reflects U.S. concerns with mounting arrears at UNESCO, the need for fundamental reform in the organization, and continuing anti-Israel bias,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement.

The withdrawal of the United States, which provides a fifth of UNESCO’s funding, is a severe blow for the Paris-based organization which began work in 1946 and is known for designating World Heritage sites such as the ancient city of Palmyra in Syria and the Grand Canyon National Park.

Under UNESCO rules, the withdrawal will become effective as of the end of December 2018. Until that time, the United States, which provides around $80 million to UNESCO annually, will remain a full member.

The organization, which employs around 2,000 people worldwide, most of them based in Paris, has long been the object of criticism over its use of resources and resolutions that have been perceived by Israel and other countries as biased.

Director-General Irina Bokova expressed disappointment at the U.S. decision.

“At the time when conflicts continue to tear apart societies across the world, it is deeply regrettable for the United States to withdraw from the United Nations agency promoting education for peace and protecting culture under attack,” she said.

“This is a loss to the United Nations family. This is a loss for multilateralism.”

UNESCO is in the process of selecting a new chief, whose priority will be to revive its fortunes.

The U.S. move underscores the scepticism expressed by President Donald Trump about the need for the United States to remain engaged in multi-lateral bodies. The president has touted an “America First” policy, which puts U.S. economic and nationalist interests ahead of international commitments.

Since Trump took office, the United States has abandoned the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade talks, withdrawn from the Paris climate deal and opened up a renegotiation of a decades old trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, NAFTA. Trump has also called NATO obsolete, though he has since backtracked on that.

Diplomats expressed concern about the loss of U.S. engagement.

“The absence of the United States or any large country with a lot of power is a loss. It’s not just about money, it’s promoting ideals that are vital to countries like the United States, such as education and culture,” a UNESCO-based diplomat said.

For differing reasons, Britain, Japan and Brazil are among states that have yet to pay their dues for 2017.

After three days of secret balloting that could run until Friday, Qatar’s Hamad bin Abdulaziz al-Kawari and France’s Audrey Azoulay are tied to win the top post at the organization, with Egyptian hopeful Moushira Khattab in third. Two other candidates trail.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Thursday as U.S. fuel inventories rose despite efforts by OPEC to cut production.

Brent crude oil LCOc1 was down 75 cents at $56.19 a barrel by 1340 GMT. U.S. light crude CLc1 was $1.00 lower at $50.30. Both benchmarks have risen more than 20 percent from their lows in June as world oil markets tightened.

U.S. crude stocks rose by 3.1 million to 468.5 million barrels last week, according to the American Petroleum Institute.

Official U.S. inventory data was due to be published later on Thursday by the Energy Information Administration (EIA).

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers, including Russia, agreed last year to reduce output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) to prop up prices.

The cuts have helped deplete global fuel inventories, but stocks are still high and well above the five-year average, a target that OPEC has said it wants to reach in order to balance the market.

High U.S. production is pushing increasing volumes of U.S. crude into world markets, feeding inventories and undermining OPEC’s efforts to tighten the market C-OUT-T-EIA.

The International Energy Agency said on Thursday demand for OPEC oil would be 32.5 million bpd next year - around 150,000 bpd lower than the group pumped last month.

Carsten Fritsch, commodities analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, said the tone of the IEA report was bearish because it suggested that demand for OPEC crude next year would not be sufficient to absorb all the available supplies.

“This means OPEC must deepen its production cuts to finish its job of bringing oil stocks back to the five-year average,” Fritsch said.

The OPEC-led deal helped lift oil from below $30 a barrel early last year. But traders say supplies remain ample and OPEC is widely expected to extend its cuts beyond the current expiry date of end-March 2018.

“There is little doubt that leading producers have re-committed to do whatever it takes to underpin the market,” the IEA said in a report on Thursday.

Many analysts expect Brent to stay between $50 and $60 a barrel as long as global markets stay balanced.

“Our updated global supply-demand balance ... shows peak stock draws in 3Q17,” Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients.

The U.S. bank said oil supply and demand fundamentals meant it expected Brent to average $58 a barrel in 2018.",Oil prices fall on higher U.S. crude inventories,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil/oil-prices-fall-on-higher-u-s-crude-inventories-idINKBN1CH01T?il=0

LONDON (Reuters) - Harvey Weinstein was suspended from the British film academy BAFTA on Wednesday, following allegations that the Hollywood movie producer sexually assaulted several women.

“In light of recent very serious allegations, BAFTA has informed Harvey Weinstein that his membership has been suspended, effective immediately,” the academy said in a statement.

“We hope this announcement sends a clear message that such behavior has absolutely no place in our industry.”

In an article in the New Yorker on Tuesday, Weinstein’s spokeswoman Sallie Hofmeister responded to the allegations, saying that “any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein”.

“Mr. Weinstein obviously can’t speak to anonymous allegations, but with respect to any women who have made allegations on the record, Mr. Weinstein believes that all of these relationships were consensual.”

Reuters was unable to independently confirm any of the allegations. Weinstein and several of the women cited in the article have not immediately replied to emailed requests for comment.

That hero, widely available in factories across the world, was the Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine.

Big, grey and boxy, CNC machines use pre-programmed guides to produce intricate parts for everything from automobiles and mobile phones to furniture and clothes. They offer accuracy that human machine tool operators are unable to achieve.

In North Korea, thanks to a combination of homemade technology and reverse engineering, the machines now play a critical role in the weapons programs. They allow Kim Jong Un to build nuclear bombs and missiles without relying as heavily on outside technical aid or imports.

Nuclear weapons experts say this has helped him accelerate missile and nuclear testing despite international sanctions on the transfer of sensitive equipment.

Interactive: Kim’s latest act of defiance

“North Korea’s centrifuges and new missiles all depend on components made with CNC machine tools,” said Jeffrey Lewis, head of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of Strategic Studies at Monterey, California.

“(They) are the essential underlying technology for producing missiles and nuclear weapons,” said Lewis.

Since 1996, CNC machines have been included in the Wassenaar Arrangement – an international arms control regime aimed at stopping the proliferation of equipment with both civilian and military uses. North Korea is not a signatory.

The country’s celebrations of its CNC technology have been fulsome. Hundreds of dancers in luminous orange and green performed the CNC pop song, titled “Break through the cutting edge,” at a Korean Workers’ Party celebration in 2010. In 2012, the year the South Korean hit “Gangnam Style” was released, the North’s CNC title was on karaoke machines nationwide, according to Choson Exchange, a Singapore-based company that trains North Koreans in business skills. The official video for the song opens with a long-range North Korean rocket soaring into a blue sky.

CUTTING EDGE

North Korea likely started to develop its own CNC machines in the early 1990s as part of a drive to build sophisticated missiles and nuclear weapons, nuclear experts say. It probably learned how to make them by taking apart machines it had imported from the Soviet Union.

North Koreans perform during mass games in Pyongyang, August 2011. Choson Exchange/via REUTERS

Its first homemade CNC machine was introduced in 1995. Former leader Kim Jong Il gave the machine the “Ryonha” brand, according to a 2009 article in the country’s official newspaper, Rodong Sinmun. That was the first time state media mentioned the technology.

By 2009, the machines had become a mainstay of North Korean propaganda, as Pyongyang launched a nationwide campaign to boost domestic industry. Sanctions were mounting after its second nuclear test and a long-range missile launch that year.

At the time, arms control experts raised concerns about a visit by former leader Kim Jong Il to a North Korean factory where homemade CNC machines appeared to be producing aluminum tubes. These could be used for nuclear centrifuges.

“By around 2010, it seemed they were capable of manufacturing various types of CNC machines,” said Kim Heung-gwang, a North Korean defector who taught at Pyongyang’s Hamhung Computer Technology University before defecting to South Korea.

But it wasn’t until 2013 that the Korea Ryonha Machinery Joint Venture Corporation, which produced the machines, was blacklisted by the U.N. Security Council for supporting the weapons programs.

And it was only in August this year that U.S. intelligence officials told Reuters North Korea likely has the ability to produce its own missile engines themselves. (Full Story)

Now, Kim Heung-gwang estimates, North Korea has about 15,000 CNC machines. He bases this on North Korean state media reports and photos as well as interviews with more than a dozen defectors who were scientists, professors or factory workers.

MASS PRODUCTION

Pyongyang hailed the homemade machines as a triumph for its governing ideology of “Juche”, which champions self-sufficiency. But that wasn’t strictly true.

In August 2016, state media released photos of Kim Jong Un visiting a factory using CNC machines with the logo of Swiss engineering firm ABB ABB.UL, one of the leading players in the global CNC machine market. It’s not clear when or how the machine reached North Korea.

ABB said the firm respects all applicable trade sanctions against North Korea, and undertakes not to deliver ABB equipment to the country. “That said, we cannot rule out that some of our equipment may have been resold to DPR of Korea without our knowledge or permission,” the company said in response to a Reuters inquiry, using North Korea’s official title.

A United Nations panel monitoring sanctions on North Korea said in a report this year that Tengzhou Keyongda CNC Machine Tools Co of China had been a supplier of Pyongyang’s new CNC machines. A sales representative for Tengzhou Keyongda told Reuters the company stopped selling CNC machines to North Korea four years ago, and no longer maintains trade relations with the country.

Despite sanctions, CNC machines are commonplace across North Korean manufacturing and can be brought in through China and Russia, said Lee Choon-geun, a senior fellow at the Science and Technology Policy Institute in South Korea.

The biggest loophole has been that while some CNC machines are banned because they can have both military and civilian functions, most serve civilian industry. “Given their dual-use capability, you could even import the machines for other purposes, take them to pieces and use them however you want,” said Lee.

The CNC song highlights this in its opening line: “Whatever it is, once we put our mind to it, there’s a program to make it,” it says.",How a homemade tool helped North Korea's missile program,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-northkorea-missiles-technology/how-a-homemade-tool-helped-north-koreas-missile-programme-idUKKBN1CH1IC

Sky shareholders have legitimate complaints.","LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Sky shareholders face a choice between principles and profit. Some investors are planning to oppose Chairman James Murdoch’s re-election because he is also chief executive of 39 percent owner Twenty-First Century Fox. But kicking up a stink might further jeopardise Fox’s offer for the European pay-TV group.

Sky investor Royal London Asset Management had a point last week when it called Murdoch’s dual role “inappropriate” and said shareholders would be better served by a truly independent chairman during the takeover. Shareholder advisory groups, meanwhile, object to Sky’s executive pay. One problem is that some long-term incentive packages could pay out with no performance conditions if Fox’s offer gets the green light, according to Glass Lewis.

Murdoch survived an investor backlash last year, winning election with around 70 percent support. Strip out Fox’s stake and abstentions, however, and just half of Sky’s independent shareholders backed the chairman.

Concerns about conflicts of interest are more pressing this time. Fox’s bid is on ice until at least March 2018 while UK authorities study its effects on the country’s media ownership and broadcasting standards. Sky investor Crispin Odey has argued that the delays are beginning to make the offer look on the low side.

That logic is questionable. When it was launched in December 2016, Fox’s offer of 10.75 pounds per share represented a 40 premium to Sky’s market value. The shares would probably fall to around 8 pounds if the bid is blocked. Notwithstanding their concerns about Murdoch’s independence, most Sky shareholders would bite Fox’s hands off if they got a chance to vote on the bid.

That is why investors might hesitate before lodging a protest vote as long as Fox and the Murdoch family are under a regulatory microscope. Campaigners have argued that past sexual harassment and phone-hacking scandals in the Murdoch empire are grounds for blocking the takeover. Drawing attention to the family’s governance shortcomings could add to the political pressure on UK Media Secretary Karen Bradley, who must rule on the deal. Sky shareholders have legitimate complaints.

ESTCOURT, South Africa (Reuters) - Police fired rubber bullets and stun grenades to break up crowds hurling insults at a group of men accused of cannibalism in a South African farming town.

More than 500 people gathered outside the magistrates court in eastern Kwa-Zulu Natal province on Thursday as the men sat inside, hiding their faces with their hooded tops and their hands.

Authorities originally charged seven men after police said one of them had walked into a police station in August with a human leg and a hand. Police spokeswoman Col. Thembeka Mbele told Reuters on Thursday he had confessed that he was tired of eating human flesh.

The court acquitted three of the men on Thursday on charges of murder and conspiracy to commit murder, saying there was a lack of evidence. The other four were held in custody and the case adjourned until Oct. 27.

“We have not charged them with cannibalism, as no such charge exists as far as I know,” Mbele said.

“No one has seen them eating any of the human parts they had in their possession but we are still investigating,” she added.

Officers were also investigating the suspects for the offence of possessing human remains, Mbele said.

Police blocked streets outside the court in the town of Estcourt, about 160 km (100 miles) north of Durban, Kwa-Zulu Natal’s biggest city.

They fired the teargas and grenades to keep the crowds at bay as security officers drove all seven men back to jail - the three acquitted man were released later.

Berlin (Reuters) - Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel (CDU) hält sich vor den Sondierungsgesprächen über eine Jamaika-Koalition beim umstrittenen Familiennachzug für Flüchtlinge alle Optionen offen.

“Über schwierige Punkte werden wir miteinander in Ruhe sprechen - und nicht in Interviews”, sagte Merkel der “Neuen Osnabrücker Zeitung” (Donnerstagausgabe) auf die Frage, ob die Pläne einer Koalition zwischen Union, Grünen und FDP an der Frage des Familiennachzugs scheitern könnten. Grünen-Fraktionschef Anton Hofreiter bezeichnete das Thema im ZDF-Morgenmagazin dagegen als “ganz zentralen Punkt” für seine Partei.

Integration sei schwierig, wenn Menschen ihre Familie nicht nachholen könnten, sagte Hofreiter. Ein “Aufmalen von roten Linien” vor den Sondierungsgesprächen kommende Woche halte er aber nicht für sinnvoll.

Der Nachzug von Familienangehörigen ist in Deutschland bis März 2018 für jene Personen ausgesetzt, denen subsidiärer Schutz gewährt wird. Dieser Schutz gilt für Menschen, die nicht als individuell verfolgt gelten, denen in ihrer Heimat aber dennoch Folter, anderweitige unmenschliche Behandlung oder gar die Todesstrafe droht oder in deren Ländern Krieg herrscht. Das Aufenthaltsrecht wird dann nur für ein Jahr ausgesprochen, kann aber verlängert werden. Als weiteren zentralen Punkt für die Grünen nannte Hofreiter die Schaffung legaler Fluchtwege.

Merkel rechnet in diesen Fragen mit langen Beratungen: “Es wird mit FDP und Grünen noch auf vielen Gebieten Diskussionen geben, schließlich haben wir sehr unterschiedliche Ausgangspositionen.” FDP-Chef Christian Lindner beharrte in der österreichischen Zeitung “Die Presse” darauf, dass Flüchtlinge die Perspektive haben müssten, in ihre alte Heimat zurückzukehren. “Humanitärer Schutz darf nicht automatisch zu Daueraufenthalt führen”. Ob dieser Schutz noch nötig sei, müsse nach drei, fünf oder zehn Jahren überprüft werden.

In the 1960’s and 1970’s, the central goal was preventing North Korean founder Kim Il Sung from redeploying his army south of the 38th parallel. For the last 25 years, however, the focus of U.S. policymakers has been something even more difficult: the denuclearization of the Kim dynasty.

Pyongyang’s two intercontinental ballistic missile tests in July, its testing of a Hwasong-12 missile over Japan in August and the September 3 test of what Pyongyang claimed was a hydrogen bomb have only accelerated the sense of urgency in Washington, Seoul, and Tokyo about the need for a strong collective response.

The U.S. foreign policy community has many recommendations on the table but few easy answers. A preventive military strike is not plausible given its devastating cost - Brigadier General Rob Givens (retired) estimates that 20,000 people would perish in Seoul in the first day of a conflict. Even though the U.N. Security Council voted Monday to step up sanctions against Pyongyang, economic restrictions have limited impact. Pyongyang is a master of sanctions evasion, devising ever new and effective ways to keep their weapons programs funded.

What may work, however, is a new U.S. approach that learns from its failures - as well as its successes during the Cold War - while tempering expectations on what can be achieved.

The Kim dynasty has long sought recognition as a nuclear weapons state, a demand that would be a political minefield for even the most popular U.S. president to meet. But North Korea is a nuclear state whether Washington offers formal recognition or not. The only way for the U.S. to improve its North Korea policy is by acknowledging that Pyongyang will be nuclear-capable for many years to come and is highly unlikely to eliminate its nuclear weapons program regardless of what Washington offers. This isn’t about what Kim Jong Un wants, but rather what is most likely to serve U.S. national security.

While openly recognizing North Korea as a nuclear power would cause tremors throughout Asia, Trump ought to do it anyway. As soon as he does, the U.S. can re-focus attention from a denuclearization objective that is increasingly impossible to imagine toward an old-fashioned strategy of deterrence and containment. “We know how to contain and degrade enemies who want to do us harm,” Harry Kazianis of the Center for the National Interest told me. “We just need to open a history book and reread what works and apply it for the 21st century.”

For Washington, deterrence and containment would mean building an anti-North Korea alliance of diverse states in and outside the region with the common objective of minimizing Pyongyang’s ability to threaten its neighbors. As former State Department official Richard Sokolsky told me in an email: “If we could deter the likes of Stalin and Mao, we can do the same with Kim.”

As politically risky as this decision would be, effective deterrence would require Trump to establish a reliable channel of communication with the North - similar to the U.S.-Soviet and U.S.-China hotlines during the Cold War - in order to clear up misunderstandings that will inevitably arise and to deliver a unified message of what Washington will tolerate. The signal to the leadership in Pyongyang should be as unambiguous as possible: while Washington does not seek an armed conflict with the North, the U.S. military will respond to any provocation that dangerously impacts the interests of the U.S. or its allies. The message would aim to trade coexistence between the U.S. and North Korea for as long as Kim Jong Un refrains from launching an attack against his neighbors. Given Kim’s preoccupation with self-preservation - there is no evidence to date he is bent on suicidal self-destruction - this arrangement may be pragmatic enough for the young dictator to explore.

Because the Kim dynasty has been accused of exporting and cooperating with countries like Iran and Syria on nuclear designs, missile technology, and possibly chemical weapons development, the Security Council ought to deliver a similar message to Pyongyang that a continuation of this behavior would be grounds for an even tougher and more comprehensive boycott of what it can import and export.

While China remains resistant to cutting off all oil imports to the North or squeezing its economy to the point of collapse, Washington may be willing to enlist Beijing’s help in areas where Beijing is more likely to agree, such as preventing the proliferation of dual use nuclear and missile technology transiting North Korean territory. Stemming the flow of these materials would minimize the spread of weapons of dangerous items to other proliferators, an objective that the Chinese appear to share.

Washington also needs to encourage a stronger South Korea-Japan relationship. Historical rivalries between these two states cannot obstruct the regional intelligence sharing essential to promoting a unity of purpose in East Asia. The Trump administration needs to spend far more diplomatic capital on alliance-building than it has to date. Open talk about scrapping the free trade agreement only destabilizes the kinds of partnerships that form the bedrock of an anti-Pyongyang alliance. Washington can and should allow the South Koreans to take more responsibility for its external defense, but it can do so without giving Pyongyang a reason to believe that its nuclear development is causing divisions among its adversaries.

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus directors publicly backed Chief Executive Tom Enders on Thursday in the face of European investigations into the use of middlemen in airplane sales and a $2 billion fighter deal.

But in a sign of the disquiet within the aerospace group, the board only declared its support for Enders after its own review of senior management, two people familiar with the matter said.

The investigations by Britain’s Serious Fraud Office and later its French counterpart were triggered by Airbus in 2016 when it reported itself to UK authorities after uncovering flawed documents over the use of intermediaries in airplane sales.

Enders and legal counsel John Harrison have come under fire from within Airbus and in the French media for opening the floodgates to widening investigations and for overseeing what several insiders have called an internal witch-hunt.

The Airbus board defended the decision to alert UK authorities to its initial findings.

“These decisions were made with the board’s unanimous approval and actions were all directed by Tom Enders, the company’s CEO,” it said in a statement.

“The Board has full trust and confidence in Tom and depends on his leadership to continue the transformation of the company and in particular our compliance program alongside our General Counsel, John Harrison,” it added.

The board’s own assessment of the group’s top executives was carried out over the summer and was commissioned to evaluate whether senior managers played any role that created risks for the company. No such evidence was discovered, the people said.

Enders has been placed under separate investigation in Vienna over a 2003 Eurofighter sale to Austria, but has denied any wrongdoing and says the probe is politically charged.

The board’s decision to examine its own top management highlights efforts being taken to restore stability after months of tension as the corruption row deepens.

Airbus Chairman Denis Ranque continues to support Enders, but people familiar with the discussions say he is choosing his words carefully pending the outcome of the probe.

“There is certainly some alarm at board level,” a person familiar with the discussions said.

Enders has promised to drive through sweeping changes in the company’s culture as legal experts say Airbus is preparing the ground for what it hopes could be a deal with UK prosecutors.

He told staff in a letter disclosed to Reuters last week to prepare for turbulence and that he and Harrison had the board’s unanimous backing to lead Airbus out of the legal crisis.",Airbus board backs CEO after reviewing top management,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-airbus-board/airbus-board-backs-ceo-after-reviewing-top-management-idUSKBN1CH180

(Reuters) - Democrats desperate to rebuild after losing the White House last year have scored a string of election victories for statehouse seats, testing a new generation of candidates and activists eager to resist President Donald Trump’s conservative agenda.

From New Hampshire to Oklahoma, Democrats have flipped eight Republican-held seats in special legislative elections, having spent millions of dollars on low-turnout contests mostly being fought over local issues. The wins showcase how Democrats want to fight back after losing to Trump and hitting historic lows in statehouses.

But the party faces challenges carrying this momentum into the 2018 midterm elections when thousands of seats are at stake, interviews with nearly two dozen Democratic leaders, campaigns and other political experts show.

“Can we recruit enough capable candidates, and can we run enough modern races?” asked Simon Rosenberg, a Democratic political strategist. He said the party must test its future leaders in real time. “Are they ready? The answer is: We don’t know.”

In November, Democrats will get an early read.

One critical test is in Washington state, where first-time candidate Manka Dhingra is running for an up-for-grabs senate seat in Seattle’s suburbs. A victory on Nov. 7 would give Democrats full control of the state.

A prosecutor and school parent volunteer, Dhingra is a Sikh Indian American whose political awakening began with businessman Trump’s surprise election victory over experienced politician Hillary Clinton. Still, Dhingra steers clear of mentioning the president in her pitch to swing voters.

“The Trump reaction, the way it works is by invigorating volunteers,” Dhingra said. “There are a lot of people, like myself, who decided we cannot be bystanders.”

Nearly 2,000 volunteers have signed up through her campaign website alone, evidence of what the party calls unprecedented interest in legislative contests.

An August primary, where Dhingra finished 10 points ahead of her Republican competitor, had a relatively robust turnout, including nearly 6,000 voters who normally skip primaries.

Outside of Washington state, however, a few Democratic wins will do little to change the political map going into the 2018 midterm elections.

Republicans control 26 state governments and two-thirds of legislative chambers. Democrats hemorrhaged power at the state level during President Barack Obama’s eight years in office with their attention on national elections.

Now Democrats see the states as critical for rebuilding, and an opportunity to advance legislation pushing back against Trump’s agenda of gutting Democratic health care reforms and environmental protections and cracking down on immigration.

VOTER OUTREACH

The party plans to recruit hundreds of thousands of volunteers to contact more than 30 million voters - double their outreach in statehouse contests in the 2016 presidential cycle.

“Because of the gridlock in Washington, people are turning to statehouses for security from Donald Trump,” said Jessica Post, executive director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.

But the party’s many inexperienced candidates must beat battle-tested incumbents in elections next year with greater voter turnout.

“If the Democrats have every bit of momentum and the wildest day they could think of, they may take us from super majorities to majorities,” said David Avella, chairman of the Republican group GOPAC. “But we will still have majorities.”

Democrats have flipped legislative seats in Florida, Oklahoma, New Hampshire and New York in 2017. Republicans picked up an uncontested seat in Louisiana.

In Oklahoma, where Trump won 65 percent of the vote in the 2016 general election, the Democrats flipped three seats in districts he carried. Candidates doubled down on local issues, such as a budget crisis forcing four-day school weeks.

They had a chance to “represent themselves as real people that weren’t actually attached to Nancy Pelosi, or Hillary Clinton, or Barack Obama,” said Anna Langthorn, Oklahoma Democratic Party chairwoman.

Some of the special elections success reflects startup progressive groups rallying voters. But they have yet to figure out how to expand their scope for 2018.

Chris Walsh, a cofounder of Flippable, which is working to win back state governments, went to Florida last month to help Democrat Annette Taddeo beat a Republican former legislator who once competed on Trump’s reality TV show, “The Apprentice.”

“There is a lot of knowledge out there that is siloed,” Walsh said, adding the party could help by sharing information such as district voting data with new groups.

This year’s most revealing contests will come in a statewide election in Virginia, where Democrats face a long-shot bid in November to pick up 17 seats and take back the House of Delegates.

In a show of enthusiasm to rebuild, the party is fielding a ticket that is more than 50 percent larger than two years ago. Yet fewer than one in four of the mostly women vying for Republican-held seats have raised more money than their competitors, Virginia Public Access Project data showed.

Republicans are also ramping up in defense. They anticipate state contests will be central to Democratic efforts in 2018, given their longer odds of reclaiming the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress.

“The Democrats are trying to probe for the weakest link, and they are looking for that at the state level,” said Matt Walter, president of the Republican State Leadership Committee. “It is our job to make sure that doesn’t happen.”",Democrats rising?

LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin smashed through the $5,000 barrier for the first time on Thursday, jumping as much as 8 percent on the day as investors shrugged off the latest warnings on the risks of buying into the booming cryptocurrency market.

Bitcoin, the biggest and best-known cryptocurrency, has chalked up a more than fivefold increase in price this year.

Typically for bitcoin, which at less than nine years old is still highly volatile and illiquid compared with traditional currencies and assets, the precise reason for its recent tear was unclear.

Upcoming splits in its software, reports that Goldman Sachs is considering offering bitcoin trading, rumors that China could ease restrictions, and even a political crisis in Spain’s Catalonia region were all cited by market-watchers as reasons for the rally.

But the main factor could simply be demand from investors wanting ‘in’ on a market that has provided gains exceeding those of any other currency in every year bar one since 2010.

“People are just wanting to be part of it,” said Ryan Nettles, head of FX trading and market strategy at Swiss bank Swissquote, which launched bitcoin trading two months ago. Nettles said interest had been much higher than anticipated and has come from banks, hedge funds and brokers.

“The interest really stems from the media hype,” he added.

On Wednesday Russian President Vladimir Putin warned of the “serious risks” surrounding the nascent market, while Russia’s central bank said it would ban cryptocurrency trading websites.

But that was not enough to put investors off, with bitcoin rallying around 10 percent since then.

Data released last week from SEMrush, a search engine data analytics firm, found the price had a 91 percent correlation with Google searches on bitcoin, suggesting that all news -- whether negative or positive -- drives up demand, even if bad news can have a temporary negative effect.

Bitcoin almost reached $5,000 at the start of September, but fell back sharply after the head of Goldman Sachs blasted the cryptocurrency as a “fraud” and as China forced exchanges to close down, sparking fears of a broader crackdown.

But after dipping below $3,000 in mid-September, bitcoin has leapt in value by more than 75 percent in four weeks.

“Bitcoin was designed to operate outside of the influence of governments and central banks, and is doing exactly that,” said Iqbal Gandham, Managing Director at retail trading app eToro, which has seen huge increases in cryptocurrency trading volumes.

CRYPTO-RIVALS ALSO RALLY

By 1245 GMT, bitcoin was trading up 8 percent on the day around $5,200 on Luxembourg-based exchange Bitstamp.

Though there have been many warnings about a bitcoin “bubble”, including from European Central Bank Deputy Governor Vitor Constancio, some say it has much further to climb. But determining its value is difficult.

“For most currencies there are several accepted methodologies for estimating relative value, normally based on macroeconomic fundamentals,” said EFG Asset Management’s Global Head of Research, Daniel Murray. “For bitcoin no such fundamentals exist.”

Other cryptocurrencies -- whose prices tend to be highly correlated to bitcoin -- also rallied. Their total value -- or market capitalization -- climbed above $160 billion for the first time since early September, according to industry website Coinmarketcap.com.

Two upcoming “forks” in the bitcoin software code, which will create rival clones of the cryptocurrency, were seen by some as a reason for the rise in price, which saw a boost after the “Bitcoin Cash” clone was created at the start of August.

“Investors are seeing the lessons of history in the up-and-coming forks and hoping for an extra dividend,” said Charles Hayter, co-founder of data analysis website Cryptocompare, adding that rumors on online forums that China could reopen exchanges could also be affecting the price.","Bitcoin rockets above $5,000 to all-time high",https://www.reuters.com/article/global-markets-bitcoin/bitcoin-rockets-above-5000-to-all-time-high-idINKBN1CH0ZC?il=0

For example, regulators could force energy companies to put consumers on the cheapest fixed-rate tariff by default.","LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - British Prime Theresa May’s energy plan has few political merits and even fewer economic ones. Her government said on Thursday it will cap the most commonly used energy prices until 2020 to ensure consumers pay less. The intention is laudable, but the biggest intervention since Britain privatised its energy industry three decades ago may do more harm than good.

Britons pay one of the lowest rates in western Europe per unit of energy consumed, according to Eurostat. Adjust for purchasing power differences, and they pay one of the lowest rates across the whole European Union (see graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2xBuOB2). That may be because Britain has more major energy suppliers than most other EU countries and is one of a minority where the combined market share of the three largest suppliers is below 70 percent, according to Europe’s Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (see graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2xxrTsV).

Many consumers are not benefiting from competition, though. Two-thirds of UK households pay so-called standard variable tariffs even though they could save money by moving to cheaper fixed-rate deals. Inertia, fears that changing providers is complex, and a fuzzy idea of potential savings may explain why regulator Ofgem found that less a fifth of customers switched suppliers last year. May calls the market “broken”.

Putting a limit on standard variable tariffs may not lead to a better outcome, though. Granted, an energy cap will in the short term cut most consumers’ bills. But a 2014 ACER report found that a regulated price acts as a gravitational force around which competing suppliers cluster. A cap therefore risks compressing the range of available tariffs and could push up prices if weaker competitors are squeezed out of the market.

Politics sometimes explain decisions that economics cannot. But May’s plan is politically flawed as well. The opposition Labour Party proposed a cap before the 2015 elections and has since gone further by talking of renationalising the energy industry.

There are better options. For example, regulators could force energy companies to put consumers on the cheapest fixed-rate tariff by default. Suppliers could also be required to inform clients of the cheapest tariff available in the market and savings they could make by switching. The latest intervention may force the industry to change. In the meantime, though, a price cap could hurt those it is supposed to help.",UK energy cap is bad economics and poor politics,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-energy-breakingviews/uk-energy-cap-is-bad-economics-and-poor-politics-idUSKBN1CH22F

Frankfurt (Reuters) - Die Krypto-Währung Bitcoin hat am Donnerstag erstmals die Marke von 5000 Dollar durchbrochen.

Auf der Handelsplattform BitStamp verteuerte sich ein Bitcoin um bis zu 7,6 Prozent auf 5186 Dollar. Bitcoin ist die bekannteste und gemessen am Handelsvolumen wichtigste Cyber-Währung. Der Kurs liegt etwa 75 Prozent über dem Niveau vor rund einem Monat. Seit dem Anfang 2017 hat er sich mehr als verfünffacht. “Anleger scheinen Nachrichten über potenzielle Börsenschließungen förmlich zu ignorieren”, kommentierte Analyst Timo Emden vom Brokerhaus IG. Der Risikoappetit der Anleger sei zurückgekehrt.

Vor wenigen Wochen hatten in China Handelsplattformen für Bitcoin & Co ihren Betrieb eingestellt, nachdem Behörden vor den Risiken von Cyber-Währungen gewarnt hatten. Daraufhin war der Bitcoin-Kurs um mehr als 1000 Dollar eingebrochen. Auch Russland will den Handel mit dem per Computer geschaffenen Geld einschränken. So will das Land den Zugang zu bestimmten Internetseiten blockieren, die Krypto-Währungen anbieten.

Ein Grund für die jüngste Kursrally sind Analysten zufolge Spekulationen auf eine bevorstehende technische Neuerung bei Bitcoin. Am 25. Oktober werde es vermutlich zu einer weiteren Teilung der Währung kommen, sagte Mati Greenspan, Experte bei der Handelsplattform eToro. Eine solche Teilung wurde bereits Anfang August vollzogen, um die Ausbreitung der Währung zu beschleunigen. Sie wurde deshalb aufgespalten in Bitcoin und Bitcoin Cash. Nun solle zudem Bitcoin Gold entstehen, sagte Greenspan. Seinen Worten zufolge ist der Einstieg für Anleger derzeit deshalb so attraktiv, weil sie die Aussicht haben, für jeden Bitcoin einen neuen Bitcoin Gold geschenkt zu bekommen.",Krypto-Währung Bitcoin durchbricht erstmals Marke von 5000 Dollar,https://www.reuters.com/article/m-rkte-bitcoin-idDEKBN1CH19Z

Shell said NewMotion, which manages over 30,000 charging points for electric vehicles in Western Europe and offers access to thousands more, will operate in parallel to Shell’s program of rolling out fast charging points at its forecourts.

“They’re complementary offers. One is fast charging on the go on the forecourt and the other is a slightly slower rate of charge at the workplace or at home. At this stage there are no plans to integrate the two,” Shell’s vice-president for new fuels, Matthew Tipper, told journalists.

Shell is installing electric vehicle charging points at retail stations in Britain, the Netherlands, Norway and the Philippines.

Demand for electric vehicles is expected to rise significantly in coming decades and Morgan Stanley estimates that 1-3 million public charging points could be needed in Western Europe by 2030. Currently, there are fewer than 100,000.

Shell expects around a quarter of the world’s car fleet to be electric by 2040.

Oil companies are growing increasingly aware of the potential threat to parts of their downstream business from the electrification of transport.

Rival BP (BP.L) said in August it was in talks with electric vehicle makers about partnering to offer charging stations at its retail sites.

NewMotion, founded in 2009, has more than 100,000 registered charge card users in Europe and offers access to its own charging points as well as another 50,000 partner locations.

In September, NewMotion signed a deal with Total (TOTF.PA) to allow the French oil company’s customers access to its electric vehicle charging network.

Shell and NewMotion declined to comment on the value of Thursday’s takeover.

YANGON (Reuters) - Rohingya Muslims are not native to Myanmar, the army chief told the U.S. ambassador in a meeting in which he apparently did not address accusations of abuses by his men and said media was complicit in exaggerating the number of refugees fleeing.

The U.N. human rights office said on Wednesday Myanmar forces had brutally driven out half a million Rohingya from northern Rakhine state to Bangladesh in recent weeks, torching homes, crops and villages to prevent them from returning.

Thousands of Rohingya were leaving the state on Thursday, aiming to reach Bangladesh by boat, citing a shortage of food and fear of repression, residents said. A Myanmar official said people were leaving but he dismissed the suggestion hunger and intimidation were factors.

The army chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, gave his most extensive account of the Rohingya refugee crisis aimed at an international audience in the meeting with Ambassador Scot Marciel, according to a report posted on his Facebook page.

The general is the most powerful person in Buddhist-majority Myanmar and his apparently uncompromising stance would indicate little sensitivity about the military’s image over a crisis that has drawn international condemnation and raised questions about a transition to democracy under Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.

The military campaign is popular in Myanmar, where there is little sympathy for the mostly stateless Rohingya, and where Buddhist nationalism has surged.

Min Aung Hlaing, referring to Rohingya by the term “Bengali”, which they regard as derogatory, said British colonialists were responsible for the problem.

“The Bengalis were not taken into the country by Myanmar, but by the colonialists,” he told Marciel, according to the account of the meeting posted on Thursday.

“They are not the natives.”

Coordinated Rohingya insurgent attacks on some 30 security posts on Aug. 25 sparked a ferocious military response.

The U.N. rights office said in its report, based on 65 interviews with Rohingya who had arrived in Bangladesh, that abuses had begun before the Aug. 25 attacks and included killings, torture and rape of children.

U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley last month denounced a “brutal, sustained campaign to cleanse the country of an ethnic minority” and called on countries to suspend providing weapons to Myanmar until its military put sufficient accountability measures in place.

The European Union and the United States are considering targeted sanctions against Myanmar’s military leaders, officials familiar with the discussions said this week.

Suu Kyi was swept into office last year after winning an election, but the military holds immense power, including exclusive say over security.

‘FEEL INSECURE’

U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra‘ad al-Hussein has described the government operations as “a textbook example of ethnic cleansing” and said the action appeared to be “a cynical ploy to forcibly transfer large numbers of people without possibility of return”.

Min Aung Hlaing did not refer to such accusations, according to the published account, but said the insurgents had killed 90 Hindus and 30 Rohingya linked to the government.

Insurgent opposition to a citizenship verification campaign, which used the term Bengali, was behind the Aug. 25 attacks that sparked the violence, he said.

“Local Bengalis were involved in the attacks under the leadership of ARSA. That is why they might have fled as they feel insecure,” he said, referring to the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army insurgents.

“The native place of Bengalis is really Bengal,” he said.

He said it was an exaggeration to say a “very large” number were fleeing to Bangladesh and there had been “instigation and propaganda by using the media from behind the scene”.

He did not elaborate but said the “real situation” had to be relayed to the international community. U.N. political affairs chief Jeffrey Feltman is due to visit on Friday.

Rohingya residents of Rakhine said up to 10,000 people had left on Wednesday and Thursday.

One resident, a teacher, said there had been no military offensive recently but people were going.

“There’s no work, nowhere to get food and the government isn’t helping,” said the teacher, who, like the first resident, declined to be identified.

Rakhine state’s secretary, Tin Maung Swe, said people were leaving “every day” to join relatives already in Bangladesh.

”Nobody is starving in death in Myanmar. The government is trying to support those in need,“ he said. ”They can fish or catch shrimps in the creeks near their villages.

“No one’s killing them or intimidating them.”

Suu Kyi, in a televised address, spoke about the importance of humanitarian assistance for all people in Rakhine and said the government would accept refugees back.

She said aid groups, international organizations and Myanmar expatriates would help with the long-term development of the state. She did not refer to accusations of rights abuses by the army.","Myanmar army chief says Rohingya Muslims 'not natives,' numbers fleeing exaggerated",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-myanmar-rohingya/myanmar-army-chief-says-rohingya-muslims-not-natives-numbers-fleeing-exaggerated-idUKKBN1CH0HG

SAN FRANCISCO(Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Waymo sought at least $1 billion in damages and a public apology from Uber Technologies Inc as conditions for settling its high-profile trade secret lawsuit against the ride-services company, sources familiar with the proposal told Reuters.

The Waymo self-driving car unit also asked that an independent monitor be appointed to ensure Uber does not use Waymo technology in the future, the sources said.

Uber rejected those terms as non-starters, said the sources, who were not authorized to publicly discuss settlement talks. The precise dollar amount requested by Waymo and the exact time the offer was made could not be learned.

Waymo’s tough negotiating stance, which has not been previously reported, reflects the company’s confidence in its legal position after months of pretrial victories in a case which may help to determine who emerges in the forefront of the fast-growing field of self-driving cars.

The aggressive settlement demands also suggest that Waymo is not in a hurry to resolve the lawsuit, in part because of its value as a distraction for Uber leadership, said Elizabeth Rowe, a trade secret expert at the University of Florida Levin College of Law.

Waymo recently persuaded a San Francisco federal judge to delay a trial to decide the dispute from October to early December, citing the need to investigate evidence Uber had not disclosed earlier.

No further settlement talks are currently scheduled, the sources said. The judge overseeing the case mandated that the companies enter mediation with a court-appointed magistrate.

Amy Candido, a Waymo attorney, declined to comment on any settlement talks, but said the company’s reasons for suing Uber are “pretty clear.”

“Waymo had one goal: to stop Uber from using its trade secrets,” she said. “That remains its goal.”

An Uber spokesperson declined to comment.

DISRUPTIVE

Waymo sued Uber in February, claiming that former engineer Anthony Levandowski downloaded more than 14,000 confidential files before leaving to set up a self-driving truck company, called Otto, which Uber acquired soon after.

Uber denied using any of Waymo’s trade secrets.

Waymo’s lawsuit has been disruptive for Uber. U.S. District Judge William Alsup granted Waymo’s request for a pretrial injunction in May, which prohibited Levandowski from working on Lidar, a key sensor technology for self-driving cars that is the crux of the current litigation.

Uber later fired Levandowski, regarded as a visionary in autonomous technology, after he refused to return Waymo documents at the heart of the case. Levandowski has asserted his constitutional right against self-incrimination and declined to answer questions from Waymo lawyers.

Meanwhile, Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick stepped down as chief executive in June after allegations of widespread misconduct at the company became public. Kalanick has since become embroiled in a boardroom fight with fellow Uber investor Benchmark Capital.

Benchmark cited Waymo’s allegations of trade secret theft in separate litigation aimed at forcing Kalanick off Uber’s board. A Delaware judge put that lawsuit on hold and sent it to private arbitration.

On Sunday Oct. 1, the day before Kalanick was scheduled to give a deposition in the Waymo case, Kalanick’s lawyers called Waymo and asked to postpone the deposition, lawyers for both companies said in court last week.

Kalanick’s lawyers said he was in the middle of a fight to appoint new board members and was therefore too busy, Waymo attorneys said in court. Waymo refused the request, forcing Kalanick to attend the deposition.

DISTRACTING A COMPETITOR

Causing such distractions for a competitor are a clear benefit to Waymo, Rowe said. Uber has hired three law firms to litigate the case and devoted thousands of hours to probe Uber servers for Waymo confidential information.

“I‘m counting all those as good reasons to keep the lawsuit going,” Rowe said.

Waymo has estimated damages in the case at about $1.9 billion, according to court filings, which Uber disputes. Despite that figure and the big settlement demands, Waymo views winning a permanent injunction against Uber using any Waymo intellectual property as the main priority, another source familiar with the company’s thinking said.

Much of the technical evidence in the case has been filed under seal, making it impossible for outside observers to independently assess the strength of each side’s arguments. In court last week, Alsup said Uber’s product was “dissimilar” from Waymo‘s.

Even if a jury finds that Uber stole Waymo trade secrets, Uber says in court filings that its engineers have designed around the Waymo technology at issue in the case. If that is true, that would lessen the impact on Uber in the event of a defeat in court.

Waymo is skeptical of Uber’s claim, however. In a court filing on Monday, it requested an order forcing Uber to disclose its source code, or underlying software, for its Lidar products.

The Alphabet subsidiary said in the filing that it recently learned that former employees took Waymo source code when they went to work at Uber, “including software related to the ‘brains’ of the vehicle that determines how the car moves.”",Exclusive: Alphabet's Waymo demanded $1 billion in settlement talks with Uber - sources,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1CH0QC-OCATP

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Bharti Airtel Ltd is acquiring the Tata conglomerate’s consumer mobile business virtually free of charge in a deal that gives India’s top wireless player a major subscriber base boost, while stemming the bleed for Tata from a money-losing venture.

Bharti Airtel will gain over 40 million customers from Tata Teleservices and a subsidiary along with airwaves the companies own on a “debt-free (and) cash-free” basis, according to a joint statement on Thursday, although Bharti Airtel will take on a “small portion” of Tata’s unpaid dues for its airwaves.

India’s telecoms market, with 1.2 billion mobile subscribers, is in the midst of a wave of consolidation as smaller debt-laden players seek exits after overspending in airwave auctions.

Small players and their larger rivals have also been severely weakened by a price war triggered by new entrant Reliance Jio - backed by India’s richest man Mukesh Ambani.

The price war has led to major losses for most carriers, and spurred India’s banking regulator - the Reserve Bank of India -to ask banks to review their telecoms sector exposure and boost their provisioning for any loans made to the sector.

Tata Teleservices, which has more than $5 billion of debt, has been mired in losses and it had been speculated that the group may opt to permanently shutter the operation.

Its parent, salt-to-software conglomerate Tata Group, is also in the middle of a restructuring exercise to improve profitability and cut its complex structure under its new chairman N. Chandrasekaran.

“It’s a very big positive for Tata Group and Chandra ... It’s also a big positive for Airtel as they will have to pay less for the spectrum they are gaining,” said Sanjiv Bhasin, an executive vice president at financial services firm IIFL.

“It’s evident disruption is picking up and consolidation is the game of the hour,” he said, adding that he expects even more deals in the crowded sector.

Vodafone Group and Idea Cellular - the market’s second and third biggest players, respectively, are in the process of combining their operations to create the market’s biggest player, while Bharti Airtel had previously agreed to buy Telenor’s India unit.

A deal to combine debt-laden Reliance Communications’ wireless unit with rival Aircel fell apart this month.

MULTIPLE OPTIONS

Tata chief Chandrasekaran said in the statement the group had evaluated “multiple options” for the telecoms business, calling the Bharti Airtel deal the “most optimal solution”.

Tata and Bharti Airtel will work together to further explore other mutual areas of cooperation, the companies said.

Tata is also in the initial stages of exploring a combination of its enterprise business with Tata Communications Ltd and its retail fixed-line and broadband business with satellite TV arm Tata Sky, according to the statement.

Tata will retain its stake in tower company Viom, and will take care of the liabilities associated with it, according to the statement.

As of end-March, Tata Teleservices and its unit had combined debt of 340.89 billion Indian rupees ($5.24 billion) excluding sums due to the government for spectrum purchases, according to local ratings agency Crisil, which also said Tata Teleservices’ net loss nearly doubled in the year to March, to 46.17 billion rupees.

“Tata were losing money head over heels,” said Satish Betadpur, director of research at brokerage William O‘Neil Companies. “They were not profitable and to make it profitable, they had to spend enormous amount of money.”

In February, Tata agreed to pay NTT DoCoMo $1.18 billion to buy out the Japanese firm’s stake in the telecoms joint venture, settling a long-standing dispute.

Goldman Sachs advised Tata on the Bharti Airtel deal. Bharti Airtel, led by billionaire Sunil Mittal, has operations in 17 countries across Asia and Africa.

Berlin (Reuters) - Mit einem konsequenteren Vorgehen hätten die Ermittlungsbehörden den Berliner Weihnachtsmarkt-Attentäter Anis Amri einem Untersuchungsbericht zufolge vermutlich weit vor der Tat stoppen können.

Zu diesem Schluss kam der Sonderbeauftragte des Berliner Senats, Bruno Jost, am Donnerstag bei der Vorlage seines Abschlussberichts. “Es hat sich gezeigt, dass Fehlleistungen von verschiedenen Stellen vorlagen”, sagte der ehemalige Bundesanwalt. Es habe grobe Fehler gegeben, wozu insbesondere der Verlauf der Observation und Telefonüberwachung Amris durch die Berliner Polizei im Sommer 2016 gehört habe. Auch eine Festnahme Amris in Friedrichshafen in Baden-Württemberg am 30. Juli des selben Jahres habe die Chance eröffnet, den Tunesier zumindest vorübergehend aus dem Verkehr zu ziehen. Amri gab nach seiner Einreise in Deutschland im Juli 2015 in Baden-Württemberg und Nordrhein-Westfalen bei Asylbehörden mehrmals falsche Namen an, handelte in Berlin mit Drogen und wurde dort parallel als gefährlich eingestuft worden.

“Man kann einen Fall wie Amri nicht 08/15 behandeln”, kritisierte Jost. “Amri war einer der Gefährder, die im Gemeinsamen Terrorabwehrzentrum (GTAZ) so oft und so intensiv besprochen wurden wie kaum ein anderer. Und dann kann man nicht so tun, als ob man einen Eierdieb festgenommen hätte.” Im GTAZ, in dem sich Behörden von Bund und Ländern auch über mögliche Extremisten austauschen, war Amri dem Bericht zufolge siebenmal Thema.

“HINTERN HEBEN UND SICH NACH FRIEDRICHSHAFEN BEWEGEN”

Jost zufolge wurde Amri in Friedrichshafen von der Bundespolizei mit zwei gefälschten italienischen Pässen erwischt und für zwei Tage inhaftiert, nachdem ein Hinweis vom LKA Berlin gekommen war. Er warf vor allem den Landeskriminalämtern Nordrhein-Westfalens und Berlins anschließende Untätigkeit vor, obwohl die Behörden über die Festnahme informiert worden seien. “Man hätte nur mal etwas flexibler sein, den Hintern heben und sich nach Friedrichshafen bewegen müssen.”

Jost kritisierte die damaligen Arbeitsbedingungen beim LKA Berlin als katastrophal. Dennoch dürfe es nicht passieren, dass wie geschehen die Überwachung Amris vorzeitig eingestellt werde. In diesem Zusammenhang hätte aber auch die Generalstaatsanwaltschaft Berlin genauer hinschauen müssen.

Der Berliner Innensenator Andreas Geisel sprach sich für einen Untersuchungsausschuss im Bundestag aus. In Berlin läuft noch ein Strafverfahren, weil LKA-Beamte Angaben zu Amris Rolle im Drogenhandel nachträglich verändert haben sollen. Der Tunesier fuhr am 19.

(Reuters) - The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which organizes the Oscars, said on Wednesday that it would hold a special meeting on Saturday to discuss allegations against producer Harvey Weinstein.

“The Academy finds the conduct described in the allegations against Harvey Weinstein to be repugnant, abhorrent, and antithetical to the high standards of the Academy and the creative community it represents,” the Academy said in a statement.

“The Board of Governors will be holding a special meeting on Saturday, October 14, to discuss the allegations against Weinstein and any actions warranted by the Academy.”

Weinstein’s spokeswoman Sallie Hofmeister did not immediately return a request for comment on the Academy’s statement.

The statement follows allegations that Weinstein sexually harassed or assaulted a number of women over the past three decades.

Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.

Earlier on Wednesday, Weinstein was suspended from the British film academy BAFTA.

“In light of recent very serious allegations, BAFTA has informed Harvey Weinstein that his membership has been suspended, effective immediately,” the academy said in a statement.

GENEVA (Reuters) - West African migrants trying to reach Europe are dying in far greater numbers in the Sahara than in the Mediterranean but efforts to dissuade them may cause new routes to open up, the United Nations migration agency said on Thursday.

So far this year 2,569 migrant deaths have been recorded in the central Mediterranean, while more than 107,000 migrants, mainly West Africans, have reached Italy.

“One thing we still don’t have is any estimate of number of deaths in the desert,” Richard Danziger, the U.N. International Organization for Migration director for West and Central Africa, told a news conference in Geneva.

“We assume, and I think we have said before, that it has to be at least double those who die in the Mediterranean. But we really have no evidence of that, it’s just an assumption. We just don’t know.”

In Niger, a main transit route, people smugglers were increasingly scared of the authorities, which might make them more prone to abandon migrants in the desert, he said.

Many migrants had told of deaths in the desert, and some said the smugglers believed that if they drove fast through minefields they would be safe, said the IOM’s Niger mission chief, Giuseppe Loprete.

Migrant numbers heading through Niger have fallen dramatically after strong action by the government to close migrant “ghettoes” and arrest people smugglers, he said.

IOM was also trying to spread the word that “you do not want to get caught in Libya,” Danziger said.

“What happens in Libya is far scarier to people than dying, the horror stories that returnees come back with.”

Many of the smugglers did not see themselves as criminals, and were often former desert guides trying to make money. Many of them had given up, while organized criminals with contacts in Libya were continuing, Loprete said.

“Right now they are looking for alternative routes, I think at least equally dangerous,” he said.

“When you plug one hole, other holes are going to open up,” Danziger said.

Niger had two routes to Libya: one closer to Chad that was used to smuggle migrants and one closer to the Algerian border that was far more dangerous and was used by extremist groups and for drugs and gun-running.

An alternative was through northern Mali, a region beset by conflicts between rival groups, but but there did not seem to have been a dramatic rise there, Danziger said.

The route considered the safest was along the western coast of Africa, via Senegal, Mauritania and Morocco to the Strait of Gibraltar, and migrant flows there had increased, he said.",Migrant deaths in the Sahara likely twice Mediterranean toll: U.N.,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1CH22H-OZATP

Haroon Khan, a spokesman for the commission, said a four-man panel rejected the registration of Milli Muslim League (MML) as an official political party.

Khan said Muhammad Raza Khan, chief of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), told MML’s lawyer at the final hearing of the registration that the new party has links with militant groups and as such “We can’t enlist you.”

The ECP spokesman said the commission cited an interior ministry recommendation that the MML was “affiliated” with Lashkar-e-Tayyeba (LeT), a militant group blamed for the 2008 Mumbai attacks that killed 166 people, and that such groups could breed violence and extremism in politics.

The United States has designated LeT founder Hafiz Saeed a terrorist and offers a $10 million reward for information leading to his conviction.

Saeed, currently under house arrest, heads the Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) Islamict charity, which Washington says is a front for LeT.

Pakistan’s reluctance to press charges against him has been a sore point in relations with Washington and India over the past decade.

“PATRIOTIC FORCES”

Saifullah Khalid, the head of MML, said his party would challenge the decision. “An attempt is being made to keep patriotic forces away from politics,” he said.

The party is likely to continue operating unofficially, as it did last month when one of its leaders contested a by-election in the eastern city of Lahore as an independent candidate.

The candidate, Yaqoob Sheikh, won several thousand votes, though officials from MML and JuD ran his campaign. Saeed’s portraits adorned posters promoting Sheikh.

The move to bar the party appears at odds with what political and former military sources told Reuters was a plan by the military’s Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) spy agency to integrate militant-linked organizations by bringing them into politics as part of a de-radicalization drive.

Pakistani army spokesman Major-General Asif Ghafoor also said last week the integration of militants into the country’s politics would be based on seeking a constructive role for the militant-linked groups, although he did not comment on the military’s role in any such strategy.

“It is in my knowledge that the government has started some discussion over it, that is, how do we mainstream them,” Ghafoor said.

(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) said it would hire 120,000 workers in the United States this holiday season, same as last year, as the online behemoth prepares for the holiday shopping frenzy.

Shoppers this year will shell out more on gifts during the holidays, according to industry surveys, as a tightening job market, rising home prices and stock markets that are hovering at record highs boost consumer confidence, increasing their intent and ability to spend.

Amazon on Thursday said the seasonal jobs will be spread out over more than 75 fulfillment centers countrywide to help pick, pack and ship holiday orders. It also said it expects to convert thousands of these positions to full-time roles.

U.S. shoppers will spend between $678.75 billion and $682 billion on holiday shopping this year, a growth of 3.6 percent to 4 percent over last year, according to the National Retail Federation (NRF).

This forecast includes online shopping, which is expected to accelerate its pace of growth to 11-15 percent to about $140 billion.

As a result, several U.S. retailers, including Macy’s Inc (M.N) and Kohl’s Corp (KSS.N), have been focusing on their online businesses and have ramped up hiring seasonal workers to man their distribution centers that support online operations.

Department store operator Target Corp (TGT.N) was the most bullish employer for the holiday season, hiring 43 percent more temporary workers this year than last year.

Target said it would hire 100,000 temp workers, banking on its successful turnaround efforts, which saw it report its first rise in comp sales in more than a year in August.

Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula that promises it a high degree of autonomy and freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland.

But critics have accused the government of bending to the will of Communist Party leaders in Beijing and of a gradual watering down of the territory’s freedoms, including freedom of speech and right to protest.

British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said he was “very concerned” that Benedict Rogers, a co-founder of the Conservative Party’s Human Rights Commission, was denied entry to Hong Kong on Wednesday and demanded an “urgent explanation” from Hong Kong and China.

It came a week before a sensitive Communist Party leadership meeting starts in Beijing.

Johnson also said Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy, rights and freedoms were “central to its way of life”.

Rogers has been a vocal critic of China-ruled Hong Kong’s treatment of political activists, including that of jailed student leader Joshua Wong. He believes the decision to bar him was made by Chinese officials after the Chinese Embassy in London had warned him earlier, through a British member of parliament, that he wouldn’t be allowed in.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the central government had a responsibility for foreign matters related to Hong Kong.

“The central Chinese government and the special administrative region government handle the relevant issue in accordance with the law,” Hua said. “Allowing or not allowing people in is China’s sovereignty ... Hong Kong affairs are a purely internal matter for China.”

She said China had lodged a solemn representation with Britain, meaning an official complaint.

When asked about the incident on a radio talk show, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam agreed.

“Ultimately, under the Basic Law (Hong Kong’s mini-constitution), the central government is responsible for foreign affairs,” Lam said.

Asked if immigration controls fell under Hong Kong jurisdiction, Lam said: ”It has to be considered whether foreign affairs are involved during the process of immigration.

“If you say everything falls under Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy, this is not what the Basic Law says.”

Rogers, speaking to Reuters shortly after arriving in London, said Beijing’s statement confirmed his assumption that the decision to boot him out was made not by Hong Kong but by Chinese authorities.

He described the interference in Hong Kong’s immigration controls as “very alarming” and “a very serious threat to ‘one country, two systems’.”

“China has now revealed its hand. The world ought to have woken up a long time ago, but I think now they really ought to wake up to what this means for ‘one country, two systems’,” he said.

“I‘m very sad for what this means for Hong Kong.”

The former head of Hong Kong’s civil service turned pro-democracy activist, Anson Chan, said the case was a “serious breach” of the Basic Law.

Article 154 of the Basic Law says Hong Kong “may apply immigration controls on entry” of foreigners into Hong Kong.

“The Immigration Department must have sought instructions from on high,” she told Reuters. “They (Beijing) are sending a message that if you dare speak out on Hong Kong ... you will not be allowed in.”

Amnesty International’s East Asia director, Nicholas Bequelin, suggested China’s definition of what constitutes national security is creeping into Hong Kong.

“In China if you’re critical of the political system, you’re committing a national security crime and this is exactly the type of thing ‘one country, two systems’ should protect against.”

In response to a Reuters’ request for comment on whether China was involved in Rogers’ denial of entry, Hong Kong’s Immigration Department said it did not comment on individual cases.

China has admitted asking a group of British MPs to cancel a visit to Hong Kong in 2014 during the massive pro-democracy protests, of which Joshua Wong was a leader, that paralyzed highways for 79 days.

SAN FRANCISCO(Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Waymo sought at least $1 billion in damages and a public apology from Uber Technologies Inc as conditions for settling its high-profile trade secret lawsuit against the ride-services company, sources familiar with the proposal told Reuters.

The Waymo self-driving car unit also asked that an independent monitor be appointed to ensure Uber does not use Waymo technology in the future, the sources said.

Uber rejected those terms as non-starters, said the sources, who were not authorized to publicly discuss settlement talks. The precise dollar amount requested by Waymo and the exact time the offer was made could not be learned.

Waymo’s tough negotiating stance, which has not been previously reported, reflects the company’s confidence in its legal position after months of pretrial victories in a case which may help to determine who emerges in the forefront of the fast-growing field of self-driving cars.

The aggressive settlement demands also suggest that Waymo is not in a hurry to resolve the lawsuit, in part because of its value as a distraction for Uber leadership, said Elizabeth Rowe, a trade secret expert at the University of Florida Levin College of Law.

Waymo recently persuaded a San Francisco federal judge to delay a trial to decide the dispute from October to early December, citing the need to investigate evidence Uber had not disclosed earlier.

No further settlement talks are currently scheduled, the sources said. The judge overseeing the case mandated that the companies enter mediation with a court-appointed magistrate.

Amy Candido, a Waymo attorney, declined to comment on any settlement talks, but said the company’s reasons for suing Uber are “pretty clear.”

“Waymo had one goal: to stop Uber from using its trade secrets,” she said. “That remains its goal.”

An Uber spokesperson declined to comment.

DISRUPTIVE

Waymo sued Uber in February, claiming that former engineer Anthony Levandowski downloaded more than 14,000 confidential files before leaving to set up a self-driving truck company, called Otto, which Uber acquired soon after.

Uber denied using any of Waymo’s trade secrets.

Waymo’s lawsuit has been disruptive for Uber. U.S. District Judge William Alsup granted Waymo’s request for a pretrial injunction in May, which prohibited Levandowski from working on Lidar, a key sensor technology for self-driving cars that is the crux of the current litigation.

Uber later fired Levandowski, regarded as a visionary in autonomous technology, after he refused to return Waymo documents at the heart of the case. Levandowski has asserted his constitutional right against self-incrimination and declined to answer questions from Waymo lawyers.

Meanwhile, Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick stepped down as chief executive in June after allegations of widespread misconduct at the company became public. Kalanick has since become embroiled in a boardroom fight with fellow Uber investor Benchmark Capital.

Benchmark cited Waymo’s allegations of trade secret theft in separate litigation aimed at forcing Kalanick off Uber’s board. A Delaware judge put that lawsuit on hold and sent it to private arbitration.

On Sunday Oct. 1, the day before Kalanick was scheduled to give a deposition in the Waymo case, Kalanick’s lawyers called Waymo and asked to postpone the deposition, lawyers for both companies said in court last week.

Kalanick’s lawyers said he was in the middle of a fight to appoint new board members and was therefore too busy, Waymo attorneys said in court. Waymo refused the request, forcing Kalanick to attend the deposition.

DISTRACTING A COMPETITOR

Causing such distractions for a competitor are a clear benefit to Waymo, Rowe said. Uber has hired three law firms to litigate the case and devoted thousands of hours to probe Uber servers for Waymo confidential information.

“I‘m counting all those as good reasons to keep the lawsuit going,” Rowe said.

Waymo has estimated damages in the case at about $1.9 billion, according to court filings, which Uber disputes. Despite that figure and the big settlement demands, Waymo views winning a permanent injunction against Uber using any Waymo intellectual property as the main priority, another source familiar with the company’s thinking said.

Much of the technical evidence in the case has been filed under seal, making it impossible for outside observers to independently assess the strength of each side’s arguments. In court last week, Alsup said Uber’s product was “dissimilar” from Waymo‘s.

Even if a jury finds that Uber stole Waymo trade secrets, Uber says in court filings that its engineers have designed around the Waymo technology at issue in the case. If that is true, that would lessen the impact on Uber in the event of a defeat in court.

Waymo is skeptical of Uber’s claim, however. In a court filing on Monday, it requested an order forcing Uber to disclose its source code, or underlying software, for its Lidar products.

The Alphabet subsidiary said in the filing that it recently learned that former employees took Waymo source code when they went to work at Uber, “including software related to the ‘brains’ of the vehicle that determines how the car moves.”",Exclusive: Alphabet's Waymo demanded $1 billion in settlement talks with Uber - sources,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-uber-lawsuit/exclusive-alphabets-waymo-demanded-1-billion-in-settlement-talks-with-uber-sources-idUSKBN1CH0QC

(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) easily beat Wall Street’s third-quarter profit expectations on Thursday, with loan growth and higher interest rates more than offsetting weakness in its markets-related unit.

Executives at the largest U.S. bank touted the diverse mix of businesses that allow JPMorgan to weather a dip in one area or another, and downplayed a 27 percent drop in bond trading revenue even though weakness has continued into the fourth quarter.

Overall, JPMorgan’s profit rose 7.1 percent in the third quarter compared with the year-ago period, to $6.73 billion, or $1.76 per share. Analysts had expected earnings of $1.65 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The bank’s total revenue of $25.33 billion also topped the average analyst estimate of $25.23 billion.

In early notes to clients, analysts characterized the results as “solid” or “pretty good,” given problems in bond trading that have affected Wall Street banks for some time.

“The results were solid but not exceptional,” said Morningstar analyst Jim Sinegal.

JPMorgan shares were down 0.4 percent at $96.48 in morning trading.

Growth in credit cards, auto loans, commercial banking and corporate advisory fees drove the results, with average core loans up 7 percent during the quarter. JPMorgan’s net interest income, or the difference between what it pays for funds and collects from lending them out, rose 10 percent.

However, markets revenue fell 21 percent as the slump in bond trading outweighed a more modest dip in equities, slightly worse than the roughly 20 percent drop Chief Executive Jamie Dimon had forecast at an event in September.

Wall Street banks have been grappling with bond market challenges for most of the past seven years, as client volumes have been depressed for a number of reasons and new regulations have restricted certain activities and made trading more expensive.

JPMorgan fared worse last quarter than rival Citigroup Inc (C.N), which reported a 16 percent decline in bond trading on Thursday. The trends bode poorly for Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), which has struggled more in bond trading recently than other Wall Street banks.

JPMorgan’s markets revenue is likely to drop again in the fourth quarter because the year-ago period was strong, Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said on a conference call with analysts.

Trading revenue during the fourth quarter of 2016 benefited from a surge in trading activity following the U.S. election.

Still, management maintained earlier guidance for full-year net interest income, expenses, charge-offs and loan growth, indicating that they expect JPMorgan’s other businesses to continue to offset capital markets pain.

During a call with reporters, Lake cited “the benefits of diversification and scale,” while Daniel Pinto, who runs JPMorgan’s investment bank, pointed to “balanced strength across diverse businesses” in a memo to employees.",Loan growth helps JPMorgan beat expectations despite trading decline,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-jpmorgan-results/loan-growth-helps-jpmorgan-beat-expectations-despite-trading-decline-idUSKBN1CH1GW

The Chinese foreign ministry insists it takes a “cautious and responsible attitude” to military drone exports.","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is nearing completion of new “Buy American” rules to make it easier to sell U.S.-made military drones overseas and compete against fast-growing Chinese and Israeli rivals, senior U.S. officials said.

While President Donald Trump’s aides work on relaxing domestic regulations on drone sales to select allies, Washington will also seek to renegotiate a 1987 missile-control pact with the aim of loosening international restrictions on U.S. exports of unmanned aircraft, according to government and industry sources.

At home, the U.S. administration is pressing ahead with its revamp of drone export policy under heavy pressure from American manufacturers and in defiance of human rights advocates who warn of the risk of fueling instability in hot spots including the Middle East and South Asia.

The changes, part of a broader effort to overhaul U.S. arms export protocols, could be rolled out by the end of the year under a presidential policy decree, the administration officials told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

The aim is to help U.S. drone makers, pioneers in remote-controlled aircraft that have become a centerpiece of counterterrorism strategy, reassert themselves in the overseas market where China, Israel and others often sell under less-cumbersome restrictions.

Simplified export rules could easily generate thousands of jobs, but it’s too early to be more specific, said Remy Nathan, a lobbyist with the Aerospace Industry Association. The main beneficiaries would be top U.S. drone makers General Atomics, Boeing (BA.N), Northrop Grumman (NOC.N), Textron (TXT.N) and Lockheed Martin (LMT.N).

“This will allow us to get in the game in a way that we’ve never been before,” said one senior U.S. official.

‘BUY AMERICAN’ AGENDA

Regulations are expected to be loosened especially on the sale of unarmed intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance drones, the most sophisticated of which carry high-resolution cameras and laser-guided targeting systems to aid missiles fired from warplanes, naval vessels or ground launchers.

Deliberations have been more complicated, however, on how to alter export rules for missile-equipped drones like the Predator and Reaper. Hunter-killer drones, which have essentially changed the face of modern warfare, are increasingly in demand and U.S. models considered the most advanced.

The push is not only part of Trump‘s “Buy American” agenda to boost U.S. business abroad but also reflects a more export-friendly approach to weapons sales that the administration sees as a way to wield influence with foreign partners, the senior official said.

Under a draft of the new rules, a classified list of countries numbering in double digits would be given more of a fast-track treatment for military drone purchases, a second senior official said. The favored group would include some of Washington’s closest NATO allies and partners in the ""Five Eyes"" intelligence alliance: Britain, Australia, Canada and New Zealand, according to the industry source.

Rachel Stohl, director of the conventional defense program at the Stimson Center in Washington, said if U.S. drone export rules become too lenient, they could give more governments with poor human rights records the means to “target their own civilians.”

Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, revised the policy for military drone exports in 2015. But U.S. manufacturers complained it was still too restrictive compared with main competitors China and Israel.

U.S. drone makers are vying for a larger share of the global military drone market. Even before the coming changes, the Teal Group, a market research firm, has forecast sales will rise from $2.8 billion in 2016 to $9.4 billion in 2025.

Linden Blue, CEO of privately held General Atomics, the U.S. leader in military drones, visited the White House recently to lobby for his industry, a person familiar with the discussions said.

Among the U.S. changes will be a formal reinterpretation of the “presumption of denial”, a longstanding obstacle to most military drones sales, that would make it easier and faster to secure approval, the officials said.

Britain, and only recently Italy, are the only countries that had been allowed to buy armed U.S. drones.

A long-delayed $2 billion sale to India of General Atomics’ Guardian surveillance drones finally secured U.S. approval in June. But New Delhi’s request for armed drones has stalled.

A major hurdle to expanded sales of the most powerful U.S. drones is the Missile Technology Control Regime, or MTCR, a 1987 accord signed by the United States and 34 other countries, which set rules for the sale and purchase of missiles.

It categorizes drones with a range greater than of 185 miles (300 km) and a payload above 1,100 pounds (500 kg) as cruise missiles, requiring extremely tight import/export controls. To gain an international stamp of approval for the relaxed U.S. export rules, U.S. officials want the MTCR renegotiated.

State Department officials attending an annual meeting of the missile-control group in Dublin next week will present a “discussion paper” proposing that sales of drones – which did not exist when the agreement was created – be treated more leniently than the missile technology that the MTCR was designed to regulate, according to a U.S. official and industry sources.

There is no guarantee of a consensus. Russia, which has NATO members along its borders, could resist such changes, the U.S. official said.

CHINA AND ISRAEL

China, which is not an MTCR signatory, has pushed ahead with drone sales to some countries with close ties to Washington, such as Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Nigeria, but which have failed to pass U.S. regulatory muster.

Chinese models such as the CH-3 and CH-4 have been compared to the Reaper but are much cheaper. U.S. officials said Beijing sells them with few strings attached.

The Chinese foreign ministry insists it takes a “cautious and responsible attitude” to military drone exports.

Israel, which is outside the MTCR but has pledged to abide by it, competes with U.S. manufacturers on the basis of high-tech standards. But it will not sell to neighbors in the volatile Middle East. Israel sold $525 million worth of drones overseas in 2016, according defense ministry data.

LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin smashed through the $5,000 barrier for the first time on Thursday, jumping as much as 8 percent on the day as investors shrugged off the latest warnings on the risks of buying into the booming cryptocurrency market.

Bitcoin, the biggest and best-known cryptocurrency, has chalked up a more than fivefold increase in price this year.

Typically for bitcoin, which at less than nine years old is still highly volatile and illiquid compared with traditional currencies and assets, the precise reason for its recent tear was unclear.

Upcoming splits in its software, reports that Goldman Sachs is considering offering bitcoin trading, rumors that China could ease restrictions, and even a political crisis in Spain’s Catalonia region were all cited by market-watchers as reasons for the rally.

But the main factor could simply be demand from investors wanting ‘in’ on a market that has provided gains exceeding those of any other currency in every year bar one since 2010.

“People are just wanting to be part of it,” said Ryan Nettles, head of FX trading and market strategy at Swiss bank Swissquote, which launched bitcoin trading two months ago. Nettles said interest had been much higher than anticipated and has come from banks, hedge funds and brokers.

“The interest really stems from the media hype,” he added.

On Wednesday Russian President Vladimir Putin warned of the “serious risks” surrounding the nascent market, while Russia’s central bank said it would ban cryptocurrency trading websites.

But that was not enough to put investors off, with bitcoin rallying around 10 percent since then.

Data released last week from SEMrush, a search engine data analytics firm, found the price had a 91 percent correlation with Google searches on bitcoin, suggesting that all news -- whether negative or positive -- drives up demand, even if bad news can have a temporary negative effect.

Bitcoin almost reached $5,000 at the start of September, but fell back sharply after the head of Goldman Sachs blasted the cryptocurrency as a “fraud” and as China forced exchanges to close down, sparking fears of a broader crackdown.

But after dipping below $3,000 in mid-September, bitcoin has leapt in value by more than 75 percent in four weeks.

“Bitcoin was designed to operate outside of the influence of governments and central banks, and is doing exactly that,” said Iqbal Gandham, Managing Director at retail trading app eToro, which has seen huge increases in cryptocurrency trading volumes.

CRYPTO-RIVALS ALSO RALLY

By 1245 GMT, bitcoin was trading up 8 percent on the day around $5,200 on Luxembourg-based exchange Bitstamp.

Though there have been many warnings about a bitcoin “bubble”, including from European Central Bank Deputy Governor Vitor Constancio, some say it has much further to climb. But determining its value is difficult.

“For most currencies there are several accepted methodologies for estimating relative value, normally based on macroeconomic fundamentals,” said EFG Asset Management’s Global Head of Research, Daniel Murray. “For bitcoin no such fundamentals exist.”

Other cryptocurrencies -- whose prices tend to be highly correlated to bitcoin -- also rallied. Their total value -- or market capitalization -- climbed above $160 billion for the first time since early September, according to industry website Coinmarketcap.com.

Two upcoming “forks” in the bitcoin software code, which will create rival clones of the cryptocurrency, were seen by some as a reason for the rise in price, which saw a boost after the “Bitcoin Cash” clone was created at the start of August.

“Investors are seeing the lessons of history in the up-and-coming forks and hoping for an extra dividend,” said Charles Hayter, co-founder of data analysis website Cryptocompare, adding that rumors on online forums that China could reopen exchanges could also be affecting the price.","Bitcoin rockets above $5,000 to all-time high",https://www.reuters.com/article/global-markets-bitcoin/bitcoin-rockets-above-5000-to-all-time-high-idINKBN1CH0ZC

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan will propose changes to its safeguard mechanism on frozen U.S. beef imports that will shorten review periods and allow importers to voluntarily lower import volumes to prevent tariffs from automatically kicking in, two government sources said on Thursday.

The proposal will be made at the second round of the U.S.-Japan economic dialogue in Washington on Oct. 16, but it is uncertain if the U.S. side will go along, said the two sources, who have direct knowledge of the matter.

If successful, the proposal could help ward off trade friction with the United States, which is renegotiating free trade agreements with other countries to protect jobs and lower its trade deficit.

Under current measures, Japan automatically imposes higher tariffs if quarterly imports of specific beef products from any country rise more than 17 percent from the previous year.

Japan hiked tariffs from Aug. 1 on imports of frozen beef, popular in beef bowl dishes, from countries including the United States to 50 percent from 38.5 percent.

The move followed U.S. President Donald Trump’s withdraw from the long-planned Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal earlier this year.

Japan says the tariff hike, set to be in place until next March, is a “safeguard” mechanism to protect domestic farmers, but it has prompted some concern in Washington.

Instead of reviewing import data on a quarterly basis, Japan will propose shortening this period to every 10 days, the sources said. This will make it easier for companies that import beef to adjust volumes and avoid triggering tariffs, the sources said.

However, the plan is far from certain to work because frozen U.S. beef imports could surge next year in April after the current tariff increase expires, one source said.

“Once the safeguard is triggered, there is a concern that it will repeatedly be triggered in the future,” the source said.

The first round of the U.S.-Japan economic dialogue, which was held in Tokyo in April, ended largely without incident. However, there is some concern among Japanese officials that the U.S. side could strongly push for trade concession during the second dialogue meeting.

Japan had a $69-billion trade surplus with the United States last year, according to the U.S. Treasury Department, which has expressed concern over what it called the “persistence” of the imbalance.

Japanese officials counter that Tokyo accounts for a much smaller slice of the U.S. deficit than in the past, while China’s imbalance is much bigger.",Japan to propose changes to beef import safeguards in talks with U.S.: sources,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-japan-trade/japan-to-propose-changes-to-beef-import-safeguards-in-talks-with-u-s-sources-idUSKBN1CH14I

OTTAWA (Reuters) - The number of job vacancies in Canada rose in the second quarter compared to the year before, with more openings seen broadly across regions and sectors, data from Statistics Canada showed on Thursday.

There were 460,000 jobs open in the second quarter, up 17.2 percent from the second quarter of last year. The job vacancy rate, which measures the share of unfilled jobs out of those available, rose to 2.9 percent from 2.5 percent.

A higher job vacancy rate often points to economic growth. Canada has seen robust job gains over the past year amid a strong economy that has prompted the Bank of Canada to raise interest rates twice in 2017 so far.

Job vacancies in the second quarter rose in nearly all the provinces, led by Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia, which have seen strong economic growth.

The number of job openings also rose in Alberta, which is recovering from the collapse in oil prices. The mining, quarrying and oil and gas sector saw some of the biggest increases in job vacancies, which is consistent with recent employment gains in the sector, the statistics agency said.

SAN FRANCISCO(Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Waymo sought at least $1 billion in damages and a public apology from Uber Technologies Inc as conditions for settling its high-profile trade secret lawsuit against the ride-services company, sources familiar with the proposal told Reuters.

The Waymo self-driving car unit also asked that an independent monitor be appointed to ensure Uber does not use Waymo technology in the future, the sources said.

Uber rejected those terms as non-starters, said the sources, who were not authorized to publicly discuss settlement talks. The precise dollar amount requested by Waymo and the exact time the offer was made could not be learned.

Waymo’s tough negotiating stance, which has not been previously reported, reflects the company’s confidence in its legal position after months of pretrial victories in a case which may help to determine who emerges in the forefront of the fast-growing field of self-driving cars.

The aggressive settlement demands also suggest that Waymo is not in a hurry to resolve the lawsuit, in part because of its value as a distraction for Uber leadership, said Elizabeth Rowe, a trade secret expert at the University of Florida Levin College of Law.

Waymo recently persuaded a San Francisco federal judge to delay a trial to decide the dispute from October to early December, citing the need to investigate evidence Uber had not disclosed earlier.

No further settlement talks are currently scheduled, the sources said. The judge overseeing the case mandated that the companies enter mediation with a court-appointed magistrate.

Amy Candido, a Waymo attorney, declined to comment on any settlement talks, but said the company’s reasons for suing Uber are “pretty clear.”

“Waymo had one goal: to stop Uber from using its trade secrets,” she said. “That remains its goal.”

An Uber spokesperson declined to comment.

DISRUPTIVE

Waymo sued Uber in February, claiming that former engineer Anthony Levandowski downloaded more than 14,000 confidential files before leaving to set up a self-driving truck company, called Otto, which Uber acquired soon after.

Uber denied using any of Waymo’s trade secrets.

Waymo’s lawsuit has been disruptive for Uber. U.S. District Judge William Alsup granted Waymo’s request for a pretrial injunction in May, which prohibited Levandowski from working on Lidar, a key sensor technology for self-driving cars that is the crux of the current litigation.

Uber later fired Levandowski, regarded as a visionary in autonomous technology, after he refused to return Waymo documents at the heart of the case. Levandowski has asserted his constitutional right against self-incrimination and declined to answer questions from Waymo lawyers.

Meanwhile, Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick stepped down as chief executive in June after allegations of widespread misconduct at the company became public. Kalanick has since become embroiled in a boardroom fight with fellow Uber investor Benchmark Capital.

Benchmark cited Waymo’s allegations of trade secret theft in separate litigation aimed at forcing Kalanick off Uber’s board. A Delaware judge put that lawsuit on hold and sent it to private arbitration.

On Sunday Oct. 1, the day before Kalanick was scheduled to give a deposition in the Waymo case, Kalanick’s lawyers called Waymo and asked to postpone the deposition, lawyers for both companies said in court last week.

Kalanick’s lawyers said he was in the middle of a fight to appoint new board members and was therefore too busy, Waymo attorneys said in court. Waymo refused the request, forcing Kalanick to attend the deposition.

DISTRACTING A COMPETITOR

Causing such distractions for a competitor are a clear benefit to Waymo, Rowe said. Uber has hired three law firms to litigate the case and devoted thousands of hours to probe Uber servers for Waymo confidential information.

“I‘m counting all those as good reasons to keep the lawsuit going,” Rowe said.

Waymo has estimated damages in the case at about $1.9 billion, according to court filings, which Uber disputes. Despite that figure and the big settlement demands, Waymo views winning a permanent injunction against Uber using any Waymo intellectual property as the main priority, another source familiar with the company’s thinking said.

Much of the technical evidence in the case has been filed under seal, making it impossible for outside observers to independently assess the strength of each side’s arguments. In court last week, Alsup said Uber’s product was “dissimilar” from Waymo‘s.

Even if a jury finds that Uber stole Waymo trade secrets, Uber says in court filings that its engineers have designed around the Waymo technology at issue in the case. If that is true, that would lessen the impact on Uber in the event of a defeat in court.

Waymo is skeptical of Uber’s claim, however. In a court filing on Monday, it requested an order forcing Uber to disclose its source code, or underlying software, for its Lidar products.

The Alphabet subsidiary said in the filing that it recently learned that former employees took Waymo source code when they went to work at Uber, “including software related to the ‘brains’ of the vehicle that determines how the car moves.”",Exclusive: Alphabet's Waymo demanded $1 billion in settlement talks with Uber - sources,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-uber-lawsuit/exclusive-alphabets-waymo-demanded-1-billion-in-settlement-talks-with-uber-sources-idUKKBN1CH0QC

We’re very advanced now in terms of planning,” said Reader, the 47-year-old manager of Grace Foods UK.
Reader fears Brexit will hit his company on several fronts: increased bureaucracy, costs and delays at borders, volatile currency shifts and a slow-burn divergence between Britain and Europe over food standards and labelling.
“We will end up with two totally different companies, with a holding company at the top,” he said, sitting near a map of the Caribbean.
If the model works, the company could build its own distribution base there in time.","WELWYN GARDEN CITY, England (Reuters) - As the head of a British company that imports, exports and manufactures food, Adam Reader is at the centre of the Brexit storm, facing threats at every turn.

But unlike the majority of company bosses who are reluctant to make concrete plans when a future trade deal with Europe has not yet been decided, Reader is not going to wait.

Instead, he’s charging ahead with investments that will split his operations between Britain and Europe, a strategy he is confident will contain any damage from changes to currency, regulations and tariffs as he ships his products globally.

“We’re lucky. We have a clear path. We’re very advanced now in terms of planning,” said Reader, the 47-year-old manager of Grace Foods UK.

“A lot of the businesses I‘m talking to are not really clear about what they’re going to do come the date of Brexit,” he told Reuters at his plant north of London, where Grace’s Caribbean, Mexican and Chinese products are stored.

Britain’s 2016 vote to leave the European Union stunned many businesses, with the prospect that border delays and tariffs could fracture intricate supply chains built up across the continent over the last 40 years.

The plunge in the pound has already forced importers to cut costs and sparked concerns about consumer spending.

Those who voted in favour of Brexit argue that although the economy could be hit in the short term, Britain will ultimately prosper because it will be able to strike trade deals with other nations quickly instead of being clamped to a failed German-dominated experiment in European integration.

For the moment many companies are in limbo, however, as Prime Minister Theresa May’s party wrangles over terms of the departure, due in March 2019. The EU says future trade cannot be discussed until the terms of the divorce have been agreed, meaning a final settlement may not be unveiled until late in the day.

Only 11 percent of companies have started to implement contingency plans, a survey by the Institute of Directors said in July, meaning many may not be ready when the time comes.

Britain’s Food and Drink Federation (FDF), which speaks for an industry employing 400,000 people, says companies should be preparing for all scenarios.

“The time between now and the end of March 2019 is so short that you have to plan for the worst,” FDF Director General Ian Wright told Reuters. “People need to be prepared for what could be a series of very difficult months ahead.”

HIGH STAKES

For Grace Foods UK, a subsidiary of Jamaica’s Grace Kennedy, the stakes are high.

Based in an industrial park in Welwyn Garden City, the company imports drinks, sauces, snacks and spices from around the world, then distributes them to supermarkets, restaurants and independent retailers in Europe, Africa and around Britain. A manufacturing plant in Wales produces sauces.

Reader fears Brexit will hit his company on several fronts: increased bureaucracy, costs and delays at borders, volatile currency shifts and a slow-burn divergence between Britain and Europe over food standards and labelling.

To respond, he has taken an embryonic plan he came up with before the Brexit vote to build a presence in Europe to meet strong demand there and transformed it into a strategy to insulate his company against the expected disruption ahead.

“Brexit accelerated it and made it a ‘must do’ now, rather than a ‘nice to have’,” said Reader from a corner office near the 11,000-sq-m chilled distribution centre piled high with boxes of colourful goods, from its branded Grace “Coconut Water” to “Jerk BBQ Sauce” and “Plantain Chips”.

The company will now make the largest investment in its history to restructure, starting with a new sales base in Europe, most likely in Germany.

“We will end up with two totally different companies, with a holding company at the top,” he said, sitting near a map of the Caribbean.

The final investment has not yet been agreed but it is likely to be equal to a low single-digit percentage of Grace UK’s revenue, he said.

The company will also partner with a distributor in Europe, meaning those goods being sold on the continent can be delivered straight there to avoid paying double tariffs that could come from importing them via Britain first, Reader said.

If the model works, the company could build its own distribution base there in time.

“We could be ready to go in terms of the European operation in the next six months,” said Reader, a former accountant who worked his way up the firm since joining in 2000.

In Britain, Reader plans to ramp up processing, figuring it will be easier and cheaper in a post-Brexit world to import raw ingredients that can come into the country on lower tariffs, rather than paying a range of tariffs on ingredients and containers in fully processed goods.

TIES BUILT UP OVER DECADES

The scale of the plan shows the challenges facing the food and drinks industry, the country’s largest manufacturing sector and one of the most deeply entwined with Europe.

Around 30 percent of Britain’s food and drink comes from the EU, with fruit and vegetables often imported, while 61 percent of the food and drink exported from Britain goes to the EU.

The close ties have built up during Britain’s more than 40 years in the EU. Reader fears that over time the regulations will now diverge on issues such as labelling and food standards, which would force him to manage his stock separately.

“Experience shows how different the regulations are,” he said, comparing how the United States and EU differ on approving certain ingredients. “When you look at how the EU gets legislation through, and the dissent you have on certain pieces, it’s going to happen over here.”

Britain has proposed a two-year transition period to help companies but the EU has yet to discuss the terms. In the meantime it is preparing a customs and tax regime that could operate if it leaves the EU with no deal.

Any introduction of tariffs would push the price of food up between 5 and 10 percent, the FDF’s Wright said, while any further devaluation of the pound would jack up import costs.

What sets Grace Foods apart from many of its peers is the fact that it is growing so quickly, with its popular branded drinks such as “Grace Ginger Beer” and “Say Aloe” helping to drive up European sales by around 30 percent a year.

Nick Harrison, the global co-head of the retail practice at consultants Oliver Wyman, said food manufacturers were weighing whether to invest to adapt the business or risk customs delays in the future.

“It’s risky to start building a factory without definitely knowing that you’re going to need it,” he said. “It isn’t totally irrational to still be doing contingency planning.”","In a sea of uncertainty, one company sets its Brexit course",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-companies-insight/in-a-sea-of-uncertainty-one-company-sets-its-brexit-course-idUKKBN1CH23N

Just a day after Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies severed transport links with Qatar over a diplomatic row, bans on Doha’s fleet using regional ports and anchorages threatened to halt some of its exports and disrupt those of liquefied natural gas (LNG).

Traders worried that Riyadh’s allies would refuse to accept LNG shipments from the Gulf state, and that Egypt might even bar tankers carrying Qatari cargoes from using the Suez Canal as they head to Europe and beyond - although Cairo is bound by an international agreement to let them use the waterway.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

U.S. President Donald Trump joined in the dispute on Tuesday, saying leaders he met on a Middle East trip had warned him that Doha was funding “radical ideology”. Qatar vehemently denies the accusations made against it.

Qatar is now unable to load crude oil onto supertankers together with other Gulf-based grades, and price agency S&P Global Platts said it would not automatically include the country in its Middle East price benchmark.

The agency noted that tankers usually combine Qatari shipments with crude from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Oman before heading from the Gulf. “Restrictions on vessels calling into Qatar and associated uncertainty could impact the inherent value of crude loading from Qatar,” it said.

More worryingly, food imports are affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies. Sources said the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already cut exports of white sugar to Qatar. Consumption is traditionally higher during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is currently being observed.

Qatar, which largely depends on food imports for its population of 2.5 million, has assured residents it has taken measures to assure that normal life continues.

However, Maersk (MAERSKb.CO), the world’s biggest container shipping line, said it can no longer transport goods in or out of Qatar.

Containers carrying food and other consumer goods are usually shipped to Qatar via the UAE port of Jebel Ali. A Maersk Line spokesman said: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

Shoppers packed stores in Doha on Monday to stock up. On Tuesday, fresh poultry and some types of milk were in short supply at two supermarkets visited by a Reuters reporter. However, plenty of fruit and vegetables remained on the shelves.

EXCLUSION ZONES

With exclusion zones sweeping into effect, vessels from Qatar are no longer able to dock in the UAE or Saudi Arabia as planned. According to shipping data on Thomson Reuters Eikon, around half a dozen oil, chemical and LNG tankers have had to leave UAE waters or have halted in the open ocean.

Bans on Qatar-linked oil and LNG vessels refueling at the UAE’s port of Fujairah have added to chaos, pushing shippers to find new refueling points at extra cost, industry sources said.

Lying near the Strait of Hormuz, through which ships pass on their way to customers in Asia, the United States or Europe, Fujairah is one of the world’s most important ports for the global energy market.

Qatar, the world’s biggest LNG seller, is moving to send a first batch of LNG tankers as far afield as Singapore and Gibraltar to refuel with Fujairah now off limits. Some trade sources said this could increase costs and delay deliveries to its clients globally.

The UAE’s ban also effectively halts deliveries of LNG produced in Qatar to the Gulf state, trade sources said. Royal Dutch Shell has a deal with the Dubai Supply Authority to deliver up to three LNG cargoes per month, typically sourced from Qatar.

“This shouldn’t affect the spot market though. Shell will simply need to go into its global portfolio and find LNG from elsewhere to send to Dubai. It’s a minor inconvenience,” one LNG trader said.

LNG traders are on high alert for signs of disruption through the Suez Canal. They are tracking the Al Ruwais LNG tanker, which is nearing the waterway and plans to become the first Qatari cargo to pass through since the row erupted.

Cairo has made no official statement. However, a Suez Canal Authority official said that under an international agreement, Cairo allows all ships to pass through except for those from countries at war with Egypt. The Suez Canal does not have the power to prevent Qatari ships from passing, the official added, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Any tanker barred from using the canal would have to sail around Africa, adding a month to shipping times. Such disruption could boost demand for Russian gas, just as Europe is trying to reduce its reliance on such supplies due to disputes with Moscow over its role in the Ukraine crisis.

Another test will be a batch of LNG shipments of Qatari origin being brought by commodity trader Trafigura to Egypt. These are due to arrive at the country’s Ain Sokhna port over the coming days and weeks, trade sources said.

Any sign that state-run importer Egyptian Natural Gas Holding would bar LNG of Qatari origin would probably push up spot prices sharply as middlemen seek alterative supplies.

Last year Qatar produced 60 percent of all LNG imported by Egypt, all of which was brought in by third-party traders such as Trafigura, Glencore and Vitol.

“The biggest impact will be if Egypt tries to restrict vessels coming through the canal or if they ban Qatari LNG from local ports,” a trading source said.

The rift has also hit aluminum exports from a Qatari plant part-owned by Norway’s Norsk Hydro (NHY.OL) as it has lost access to the Jebel Ali port, through which it typically runs exports operations.

Circumventing barriers to customers in Asia, Europe and the United States will take some time, the company said, showing how the diplomatic face-off is inflicting havoc on global supply chains.",Port bans choke Qatar's commodity trade as gas supply worries grow,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gulf-qatar-commodities/port-bans-choke-qatars-commodity-trade-as-gas-supply-worries-grow-idUSKBN18X1Y2

That hero, widely available in factories across the world, was the Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine.

Big, grey and boxy, CNC machines use pre-programmed guides to produce intricate parts for everything from automobiles and mobile phones to furniture and clothes. They offer accuracy that human machine tool operators are unable to achieve.

In North Korea, thanks to a combination of homemade technology and reverse engineering, the machines now play a critical role in the weapons programs. They allow Kim Jong Un to build nuclear bombs and missiles without relying as heavily on outside technical aid or imports.

Nuclear weapons experts say this has helped him accelerate missile and nuclear testing despite international sanctions on the transfer of sensitive equipment.

Interactive: Kim’s latest act of defiance

“North Korea’s centrifuges and new missiles all depend on components made with CNC machine tools,” said Jeffrey Lewis, head of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of Strategic Studies at Monterey, California.

“(They) are the essential underlying technology for producing missiles and nuclear weapons,” said Lewis.

Since 1996, CNC machines have been included in the Wassenaar Arrangement – an international arms control regime aimed at stopping the proliferation of equipment with both civilian and military uses. North Korea is not a signatory.

The country’s celebrations of its CNC technology have been fulsome. Hundreds of dancers in luminous orange and green performed the CNC pop song, titled “Break through the cutting edge,” at a Korean Workers’ Party celebration in 2010. In 2012, the year the South Korean hit “Gangnam Style” was released, the North’s CNC title was on karaoke machines nationwide, according to Choson Exchange, a Singapore-based company that trains North Koreans in business skills. The official video for the song opens with a long-range North Korean rocket soaring into a blue sky.

CUTTING EDGE

North Korea likely started to develop its own CNC machines in the early 1990s as part of a drive to build sophisticated missiles and nuclear weapons, nuclear experts say. It probably learned how to make them by taking apart machines it had imported from the Soviet Union.

Its first homemade CNC machine was introduced in 1995. Former leader Kim Jong Il gave the machine the “Ryonha” brand, according to a 2009 article in the country’s official newspaper, Rodong Sinmun. That was the first time state media mentioned the technology.

By 2009, the machines had become a mainstay of North Korean propaganda, as Pyongyang launched a nationwide campaign to boost domestic industry. Sanctions were mounting after its second nuclear test and a long-range missile launch that year.

At the time, arms control experts raised concerns about a visit by former leader Kim Jong Il to a North Korean factory where homemade CNC machines appeared to be producing aluminum tubes. These could be used for nuclear centrifuges.

“By around 2010, it seemed they were capable of manufacturing various types of CNC machines,” said Kim Heung-gwang, a North Korean defector who taught at Pyongyang’s Hamhung Computer Technology University before defecting to South Korea.

But it wasn’t until 2013 that the Korea Ryonha Machinery Joint Venture Corporation, which produced the machines, was blacklisted by the U.N. Security Council for supporting the weapons programs.

And it was only in August this year that U.S. intelligence officials told Reuters North Korea likely has the ability to produce its own missile engines themselves. (Full Story)

Now, Kim Heung-gwang estimates, North Korea has about 15,000 CNC machines. He bases this on North Korean state media reports and photos as well as interviews with more than a dozen defectors who were scientists, professors or factory workers.

MASS PRODUCTION

Pyongyang hailed the homemade machines as a triumph for its governing ideology of “Juche”, which champions self-sufficiency. But that wasn’t strictly true.

In August 2016, state media released photos of Kim Jong Un visiting a factory using CNC machines with the logo of Swiss engineering firm ABB ABB.UL, one of the leading players in the global CNC machine market. It’s not clear when or how the machine reached North Korea.

ABB said the firm respects all applicable trade sanctions against North Korea, and undertakes not to deliver ABB equipment to the country. “That said, we cannot rule out that some of our equipment may have been resold to DPR of Korea without our knowledge or permission,” the company said in response to a Reuters inquiry, using North Korea’s official title.

A United Nations panel monitoring sanctions on North Korea said in a report this year that Tengzhou Keyongda CNC Machine Tools Co of China had been a supplier of Pyongyang’s new CNC machines. A sales representative for Tengzhou Keyongda told Reuters the company stopped selling CNC machines to North Korea four years ago, and no longer maintains trade relations with the country.

Despite sanctions, CNC machines are commonplace across North Korean manufacturing and can be brought in through China and Russia, said Lee Choon-geun, a senior fellow at the Science and Technology Policy Institute in South Korea.

The biggest loophole has been that while some CNC machines are banned because they can have both military and civilian functions, most serve civilian industry. “Given their dual-use capability, you could even import the machines for other purposes, take them to pieces and use them however you want,” said Lee.

The CNC song highlights this in its opening line: “Whatever it is, once we put our mind to it, there’s a program to make it,” it says.",How a homemade tool helped North Korea's missile program,https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1CH1IC

O plano havia sido aprovado na semana passada pelo Conselho de Administração da companhia e prevê aportes de pelo menos 9 bilhões de reais na companhia. A proposta deverá ser analisada por milhares de credores reunidos em assembleia marcada para 23 de outubro, com uma segunda convocação prevista para 27 de novembro. Se não houver aprovação, a falência da empresa poderá ser decretada.

O processo de recuperação judicial da Oi, iniciado em junho de 2016, é o maior da história do país. A empresa, que foi eleita pelos governos petistas como uma “campeã nacional” e tentou uma fracassada fusão com a Portugal Telecom, listou dívidas de mais de 65 bilhões de reais e cerca de 55 mil credores.

Dos 9 bilhões de reais da capitalização, cerca de 6 bilhões equivalem a dinheiro novo, sendo 3,5 bilhões de reais por parte dos detentores de títulos de dívida da Oi e 2,5 bilhões dos atuais acionistas. Os 3 bilhões de reais restantes poderão vir de conversão de debêntures em ações, segundo o plano.

O limite da conversão das debêntures é de 15 (até 119 milhões de ações) a 25 por cento (até 225 milhões de papéis), dependendo da opção de juros e do prazo a serem adotados pelos principais detentores de bônus da empresa. No início deste mês estes credores manifestaram interesse de troca de 26 bilhões de reais em dívidas da Oi por 88 por cento do capital da operadora.

No caso da opção que prevê conversão de 15 por cento, a taxa de juros é de 10 por cento ao ano e o prazo é de zero a 12 meses, na alternativa de 25 por cento, os juros propostos são de 6 por cento, com a troca efetiva ocorrendo após 24 meses, segundo o plano.

O plano apresentado no início do ano previa 3,9 bilhões de reais em bônus conversíveis a partir do 36º mês, com a troca sendo equivalente a 17 por cento do capital, e juros de 6 por cento ao ano.

Além disso, o novo plano prevê dividendos a serem distribuídos apenas após seis anos, e após isso caso o índice de dívida líquida sobre Ebitda seja inferior a 2 vezes e enquanto houver créditos remanescentes da reestruturação. Anteriormente, a proposta previa distribuição de dividendos apenas caso a alavancagem ficasse abaixo de 2,5 vezes.

INVESTIMENTOS

A Oi reafirmou que o aumento de capital permitirá à empresa elevar investimentos de 5 bilhões para 7 bilhões de reais por ano nos próximos três anos. Isso permitiria à empresa competir em melhores condições com grupos internacionais como Telefónica, América Móvil e Telecom Italia, que operam no Brasil por meio das marcas Vivo, Claro e TIM.

O plano protocolado na Justiça prevê a negociação da dívida de mais de 10 bilhões e reais devida à Agência Nacional de Telecomunicações (Anatel) por meio de dois caminhos: negociação de acordos (TACs) para conversão de multas em investimentos e parcelamento em até 20 anos, com correção pelo IPCA, com entrada de 20 por cento, deduzido de depósitos judiciais. Essa solução mista havia sido antecipada na semana passada à Reuters por fontes envolvidas nas negociações.

Representantes da Anatel não puderam ser encontrados para comentar a proposta.

SOCORRO FEDERAL

Nesta semana, o governo federal criou um grupo de trabalho, liderado pela Advocacia-Geral da União (AGU) para buscar solução para as dívidas da Oi com entidades públicas, como as multas da Anatel. A Oi é responsável por cerca de 30 por cento dos serviços de telecomunicações utilizados pelo governo federal.

A orientação que partiu do Palácio do Planalto é buscar uma saída que evite a necessidade de intervenção na companhia.

Falando a jornalistas na terça-feira, após reunião com o ministro da Fazenda, Henrique Meirelles, para tratar do assunto, a ministra da AGU, Grace Mendonça, disse que o governo vai analisar todos os cenários, desde que tenham sustentação jurídica, para tentar buscar uma solução.

Ela não descartou medidas como o enquadramento de parte da dívida de mais de 10 bilhões de reais da Oi com a Anatel nas regras de financiamento previstas na Medida Provisória 780, o chamado Refis das autarquias.

Haveria ainda a possibilidade de negociar um acordo para conversão de parte das multas recebidas pela operadora em investimentos, algo já mencionado no plano entregue nesta quarta-feira. A ministra também não descartou alongamento de prazos para pagamento das dívidas, como pretendido pela Oi no plano.","Oi entrega à Justiça plano de recuperação, limita conversão a 25% do capital",https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idBRKBN1CH038-OBRBS

LONDON (Reuters) - British lenders are planning the biggest cutback in consumer loans in nearly 10 years, the Bank of England said on Thursday, after it warned repeatedly about the strong pace of lending to households.

The BoE’s quarterly net balance of lenders’ expectations for the availability of unsecured lending over the next three months fell to -28.6 from -16.2.

That signalled the steepest contraction since the fourth quarter of 2008, when the economy was in the depths of its worst post-war recession.

The BoE has said there is no overall debt bubble in Britain but it has expressed concern about consumer debt, which had been growing at about 10 percent a year.

The BoE has signalled it is likely to raise interest rates for the first time in more than a decade soon, so long as the economy and inflation continue to grow.

Most economists polled by Reuters think it will hike rates in November, although a majority reckon it would also be a mistake given the uncertain outlook ahead of Britain’s divorce from the European Union.

Thursday’s survey figures showed Britain’s consumer economy is running out of steam, said Joanna Davies, economist at Fathom Consulting, the only forecaster in recent Reuters polls to predict a recession. [ECILT/GB]

“We’re quite concerned about the consumer squeeze,” Davies said, citing falling wages in inflation adjusted terms and historically low household savings.

“If you add tightening credit conditions onto that, it doesn’t bode well.”

Lenders expected the availability of mortgages and loans to businesses to remain broadly steady over the next three months.

But they also expected demand for loans for capital investment in businesses to fall at the fastest rate since the third quarter of 2011.

The BoE has raised concerns about heady growth rates in consumer credit, and the Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates consumer credit firms, is looking at whether changes are needed as thousands of people struggle with debt.

Earlier this year the BoE warned lenders may be dicing with a “spiral of complacency”, with car loans a particular area of worry.

The FCA faces some political pressure to cap high interest rates, but David Geale, director of policy at the watchdog, said on Thursday there is no single fix.

“I don’t think there is a one-size-fits-all solution,” Geale told the Westminster Business Forum.

Consumer credit, including unarranged overdrafts, were a lifeline for some people, he said.

“Price caps are something that shouldn’t be used in haste ... There is a combination of factors that we need to consider, and not just a price cap,” Geale said.

Rising costs for households in an era of weak wage growth -- whether from loans, housing or energy -- have shot to the top of Britain’s political agenda over the past few years.

Earlier on Thursday, Britain published a draft law that would cap consumer gas and electricity prices for millions of households, taking action to try and fix a market it says punishes loyal customers.",UK lenders plan biggest consumer lending curb since late 2008 -BoE,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-boe-lending/uk-lenders-plan-biggest-consumer-lending-curb-since-late-2008-boe-idUKKBN1CH0ZE

FRANKFURT/BERLIN (Reuters) - Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) reinforced its position as Germany’s largest airline on Thursday by signing a 210 million euro ($249 million)deal to buy large parts of insolvent Air Berlin (AB1.DE).

Lufthansa plans to use the Air Berlin assets to quickly expand its Eurowings budget business. News of the deal pushed Lufthansa shares up more than 3 percent to their highest level in nearly 17 years.

Air Berlin, which has struggled to turn a profit over the last decade, filed for insolvency on Aug. 15, and a government loan has kept its planes aloft while its administrator negotiated with prospective buyers for parts of the business.

Lufthansa has agreed to acquire Air Berlin’s Austrian leisure travel airline Niki, its LG Walter regional airline and 20 additional aircraft, Air Berlin said in a statement.

“This contract provides new opportunities for jobs for a large part of our workforce. But we can only really breathe again when the EU Commission approves the deal,” Air Berlin Chief Executive Thomas Winkelmann said.

Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr said earlier he expected the European Union to approve the transaction by the end of 2017.

Talks to sell some of Air Berlin’s remaining assets to Britain’s easyJet (EZJ.L) and other bidders are continuing, Air Berlin said, without providing details.

EasyJet, which has a base at Berlin’s Schoenefeld airport, has been discussing acquiring 27 to 30 planes. Air Berlin previously said others, such as Thomas Cook’s (TCG.L) Condor, could pick up some parts of the business.

EasyJet declined to comment on the progress of talks on Thursday.

BIG INVESTMENTS

Lufthansa CEO Spohr told a German paper earlier that his airline would be investing around 1.5 billion euros in total as a result of the Air Berlin deal.

That sum includes investment in new planes, for which the board freed up 1 billion euros of funds last month, the purchase price and the costs of taking on new staff.

Air Berlin, Germany’s second largest carrier, will cease operating flights this month, capping a turbulent summer for European carriers.

Italy’s national airline Alitalia [CAITLA.UL] is in administration and seeking investors too, British leisure airline Monarch collapsed at the start of this month.

Lufthansa’s Spohr said on Thursday while he was not interested in the Italian carrier in its current shape he would be interested in talks to create a new Alitalia.

Shares in Lufthansa were up 3.3 percent at 25.38 euros, the top gainer in Germany’s DAX market index <0#.GDAXI> by 1340 GMT.

Analysts at Bernstein Research raised their rating on Lufthansa’s shares to “outperform” from “market-perform”, saying they expected a deal with Air Berlin to add around 70 to 90 million euros to annual operating profits at Lufthansa’s budget unit Eurowings in the medium term.

HSBC analysts lifted their target share price to 29 euros from 25 euros, citing the imminent agreement with Air Berlin, a new multi-year labor deal with pilots announced this week and a positive trading performance this year.",Lufthansa spreads wings by snapping up parts of failed Air Berlin,https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idCAKBN1CH0SS-OCABS

Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula that promises it a high degree of autonomy and freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland.

But critics have accused the government of bending to the will of Communist Party leaders in Beijing and of a gradual watering down of the territory’s freedoms, including freedom of speech and right to protest.

British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said he was “very concerned” that Benedict Rogers, a co-founder of the Conservative Party’s Human Rights Commission, was denied entry to Hong Kong on Wednesday and demanded an “urgent explanation” from Hong Kong and China.

It came a week before a sensitive Communist Party leadership meeting starts in Beijing.

Johnson also said Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy, rights and freedoms were “central to its way of life”.

Rogers has been a vocal critic of China-ruled Hong Kong’s treatment of political activists, including that of jailed student leader Joshua Wong. He believes the decision to bar him was made by Chinese officials after the Chinese Embassy in London had warned him earlier, through a British member of parliament, that he wouldn’t be allowed in.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the central government had a responsibility for foreign matters related to Hong Kong.

“The central Chinese government and the special administrative region government handle the relevant issue in accordance with the law,” Hua said. “Allowing or not allowing people in is China’s sovereignty ... Hong Kong affairs are a purely internal matter for China.”

She said China had lodged a solemn representation with Britain, meaning an official complaint.

When asked about the incident on a radio talk show, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam agreed.

“Ultimately, under the Basic Law (Hong Kong’s mini-constitution), the central government is responsible for foreign affairs,” Lam said.

Asked if immigration controls fell under Hong Kong jurisdiction, Lam said: ”It has to be considered whether foreign affairs are involved during the process of immigration.

“If you say everything falls under Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy, this is not what the Basic Law says.”

Rogers, speaking to Reuters shortly after arriving in London, said Beijing’s statement confirmed his assumption that the decision to boot him out was made not by Hong Kong but by Chinese authorities.

He described the interference in Hong Kong’s immigration controls as “very alarming” and “a very serious threat to ‘one country, two systems’.”

“China has now revealed its hand. The world ought to have woken up a long time ago, but I think now they really ought to wake up to what this means for ‘one country, two systems’,” he said.

“I‘m very sad for what this means for Hong Kong.”

The former head of Hong Kong’s civil service turned pro-democracy activist, Anson Chan, said the case was a “serious breach” of the Basic Law.

Article 154 of the Basic Law says Hong Kong “may apply immigration controls on entry” of foreigners into Hong Kong.

“The Immigration Department must have sought instructions from on high,” she told Reuters. “They (Beijing) are sending a message that if you dare speak out on Hong Kong ... you will not be allowed in.”

Amnesty International’s East Asia director, Nicholas Bequelin, suggested China’s definition of what constitutes national security is creeping into Hong Kong.

“In China if you’re critical of the political system, you’re committing a national security crime and this is exactly the type of thing ‘one country, two systems’ should protect against.”

In response to a Reuters’ request for comment on whether China was involved in Rogers’ denial of entry, Hong Kong’s Immigration Department said it did not comment on individual cases.

China has admitted asking a group of British MPs to cancel a visit to Hong Kong in 2014 during the massive pro-democracy protests, of which Joshua Wong was a leader, that paralyzed highways for 79 days.

Hong Kong has, on occasion, barred entry to individuals including dissidents, such as former leaders of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in Beijing and a Danish sculptor, Jens Galschiot, who made a Tiananmen sculpture.",China says it has right to bar people from Hong Kong after British activist expelled,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-hongkong-britain/china-says-it-has-right-to-bar-people-from-hong-kong-after-british-activist-expelled-idUKKBN1CH10A

SAN FRANCISCO(Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Waymo sought at least $1 billion in damages and a public apology from Uber Technologies Inc as conditions for settling its high-profile trade secret lawsuit against the ride-services company, sources familiar with the proposal told Reuters.

The Waymo self-driving car unit also asked that an independent monitor be appointed to ensure Uber does not use Waymo technology in the future, the sources said.

Uber rejected those terms as non-starters, said the sources, who were not authorized to publicly discuss settlement talks. The precise dollar amount requested by Waymo and the exact time the offer was made could not be learned.

Waymo’s tough negotiating stance, which has not been previously reported, reflects the company’s confidence in its legal position after months of pretrial victories in a case which may help to determine who emerges in the forefront of the fast-growing field of self-driving cars.

The aggressive settlement demands also suggest that Waymo is not in a hurry to resolve the lawsuit, in part because of its value as a distraction for Uber leadership, said Elizabeth Rowe, a trade secret expert at the University of Florida Levin College of Law.

Waymo recently persuaded a San Francisco federal judge to delay a trial to decide the dispute from October to early December, citing the need to investigate evidence Uber had not disclosed earlier.

No further settlement talks are currently scheduled, the sources said. The judge overseeing the case mandated that the companies enter mediation with a court-appointed magistrate.

Amy Candido, a Waymo attorney, declined to comment on any settlement talks, but said the company’s reasons for suing Uber are “pretty clear.”

“Waymo had one goal: to stop Uber from using its trade secrets,” she said. “That remains its goal.”

An Uber spokesperson declined to comment.

DISRUPTIVE

Waymo sued Uber in February, claiming that former engineer Anthony Levandowski downloaded more than 14,000 confidential files before leaving to set up a self-driving truck company, called Otto, which Uber acquired soon after.

Uber denied using any of Waymo’s trade secrets.

Waymo’s lawsuit has been disruptive for Uber. U.S. District Judge William Alsup granted Waymo’s request for a pretrial injunction in May, which prohibited Levandowski from working on Lidar, a key sensor technology for self-driving cars that is the crux of the current litigation.

Uber later fired Levandowski, regarded as a visionary in autonomous technology, after he refused to return Waymo documents at the heart of the case. Levandowski has asserted his constitutional right against self-incrimination and declined to answer questions from Waymo lawyers.

Meanwhile, Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick stepped down as chief executive in June after allegations of widespread misconduct at the company became public. Kalanick has since become embroiled in a boardroom fight with fellow Uber investor Benchmark Capital.

Benchmark cited Waymo’s allegations of trade secret theft in separate litigation aimed at forcing Kalanick off Uber’s board. A Delaware judge put that lawsuit on hold and sent it to private arbitration.

On Sunday Oct. 1, the day before Kalanick was scheduled to give a deposition in the Waymo case, Kalanick’s lawyers called Waymo and asked to postpone the deposition, lawyers for both companies said in court last week.

Kalanick’s lawyers said he was in the middle of a fight to appoint new board members and was therefore too busy, Waymo attorneys said in court. Waymo refused the request, forcing Kalanick to attend the deposition.

DISTRACTING A COMPETITOR

Causing such distractions for a competitor are a clear benefit to Waymo, Rowe said. Uber has hired three law firms to litigate the case and devoted thousands of hours to probe Uber servers for Waymo confidential information.

“I‘m counting all those as good reasons to keep the lawsuit going,” Rowe said.

Waymo has estimated damages in the case at about $1.9 billion, according to court filings, which Uber disputes. Despite that figure and the big settlement demands, Waymo views winning a permanent injunction against Uber using any Waymo intellectual property as the main priority, another source familiar with the company’s thinking said.

Much of the technical evidence in the case has been filed under seal, making it impossible for outside observers to independently assess the strength of each side’s arguments. In court last week, Alsup said Uber’s product was “dissimilar” from Waymo‘s.

Even if a jury finds that Uber stole Waymo trade secrets, Uber says in court filings that its engineers have designed around the Waymo technology at issue in the case. If that is true, that would lessen the impact on Uber in the event of a defeat in court.

Waymo is skeptical of Uber’s claim, however. In a court filing on Monday, it requested an order forcing Uber to disclose its source code, or underlying software, for its Lidar products.

The Alphabet subsidiary said in the filing that it recently learned that former employees took Waymo source code when they went to work at Uber, “including software related to the ‘brains’ of the vehicle that determines how the car moves.”",Exclusive: Alphabet's Waymo demanded $1 billion in settlement talks with Uber - sources,https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idCAKBN1CH0QC-OCABS

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Thursday as U.S. fuel inventories rose despite efforts by OPEC to cut production.

Brent crude oil LCOc1 was down 75 cents at $56.19 a barrel by 1340 GMT. U.S. light crude CLc1 was $1.00 lower at $50.30. Both benchmarks have risen more than 20 percent from their lows in June as world oil markets tightened.

U.S. crude stocks rose by 3.1 million to 468.5 million barrels last week, according to the American Petroleum Institute.

Official U.S. inventory data was due to be published later on Thursday by the Energy Information Administration (EIA).

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers, including Russia, agreed last year to reduce output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) to prop up prices.

The cuts have helped deplete global fuel inventories, but stocks are still high and well above the five-year average, a target that OPEC has said it wants to reach in order to balance the market.

High U.S. production is pushing increasing volumes of U.S. crude into world markets, feeding inventories and undermining OPEC’s efforts to tighten the market C-OUT-T-EIA.

The International Energy Agency said on Thursday demand for OPEC oil would be 32.5 million bpd next year - around 150,000 bpd lower than the group pumped last month.

Carsten Fritsch, commodities analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, said the tone of the IEA report was bearish because it suggested that demand for OPEC crude next year would not be sufficient to absorb all the available supplies.

“This means OPEC must deepen its production cuts to finish its job of bringing oil stocks back to the five-year average,” Fritsch said.

The OPEC-led deal helped lift oil from below $30 a barrel early last year. But traders say supplies remain ample and OPEC is widely expected to extend its cuts beyond the current expiry date of end-March 2018.

“There is little doubt that leading producers have re-committed to do whatever it takes to underpin the market,” the IEA said in a report on Thursday.

Many analysts expect Brent to stay between $50 and $60 a barrel as long as global markets stay balanced.

“Our updated global supply-demand balance ... shows peak stock draws in 3Q17,” Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients.

The U.S. bank said oil supply and demand fundamentals meant it expected Brent to average $58 a barrel in 2018.",Oil prices fall on higher U.S. crude inventories,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-global-oil/oil-prices-fall-on-higher-u-s-crude-inventories-idUKKBN1CH01V?il=0

Flint, who runs HSBC’s retail and wealth management business out of London, will take over as CEO in February next year when Stuart Gulliver, 58, retires after seven years in the job.

The appointment is the first major decision taken by former AIA Group (1299.HK) chief Mark Tucker, who officially took up his post at HSBC just 12 days ago as its first externally-appointed chairman.

Flint, who is not related to Tucker’s predecessor Douglas Flint, is viewed by other HSBC executives as the safe option, having worked at the bank since 1989.

During his career at HSBC Flint, 49, has worked across most of its businesses and spent his first 14 years in Asia, giving him the breadth of experience seen as vital for the CEO role.

“He has a great understanding and regard for HSBC’s heritage, and the passion to build the bank for the next generation,” Tucker said in a statement.

Flint emerged as the forerunner in the past six months as expectations HSBC could appoint its first external CEO in its 150-year history waned on the back of a rally in its share price.

The bank’s stock is up 14 percent so far this year, though was little moved on Thursday following the announcement of Flint’s appointment.

“It’s good news - it’s important to mix an insider with the new outside chairman and continue on the path set by the current team,” said Hugh Young, head of Asia at Standard Life Aberdeen, one of the bank’s top ten shareholders.

PUSH FOR GROWTH

Flint will be paid a base salary of 1.2 million pounds ($1.6 million) a year, as well as a fixed pay allowance of 1.7 million pounds and an annual pension allowance of 360,000 pounds.

He will also be entitled to an annual bonus worth up to 215 percent of his base pay and a long-term incentive award of up to 320 pct of his base pay.

His main task will be to grow revenues across HSBC’s businesses, as it seeks to grow profits again following a period of restructuring after the 2008-9 financial crisis.

HSBC’s previous management duo of Gulliver and Douglas Flint spent the years since their appointment in 2010 shrinking HSBC, after a period of empire-building in the run-up to the 2008 global financial crisis left the bank over-extended.

In July, HSBC announced its third share buyback in a year and rising profits, in a sign of its turnaround.

But the bank still faces a tough challenge to meet its long term goal of making a better than 10 percent return on equity.

In August last year HSBC abandoned a timetable for achieving that target, as increased regulatory requirements on capital, low interest rates and rising competition from low-cost competitors pressure lenders’ profits worldwide.

Investors will watch closely to see whether Flint continues Gulliver’s shift toward the bank’s second home market of Asia.

HSBC said in 2015 it would hire 4000 staff and lend more in China’s southern Pearl River Delta region, a plan that has since encountered some setbacks as China’s growth slowed.

It has also lost market share in its Asian life insurance business, a trend which analysts expect the bank’s new chairman to attempt to reverse given his background in the industry.

Flint spent much of his early carer in Asia, and has done stints in Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, and India as well as the United States and Britain.

Before taking on his retail and wealth role in 2013, he was HSBC’s head of strategy and planning having previously run its global asset management business and was deputy head of its markets business as well as serving as Group Treasurer.",HSBC picks company veteran John Flint as new chief executive,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hsbc-ceo/hsbc-picks-company-veteran-john-flint-as-new-chief-executive-idUSKBN1CH1BB?il=0

LONDON (Reuters) - A group of Britain’s most successful contemporary artists has donated valuable works to sell at a charity auction for the survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire, which killed about 80 people at a London social housing block in June.

Home to a close-knit, multi-ethnic community, the 24-storey tower in a deprived housing estate was reduced to a charred ruin by the inferno that engulfed it in the middle of the night.

Many survivors have yet to be rehoused and are still living in hotels.

The charity auction, to be held at Sotheby’s on Monday, includes works by A-list artists including Wolfgang Tillmans, Antony Gormley, Tracey Emin, Sarah Lucas, Mark Wallinger and Rachel Whiteread.

The proceeds from the auction, which Sotheby’s estimates will range between 700,000 and 1 million pounds ($926,000-$1.3 million), will be divided equally among 158 surviving families.

Film producer Hamish McAlpine, an art collector who was one of the driving forces behind the auction, said the Grenfell tragedy had had a huge emotional impact on Londoners, including the city’s vibrant artistic community.

“Grenfell touched their souls,” he said in an interview at Sotheby’s in an airy gallery where the donated artworks are on display. “It’s a very emotive subject for people in London.”

It would normally take six to nine months to organize an auction on this scale, but McAlpine and art consultant Katie Heller were able to put this one together in about 10 weeks thanks to the positive response from almost all the artists.

McAlpine said famous artists were constantly bombarded with requests to donate works for charity and could not always give, but in this case almost everyone had agreed immediately.

“There has been an extraordinary generosity within the artists’ community,” he said. “To give a work that’s worth hundreds of thousands of pounds, for free, it really is a magical thing.”

One of the works, “Lay the Dust with Tears” by Tacita Dean, was created especially for the auction. A gray and black image made with charcoal on paper, it is evocative of billowing smoke.

Other works that already existed have been renamed by the artists to honor the victims of the fire.

“Red Lens for Grenfell” by Anish Kapoor is a thick acrylic disc, reminiscent of lenses used in lighthouses, while a black-and-white photograph by Sarah Lucas has been renamed “Eating a Banana (for Grenfell)”.

The most valuable artwork for sale is “Freischwimmer 193” by Wolfgang Tillmans, a very large green print.

But things have changed, making President Emmanuel Macron’s job of pushing through labor reforms that much easier.

Barely 26,000 attended one Paris rally on Tuesday to protest against the reforms, a fraction of the hundreds of thousands who went on strike in the heyday of French industrial action freezing activity in swathes of the economy.

French strikes are not what they used to be, reflecting a cooling in national attitude to union militancy plus a change in approach by Macron who flagged his reforms well in advance to union leaders who have in turn seen their powers decline.

This means the 39-year-old former investment banker has the best opportunity in generations to overhaul France’s labor laws in his strategy to invigorate the EU’s second-largest economy.

“Fundamentally it is not a very strike-prone country any more,” said Bob Hancke, a labor relations expert at the London School of Economics. “In the mid-1990s, the joke was practically everyone had been a trade union member but no one ever stayed.”

In 2015, companies in France lost 69 days to strikes per 1,000 workers. That was barely a fifth of what it was in the late 1990s and a far cry from the 1,000 days lost to strikes per 1,000 workers in the late 1980s.

The decline has accelerated since conservative President Nicolas Sarkozy passed a law in 2007 banning wildcat walkouts and forcing public transport unions to guarantee a minimum service during strikes.

While it is possible that protests will gain momentum when Macron unveils more hard-hitting reforms over the next year, including changes to unemployment benefits and pensions, things have so far played in his favor.

SHIFT IN POWER

Unionists and labor experts interviewed for this story said one critical factor is that big, nationwide strikes have achieved little for the average worker in the past two decades.

“Governments eventually realized they could just force things through,” said Stephane Sirot, a professor at the Cergy-Pontoise university. An important point came in 2003, when a mass public-sector protest against pension reform failed to convince the government to budge, he said.

The last significant nationwide success enjoyed by unions was in 1995, when weeks of protests, also over pension reform, virtually brought the economy to a halt.

Since those strikes, which forced newly elected President Jacques Chirac to yield, major standoffs with successive governments have had mixed results.

“That’s the main difficulty for unions,” said Sirot. “They don’t win anymore.”

Taking part in a march in Paris against Macron’s reforms on Tuesday, Sarah, an activist for 20 years in the Sud Nettoyage cleaners’ union, said it was harder to get colleagues to strike.

“Many have been demotivated,” she said. “With their heart they are with us but it’s more difficult to mobilize them,” she said, adding that the young were particularly ambivalent about the effectiveness of strikes and street protests.

Around 10 percent of French workers are unionized, according to labor ministry data, with the average member more likely to be older and with a permanent job.

At the same protest rally in Paris on Tuesday, Marie-Josee da Silva, a 49-year old hospital care-worker, said she was marching on principle rather than out of any real hope that the rally would convince the government to change course.

Tuesday’s strike shut down some French schools and led to about a third of flights being canceled at some airports but overall disruption was minimal.

A lack of unity among unions also dented protests against Macron’s reforms, with many voters saying they believe the changes are vital to restore the health of the French economy.

The economy ministry said some 14 percent of state civil servants had been on strike and just 9.5 percent in local administration.

A WINNING STRATEGY?

Macron was careful to consult with unions ahead of the publication of his reform bill but he also offered small concessions. The most moderate union, the CFDT, which now has the largest membership, bought into Macron’s proposals.

Jean-Claude Mailly, the leader of France’s third-largest union, Force Ouvriere, told activists last month he had fought with the government behind closed doors for three months. But his union has also effectively accepted Macron’s reforms.

Only the Communist Party-rooted CGT spearheaded street demonstrations against the loosening of employment laws.

When consultations with unions on changes to unemployment benefits and job training start on Thursday, the government will try the same approach, being firm on basic issues while offering some concessions.

Sirot and others said the strategy could work, but they also warned that with Macron planning to press ahead over the next year with even more contentious legislation, he may have won an early battle but not yet the war.

“There is a degree of resignation, people wonder if (taking part in rallies) is worth it, if they will be listened to,” said Luc Berille, the head of Unsa, one of the public sector’s main unions. “People don’t necessarily walk off the job or protest, but there is an accumulation of resentment nonetheless, and that’s good for no one.”

For the current climate to prevail, the government needs to maintain contacts with unions, said Jean Grosset, who heads research on industrial relations at the Jean Jaures think-tank.

“The key is the sense of injustice,” said Grosset, a former union leader, cautioning that if the government failed to tackle this sentiment, bigger protests could be triggered.","With French down on strikes, Macron reforms get easier ride",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-france-reform-unions/with-french-down-on-strikes-macron-reforms-get-easier-ride-idUKKBN1CH1TQ?il=0

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A California woman wounded in the mass shooting at a Las Vegas music festival has filed a lawsuit against the operators of the hotel where the gunman fired from, the festival organizers and the maker of a device that allowed weapons to be fired at a near-automatic rate.

Paige Gasper, 21, said in the lawsuit that the defendants’ negligence led to the life-threatening injuries she suffered when a bullet shattered her ribs and lacerated her liver. The lawsuit was filed on Tuesday in Clark County, Nevada.

Stephen Paddock, the 64-year-old gunman, fired into the festival crowd from a 32nd-floor hotel suite at the Mandalay Bay hotel on Oct. 1, killing 58 people and injuring hundreds more. Paddock killed himself before the police stormed his suite.

Gasper’s lawsuit says MGM Resorts International and its subsidiary Mandalay Corp. [MGGMR.UL], which own the hotel, failed to properly monitor Paddock’s activities and responded too late to the shooting of a hotel security officer. Paddock fired at the security officer six minutes before opening fire on the crowd below.

Gasper said the festival organizer, Live Nation Entertainment, Inc., was negligent for failing to provide adequate exits and properly train staff for an emergency.

The companies did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

Legal experts said claims such as Gasper’s would face an uphill battle.

Victor Schwartz, an attorney specializing in injury cases, said that in order to hold MGM liable, victims would have to show the company could have foreseen the shooting and taken steps to prevent it.

That would be difficult for such an extreme event, he said.

Gasper’s lawsuit also accused Slide Fire Solutions, the maker of bump stock devices that were used by the gunman, of negligence, design and manufacturing defects. The devices are legal and allow semiautomatic rifles to operate as if they were fully automatic machine guns, which are heavily restricted in the United States.

Such claims would have to survive a law passed by U.S. Congress in 2005 that shields manufacturers of firearms, component parts or ammunition from liability if their products are used to commit a crime. Legal experts said it was not clear whether the component parts definition applied to bump stock devices.

Slide Fire did not respond to requests for comment.

In a separate lawsuit filed over the weekend, a group of plaintiffs accused the makers of bump stocks of negligence for inflicting emotional distress on thousands of people.

Gasper also alleged battery and the intentional infliction of emotional distress against the estate of Paddock, arguing the shooter acted with malice and evil intent, causing her injuries.","Las Vegas shooting victim sues hotel, festival organizer, 'bump stock' maker",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lasvegas-shooting-lawsuit/las-vegas-shooting-victim-sues-hotel-festival-organizer-bump-stock-maker-idUSKBN1CG2I0

OTTAWA (Reuters) - The number of job vacancies in Canada rose in the second quarter compared to the year before, with more openings seen broadly across regions and sectors, data from Statistics Canada showed on Thursday.

There were 460,000 jobs open in the second quarter, up 17.2 percent from the second quarter of last year. The job vacancy rate, which measures the share of unfilled jobs out of those available, rose to 2.9 percent from 2.5 percent.

A higher job vacancy rate often points to economic growth. Canada has seen robust job gains over the past year amid a strong economy that has prompted the Bank of Canada to raise interest rates twice in 2017 so far.

Job vacancies in the second quarter rose in nearly all the provinces, led by Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia, which have seen strong economic growth.

The number of job openings also rose in Alberta, which is recovering from the collapse in oil prices. The mining, quarrying and oil and gas sector saw some of the biggest increases in job vacancies, which is consistent with recent employment gains in the sector, the statistics agency said.

“DETRIT EM REBELIÃO”

- Única mulher vencedora do Oscar de direção (em 2008, por “Guerra ao Terror”), a norte-americana Kathryn Bigelow focaliza mais uma vez um período conturbado na história de seu país, ficcionalizando os distúrbios raciais em Detroit em 1967.

Buscando nova parceria com seu habitual roteirista, Mark Boal, ela reconstitui a violência que tomou conta de vários bairros negros da cidade depois da violenta repressão policial a uma festa particular, também recorrendo a algum material jornalístico da época.

O centro do filme é a dramática invasão do motel Algiers, onde policiais foram em busca de um suposto atirador. Ali dentro, estes policiais submeteram alguns homens negros e duas moças brancas a uma verdadeira noite de terror, da qual alguns não escapariam com vida.

“ENTRE IRMÃS”

- Parceiros no sucesso “2 Filhos de Francisco” (2005), o diretor Breno Silveira e a roteirista Patrícia Andrade renovam sua receita de melodrama familiar em “Entre Irmãs”.

Inspirado no romance “A Costureira e o Cangaceiro”, de Frances de Pontes Peebles e ambientado nos anos 1930, o drama retrata a vida das irmãs Luzia (Nanda Costa) e Emília (Marjorie Estiano).

Órfãs criadas por uma tia, Sofia (Cyria Coentro), as meninas são inseparáveis. Cresceram na pequenina Taquaritinga do Norte (PE), treinadas pela tia para se tornarem costureiras como ela. Apesar de sua ligação, as irmãs têm personalidades bem diferentes: Emília é romântica e espera a chegada de um príncipe encantado; amargurada por ter um braço paralisado desde a infância, Luzia é mais dura e não espera o amor.

Um dia, o bando do cangaceiro Carcará (Júlio Machado), chega a Taquaritinga, e decide levar Luzia consigo quando deixa a região. Emília e Sofia vestem luto, sem ter notícias de Luzia por um bom tempo. Enquanto isso, o sonho de Emília parece realizar-se quando um jovem do Recife, Degas (Rômulo Estrela), a pede em casamento.

“LOGAN LUCKY: ROUBO EM FAMÍLIA”

- O segundo filme a trazer a palavra “Logan” em seu título em 2017 é quase tão bom quanto o primeiro – embora numa chave completamente diferente. O roteiro assinado pela estreante Rebecca Blunt tirou Steven Soderbergh de sua suposta aposentadoria, levando-o de volta ao gênero que ele dominou tão bem com a série “11 Homens e um Segredo”: o filme de roubo.

A família Logan pode ser chamada de tudo, menos de sortuda. Clyde (Adam Driver) perdeu um braço no Iraque; Jimmy (Channing Tatum) conserta pias; e Mellie (Riley Keough) é uma cabeleireira. Um roubo poderia melhorar a vida do clã e, para ajudar, entra em cena um especialista em explosivos que está preso, Joe Bang (Daniel Craig).

O cenário é o mundo das corridas Nascar e dos concursos de beleza infantil. A partir disso, Soderbergh faz um retrato cômico e um tanto cínico dos EUA da era Trump. O diretor se mostra no melhor de sua forma, como há muito não era capaz de se encontrar.

“A MORTE TE DÁ PARABÉNS”

- O terceiro filme de 2017 a usar o conceito da boa e velha comédia “Feitiço do Tempo” é o mais divertido, mas também o mais problemático em suas explicações e resolução. O conceito é o mesmo de sempre: um dia-chave que se repete na vida da protagonista, Tree (Jessica Rothe) - esse é o dia do seu aniversário, e também será o da sua morte. Quando ela é assassinada, acorda na manhã seguinte e tudo acontece novamente mais ou menos igual.

Depois de estabelecer essa ideia, o filme explora as possibilidades e soluções. Tree é assassinada por alguém sempre portando uma máscara com o rosto de um bebê gordo e dentuço – símbolo de sua faculdade.

Dirigido por Christopher Landon, o longa brinca com as diversas alternativas – menos a de Tree arrancar a máscara e descobrir quem é o assassino - brinca tanto, a ponto de se tornar enfadonho e não saber muito bem o que fazer com o que inventou. E, com pequenas trapaças, modifica alguns elementos para justificar sua resolução.

“COMO SE TORNAR O PIOR ALUNO DA ESCOLA”

- Baseado no livro homônimo do comediante Danilo Gentili, “Como se tornar o pior aluno da escola” é uma comédia para quem consegue achar graça em cenas com urina, fezes, vômito, destruição de livros e pedofilia. Tudo isso no cardápio indigesto do filme dirigido pelo estreante Fabrício Bittar.

Os protagonistas são Bernardo (Bruno Munhoz) e Pedro (Daniel Pimentel), que, cansados de ser alunos aplicados, resolvem radicalizar quando encontram um antigo manual de pior aluno da escola escondido num banheiro. Eles chegam ao dono do caderno (Gentili), que, algumas décadas atrás, aterrorizou a escola.

O principal inimigo dos garotos é o diretor (Carlos Villagrán, o eterno Quico, do programa “Chaves”). Com ajuda do novo amigo, farão de tudo para acabar com a reputação do dirigente. Serem expulsos poderá ser um bônus, no final das contas.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Thursday pushed back against federal aid for Puerto Rico as the House of Representatives prepared to weigh $36.5 billion in emergency relief for the U.S. territory and other hurricane-hit areas as well as fire-ravaged California.

Lawmakers are expected to approve the bipartisan measure that will also provide relief to the storm-struck areas of Florida, Texas, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and leaders of both major parties have lauded the bill.

Trump, in several early Twitter posts, however, criticized Puerto Rico for ”a total lack of “accountability,” saying “electric and all infrastructure was disaster before hurricanes.”

While he noted it was up to “Congress to decide how much to spend,” he said: “We cannot keep FEMA, the Military & the First Responders, who have been amazing (under the most difficult circumstances) in P.R. forever!”

The content and timing of the comments, as the island struggles with the storm’s aftermath, prompted swift backlash from some Democratic lawmakers, who said such a move would amount to abandoning U.S. citizens.

“There is still devastation, Americans are still dying. FEMA needs to stay until the job is done,” Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer replied on Twitter.

Representatives for the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on what Trump meant by his tweets.

Republican U.S. Representative Scott Perry defended Trump’s statement, telling CNN federal assistance was meant to be finite and that it was “reasonable” for the island to eventually take up its own governance.

The bill includes $18.7 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s disaster relief fund. Of that amount, $4.9 billion is earmarked for loans to local governments to ensure that the cash-strapped Puerto Rico can keep government programs operating beyond Oct. 31.

Other funds include $576.5 million for the federal government’s wildfire control efforts. Some $16 billion would go toward the National Flood Insurance Program to help it cover claims after reaching its borrowing limit.

Once passed by the Republican-led House, the Senate, also controlled by Republicans, is expected to take up the package later this month after it returns from a week-long recess.

Republican and Democratic lawmakers, however, said more money would likely be needed later.

“These funds are vital right now, in the near term, to get the aid where it is needed most,” said House Appropriations Committee Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen, a Republican.

Democratic Representative Nydia Velázquez of New York, which has a large Puerto Rican community, said the relief package was “just the start” of federal aid to the island, where large areas remain without electricity or running water three weeks after Hurricane Maria made landfall.

Puerto Rico is burdened with nearly $72 billion in pre-hurricane debt being overseen by a federally created oversight board.

Velázquez said the funds earmarked for loans to local governments would assist Puerto Rico’s “liquidity crisis” and that steps must be taken to ensure that creditors are unable to access funds meant for disaster relief.","As US House weighs $36.5 billion disaster relief, Trump slams Puerto Rico",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-congress/as-us-house-weighs-36-5-billion-disaster-relief-trump-slams-puerto-rico-idUSKBN1CH1A7

That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ second annual ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science and invent new technologies.

REUTERS TOP 75

The most innovative university in the region, for the second year running, is South Korea’s KAIST. Formerly known as the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, it is the nation’s oldest research-oriented science and engineering university, with campuses in Daejeon, Seoul and Busan.

KAIST earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than 74 out of the 75 top-ranked universities in the region, and outside researchers frequently cite KAIST inventions in their own patents and research papers. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Asia Pacific’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

Recent KAIST research highlights include the development of a “parasite” robot that controls the movements of a living host: The device is mounted onto the shell of a turtle, and uses a combination of flashing lights and food rewards to direct the animal. The research could lead to hybrid animal-robot systems that would allow access to environments that would otherwise be difficult to reach on their own. In 2015 a university team collaborated with Rainbow Co, a company spun out of KAIST’s Humanoid Robot Research Center, to win the U.S. Department of Defense’s DARPA Robotics Challenge with an adaptable humanoid robot, DRC-HUBO.

The second most innovative university in the Asia Pacific region is also based in South Korea. Seoul National University was founded in 1946 as the country’s first national university, and now operates 16 colleges, one graduate school and 10 professional schools. In 2016 SNU received more than KRW 76 billion (about $68 million) in research funding from external industry, approximately 15 percent of its total funding.

South Korean universities typically have close relationships with industry. Fourth-place Pohang University of Science & Technology, or POSTECH, was actually founded by the South Korean steel company POSCO in 1986, and its 400-acre campus is located only a few minutes away from POSCO headquarters. POSTECH ranks first among all universities on the list in terms of the percentage of research articles it produces that include a co-author from industry, and the number of times its research papers are cited by articles originating in the private sector.

Overall, South Korean universities fill four of the top five spots on the ranking and eight of the top 20. There are 22 South Korean universities among the top 75, far more than you’d expect from a relatively small nation. Korea’s population is just under 51 million, so that’s one top-ranked university per 2.3 million people. In contrast, China has the most universities on the list – 25 between Hong Kong and the mainland – but it also has a massive population of more than 1.37 billion people, or one top-ranked university per 54.9 million people. (Japan has 19 ranked universities, Australia has five, Singapore has two, and New Zealand and India each have one.)

Some nations underperform on the ranking because of the way they organize their university systems. Despite boasting the world’s second-largest population (more than 1.26 billion) and one of its largest economies, only one Indian university appears in the top 75, The Indian Institutes of Technology (#71). IIT is a network of 23 universities which centralizes its patent administration, so it's not always possible to identify which constituent university was responsible for what research. As a result, Reuters ranked the entire system as opposed to individual universities. World-class campuses like IIT Delhi and IIT Bombay may have ranked much higher on the list if they weren’t grouped in with smaller and newer institutes like IIT Tirupati and IIT Palakkad.

And some countries are missing from the list entirely. There are no ranked universities in Indonesia, which contains Asia’s third largest population. Nor are there any universities in Pakistan or Bangladesh, the region’s fourth- and fifth-most populous countries, or any universities in the Philippines and Vietnam, two of the region’s largest economies.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included universities in East Asia, South Asia, and Oceania, and then ranked them based on their performance.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Asia’s Most Innovative Universities. Five universities that ranked in the top 75 last year slipped off the list in 2017: Japan’s Nihon University, the Indian Institute of Science – Bangalore, Putra University Malaysia, the University of South Australia, and Malaysia’s University of Malaya. These drop offs were all supplanted by fast-growing institutions in China and South Korea: the China University of Petroleum (#45), the University of Ulsan (#69), the University of Electronic Science & Technology of China (#70), Yeungnam University (#73), and Tongji University (#75).

The returning university that made the biggest move on the list was the University of Hong Kong, which climbed 26 spots from #56 to #30. That change is largely attributable to adjustments in Clarivate Analytics’ methodology: The university’s 2016 ranking did not account for patents that originated at HKU but were assigned to its commercialization arm, Versitech Limited, and the addition of those patents improves the university’s overall performance. Other big movers include China’s Huazhong University of Science & Technology (up 24 spots to #33) and the Beijing University of Chemical Technology (up 13 spots to #34). Japan's Okayama University (down 14 spots to #52) and Waseda University (down 18 to #66) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Overall, the ranking remained largely stable year over year, with eight of 2016’s top 10 universities returning to the top 10, and 18 of the top 20.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of the scope of its researchers’ work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 75 in the region: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

SAN FRANCISCO(Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Waymo sought at least $1 billion in damages and a public apology from Uber Technologies Inc as conditions for settling its high-profile trade secret lawsuit against the ride-services company, sources familiar with the proposal told Reuters.

The Waymo self-driving car unit also asked that an independent monitor be appointed to ensure Uber does not use Waymo technology in the future, the sources said.

Uber rejected those terms as non-starters, said the sources, who were not authorized to publicly discuss settlement talks. The precise dollar amount requested by Waymo and the exact time the offer was made could not be learned.

Waymo’s tough negotiating stance, which has not been previously reported, reflects the company’s confidence in its legal position after months of pretrial victories in a case which may help to determine who emerges in the forefront of the fast-growing field of self-driving cars.

The aggressive settlement demands also suggest that Waymo is not in a hurry to resolve the lawsuit, in part because of its value as a distraction for Uber leadership, said Elizabeth Rowe, a trade secret expert at the University of Florida Levin College of Law.

Waymo recently persuaded a San Francisco federal judge to delay a trial to decide the dispute from October to early December, citing the need to investigate evidence Uber had not disclosed earlier.

No further settlement talks are currently scheduled, the sources said. The judge overseeing the case mandated that the companies enter mediation with a court-appointed magistrate.

Amy Candido, a Waymo attorney, declined to comment on any settlement talks, but said the company’s reasons for suing Uber are “pretty clear.”

“Waymo had one goal: to stop Uber from using its trade secrets,” she said. “That remains its goal.”

An Uber spokesperson declined to comment.

DISRUPTIVE

Waymo sued Uber in February, claiming that former engineer Anthony Levandowski downloaded more than 14,000 confidential files before leaving to set up a self-driving truck company, called Otto, which Uber acquired soon after.

Uber denied using any of Waymo’s trade secrets.

Waymo’s lawsuit has been disruptive for Uber. U.S. District Judge William Alsup granted Waymo’s request for a pretrial injunction in May, which prohibited Levandowski from working on Lidar, a key sensor technology for self-driving cars that is the crux of the current litigation.

Uber later fired Levandowski, regarded as a visionary in autonomous technology, after he refused to return Waymo documents at the heart of the case. Levandowski has asserted his constitutional right against self-incrimination and declined to answer questions from Waymo lawyers.

Meanwhile, Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick stepped down as chief executive in June after allegations of widespread misconduct at the company became public. Kalanick has since become embroiled in a boardroom fight with fellow Uber investor Benchmark Capital.

Benchmark cited Waymo’s allegations of trade secret theft in separate litigation aimed at forcing Kalanick off Uber’s board. A Delaware judge put that lawsuit on hold and sent it to private arbitration.

On Sunday Oct. 1, the day before Kalanick was scheduled to give a deposition in the Waymo case, Kalanick’s lawyers called Waymo and asked to postpone the deposition, lawyers for both companies said in court last week.

Kalanick’s lawyers said he was in the middle of a fight to appoint new board members and was therefore too busy, Waymo attorneys said in court. Waymo refused the request, forcing Kalanick to attend the deposition.

DISTRACTING A COMPETITOR

Causing such distractions for a competitor are a clear benefit to Waymo, Rowe said. Uber has hired three law firms to litigate the case and devoted thousands of hours to probe Uber servers for Waymo confidential information.

“I‘m counting all those as good reasons to keep the lawsuit going,” Rowe said.

Waymo has estimated damages in the case at about $1.9 billion, according to court filings, which Uber disputes. Despite that figure and the big settlement demands, Waymo views winning a permanent injunction against Uber using any Waymo intellectual property as the main priority, another source familiar with the company’s thinking said.

Much of the technical evidence in the case has been filed under seal, making it impossible for outside observers to independently assess the strength of each side’s arguments. In court last week, Alsup said Uber’s product was “dissimilar” from Waymo‘s.

Even if a jury finds that Uber stole Waymo trade secrets, Uber says in court filings that its engineers have designed around the Waymo technology at issue in the case. If that is true, that would lessen the impact on Uber in the event of a defeat in court.

Waymo is skeptical of Uber’s claim, however. In a court filing on Monday, it requested an order forcing Uber to disclose its source code, or underlying software, for its Lidar products.

The Alphabet subsidiary said in the filing that it recently learned that former employees took Waymo source code when they went to work at Uber, “including software related to the ‘brains’ of the vehicle that determines how the car moves.”",Exclusive: Alphabet's Waymo demanded $1 billion in settlement talks with Uber - sources,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-uber-lawsuit/exclusive-alphabets-waymo-demanded-1-billion-in-settlement-talks-with-uber-sources-idUSKBN1CH0QC?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin smashed through the $5,000 barrier for the first time on Thursday, jumping as much as 8 percent on the day as investors shrugged off the latest warnings on the risks of buying into the booming cryptocurrency market.

Bitcoin, the biggest and best-known cryptocurrency, has chalked up a more than fivefold increase in price this year.

Typically for bitcoin, which at less than nine years old is still highly volatile and illiquid compared with traditional currencies and assets, the precise reason for its recent tear was unclear.

Upcoming splits in its software, reports that Goldman Sachs is considering offering bitcoin trading, rumors that China could ease restrictions, and even a political crisis in Spain’s Catalonia region were all cited by market-watchers as reasons for the rally.

But the main factor could simply be demand from investors wanting ‘in’ on a market that has provided gains exceeding those of any other currency in every year bar one since 2010.

“People are just wanting to be part of it,” said Ryan Nettles, head of FX trading and market strategy at Swiss bank Swissquote, which launched bitcoin trading two months ago. Nettles said interest had been much higher than anticipated and has come from banks, hedge funds and brokers.

“The interest really stems from the media hype,” he added.

On Wednesday Russian President Vladimir Putin warned of the “serious risks” surrounding the nascent market, while Russia’s central bank said it would ban cryptocurrency trading websites.

But that was not enough to put investors off, with bitcoin rallying around 10 percent since then.

Data released last week from SEMrush, a search engine data analytics firm, found the price had a 91 percent correlation with Google searches on bitcoin, suggesting that all news -- whether negative or positive -- drives up demand, even if bad news can have a temporary negative effect.

Bitcoin almost reached $5,000 at the start of September, but fell back sharply after the head of Goldman Sachs blasted the cryptocurrency as a “fraud” and as China forced exchanges to close down, sparking fears of a broader crackdown.

But after dipping below $3,000 in mid-September, bitcoin has leapt in value by more than 75 percent in four weeks.

“Bitcoin was designed to operate outside of the influence of governments and central banks, and is doing exactly that,” said Iqbal Gandham, Managing Director at retail trading app eToro, which has seen huge increases in cryptocurrency trading volumes.

CRYPTO-RIVALS ALSO RALLY

By 1245 GMT, bitcoin was trading up 8 percent on the day around $5,200 on Luxembourg-based exchange Bitstamp.

Though there have been many warnings about a bitcoin “bubble”, including from European Central Bank Deputy Governor Vitor Constancio, some say it has much further to climb. But determining its value is difficult.

“For most currencies there are several accepted methodologies for estimating relative value, normally based on macroeconomic fundamentals,” said EFG Asset Management’s Global Head of Research, Daniel Murray. “For bitcoin no such fundamentals exist.”

Other cryptocurrencies -- whose prices tend to be highly correlated to bitcoin -- also rallied. Their total value -- or market capitalization -- climbed above $160 billion for the first time since early September, according to industry website Coinmarketcap.com.

Two upcoming “forks” in the bitcoin software code, which will create rival clones of the cryptocurrency, were seen by some as a reason for the rise in price, which saw a boost after the “Bitcoin Cash” clone was created at the start of August.

“Investors are seeing the lessons of history in the up-and-coming forks and hoping for an extra dividend,” said Charles Hayter, co-founder of data analysis website Cryptocompare, adding that rumors on online forums that China could reopen exchanges could also be affecting the price.","Bitcoin rockets above $5,000 to all-time high",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-markets-bitcoin/bitcoin-rockets-above-5000-to-all-time-high-idUSKBN1CH0YQ

“The uncertainty that the (election) result brings means that you have a degree of the risk premia re-establishing itself,” said Barclays strategist Hamish Pepper.","LONDON (Reuters) - Last week’s shocking British election result and the period of political uncertainty that looks set to follow may have come at the worst of times for the country’s economy and the value of the pound sterling.

Until 10 p.m. London time last Thursday, Prime Minister Theresa May’s decision to call the snap poll did not look like a pivotal point for the most-sold major currency of last year.

Sterling lost almost a fifth of its value between June 2016, when Britons voted to leave the European Union, and November. Many had begun to assume that would be the full extent of the “Brexit discount” demanded by overseas investors to keep faith with the world’s fifth-largest economy.

But May’s loss of her majority drove a 2 percent fall in the pound on Friday and another 1 percent on Monday, and traders now say the election could prove another turning point for sterling.

After the biggest-ever move in favor of the pound in the four weeks to mid-May, market positioning has reversed.

For many strategists, the election result not only makes the likely shape of Brexit even more uncertain, it also creates a political hiatus that risks the sort of sudden stop to economic activity that many feared would follow last year’s referendum.

“Markets are still trying to work out what the new risk premium is for sterling,” says James Binny, head of currencies at U.S. financial group State Street Global Advisors in London.

“If the Conservatives back a softer Brexit, sterling would seem to want to go up. But if it became much clearer that things were heading downhill from a growth perspective, then that might create a bigger move down.”

VICIOUS CYCLE

Markets now assume May’s failure to secure her party a majority will lead to a softening of the government’s Brexit stance to give greater priority to a close trading relationship with the EU.

But there’s little confidence that the planned loose support agreement with Northern Irish Unionists can keep her minority Conservative government afloat for long, or whether May herself can cling on as premier for the two years of divorce talks.

Anxiety that Britain’s economy may be entering a downward spiral was already growing before the election.

Sterling’s weakness in the wake of the Brexit vote has driven inflation above the Bank of England’s target at a time when household wages and overall growth are not keeping pace, as data on Wednesday underlined.

But high and increasingly static housing costs that eat into the pay packets of young Britons without feeding optimism among their older neighbors mean the Bank of England is forced to ignore rising prices and keep credit conditions ultra-loose.

The combination of high inflation and cheap money then just undermines the pound further.

That presents a stark contrast with the euro zone, now on its best economic run for a decade, and leaves sterling looking most exposed against the euro.

Some airport exchange bureaus are already offering holidaymakers less than a euro per pound and the options markets companies use to insure against currency moves have flipped from positive on sterling in mid-April to universally negative. EURGBPVOL=

“The fundamentals still are not positive, they are negative,” said Josh O‘Byrne, a currency strategist with Citi, the world’s single biggest currency trader, in London.

”We have this cyclical underperformance. We have this political divergence where the UK is looking less stable, Europe looks more so.

“And also the positioning does not favor sterling. People are taking another look but waiting for more clarity.”

Barclays, which was positive on the pound before last week, has put its forecasts on review and is likely to cut them.

“The uncertainty that the (election) result brings means that you have a degree of the risk premia re-establishing itself,” said Barclays strategist Hamish Pepper. “The currency is vulnerable to that in the near term.”

Much will depend on how fiscal and monetary policies mesh over the next year, and some hedge funds and other major speculative investors are already wondering if more quantitative easing (QE) asset purchases from the BoE will be in the mix.

That would further loosen monetary policy and probably prove negative for sterling, although it would provide a backstop bid for British government bonds, known as gilts.

Ed Al-Hussainy, senior interest rate and currency analyst at Columbia Threadneedle, which manages $467 billion of assets, said ordinarily investors would sell gilts and demand higher interest rates to hold them, pressuring public finances.

”But here’s the twist: we have an opportunity for the Bank to restart QE,“ he said. ”The threshold for that is still very high -- we need to see a much greater deterioration.

“But in that scenario it is not clear that rates will go up.”","Hard or soft Brexit aside, pound nervous of economic slowdown",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-markets-sterling-analysis/hard-or-soft-brexit-aside-pound-nervous-of-economic-slowdown-idUSKBN19528B

Sin embargo, Barnier dijo en conferencia de prensa que había movimientos en torno a otros elementos del acuerdo de divorcio británico y habló de la posibilidad de acceder en los dos próximos meses a las demandas británicas de negociar un pacto comercial y un periodo de transición tras la salida de Reino unido de la UE en marzo de 2019 -- si hay voluntad política.

El secretario británico para el Brexit, David Davis, dijo que su país aún seguía presionando para que los líderes de la UE dieran luz verde a las conversaciones sobre la relación futura cuando la primera ministra Theresa May acuda a una cumbre de la UE en Bruselas el próximo jueves.

Barnier dejó claro que pese al nuevo ritmo imprimido a las conversaciones tras un discurso de May en septiembre, la posición británica sobre el dinero, los derechos de los ciudadanos expatriados y la frontera con Irlanda seguían sin “avances significativos”, que eran una condición para abrir las negociaciones sobre el comercio.

May dijo que Reino Unido aseguraría que los otros 27 países no salieran perdiendo financieramente por el Brexit en el actual periodo presupuestario de la UE hasta 2020 y cumpliría sus compromisos, pero Barnier dijo que Londres no logró siquiera decir lo que estaba dispuesto a pagar.

“Sobre esa cuestión estamos en un ‘impasse’, que es muy preocupante para miles de proyectos en toda Europa y para quienes contribuyen”, dijo.

“Sigo convencido de que, con voluntad política, está al alcance un avance decisivo en los próximos dos meses. Con David Davis organizaremos varias reuniones entre ahora y finales de año”, dijo.

Sobre las conversaciones en general esta semana, que incluyó algunos avances en los derechos de los ciudadanos y progresos técnicos sobre Irlanda, Barnier añadió: “Hemos trabajado con espíritu constructivo y hemos aclarado ciertos puntos, pero no hemos dado grandes pasos hacia adelante”.

Davis, reconoció que faltaba mucho trabajo por hacer, pero dijo que confiaba en que podría llegar pronto un acuerdo sobre los derechos de los ciudadanos. Barnier reiteró el deseo de Bruselas de ver que los ciudadanos de la UE en Reino Unido puedan recurrir a los jueces de la UE, pero Londres ha rechazado aceptarlo.

“No es un secreto el hecho de que debemos hablar sobre el futuro para dar certidumbre”, dijo Davis. “Espero que los líderes de los 27 den a Michel medios para explorar vías sobre eso”, añadió.

Berlin (Reuters) - Die Lufthansa setzt zum Höhenflug an: Mit der Übernahme großer Teile der insolventen Konkurrentin Air Berlin baut die Kranich-Linie ihre Marktführerschaft in Deutschland weiter aus.

Im Tagesverlauf sollten die Verträge unterzeichnet werden, kündigte Lufthansa-Chef Carsten Spohr am Donnerstag in Berlin an. “Wir werden heute einen echten Meilenstein sehen in der Geschichte Lufthansa und Berlin.” Schließlich sei die Lufthansa 1926 in Berlin gegründet worden. Und Spohr hat schon das nächste Ziel vor Augen. Sollte es einen Neustart bei der ebenfalls Pleite gegangenen Alitalia geben, wäre die Lufthansa an Gesprächen interessiert, sagte Spohr zu Reuters.

Börsianer jubelten. Die Lufthansa-Aktie kletterte auf den höchsten Stand seit fast 17 Jahren. Mit einem Plus von drei Prozent auf 25,34 Euro war das Papier größter Dax-Gewinner. Die Investmentbanken Bernstein und HSBC halten sogar einen Anstieg auf bis zu 30 Euro für möglich. “Der Air-Berlin-Deal macht die Lufthansa in ihrem Heimatmarkt stärker, was in den kommenden Jahren zu steigenden Erträgen führen sollte”, schrieben die HSBC-Analysten.

Die schon länger dahinsiechende Air Berlin ist seit Mitte August pleite. Wochenlang hatte Spohr hinter den Kulissen intensiv verhandelt. Nun steht fest: Die Lufthansa will mit den 81 der zuletzt gut 130 Flugzeuge der Air-Berlin-Flotte ihre Billigtochter Eurowings ausbauen, um sie für den Wettbewerb mit der irischen Ryanair und der britischen EasyJet zu stärken. Ryanair-Chef Michael O‘Leary schimpfte sehr früh im Verkaufsprozess, Lufthansa und die Bundesregierung hätten ein abgekartetes Spiel betrieben. Auch unterlegene Interessenten wie der Luftfahrt-Unternehmer Hans Rudolf Wöhrl kritisierten, die Lufthansa werde zu einem Monopolisten im Heimatmarkt.

Ob der Kauf den Wettbewerb beschneidet, hat nach der Vertragsunterschrift die EU-Kommission zu prüfen. Spohr setzt darauf, dass die Behörde bis Jahresende grünes Licht gibt. Erst dann können die Maschinen den Besitzer wechseln. Kartellamtspräsident Andreas Mundt kündigte bereits an, dass die Wettbewerbshüter alles sorgfältig unter die Lupe nehmen würden. “Die Europäische Kommission wird sich das sehr genau ansehen”, sagte Mundt der “Rheinischen Post” (Freitagausgabe). “Wir werden das dortige Verfahren begleiten.”

Die Kranich-Airline würde neben dem Kaufpreis, der Insidern zufolge bei rund 200 Millionen Euro liegt, noch 100 Millionen Euro vorschießen, um den Flugbetrieb aufrecht zu erhalten.

WAS PASSIERT MIT DEM REST?

Air Berlin verhandelte neben der Lufthansa auch mit EasyJet über einen Teilverkauf. Spohr geht nach eigenen Worten aber nicht davon aus, dass es zeitnah weitere Abschlüsse gibt. EasyJet lehnte einen Kommentar dazu ab. Die Briten waren an rund 30 Flugzeugen interessiert, zögerten zuletzt aber. Sollte sich EasyJet zurückziehen, könnten die Thomas Cook-Tochter Condor oder andere Interessenten wieder ins Spiel kommen. Die Zeit drängt allerdings, weil Air Berlin zum Schutz der Gläubiger bis zum 28. Oktober den Flugbetrieb mit dem Teil der Flotte einstellen muss, der nicht zur Lufthansa wechselt. Zu den Gläubigern, die vorrangig bedient werden müssen, gehört die Bundesregierung mit ihrer Kreditlinie von 150 Millionen Euro.

Air Berlin war vor rund 40 Jahren gegründet worden. Dem Unternehmen wurde ein zu rasanter Expansionskurs zum Verhängnis. Zuletzt hielten nur noch Finanzspritzen vom Großaktionär Etihad die Flieger in der Luft.

Von den gut 8000 Mitarbeitern hat ein großer Teil der Piloten und Flugbegleiter nun gute Chancen, bei der Lufthansa unterzukommen. Die rund 1700 Beschäftigten des Ferienfliegers Niki und der Regionalfluggesellschaft LGW, die Teil des Pakets sind, können fest mit einer Übernahme rechnen. Die restlichen rund 1500 Crewmitglieder können sich schon seit einigen Wochen auf Stellenangebote bei Eurowings bewerben.

The wealthy region’s intention to break away has plunged Spain into its worst political crisis since an attempted military coup in 1981, with Madrid threatening to sack the Catalan government if it goes ahead.

On Thursday, a military parade to mark the anniversary of explorer Christopher Columbus’s arrival in the Americas on behalf of the Spanish crown took place in a city already festooned with flags hung by Spaniards in a display of unity.

Tension remains high between the central government and Catalonia after the region’s leader signed a symbolic declaration of independence on Tuesday, citing the results of an Oct. 1 referendum which had been declared illegal by Madrid.

Catalan government chief Carles Puigdemont had stopped short of moving a motion of independence in the regional parliament, disappointing many of his own supporters.

Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has given Puigdemont eight days to drop his push for independence or face the suspension of its political autonomy.

Related Coverage China offers support to Spanish government amid Catalonia crisis

If Puigdemont does not respond in time or confirms a will to secede, Rajoy can turn to article 155 of the 1978 constitution which allows him to sack the regional government.

“Ask for dialogue and they answer you by putting the 155 on the table. Understood,” Puigdemont tweeted late on Wednesday.

Uncertainty remains over what article 155, which has never been invoked before, would mean in practice.

“I can’t tell you exactly what the measures are,” Foreign Minister Alfonso Dastis told France’s CNews TV channel.

“Article 155 is... quite large. It can be fine-tuned, and that’s certainly what the government will do, acting prudently as it has been,” Dastis said.

Political analysts expect Rajoy’s next step would be to call a snap regional election to plot a path out of the crisis.

People were also expected to gather on Thursday at Plaza Catalonia in central Barcelona, the Catalan capital.

In Barcelona last weekend, crowds waved Spanish and Catalan flags, describing themselves as the “silent majority” opposed to independence.

Puigdemont said 90 percent of voters in the referendum backed secession, but turn-out was only 43 percent. Polls conducted beforehand had suggested around 40 percent of residents in Catalonia backed independence.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader, said on Thursday a landmark arms control treaty that helped end the Cold War was in peril and called for a summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin to save it.

Gorbachev, 86, said U.S.-Russia relations were in the throes of a “severe crisis” and that the treaty, which banned all Soviet and American short and intermediate-range land-based nuclear and conventional missiles, was now at serious risk.

Gorbachev signed the pact - the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty - in 1987 along with then U.S. President Ronald Reagan in Washington. Russia, after the 1991 Soviet collapse, took on its obligations.

Both sides have accused each other of violating the treaty in recent months however, stoking fears it might break down as U.S.-Russia ties continue to deteriorate amid allegations that Moscow interfered with the 2016 U.S. presidential election, something Russia flatly denies.

Gorbachev, writing in government newspaper Rossiiskaya Gazeta, said the INF treaty was in danger and that Trump and Putin needed to meet and discuss the problems of nuclear disarmament and strategic stability.

“It has turned out to be the most vulnerable link in the system of limiting and reducing weapons of mass destruction,” Gorbachev wrote of the landmark treaty.

“If the system of curbing nuclear arms crumbles, and that is exactly what the collapse of the INF treaty can lead to, the consequences will be catastrophic.”

The INF treaty required the United States and the Soviet Union to eliminate and forego all nuclear ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with a range of 500 to 5,500 Km, eliminating an entire category of weapon.

Appealing to Trump and Putin, Gorbachev said he wanted to see a “fully-fledged” U.S.-Russia summit of the kind he took part in toward the end of the Cold War.

“It’s totally abnormal for the presidents of nuclear powers to meet somewhere ‘on the sidelines’ (of an event) and that they have only met once,” Gorbachev wrote, referring to a meeting between Trump and Putin at the G-20 summit in Germany in July.

“If the INF treaty could be saved, it would be a powerful signal for the whole world that the biggest nuclear powers understand their responsibility and take their obligations seriously,” wrote Gorbachev.","Gorbachev, last Soviet leader, wants Trump-Putin summit to save arms pact",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-russia-usa-gorbachev/gorbachev-last-soviet-leader-wants-trump-putin-summit-to-save-arms-pact-idUKKBN1CH1E8

PARIS (Reuters) - The United States announced on Thursday it was withdrawing from UNESCO, the U.N.’s cultural and educational agency, complaining about how it is run and about what Washington described as bias against Israel.

“This decision was not taken lightly, and reflects U.S. concerns with mounting arrears at UNESCO, the need for fundamental reform in the organization, and continuing anti-Israel bias,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement.

The withdrawal of the United States, which provides a fifth of UNESCO’s funding, is a severe blow for the Paris-based organization which began work in 1946 and is known for designating World Heritage sites such as the ancient city of Palmyra in Syria and the Grand Canyon National Park.

Under UNESCO rules, the withdrawal will become effective as of the end of December 2018. Until that time, the United States, which provides around $80 million to UNESCO annually, will remain a full member.

The organization, which employs around 2,000 people worldwide, most of them based in Paris, has long been the object of criticism over its use of resources and resolutions that have been perceived by Israel and other countries as biased.

Director-General Irina Bokova expressed disappointment at the U.S. decision.

“At the time when conflicts continue to tear apart societies across the world, it is deeply regrettable for the United States to withdraw from the United Nations agency promoting education for peace and protecting culture under attack,” she said.

“This is a loss to the United Nations family. This is a loss for multilateralism.”

UNESCO is in the process of selecting a new chief, whose priority will be to revive its fortunes.

The U.S. move underscores the scepticism expressed by President Donald Trump about the need for the United States to remain engaged in multi-lateral bodies. The president has touted an “America First” policy, which puts U.S. economic and nationalist interests ahead of international commitments.

Since Trump took office, the United States has abandoned the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade talks, withdrawn from the Paris climate deal and opened up a renegotiation of a decades old trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, NAFTA. Trump has also called NATO obsolete, though he has since backtracked on that.

Diplomats expressed concern about the loss of U.S. engagement.

“The absence of the United States or any large country with a lot of power is a loss. It’s not just about money, it’s promoting ideals that are vital to countries like the United States, such as education and culture,” a UNESCO-based diplomat said.

For differing reasons, Britain, Japan and Brazil are among states that have yet to pay their dues for 2017.

After three days of secret balloting that could run until Friday, Qatar’s Hamad bin Abdulaziz al-Kawari and France’s Audrey Azoulay are tied to win the top post at the organization, with Egyptian hopeful Moushira Khattab in third. Two other candidates trail.

SOFIA (Reuters) - Couples lining up to face each other are given 30 seconds to chat before moving on - in a version of speed dating that, rather than sparking romance, aims to promote understanding and integration for new immigrants.

At a social center in the Bulgarian capital Sofia, the locals stand on one side, the immigrants - many refugees from Syria, Afghanistan and other war-torn countries - face them.

The quick-fire conversations - in which participants have just seconds to share their dreams and stories of love, pain and family - are aimed at starting a dialogue between two communities that in normal daily life rarely speak to each other on an equal footing.

“It’s so good to have an event like this, especially for refugees,” said Rodi Naamo, a 26-year-old Syrian Kurd who arrived in Bulgaria in 2015, when hundreds of thousands of migrants passed through the Balkans en route to Germany and northern Europe.

Bulgarians also appreciated the speedy encounters, as well as the Middle Eastern food and traditional Afghan dances afterwards.

“I really enjoyed it, it helped me overcome prejudices,” said Milka Bocheva, a Bulgarian who runs an online business. “They (the refugees) are just people like us, we gave such similar answers.”

Bulgaria stands out in the region for its significant Muslim minority, some 12 percent among 7.1 million mainly Orthodox Christians - a legacy of its history as part of the Ottoman Empire.

BlackBerry, which holds about 40,000 worldwide patents and applications, has been long been focusing on software sales and licensing after its once-popular phones lost out to Apple and others in the smartphone industry.","BlackBerry signs license deal with Florida's BLU, ends patent dispute",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blackberry-patents/blackberry-signs-license-deal-with-floridas-blu-ends-patent-dispute-idUSKBN1CH1GE

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Thursday morning, dragged down by media companies, while results from JPMorgan and Citigroup failed to fuel the optimism that has driven indexes to record highs.

JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Citigroup (C.N), which had already talked down third-quarter expectations, reported earnings that were better than Wall Street estimates even as trading revenues fell. The shares of both companies were little changed.

“After a long stretch of consecutive highs in the market, with earnings, even if they are slightly disappointing, or an even an aspect of earnings like bond trading at JPM, is more an excuse to selloff,” said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist for Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.

With the S&P 500 up about 14 percent in 2017, investors are betting on strong earnings growth across the S&P 500.

AT&T (T.N) tumbled 3.22 percent after the company said its third-quarter results took a hit from the string of hurricanes.

The company also said it lost video subscribers in the quarter. Brokerage Guggenheim downgraded Disney (DIS.N) and Viacom (VIAB.O) on worries over subscriber declines

That sparked fresh jitters in a sector that was hit a day earlier by President Donald Trump’s suggestion to challenge TV network licenses over ‘fake news’.

Comcast (CMCSA.O) fell 2.8 percent, Disney (DIS.N) fell 1 percent. Viacom sank 6.6 percent after warning that Charter Communications subscribers may lose access to its channels as the expiration looms for a distribution deal.

Clemons said earnings will probably heighten volatility, with lack of any other major developments to drive the market.

At 9:37 a.m. ET (1337 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was down 38.19 points, or 0.17 percent, at 22,834.7, the S&P 500 .SPX was down 4.38 points, or 0.17 percent, at 2,550.86 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was down 7.33 points, or 0.11 percent, at 6,596.22.

Ten of the 11 major S&P indexes were lower, led by a more than 2 percent fall in the telecom services index .SPLRCL due to AT&T’s declines.

The biggest drag, however, was from the consumer discretionary sector .SPLRCD, which fell 0.57 percent, weighed down by media stocks.

Energy stocks also fell, dragged down by a more than 1 percent drop in crude oil prices as U.S. fuel inventories rose despite efforts by OPEC to cut production.

General Motors (GM.N) fell 1.5 percent. The Wall Street Journal reported GM planned to cut production at a Detroit plant and lay off about 1,500 workers.

WARSAW (Reuters) - South Korea’s LG Chem will open Europe’s largest lithium-ion battery factory in Poland next year as the region’s auto industry gears up to mass produce electric cars.

Tumbling battery prices and growing pressure to cut exhaust emissions have led carmakers to embrace electric vehicles. Manufacturers from VW Group (VOWG_p.DE) to Volvo Cars, Daimler and BMW plan to roll out a raft of new electric models in coming years.

But Europe lacks big-scale battery cell production facilities so those components are mostly imported from China and South Korea.

Calls are now growing for the region to develop its own battery industry to preserve jobs and profits, though Asian producers have a huge head start in development and scale.

LG Chem plans to spend 5.9 billion zlotys ($1.63 billion) on the factory near the southwestern city of Wroclaw, according to Polish state industry agency ARP.

Wroclaw is 190 kilometers (118 miles) from the border with Germany, home of VW Group which plans to invest more than 20 billion euros ($24 billion) in zero-emission vehicles by 2030 and make 3 million electric vehicles (EVs) a year by 2025.

LG Chem expects to produce up to 100,000 EV batteries in Poland annually from next year, it said on Thursday in a statement.

The factory will employ 2,500 people. LG Chem, a subsidiary of Korea’s LG Corp, did not name the likely customers but said they would include top car companies.

“The company has chosen Poland as the most competitive location for production to satisfy the needs of European and global car producers,” said Chang-Beom Kang, vice president at LG Chem.

It was not immediately clear if the factory would produce all the basic battery cells from scratch or import some components, but the statement said the site would include a research and development center employing “about 400 engineers from various specializations: automation, electronics, chemistry and IT”.

Asked about the source of lithium and other raw materials, a representative of LG Chem’s local arm said they would first be imported from the parent company in Korea and then hopefully from Polish suppliers.

DEMAND SURGE

The factory’s planned capacity is just a fraction of expected future demand.

Based on the typical capacity of a mid-market compact car like Nissan Leaf, 100,000 car batteries are equivalent to 4 GWh per year. This means the factory’s capacity could be slightly more than 10 percent of the production capacity that Tesla’s U.S. based “Gigafactory” is to reach in 2018.

Battery costs have been prohibitive but are falling rapidly. Average battery costs have come down from over $1,000 per kilowatt hour in 2010, to around $227 in 2016, according to analysts at Barclays.

In 2016, only 0.2 percent of new passenger cars sold in Europe were fully electric.

But Britain and France say they will ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2040 in an attempt to reduce air pollution, ending use of the fossil fuel-guzzling internal combustion engine.

LG’s Polish plant may not remain Europe’s largest car battery plant for long.

In September, Swiss engineering group ABB said it had joined a project to build Europe’s largest lithium-ion battery factory in Sweden targeting annual cell production equivalent to 32 gigawatt-hours by 2023, over 90 percent of Tesla’s Gigafactory target.

That project, named Northvolt, is led by a former manager at Tesla, which also plans to build a Gigafactory in Europe, though it has not said where.",LG to open Europe's biggest car battery factory next year,https://www.reuters.com/article/lgchem-factory-poland/lg-to-open-europes-biggest-car-battery-factory-next-year-idINKBN1CH21S?il=0

By Blanca Rodríguez and Sonya Dowsett

MADRID/BARCELONA (Reuters) - Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy on Wednesday gave the Catalan government eight days to drop an independence bid, failing which he would suspend Catalonia’s political autonomy and rule the region directly.

His move could deepen the confrontation between Madrid and the northeastern region but also signals a way out of Spain’s biggest political crisis since a failed military coup in 1981.

Rajoy would probably call a snap regional election after activating Article 155 of the constitution that would allow him to sack the Catalan regional government.

Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont issued a symbolic declaration of independence from Spain on Tuesday night but then immediately suspended it and called for negotiations with the Madrid government.

“The cabinet has agreed this morning to formally request the Catalan government to confirm whether it has declared the independence of Catalonia, regardless of the deliberate confusion created over its implementation,” Rajoy said in a televised address after a cabinet meeting called to consider the government’s response.

He later told Spain’s parliament the Catalan government had until Monday, Oct. 16 at 0800 GMT to answer. If Puigdemont was to confirm he did declare independence, he would be given an additional three days to rectify it, until Thursday, Oct. 19 at 0800 GMT. Failing this, Article 155 would be triggered.

It is not yet clear if the Catalan government will answer the requirement but it now faces a conundrum, analysts say.

If Puigdemont says he did proclaim independence, the central government will step in. If he says he did not declare it, then far-left party CUP would probably withdraw its support for his minority government.

“Rajoy has two objectives: if Puigdemont remains ambiguous, the pro-independence movement will get more fragmented; if Puigdemont insists on defending independence then Rajoy will be able to apply Article 155,” said Antonio Barroso, deputy director of the London-based research firm Teneo Intelligence.

“Either way, Rajoy’s aim would be to first restore the rule of law in Catalonia and this could at some point lead to early elections in the region.”

The stakes are high - losing Catalonia, which has its own language and culture, would deprive Spain of a fifth of its economic output and more than a quarter of exports.

CALL FOR DIALOGUE DISMISSED

Puigdemont had been widely expected to unilaterally declare Catalonia’s independence on Tuesday after the Catalan government said 90 percent of Catalans had voted for a breakaway in an Oct. 1 referendum. Central authorities in Madrid had declared the referendum illegal and most opponents of independence boycotted it, reducing turnout to around 43 percent.

Madrid responded angrily to Puigdemont’s speech to Catalonia’s parliament, saying his government could not act on the results of the referendum.

“Neither Mr. Puigdemont nor anyone else can claim, without returning to legality and democracy, to impose mediation... Dialogue between democrats takes place within the law,” Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria said.

Invoking Article 155 to ease Spain’s worst political crisis in four decades would make prospects of a negotiated solution even more remote.

A spokesman for the Catalan government in Barcelona said earlier on Wednesday that if Madrid went down this road, it would press ahead with steps towards statehood.

“We have given up absolutely nothing...We have taken a time out...which doesn’t mean a step backwards, or a renunciation or anything like that,” Catalan government spokesman Jordi Turull told Catalunya Radio.

Spanish Socialist opposition leader Pedro Sanchez said he would back Rajoy if he had to activate Article 155 and that he agreed with the premier to launch constitutional reform within six months to address how Catalonia could fit better in Spain.

It was not clear how the Catalan government would respond to that offer.

MARKET RELIEF

Puigdemont’s speech also disappointed supporters of independence, thousands of whom watched proceedings on giant screens outside parliament before sadly leaving for home.

Financial markets, however, were encouraged that an immediate declaration of independence had been avoided.

After Puigdemont’s speech, Spain’s benchmark IBEX share index rose as much as 1.6 percent, outperforming the pan-European STOXX 600 index. The rally propelled the main world stocks index, the MSCI’s 47-country ‘All-World’ index, to a record high.

Spain’s 10-year government bond yield - which moves inversely to the price - dropped 5 basis points to 1.65 percent in early trade, according to Tradeweb data.

At European Union headquarters in Brussels, there was relief that Spain, the euro zone’s fourth-largest economy, now had at least bought some time to deal with a crisis that was still far from over.

One EU official said Puigdemont “seems to have listened to advice not to do something irreversible”. The EU has been cool to Puigdemont’s calls for European mediation.

The Catalan crisis has deeply divided the region itself as well as the Spanish nation. Opinion polls conducted before the vote suggested a minority of about 40 percent of residents in Catalonia backed independence.

If there’s been one common thread running through almost every industry in the last decade, it has been how a handful of tech firms have revolutionized how the world does business. There’s Google for accessing information; Twitter for sharing opinion and news; Facebook for interacting with friends; Amazon for shopping, AirBnB for places to stay and Uber for getting around.

Until relatively recently, most consumers and governments took this as a positive trend. While there were disputes over individual and limited issues – not least the companies’ unwillingness to pay tax or comply with requests from local regulators – they usually were seen as good for the economy and job opportunities. With their slick lobbying and PR operations, the tech entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley were courted by politicians and civil society alike.

That is changing. The decision by London authorities to strip Uber of its license to operate in the British capital is part of a wider backlash in a rapidly escalating war between governments and the tech firms they believe have become too powerful and contemptuous of rules and democratic authority. Uber and its biggest rival Lyft were ejected from the Texas capital of Austin last year for refusing to fingerprint their drivers. In 2013 in San Francisco and Oakland, tech giants such as Google and Apple’s private employee buses, which were illegally using public bus stops, were blocked by protesters.

Other cities are clearly watching carefully. New York’s city regulators said Monday they were looking at their own probe into Uber, looking specifically at its impact on the city’s own yellow cab sector.

Political perceptions of these tech firms are changing too. After the so-called “Arab Spring,” many Western governments – and the Obama administration in particular – openly praised the tech firms as being a positive global influence, helping democratize the world.

That assumption unraveled as the same platforms later fueled the rise of far right parties in Europe and the Trump presidential campaign. Under Congressional pressure, Facebook voluntarily turned over details of 3,000 election-related ads that appeared to have been paid for by Russia-linked buyers.

Such scrutiny may only be the beginning. Increasingly, firms such as Facebook and Twitter are being blamed for seismic changes in Western political systems, accused of allowing themselves to be hijacked by automatic bots and hardliners to radicalize politics and often spread extremism.

Getting too close to tech firms now brings its own political dangers. U.S. think tanks that happily embraced funding from Google now find themselves criticized for it, accused of reining in any debate critical of the company and its counterparts.

Instead of spreading opportunity, such firms are increasingly blamed for killing jobs. Amazon’s success is at the heart of what trade analysts referred to as the “retail apocalypse,” the shutting of growing numbers of stores across the United States and beyond. Uber has proved toxic to more tightly controlled taxi industries. The drivers of London’s famous black cabs have been particularly hard hit, and their aggressive lobbying of politicians is seen as one of the key factors behind London mayor Sadiq Khan’s decision to suspend Uber’s operating license.

The decision proved immediately contentious. For all the criticisms of Uber – that it ignores regulators and the employment rights of those who drive for it, and that there have been reports of abuse and sexual assaults by drivers – it has slashed transport costs for its users. It has also provided opportunities – although without much in the way of job security – for hundreds of thousands around the world. An Uber-launched petition to reverse the London ban quickly notched up 600,000 signatures.

For the firms themselves, this is a familiar dynamic. Facebook, Google and Twitter in particular have been tangling with national governments since they began operating in relatively autocratic countries such as Russia, China and those in the Middle East, where those in authority have long felt threatened by the quick and easy access they offer to information. Sometimes, the tech companies have found themselves blocked outright.

Increasingly, the perception has become that many of these firms are simply willing to push their luck to see what they can get away with.

Technology firms do have a difficult balance to strike. Google, Apple and others have long made a virtue of protecting user data against what they see as overly intrusive requests for access by authorities. In some areas, the rights and wrongs are arguable. In others, however – such as the payment of tax – governments and campaigners believe the issues are much more clear-cut.

In many respects, Uber and AirBnB are seen amongst the most egregious examples of companies that have seriously and deliberately pushing the limits of what is strictly legal. While London’s already more stringent taxi regulation means Uber needs a license, in many other cities both it and its drivers operate outside the conventional taxi licensing system. AirBnB lets out rooms in cities that explicitly ban short-term rentals. Both have based their entire business model on working around, if not entirely flouting, pre-existing local regulations. Authorities often seemed to lack the ability, or the political will, to enforce the rules.

The London Uber decision is perhaps the most significant escalation in that war so far. It’s not that the firm will necessarily be ultimately banned from the streets, as it will continue to operate pending an appeal. The most likely scenario is that the firm and regulators reach a deal – although that could be a difficult process.

Early signs are that the firm is indeed willing to compromise. On Monday, its chief executive sent London authorities a contrite letter saying that the firm realized it had to change. Mayor Khan welcomed the statement, saying he favored talks to resolve the issue.

What Khan – a fast-rising star within the opposition Labour Party – has demonstrated, however, is that the firm can only operate if authorities allow it to do so. It is fundamentally replaceable – indeed, that have already been suggestions that a quickly-formed rival with better employment and safety practices might take its place. Something similar happened in Austin: although the Texas state government overruled the ban on Uber and Lyft in May, both companies now face more local competition.

Giant tech firms are unlikely to go away. But neither are national or local governments, democratically elected or otherwise. With a host of new technologies coming down the line – self-driving cars, automatic shops, artificial intelligence – many controlled by the same companies, these fights are only going to get bloodier.",Commentary: Uber’s London fight a sign of tech battles to come,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apps-uber-commentary/commentary-ubers-london-fight-a-sign-of-tech-battles-to-come-idUSKCN1C223I

WARSAW (Reuters) - South Korea’s LG Chem will open Europe’s largest lithium-ion battery factory in Poland next year as the region’s auto industry gears up to mass produce electric cars.

Tumbling battery prices and growing pressure to cut exhaust emissions have led carmakers to embrace electric vehicles. Manufacturers from VW Group (VOWG_p.DE) to Volvo Cars, Daimler and BMW plan to roll out a raft of new electric models in coming years.

But Europe lacks big-scale battery cell production facilities so those components are mostly imported from China and South Korea.

Calls are now growing for the region to develop its own battery industry to preserve jobs and profits, though Asian producers have a huge head start in development and scale.

LG Chem plans to spend 5.9 billion zlotys ($1.63 billion) on the factory near the southwestern city of Wroclaw, according to Polish state industry agency ARP.

Wroclaw is 190 kilometers (118 miles) from the border with Germany, home of VW Group which plans to invest more than 20 billion euros ($24 billion) in zero-emission vehicles by 2030 and make 3 million electric vehicles (EVs) a year by 2025.

LG Chem expects to produce up to 100,000 EV batteries in Poland annually from next year, it said on Thursday in a statement.

The factory will employ 2,500 people. LG Chem, a subsidiary of Korea’s LG Corp, did not name the likely customers but said they would include top car companies.

“The company has chosen Poland as the most competitive location for production to satisfy the needs of European and global car producers,” said Chang-Beom Kang, vice president at LG Chem.

It was not immediately clear if the factory would produce all the basic battery cells from scratch or import some components, but the statement said the site would include a research and development center employing “about 400 engineers from various specializations: automation, electronics, chemistry and IT”.

Asked about the source of lithium and other raw materials, a representative of LG Chem’s local arm said they would first be imported from the parent company in Korea and then hopefully from Polish suppliers.

DEMAND SURGE

The factory’s planned capacity is just a fraction of expected future demand.

Based on the typical capacity of a mid-market compact car like Nissan Leaf, 100,000 car batteries are equivalent to 4 GWh per year. This means the factory’s capacity could be slightly more than 10 percent of the production capacity that Tesla’s U.S. based “Gigafactory” is to reach in 2018.

Battery costs have been prohibitive but are falling rapidly. Average battery costs have come down from over $1,000 per kilowatt hour in 2010, to around $227 in 2016, according to analysts at Barclays.

In 2016, only 0.2 percent of new passenger cars sold in Europe were fully electric.

But Britain and France say they will ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2040 in an attempt to reduce air pollution, ending use of the fossil fuel-guzzling internal combustion engine.

LG’s Polish plant may not remain Europe’s largest car battery plant for long.

In September, Swiss engineering group ABB said it had joined a project to build Europe’s largest lithium-ion battery factory in Sweden targeting annual cell production equivalent to 32 gigawatt-hours by 2023, over 90 percent of Tesla’s Gigafactory target.

That project, named Northvolt, is led by a former manager at Tesla, which also plans to build a Gigafactory in Europe, though it has not said where.",LG to open Europe's biggest car battery factory next year,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lgchem-factory-poland/lg-to-open-europes-biggest-car-battery-factory-next-year-idUSKBN1CH21W

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Thursday morning, dragged down by media companies, while results from JPMorgan and Citigroup failed to fuel the optimism that has driven indexes to record highs.

JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Citigroup (C.N), which had already talked down third-quarter expectations, reported earnings that were better than Wall Street estimates even as trading revenues fell. The shares of both companies were little changed.

“After a long stretch of consecutive highs in the market, with earnings, even if they are slightly disappointing, or an even an aspect of earnings like bond trading at JPM, is more an excuse to selloff,” said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist for Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.

With the S&P 500 up about 14 percent in 2017, investors are betting on strong earnings growth across the S&P 500.

AT&T (T.N) tumbled 3.22 percent after the company said its third-quarter results took a hit from the string of hurricanes.

The company also said it lost video subscribers in the quarter. Brokerage Guggenheim downgraded Disney (DIS.N) and Viacom (VIAB.O) on worries over subscriber declines

That sparked fresh jitters in a sector that was hit a day earlier by President Donald Trump’s suggestion to challenge TV network licenses over ‘fake news’.

Comcast (CMCSA.O) fell 2.8 percent, Disney (DIS.N) fell 1 percent. Viacom sank 6.6 percent after warning that Charter Communications subscribers may lose access to its channels as the expiration looms for a distribution deal.

Clemons said earnings will probably heighten volatility, with lack of any other major developments to drive the market.

At 9:37 a.m. ET (1337 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was down 38.19 points, or 0.17 percent, at 22,834.7, the S&P 500 .SPX was down 4.38 points, or 0.17 percent, at 2,550.86 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was down 7.33 points, or 0.11 percent, at 6,596.22.

Ten of the 11 major S&P indexes were lower, led by a more than 2 percent fall in the telecom services index .SPLRCL due to AT&T’s declines.

The biggest drag, however, was from the consumer discretionary sector .SPLRCD, which fell 0.57 percent, weighed down by media stocks.

Energy stocks also fell, dragged down by a more than 1 percent drop in crude oil prices as U.S. fuel inventories rose despite efforts by OPEC to cut production.

BEIJING/SINGAPORE/LONDON (Reuters) - Some of China’s top oil refineries are having to take the highly unusual step of cutting operations during what is typically the peak demand summer season when hot weather drives up power usage and families take to the road during school holidays.

Almost 10 percent of China’s refining capacity is set to be shut down during the third quarter, signaling that demand growth from the world’s top crude importer is stuttering further.

West African and European suppliers are already feeling the chill from China’s reduced demand, and a global glut has dragged spot prices for crude this week to their lowest since November, 2016.

Major Chinese oil refineries, including PetroChina’s Jinzhou will set their run rates around 6,500 barrels per day (bpd) lower than the second quarter, sources at the affected refineries said.

Petrochina’s Fushun refinery, with an annual capacity of 233,200 bpd, began a 45-day full shutdown at the start of June, the sources said on condition of anonymity as they are not authorized to speak to media.

Rival Sinopec is considering slashing as much as 230,000 bpd, equivalent to about 5 percent of its average daily production last year, in what would be only the second time in 16 years that the firm has cut runs.

Stocks of surplus products like gasoline and diesel have been building since mid-2015, when Beijing started giving out crude import licenses to independent refiners, sometimes called teapots. This has forced state-owned Sinopec and PetroChina to cut back operations, and reduced their crude buying.

“Refiners probably realized that the domestic market cannot take so much gasoline and diesel, and the only way is to cut runs,” said Gao Jian, crude oil analyst with China Sublime Information Group.

Adding to these cuts, around 1.3 million bpd of refining capacity is going to shut in the third quarter as four state-run refineries and six independents begin planned maintenance, data provided by China Sublime Information Group showed.

Those closures mean almost 10 percent of China’s 15.1 million bpd total refining capacity will go offstream in the third quarter.

To whittle down the surplus weighing on the domestic market, analysts expect China to export refined product, putting more pressure on a well supplied global markets.

“China will have to export product... onto Asian markets, which given demand conditions regionally does not appear particularly constructive,” said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity strategy at French bank BNP Paribas.

The lower refinery throughput should reduce China’s demand for crude until around September. Some suppliers are already feeling the chill. Shipments by Angola, which sends most its oil to China, were running at the lowest level in at least a year during the first few weeks of June.

From the North Sea, just 2 million barrels of Forties crude has been shipped to Asia so far this month, compared with around 6 million barrels in June last year, and 10 million barrels in May.

BUT DON‘T WRITE CHINA OFF

The imminent cuts in China’s refining sector are likely to further weigh on oil prices, which have more than halved since 2014 due to oversupply.

However, traders say that China’s voracious thirst for oil will likely return once the immediate glut is cleared.

Nineteen Chinese independent refiners this week received fresh licenses to import crude for 2017.

“I’d expect improved buying now that teapot quotas have been released. If prices drop, China tends to buy more,” said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for Strong Petroleum, a trading firm supplying Chinese refiners.

Taken together with the licenses awarded earlier, independent refiners now have import quotas for about 1.42 million bpd this year, and it is possible that eight companies will receive allocations for another 340,000 bpd.

As refiners start chartering tankers to import crude, the impact of the new import allowances is expected to show from the end of the third quarter.

Traders said they will meet much of this demand by re-selling crude stored in South Korea and China, particularly from Shandong province where most of the independent refiners are, and from tankers off Malaysia.

Some traders even expect demand to spike in the fourth quarter, as seen late last year as teapots rushed to use up quotas to build their case for maintaining or increasing future quota allocations.

“China is a bit unpredictable – suddenly they buy a lot out of the blue, so you can never underestimate China’s buying,” said Berentsen.",Looming Chinese refinery cuts to hit oil demand,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-oil-demand-analysis/looming-chinese-refinery-cuts-to-hit-oil-demand-idUSKBN19C168

Any legal misstep in the trial of Diane Shima Rwigara could further mar the reputation of the long-ruling Kagame, who is credited for stabilising and developing Rwanda after its 1994 genocide but accused by rights groups of suppressing dissent.

Rwigara is accused of falsifying registration papers she filed to stand against Kagame in an August election and is the latest in a series of dissidents to face criminal charges. She was barred from running in the election, which Kagame subsequently won with an official 98.8 percent of the vote.

“I plead not guilty to all charges,” she told the court, adding that she had so far had scant access to her lawyer since police arrested her at her home on Aug. 30 on tax evasion allegations related to her family’s tobacco company.

Prosecutors said on Monday they could not disclose details of the charges because an investigation was still going on.

Rwigara accuses Kagame of stifling dissent and has criticised the ruling Rwandan Patriotic Front’s (RPF) tight grip on the country since it fought its way to power to end the east African nation’s genocide.

Her mother Adeline and younger sister Anne are co-defendants in the trial and say the accusations are politically motivated.

Their attorney, Pierre Celestin Buhuru, said he had not been given access to WhatsApp messages and recordings that prosecutors have presented as evidence.

The family has also asked for a return of money they said was confiscated by police during their raid in August so that they can appoint an additional lawyer.

The trial will resume on Friday.

(Reuters) - India paceman Ashish Nehra is to retire from international cricket after the opener of a three-match Twenty20 series against New Zealand on Nov. 1 at his home ground in Delhi, local media have reported.

Nehra made his senior debut for India during the test series against Sri Lanka in 1999 and helped his country reach the 2003 World Cup final. The 38-year-old has been plagued by injuries and last played for India in February.

Indian media quoted an unnamed Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) official as saying Nehra has informed head coach Ravi Shastri and captain Virat Kohli about his decision.

“Ashish has told both Ravi and Virat that he does not want to continue beyond November 1... ,” the official was quoted as saying.

“Obviously, there is some element of surprise. One thought that he would like to continue till the home season against Sri Lanka. But he feels it’s the right time to move on.”

The Delhi-native has collected 44 test, 157 one-day international and 34 Twenty20 wickets in his 18-year international career.

LONDON (Reuters) - Gold prices held near two-week highs as focus shifted to U.S inflation figures due on Friday which are expected to give more clues on monetary policy.

After four straight session of gains, spot gold was steady at $1,291.34 an ounce at 1400 GMT, after earlier hitting $1,297.40. U.S. gold futures climbed 0.7 percent to $1,298 per ounce.

“If inflation were to rise more than expected or at least meet expectation ... this could underpin the dollar which could undermine gold,” Fawad Razaqzada, an analyst at FOREX.com, said.

Minutes from a September meeting by the U.S. Federal Reserve showed policymakers had a prolonged debate about the prospects of a pick up in inflation and slowing the path of future interest rate rises if it did not.

The dollar inched up after U.S. data showed new applications for U.S. unemployment benefits last week fell to a more than one-month low after being boosted by two hurricanes.

But the greenback still languished near two-weeks lows against a basket of currencies, weighed down by the U.S Fed minutes which the market interpreted as dovish.

Gold is highly sensitive to rising interest rates, as these tend to boost the dollar, in which the metal is priced.

Several policymakers said they would focus on upcoming inflation data over the next few months when deciding on the central bank’s future rate hike path.

Political uncertainty also helped to support gold, which investors turn to during periods of turmoil, analysts said.

“If people are not too worried about the Fed’s policy, we have North Korea. Surely, geopolitical tensions are supporting prices ... we may try $1,300 next week,” Yuichi Ikemizu, Tokyo branch manager at CIBC Standard Bank, said.

Silver slipped 0.2 percent to $17.12 an ounce after touching a three-week high.

Platinum was 0.9 percent higher at $935.90 an ounce, after hitting a more than two-week high earlier in the session.

Palladium jumped 2.4 percent to $983, its highest since Sept. 6.

Discussions over a possible substitution between platinum group metals in auto catalysts will likely gather pace if the palladium continues to trade at a premium to the platinum, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a note earlier this month.",Gold steady ahead of U.S. inflation data,https://www.reuters.com/article/global-precious/gold-steady-ahead-of-u-s-inflation-data-idINKBN1CH1RT
