But the episode's storyline seems to bear similarities to the real-life Harvey Weinstein scandal playing out in Hollywood.

In the TV version, however, the gender roles are flipped, with Tina Fey starring as Diana St. Tropez, a boss who sexually harasses men and women following her promotion to head the company, Deadline reported.

In the episode, a rising young producer is faced with dilemma about whether to come forward regarding St. Tropez’s inappropriate behavior, USA Today reported.

The show draws similarities to bombshell reports by the New York Times and the New Yorker magazine, accusing Hollywood executive Weinstein of sexually harassing women.

But NBC, the network that airs ""Great News,"" says the plot of its show is nothing more than a coincidence with the Weinstein scandal, given the fact that the episode was written last summer and never mentions Weinstein, USA Today reported.

The episode title, “Honeypot!” however, was referenced in the New Yorker’s report on Weinstein. The term referred to the 65-year-old executive’s assistants who would attend a meeting, then leave Weinstein alone with a woman, according to the Hollywood Reporter.

Fey's old show, ""30 Rock,"" made a crack about Weinstein in a 2012 episode, when Jenna (Jane Krakowski) said she “turned down intercourse with Harvey Weinstein on no less than three occasions.""

""We're negotiating a NAFTA deal.

Trudeau will head to Mexico on Thursday to continue talks regarding NAFTA.","Few clues emerged from President Donald Trump’s meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Wednesday about the uncertain future of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

""We're negotiating a NAFTA deal. It's time after all of these years and we'll see what happens. It's possible we won't be able to make a deal and it's possible that we will,"" Trump said.

Negotiations have struggled to gain momentum as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce cautioned that the Trump administration’s impractical requests could harm the talks.

But despite the U.S. threatening to withdraw from the agreement that’s been in effect since 1994, Trudeau remained optimistic that the U.S., Canada and Mexico can reach a ""win-win-win"" solution. Still, he said Canada would be ""ready for anything.""

The fourth round of NAFTA negotiations began Wednesday in Arlington, Va., and will continue through Tuesday.

NAFTA eliminated trade barriers between the U.S., Canada and Mexico to generate trade growth. But critics argue it also led to the downfall of U.S. manufacturing as companies moved across the southern border to take advantage of cheaper labor.

In order for the tri-lateral trade agreement to remain past its 23rd year, Trump has requested an increase in U.S auto production, more American companies securing government contracts in the NAFTA bloc, and for the agreement to be abolished altogether unless countries agree every few years to extend it. In addition, the administration is seeking eliminating dispute resolution processes.

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue detailed some of the main issues with NAFTA, specifically where Canada is reaping more of the benefits than the U.S.

“The irritants that we have are primarily with Canada over their dairy management supply program. They are overproducing, creating depressing world prices for milk solids,” Perdue told FOX Business’ Trish Regan on The Intelligence Report. “There is also a wine issue in British Columbia where they are not letting our wines out front where their customers can choose.”

Perdue added that there are also issues with poultry access.

U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Thomas Donohue called Trump’s proposals “poison pills” for Canada and Mexico, which could result in the death of the agreement, Reuters reported.

Donohue co-chaired the U.S.-Mexico CEO conference Wednesday alongside Fedex Freight's CEO Michael Ducker. Guillermo Vogel, a steel company executive, co-chaired the event in Mexico, which included closed-door talks regarding NAFTA with Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray and Economy Minister Idelfonso Guajardo, who are responsible for Mexico’s involvement in the negotiations, Reuters reported.

Vogel emphasized the importance of negotiating a good deal, and told Reuters a “bad agreement” would be far worse than “with no NAFTA,” but recognized the end of the pact would be a “lose-lose” situation.

Farm groups and agricultural lobbies have urged the Trump administration to keep NAFTA, because if the U.S. were to leave the agreement, the agricultural industry would be slapped with potentially steep tariffs from Canada and Mexico.

If negotiations fail to reach a solution, Trump alluded to the possibility of having separate deals with Canada and Mexico.

“It's possible we won't be able to reach a deal with one or the other. But in the meantime, we'll make a deal with one,"" the president said.

In addition, during an interview with Forbes magazine published Tuesday, Trump appeared to favor eliminating the deal and said he likes “bilateral deals.""

""I happen to think that NAFTA will have to be terminated if we're going to make it good. Otherwise, I believe you can't negotiate a good deal,"" Trump said.

Trudeau will head to Mexico on Thursday to continue talks regarding NAFTA.

Jones, 50, a mother of two, who used to be a punk rock artist but later converted to Islam and fled to Syria to become a top recruiter for the Islamic State group, was reportedly killed in June during a drone strike near the border between Syria and Iraq.

“The Americans zapped her trying to get away from Raqqa. Quite frankly, it’s good riddance,” a British source familiar with the strike told the Sun, which first reported Jones' death.

Jones followed the same fate as her husband, Junaid Hussain, who died in an airstrike in 2015 as part of a larger campaign against ISIS. She and her husband were occasionally called “Mr. and Mrs. Terror” and were linked to numerous terror plots.

Jones’ 12-year-old son Jojo was also believed to have been killed in the strike. “The premise that Sally Jones and her son are dead is probably accurate,” an unnamed British official told the Times of London.

The woman reportedly used her son as a human shield during skirmishes with anti-ISIS forces. She was last seen fleeing Raqqa following the liberation by U.S-backed military forces, the Sun reported.

Jones was top ISIS recruiter of female jihadists and was reportedly high on the U.S. “kill list” as she was considered a high-value target. She targeted young girls, trying to lure them into Syria to become jihadi brides, and used social media to threaten attacks on Britain.

Her son was not targeted by the U.S. military strike and was not considered a combatant.

She not only cheered, but ran cross country in middle school and varsity track in high school, and Stormy was ready to take on another year of athletics at River Valley High School in Caledonia, Ohio. But something happened that would take Stormy totally off track.

Fast forward to Sunday, September 24, 2017, Stormy was back on a running course. Now 25, she was in a wheelchair as two firefighters and other teammates pushed her for 3.1 miles at the Team Heart & Sole Marion Presidential 5K.

No, it wasn't quite the same freedom or feeling she had running with her peers in high school. But after eight years of rigorous physical and neurological therapy, Stormy was just excited to be outside, racing again.

OFFICERS HELP RUNNER FINISH CHICAGO MARATHON AFTER HIP INJURY

""It was wonderful,"" Stormy said. ""The wind and the sun was in my hair, just like when I used to run in track.""

That summer afternoon eight years ago, Stormy's car collided with a motorcycle causing her vehicle to flip several times. Firefighters pulled her from the wreckage, unsure of her prognosis.

Marsha Cushing, Stormy's mom, said it's been a ""slow and steady process” since the accident, which put her in a coma for six weeks and in the hospital for six months. For the first six months, she stayed by her daughter’s side, waiting patiently for her to come out of a coma.

Once she emerged, Stormy had to relearn everything, including eating and talking. Early on, the doctors recommended admitting her into a nursing home, but her parents refused. Instead, they sought help from Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, where staff taught them how to care for Stormy so she could live at home.

Stormy busies herself every week with physical therapy, including three days a week at Ohio Health, water therapy on Fridays, and neuromuscular relief every other Friday. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Stormy and her family work with specialists to make daily routines for them to do at home. Cushing knows the rigorous training and help from doctors and physical therapists, along with Stormy's tenacious spirit, helps her overcome the obstacles she faces every day.

""That's what's got her this far, the right therapists along the way who were so intentional with Stormy, thought outside the box, and gave us stuff to work on,"" Cushing said. ""When she first came home, she couldn't move either of her hands or legs. They were really tight and really drawn up. Now she has complete control over her right hand, has started to bend her right leg, and is getting more movement with her other leg and left arm arm.""

A friend of the Cushing family told Heart & Sole, a non-profit organization that helps people with disabilities participate in athletics, about Stormy. The group offered to pay her entry fee and provided a special running wheelchair.

""[Heart & Sole] basically contacted us and said, 'Show up here,'"" Cushing said. ""And we showed up. They're wonderful, and you can tell the volunteers' hearts are truly in this. It was really awesome getting to see [Stormy] have a glimpse of her old life again.""

After the 5K, Stormy is only determined to do more. She plans on doing three more Heart & Sole races before the end of the year. Through continuing intense physical therapy, Stormy hopes to walk down the aisle at her sister's wedding in March with the least amount of help possible.

After that? She's just going to keep dreaming of running again, and taking one step at a time to get there.

""She's said to me several times, 'In the morning when I get up, will you help me stand up? Because I want to try to run,'"" Cushing said. ""I'm always like, 'Stormy, don't you think you should try to walk first?' And she says, 'No, I want to run tomorrow. I want to run when I get up.'""

Alva Campbell uses a walker, relies on an external colostomy bag, requires four breathing treatments a day for asthma and emphysema and may have lung cancer, the lawyers said in a filing with the Ohio Parole Board.

Campbell was also the product of a violent, dysfunctional and sexually abusive childhood and continued to suffer abuse after he was placed in foster homes, the attorneys said.

""Alva's development suffered, and the chances of him becoming a responsible adult withered."" - David Stebbins, federal public defender

Campbell's attorneys argue his case is similar to that of Joseph Murphy, spared by Kasich in 2011 ahead of his scheduled execution for slashing a woman's throat during a robbery.

The parole board recommended mercy for Murphy, noting his childhood growing up in West Virginia in which he was beaten, starved and sexually abused.

The board planned to hear arguments for and against clemency on Thursday. A decision is expected in about a week. Kasich has the final say. Campbell is scheduled for execution Nov. 15.

Campbell was in a wheelchair feigning paralysis when he overpowered a Franklin County sheriff's deputy on the way to a court hearing on April 2, 1997, on several armed robbery charges, records show.

Campbell took the deputy's gun, carjacked 18-year-old Charles Dials and drove around with him for several hours before shooting him twice in the head as Dials crouched in the footwell of his own truck, according to court records.

""As judgment day nears he again resorts to ill health as a reason to enable an escape from his capital sentence -- and should not be permitted to do so,"" O'Brien said in a Tuesday filing with the parole board.

Campbell served two decades in prison for a fatal bar shooting in Cleveland in 1972. He was arrested in 1997 after a series of armed robberies in Columbus.

""It is easy to blame deceased parents or a childhood for mistakes or even crimes -- but not for two separate murders committed decades apart,"" O'Brien said.

SEE THE NYC TOWNHOUSE WHERE OBAMA LIVED AFTER COLLEGE

The building has been the site of two very high-profile suicides in the last 30 years, which is enough to make even a New York City real-estate agent think twice about living there.

“I don’t know of any buildings with two suicides,” said Dolly Lenz, CEO of Dolly Lenz Real Estate, in a statement to the New York Post. “It almost says that there is a cloud on the building.”

The first victim of these tragedies was Carter Cooper, the 23-year-old son of Gloria Vanderbilt and the older brother of CNN anchor Anderson Cooper. According to reports, Carter was acting strangely in the months leading up to his suicide, but had been in therapy. Then, on July 22, 1988, during a visit to his mother’s home, he abruptly ran out onto the terrace of his Vanderbilt’s two-story penthouse apartment, hopped over the ledge, and dangled there before letting himself drop from the 14th floor — all while Vanderbilt watched from feet away.

""He let go, and there was a moment when I thought I was going to jump over after him,” Vanderbilt remembered during a 2011 appearance of Anderson Cooper’s talk series.

In Vanderbilt’s 1997 book, “A Mother’s Story,” she also alleged that Carter’s suicide may have triggered by an allergy to medication.

The second, much more recent suicide at 10 Grace Square took place in April 2017, and claimed the life of author, heiress and socialite Jean Stein. Stein, whose works include “Edie: An American Girl” and “West of Eden,” had reportedly been suffering from depression, according to her daughter Katrina vanden Heuvel, and jumped from the 15th floor of the building on April 30, the New York Times reported in its obituary.

A fellow resident who witnessed the suicide has said it was a messy one, as Stein “miscalculated” the jump and landed an eighth-floor terrace. She had also severed her leg in the fall, according to reports.

10 Gracie Square, however, is also infamous for more than these two suicides: In 1982, it was also where sixth-floor resident Frances Schreuder was arrested for conspiring with her son Marco to kill Schreuder’s father, wealthy Utah businessman Franklin Bradshaw.

Schreuder had reportedly been unhappy with the amount of money Bradshaw was allotting her, and persuaded her then-17-year-old son to shoot his grandfather dead in 1978. He was eventually caught, and Schreuder was nabbed while trying to escape out the window of her 10 Gracie Square abode.

The boxy Partisan One might just be one of the most basic and ugliest cars ever.

The warzone ready SUV is limited to a steering wheel, pedals, lights and seats - and yet you'll still need to part with £44,000 for the privilege.

But don't worry, you do get a 100 year warranty because the German firm reckons it's THAT indestructible - presumably because there's so little to actually break.

Kia's market leading seven year warranty suddenly looks a little inadequate.

The scaffold-inspired Partisan One is delivered in lightweight assembly kits - think Ikea at war.

It's the brainchild of Russian engineer Dr Juri Postnikov and is expected to live life on the battlefield.

It can be dropped into any warzone and withstand barrages in the harshest conditions.

Circular holes around the exterior let you bolt on armour plating - and there's even an option to strap on V-shape armour under the chassis to deflect roadside bombs.

""Designers"" claim the SUV is meant to stand out against its pretty rivals with right angles replacing rooflines.

Because it lacks any style or complicated panels, it can be produced quickly and cheaply.

Plus you can stick in whatever engine you want - including electric power - although a 2.8-litre Fiat diesel is standard.

That's a break from the Senate intelligence committee, which had said it won't release them.","One of Facebook's top executives met Wednesday with House members investigating the company's Russia-linked ads and told them the social media giant is serious about dealing with the issue.



Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, told lawmakers behind closed doors that the company is working hard to ensure Americans ""understand what the propaganda is that they may or may not be reading,"" said House Republican Rep. Mike Conaway, who is leading the House intelligence committee probe.



Wednesday's meetings are ahead of a Nov. 1 House Intelligence Committee hearing at which Facebook, Twitter and Google are expected to testify. The Senate Intelligence Committee is also holding an open hearing with the three companies that day.



Investigators have recently focused on the spread of false news stories and propaganda on social media and have pressured Facebook, along with Twitter and Google, to release any Russia-linked ads. Facebook recently provided three congressional committees with more than 3,000 ads they had traced to a Russian internet agency.



Facebook has said those ads focused on divisive political messages, including LGBT issues, immigration and gun rights, and were seen by an estimated 10 million people.



Conaway, R-Texas, and the top Democrat on the panel, California Rep. Adam Schiff, met with Sandberg in the office of House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. Sandberg also held a separate meeting with Schiff, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California and No. 2 House Democrat Steny Hoyer of Maryland.



Schiff said Sandberg wanted to calm members of Congress, who were initially concerned that the company was reluctant to share information and to ensure that foreign governments don't wage information campaigns in U.S. elections.



Sandberg said, according to Schiff, that Facebook is ""determined to take whatever steps are necessary to ferret out foreign actors creating fake identities and using their platform.""



He said Sandberg also indicated the company wants the help of the intelligence community to identify who may be using Facebook for those reasons.



Conaway and Schiff said after the meeting that they expect to eventually release the Facebook ads. That's a break from the Senate intelligence committee, which had said it won't release them. Facebook has also declined to make the ads public.



""My personal bias is that we'll do that as quickly as we can,"" Conaway said, adding that they probably wouldn't release the ads before the Nov. 1 hearings.



Both men said that in the end, voters need to be more aware of the type of information they are seeking out.



""You and I as voters are responsible for where we get information and how we trust it, and whether we trust it,"" Conaway said.



Sandberg also was expected to meet Thursday with the Congressional Black Caucus. Some members of the caucus have been critical of Facebook over the ads, many of which had racial themes.



One member of Congress who viewed the ads said that of about 70 that person had viewed, all of them had racial themes. The person said the ads were meant to inflame all sides, with some showing white police officers beating black people. The member declined to be named because the ads aren't yet public.

The “Parts Unknown” host is dating actress Asia Argento, one of the women who came forward and accused Weinstein of raping her. Bourdain tweeted his praise and support of his girlfriend on Tuesday, stating he was “proud and honored to know you.”

Clinton appeared on Fareed Zakaria’s CNN show Wednesday and addressed the Weinstein’s allegations. Weinstein has contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Clinton Foundation and contributed $46,350 to her 2016 presidential campaign.

“I was — I was just sick,” Clinton told Zakaria. “I was shocked. I was appalled. And, you know, like so many people who’ve come forward and spoken out, this was a different side of a person who I and many others had known in the past.”

Clinton told Zakaria she was not aware of Weinstein’s actions.

""I certainly didn't, and I don't know who did. But I can only speak for myself, and I think I speak for many others who knew him primarily through politics,"" Clinton said.

Weinstein and his family have given more than one million dollars in political contributions to Democratic lawmakers, candidates and their allies, the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics reported.

Clinton said she would donate the money she was given by Weinstein to charity.

Bourdain took to Twitter to share his thoughts in a series of tweets.

“And I have to say, Hillary's interview with Fareed Zakaria was shameful in its deflection and its disingenuousness,” Bourdain tweeted.

“Know what Hillary Clinton is NOT? She’s not stupid. Or unsophisticated about the world. The Weinstein stories had been out there for years,” Bourdain continued.

He added, ""Secretary Clinton was one of the most intelligent, well prepared, well briefed politicians ever. So, yes. I’d hoped for a better response.""

HILLARY CLINTON BREAKS SILENCE ON HARVEY WEINSTEIN: ‘I WAS SHOCKED AND APPALLED’

However, Bourdain, whose show is broadcasted on CNN, also tweeted he admired Clinton but felt the interview was “a real disappointment.” He also reiterated that Clinton was not responsible for anything Weinstein has done.

""I can assure you that the victims of Mr. Weinstein's three decades of predatory behavior are disappointed too. I'm sitting next to one,” Bourdain said of his girlfriend, Argento.

Bourdain concluded: “This Weinstein story is deeply personal to me -- and far far far more personal and painful to people I love and people I care about.”

Clinton was criticized earlier this week for remaining silent following the expose released by The New York Times last week that claimed Weinstein had settled sexual harassment lawsuits with at least eight women. The New Yorker followed up Tuesday with more allegations.

Clinton released a statement through her spokesman Nick Merrill on Twitter Tuesday following the New Yorker’s bombshell report.

“I was shocked and appalled by the revelations about Harvey Weinstein,"" she stated. ""The behavior described by women coming forward cannot be tolerated. Their courage and the support of others is critical in helping to stop this kind of behavior.”

Bowe Bergdahl will likely prove far more daunting.

It was more than three years ago when American Caitlan Coleman and her Canadian husband, Joshua Boyle, vanished in Afghanistan. The couple, who were backpacking through the region while Coleman was five-months’ pregnant, next surfaced in a video emailed to Coleman's family in York County, Pennsylvania. The U.S. government believes they, as well as an unnamed American in his 60s, are being held by the infamous Haqqani network.

“They were in the wrong place at the wrong time.” - Relative of Caitlan Coleman, hostage held by Haqqani network

“We should be putting the fear of God in these terrorists that if you mess with an American citizen, we will get you and we will win,” a source with knowledge of back-channel communications aimed at their return told Fox News.com. “Are we really doing that?”

Multiple sources told FoxNews.com that an American man, as first reported by the Daily Beast and whose identity remains undisclosed for safety reasons, is also being secretly held hostage by terrorists around the Afghanistan/Pakistan border. According to one well-placed source, the unnamed U.S. citizen has been in the grasp of the Haqqani network since being grabbed while wandering through Pakistan for “odd but not nefarious reasons” in late 2014.

Equal parts terrorist organization and criminal organization, the Taliban-aligned Haqqani network operates in the lawless Afghan-Pakistani border. It held Bergdahl, the U.S. Army sergeant who left his base in Afghanistan, for five years, until the U.S. won his release with a controversial prisoner swap. Talks to free Coleman, Boyle and the unnamed hostage are proceeding, but little is known about the progress being made, if any is.

One government official said there is reason to believe Coleman is alive, and a Coleman relative told FoxNews.com that the family feels almost certain the couple and their baby are still alive.

“They were in the wrong place at the wrong time,” a relative of Coleman told FoxNews.com, adding that family members closest to her have frequent contact with several government officials and receive regular updates on what is being done to bring the Westerners home.

Several months after their disappearance in 2012, videos featuring the couple were emailed to the Coleman family by an Afghan man claiming to have Taliban ties but no direct involvement in their captivity. It wasn’t until June of 2014 that the families publicized the two videos – in which a gaunt Coleman was seen pleading to “my president, Barack Obama” for help. Coleman, who is now 30, references their baby in the tape, but the child is not shown.

The decision to draw attention to their plight came following the release of Bergdahl, in the hopes that further awareness might lead to a successful negotiation. Family members also expressed disappointment that Boyle, Coleman and their baby were not freed as part of the deal.

“There is a possibility that she may have had a second child in captivity since then,” said the defense source familiar with the case. “So ultimately we’re looking at three main scenarios – one child, two children or none at all.”

Negotiations and whatever leverage the U.S. may have remain murky. Unlike the Iranian exchange, which involved a government’s conviction – however dubious – of Americans, the hostages held by Haqqani network are in an undisclosed location by dangerous and unpredictable captors.

“We say we don’t talk to terrorists, we don’t pay ransoms to support terrorists,” said the source familiar with U.S. efforts to free the hostages. “Unfortunately, the captor network does not follow ‘diplomatic protocol'.”

Yet one well-placed source said the Haqqani network is more pragmatic than a typical terrorist organization, and negotiations using third parties and local middle men are possible. That could help the U.S. get around its official policy of not dealing with terrorists. The Arab nation of Qatar took part in the talks that led to Bergdahl’s release.

Last year the Obama administration attempted to improve overall hostage negotiation strategy by revising the current policy – approving changes to help streamline the process, declassify information in a faster manner so it can be shared with relatives and ultimately allowing them to pay for information that may help lead to the release of a loved one.

A Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell also was established as the single government entity responsible for coordinating the recovery the U.S hostages abroad, located in the FBI headquarters but with professionals from several agencies including the Department of Defense and Department of Justice involved.

The changes were prompted by a series of tragedies surrounding American hostages in recent years, including journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and aid worker Kayla Mueller, who were all murdered by their ISIS captors. Aid worker Warren Weinstein was inadvertently killed by a CIA drone strike while in the internment of Al Qaeda in Pakistan.

Dozens of Americans -- including former U.S. Marine-turned-journalist Austin Tice, who vanished in Syria, and retired FBI agent Robert Levinson, who disappeared in Iran in 2007 -- are reportedly being held around the world, although many have not been heard from in months or even years. But whether the Obama administration’s new approach will prove effective remains to be seen.

“The Recovery Cell doesn’t work until it works – until we see the proof, until these Americans come home,” Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., told FoxNews.com, adding that he objects to the emphasis on not publicizing hostage cases.

U.S. Government officials – who would not comment on the unnamed American in captivity, but acknowledged Coleman’s case – insist that the “safe recovery of hostages” is a top priority.

“We can assure you we continue to work aggressively to ensure Ms. Coleman and her family’s safe return,” the official said. “These individuals are being held against their will and should be allowed to return to their families.”

A spokesperson for the Canadian government told FoxNews.com that the country’s first priority is the safety and security of its citizens, but declined further comment on Boyle’s situation so as not to “compromise ongoing efforts or endanger the safety of Canadian citizens.”

However, Gary Noesner, kidnap management consultant and retired chief of the FBI’s Crisis Negotiation Unit, said that the administration’s new approach is a positive step toward improving the quality of family support and operational management of the U.S. Government in these difficult cases.

Caitlan Coleman, 32, was seven months pregnant when she and her husband, Josh Boyle, were abducted.

The operation that set Coleman, Boyle and their children free was undertaken by Pakistani forces based on actionable intelligence provided by U.S. authorities, according to a statement by the ISPR. U.S. intelligence agencies had been tracking the hostages and shared the location with Pakistani counterparts when the hostages shifted into Pakistani territory Wednesday.

""Today they are free. This is a positive moment for our country's relationship with Pakistan,"" President Donald Trump said in a statement Thursday. ""The Pakistani government's cooperation is a sign that it is honoring America's wishes for it to do more to provide security in the region.""

Trump appeared to hint at the news of Coleman's release during a speech in Coleman's home state of Pennsylvania a day earlier.

""Something happened today, where a country that totally disrespected us called with some very, very important news,"" Trump said Wednesday. ""And one of my generals came in.

But this is a country that did not respect us. This is a country that respects us now. The world is starting to respect us again, believe me.""

TRUMP RAMPS UP PRESSURE ON PAKISTAN IN SPEECH

Coleman and Boyle were last seen in a hostage video in December 2016 pleading for their governments to intervene.

The two vanished after setting off in the summer of 2012 for a journey that took them to Russia, the central Asian countries of Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, and then to Afghanistan.

Coleman's parents, Jim and Lyn Coleman, last heard from their son-in-law on Oct. 8, 2012, from an internet cafe in what Josh described as an ""unsafe"" part of Afghanistan.

The announcement of the release comes a month after President Trump announced a new strategy to deal with Afghanistan and Pakistan, saying the Taliban and other militant groups would no longer find safe haven in Pakistan.

Defense Secretary James Mattis and Gen. Joseph Dunford told Congress last week Pakistan would no longer be a sanctuary for terrorism.

In the 2016 YouTube video, Coleman refers to ""the Kafkaesque nightmare in which we find ourselves"" and urges ""governments on both sides"" to reach a deal for their freedom. She then adds: ""My children have seen their mother defiled.""

Two young children appear in the video with them, and Coleman has told her family that she gave birth to two children in captivity. It was revealed Thursday that Coleman had a third child.

The video came to public attention through the Site Intelligence Group, which monitors extremist activity online. SITE said it was dated Dec. 3.

The Haqqani network has orchestrated a vast array of brutal attacks in Afghanistan in recent years, against both locals and the U.S. military, but unlike their Taliban associates, they are deemed to be more motivated by money than faith.

In that interview with Circa News in 2016, Jim Coleman issued a plea to top Taliban commanders to be ""kind and merciful"" and let the couple go.

An executive order Trump plans to sign Thursday morning aims to offer “alternatives” to ObamaCare plans and increase competition to bring down costs.

“The time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across state lines, which will create a truly competitive national marketplace that will bring costs way down and provide far better care,” Trump said in a statement.

According to officials, Trump will direct the secretary of Labor to consider expanding access to Association Health Plans, which could allow employers to form groups across state lines offering coverage. According to the White House, these plans could offer lower rates.

The order also calls on other federal agencies to consider expanding coverage in low-cost, short-term insurance plans not subject to ObamaCare rules.

The move comes after congressional Republicans repeatedly have been unable to pass legislation repealing or reforming the Affordable Care Act, which critics say has led to rising premiums and diminishing coverage options – in some cases forcing consumers to lose their previous plans and doctors. Trump’s executive order could clear the way for cheaper, more bare-bones insurance policies.

Trump's order is likely to encounter opposition from medical associations, consumer groups and even insurers -- the same coalition that has blocked congressional Republicans. They say it would raise costs for the sick, while the lower-premium coverage for healthy people would come with significant gaps.

“When it bothers somebody that you’re asking for drinking water, medicine for the sick and food for the hungry, that person has much deeper problems than what we can discuss in an interview,” Cruz said.

“What really is nasty is showing your back to the Puerto Rican people,” Cruz added.

The island was recently hit by powerful Hurricane Maria and has been working to restore power and clean water to the territory.

TRUMP SURVEYS HURRICANE-RAVAGED PUERTO RICO, MEETS SAN JUAN MAYOR AFTER FEUD

Cruz criticized the Trump administration’s hurricane response to the island. Last Friday, the mayor appeared on television in a black shirt with white letters that read, ""HELP US, WE ARE DYING."" Cruz argued that federal aid had been slow to reach Puerto Rico following Maria, which knocked out power to the entire island.

In response, Trump tweeted on Saturday, “Such poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help.”

Trump added Cruz was “very complimentary only a few days ago,” but “has now been told by the Democrats that you must be nasty to Trump.”

A number of politicians and celebrities took to social media immediately after to criticize Trump’s tweets.

Trump said in an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity that Cruz was “very nice at the beginning but she went a little bit on the nasty side and I said I guess she’s running for office, and it turns out I’m right.”

During Trump’s visit to the U.S. territory on Tuesday, the mayor and president shook hands. Trump received some criticism for telling Puerto Ricans they escaped the higher death toll of “a real catastrophe like Katrina.”

Known deaths from Maria in Puerto Rico stand at 34, The Associated Press reported.

However, Cruz praised the White House staff and said, “I saw a real connection between the reality and the White House staff. I think they finally understood.”

“Congress to decide how much to spend…We cannot keep FEMA, the Military & the First Responders, who have been amazing (under the most difficult circumstances) in P.R. forever!”

The president’s comments come just one week after he visited the U.S. territory that is struggling to recover from the devastation left by Hurricane Maria, the strongest hurricane to hit Puerto Rico in nearly a century.

Trump’s trip to Puerto Rico was criticized, for among other things commenting on how the storm's death toll was far lower than that of a “real catastrophe like Katrina” in 2005.

“Sixteen people versus in the thousands,” Trump said. “You can be very proud of all your people.”

The president has repeatedly called for more help “on a local level” from Puerto Rico and has had an intermittent feud with the San Juan mayor, who also has faced criticism for engaging in political combat when other officials on the island are not.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., shot back Thursday at Trump's latest tweets.

""Why do you continue to treat Puerto Ricans differently than other Americans when it comes to natural disasters?"" Schumer tweeted.

According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, earlier this month, there were more than 10,000 federal officials on the ground on the island.

On Friday, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., plans to lead a small bipartisan group, including the chairman and top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee that signs off on spending legislation, to visit Puerto Rico.

Ryan plans to meet with local officials and emergency personnel.

The House is expected to vote this week on an emergency spending package including billions of dollars more in relief for Puerto Rico, Texas and Florida in the wake of deadly storms Maria, Harvey and Irma this hurricane season.

The president asked Congress this week for a $4.9 billion loan to help Puerto Rico pay its bills from the storm. The island faced more than $70 billion in debt prior to the storm, and declared bankruptcy in May.","Trump warns post-hurricane Puerto Rico, says FEMA won’t stay 'forever'",http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/12/trump-warns-post-hurricane-puerto-rico-says-fema-won-t-stay-forever.html

“I’ve realized something painful. It’s not just the memorable summits and crux moves that are fleeting. Friends and climbing partners are fleeting, too,” he wrote for the “Evening Sends” blog. “This is the painful reality of our sport, and I’m unsure what to make of it. Climbing is either a beautiful gift or a curse.”

Gallatin County sheriff’s officials say Kennedy, 27, and Inge Perkins, 23, were skiing on Imp Peak in the southern Madison Range on Saturday when they triggered an avalanche in a steep, narrow gulley at about 10,000 feet above sea level.

Perkins, also an accomplished mountain climber, was buried by the 150-foot-wide slide. Kennedy hiked out after he couldn’t find his girlfriend.

The area had received a foot of snow since Oct. 1, which was on top of about four feet of dense snow that had fallen over the previous two weeks, according to the Gallatin National Forest Avalanche Center.

Kennedy, who had recently moved to Bozeman, was found dead in his home Sunday with a note detailing where to find Perkins’ body.

Doug Chabot, director of the avalanche center, said Kennedy did not call 911 to report the slide.

“It all came out in this incredibly detailed and well-thought-out note,” he said. “He basically left nothing to chance in finding Inge.”

Chabot said the note included GPS coordinates and details about the route Kennedy and Perkins were skiing. Kennedy also left an avalanche probe and a shovel in the debris to mark the site, allowing searchers to find the body within an hour of arriving.

Perkins had an avalanche transceiver in her backpack, but it was turned off, Chabot said. It’s unclear if Kennedy was carrying a similar unit.

In a statement released Tuesday, Kennedy’s parents described their son as “an uncensored soul whose accomplishments as a mountaineer were always secondary to his deep friendships and mindfulness.”

“Hayden survived the avalanche but not the unbearable loss of his partner in life,” they wrote.

Kennedy, who grew up in Carbondale, Colorado, had been working on his EMT certification while Perkins completed a bachelor’s degree in mathematics and education at Montana State University.

Kennedy was perhaps best known for climbing the Southeast Ridge in Patagonia’s Cerro Torre in 2012 and removing many of the bolts placed by controversial Italian climber Cesare Maestri more than 40 years earlier.

Afterward, he and his climbing partner were accosted by locals and detained by police. But Kennedy’s father, Michael Kennedy, who was editor of Climbing Magazine for more than two decades, beamed with pride.

“You made a courageous first step in restoring Cerro Torre to its rightful place as one of the most demanding and inaccessible summits in the world,” the elder Kennedy wrote in an open letter to his son that was published in Alpinist Magazine in 2012. “I never would have had the guts to take that step myself, even in my best days.”

Michael Kennedy, an accomplished mountaineer in his own right, also wrote to his son about losing multiple friends to the sport.

The company brought it to the Association of the U.S. Army’s annual meeting in Washington, D.C., this week to gauge interest in it for military applications.

The platform is modular and can accommodate many vehicle types, including a pickup version of the MTU-6. Green4U has also built a street-focused prototype called the Enova with taxi services in mind that’s based on the same chassis as the MTU-6 but looks more like a crossover.

The North Koreans reportedly stole hundreds of gigabytes of important military information in a cyberattack on South Korea last September – including information about potential U.S.-South Korean wartime plans. At the same time, the rogue nation appears to be moving forward with its nuclear weapons program – even celebrating the anniversary of its first nuclear weapon test on Monday.

That is exactly the possibility I explore in my new book, Vengeance, the third volume in the bestselling Brooke Grant series I write with former Washington Post reporter Pete Earley.

Vengeance was released this week, along with Callista’s new children’s book, Remember the Ladies, in which Ellis the Elephant returns to the White House to teach four-to eight-year-olds about our nation’s first ladies.

In Vengeance, the North Koreans provide nuclear material to radical jihadists in exchange for two supertankers filled with oil. In turn, the terrorists plan to destroy U.S. cities. While the book is a work of fiction, the threat we explore is very real.

The United States and our allies in the region must see to it that North Korea is disarmed not only to protect South Korea, Guam, Japan, and our West Coast, but also to eliminate the rogue nation’s capability to provide devastating weapons to groups that will use them more readily, and with less regard for even their own survival.

Kim Jong Un is a dangerous dictator, but a nuclear weapon in the hands of radical Islamic terrorists, who believe they will be richly rewarded in the afterlife for destroying a Western city, is a very different type of threat and a potential reality that the United States and all of our allies must prepare for and defend against.

I hope the novels I write with Pete Earley remain pure works of fiction. Sadly however, real danger is becoming too easy to imagine.",Newt Gingrich: Vengeance: A warning about a dangerous world,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/11/newt-gingrich-vengeance-warning-about-dangerous-world.html

Our Cooke Scholars prove every day that this is nonsense.","In many parts of the world, if you are born poor you will almost certainly stay poor for your entire life. You don’t get the chance to get a good education or go on to a well-paid career. You struggle – picking crops, mopping floors, mowing lawns, waiting on tables, or in other low-paying jobs, barely making ends meet.

But in America – known the world over as the Land of Opportunity – upward mobility is the national ideal. It doesn’t always happen, of course. But just the possibility draws immigrants from the world over to our shores – my own parents included. For most, education is the key that enables them or their children to break out of poverty and enter the middle class or go higher, as I and millions of others have been able to do.

For this reason, providing equal educational opportunity for all is vitally important – not just for students who can get college degrees that transform their lives, but for America. We need an educated workforce to keep our economy and our nation strong. We need to keep the American Dream alive.

A stereotype persists that – to put it crudely – poor kids are dumb. Cooke Scholars prove every day that this is nonsense. They are some of the smartest and most capable people on our planet. All they needed was a helping hand and financial aid to succeed.

One immigrant who achieved the American Dream and helped thousands more young people do so as well was Jack Kent Cooke. Born in Canada in 1912, he never had the chance to go to college, leaving high school during the Great Depression to help support his struggling family. He went from selling encyclopedias door to door, to leading a band, to being a runner on the floor of the Toronto Stock Exchange, to working as a salesman, to managing radio stations.

Cooke kept working his way up, becoming a part-owner of radio stations, newspapers and a magazine, and then buying a minor league baseball team in Toronto and other businesses. He immigrated to the United States in 1960 and became an even more successful businessman and owner of sports teams, including the Los Angeles Lakers, the Los Angeles Kings and the Washington Redskins.

The Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, which I now head as executive director, has awarded $175 million in scholarships to more than 2,300 high-achieving, low-income students from 8th grade through graduate school, along with comprehensive counseling and other support services. The foundation has also provided over $97 million in grants to organizations that serve such students.

Every year, the Cooke Foundation finds absolutely brilliant students who have overcome incredible obstacles and gives them scholarships. Some of our Cooke Scholars have been homeless, have gone hungry, have been undocumented, have suffered from serious illnesses, have been kicked out of their homes after announcing they were LGBT, have been teenage parents, and have faced other big challenges.

Yet Cooke Scholars have graduated with distinction from some of the top colleges and universities in the world. Some have become physicians, created nonprofit organizations to help others in need, become medical researchers working to prevent and cure diseases, launched successful businesses, become professors, started charter schools, written books, and taken on many other important rules. How sad it would have been if they never had the chance to get a college education and instead spent their lives in dead-end jobs.

Yet a stereotype persists that – to put it crudely – poor kids are dumb. Our Cooke Scholars prove every day that this is nonsense. They are some of the smartest and most capable people on our planet. All they needed was a helping hand and financial aid to succeed.

What’s lacking isn’t brainpower among those with low incomes. What’s lacking is the opportunity to get a higher education and the money to pay for it.

But we should be embarrassed that millions of low-income young people who do these things and are enormously talented hit a cash ceiling when they try to better themselves with a college degree. They should not be denied equal educational opportunity simply because they were born into families of modest means. If given the chance, they can make our nation proud.","America is the land of opportunity, and should be proud of it",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/08/america-is-land-opportunity-and-should-be-proud-it.html

UVM’s Wellness Environment, more commonly known as WE, is a new, substance-free dorm that goes beyond just banning drugs and alcohol.

Students who choose to live there must take a class called “Healthy Brains, Healthy Bodies” which teaches students about different things that affect body and brain health. WE students also have access to yoga and meditation, healthy foods, and a free gym membership. They can also consult nutrition and fitness coaches who assist them on their wellness journeys.

The dorm has a zero-tolerance policy for drugs and alcohol. If a student is found with either, they’re kicked out.

“We created an environment where we believe if we offer young people healthy foods, healthy choices, they’ll make them. We reward those things, and we don’t encourage the negative things, so the rule in the environment is no alcohol, no drugs, and the students follow it,” Dr. Jim Hudziak, the chief of child psychiatry at the UVM’s Larner College of Medicine, who founded the WE program, said.

The WE way of life seems to be catching on: the program, which started with just 120 freshman last year, has almost quadrupled this semester. WE students pay the same rate as students who live in other campus housing.

Students can also track their activities through an app, and earn “coins” to purchase WE shirts, sweatshirts, hats, and other items.

University student Hannah Bryant, of Brewster, MA, said she enjoys WE’s food, yoga and meditation options. Bryant added that the WE lifestyle has already been beneficial for her.

“Just like already within the first three weeks of school has already made a huge difference,” she said. “And it’s things like this, the 30 minutes, that can really change your week around.”

Liberal writer Kurt Eichenwald even defended D’Souza, calling him a “liar” who has free speech rights to “spin his drivel.”

D’Souza quickly responded himself, “Don’t call a book sh-- without reading it. If you do, I’d honestly like you to tell me what I got wrong.”

Sources close to Oppenheim and NBC News say that he has been telling colleagues that he does not have a business relationship with Weinstein.
Insiders at NBC were speculating Wednesday if the spiking of the Weinstein story could cost Oppenheim his job.
“Everyone’s asking if he can survive now,” one NBC News correspondent, who asked to remain anonymous, told Fox News.","NBC News’ recently appointed president, Noah Oppenheim, is facing intense criticism for reportedly spiking an exclusive story exposing movie producer Harvey Weinstein’s history of sexual assault allegations. Oppenheim, who is a Hollywood screenwriter, should have recused himself from making decisions about a powerful player in the entertainment industry, critics say. Instead, the usually hands-off executive — who is still actively writing screenplays — intervened in the editorial process and killed the story, according to The Daily Beast.

Oppenheim often has told industry colleagues that he’s likely to one day return to Hollywood full time. He wrote “Jackie,” a 2016 film starring Natalie Portman, and has been attached to multiple other projects. Weinstein was one of the most influential people in the movie business until a series of bombshell sexual harassment and assault allegations derailed his career.

One of the most damning reports was by former MSNBC host Ronan Farrow, who was still an NBC News reporter, but Oppenheim’s news organization refused to run the story. Farrow, who eventually took his 7,718-word bombshell to the prestigious New Yorker magazine, was told by Oppenheim’s team months before publication that his Weinstein scoop didn’t meet NBC’s standards.

NBC’s assertion that the Farrow story wasn’t up to snuff has been met with deep skepticism within NBC News and without. Farrow himself slammed NBC, ironically on MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow show, saying the story he’d presented network executives was rock solid, and in the same shape as it was when he eventually took it to The New Yorker.

TV historian and Syracuse journalism professor Robert Thompson told Fox News that Oppenheim should have stepped aside from making decisions about Weinstein if the two men had a business relationship, or if there was a potential for future relationships.

“If you’ve got somebody who is making major decisions about whether or not to run stories about people who might ultimately buy their properties, then I think that’s certainly worth investigating as a potential conflict of interest,” Thompson said. “It’s certainly an ethical question.”

Oppenheim’s agent, CAA’s Rowena Arguelles, declined to answer whether Oppenheim had business dealings with Weinstein, and referred Fox News to a spokesman for NBC News, who also declined to answer the question.

Sources close to Oppenheim and NBC News say that he has been telling colleagues that he does not have a business relationship with Weinstein. That’s also got colleagues scratching their heads, as it’s unlikely a screenwriter of prestige projects like “Jackie” would not have been interested in one day doing business with the premier producer of Oscar-nominated films.

Thompson said that Weinstein had “so much power and so much money” that he was able to keep his secret life out of the news for decades.

“Nobody wanted to rock the boat,” he said. “The relationships to Harvey Weinstein, both past and potential in future, are things that one would certainly want to look into carefully.”

Oppenheim’s “Jackie” screenplay was in development for many years, and was on the famous “Black List” of notable unproduced screenplays. Industry experts say it is likely that the “Jackie” project crossed Weinstein’s desk when it was looking for a home (it was eventually produced by Fox Searchlight Pictures). Back in 2012, Deadline reported that Oppenheim would adapt George Orwell’s “1984” for Imagine Entertainment. He also was slated to write a reboot of “War Games” and a movie about Harry Houdini. In a recent interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Oppenheim said he was writing a new draft of the Houdini movie, in addition to his duties as NBC News president.

“I've been able to kind of keep it going, so I haven't yet started to miss it,” he said. “Making your living as a screenwriter is a very tricky proposition in the long run. If I'm moved to want to work on something, I can carve out the time.”

Imagine Entertainment could not be reached and a representative for its co-founder, Brian Grazer, did not respond. The Weinstein Company did not immediately respond to whether it considered funding “Jackie,” or if it has had any other dealings with Oppenheim.

“For a guy writing highbrow movies, eliminating the single most prominent producer of upmarket material would not be a wise move, and is of course a direct conflict of interest,” an industry insider told Fox News.

Oppenheim was also at the middle of NBC’s controversial decision a year ago to sit on the notorious “Access Hollywood” tape of Donald Trump making lascivious comments about women. At the time, Oppenheim was running the “Today” show, whose co-host Billy Bush also was recorded on the tape egging on Trump. As with the Weinstein story, NBC argued strenuously that they had not been able to work out legally how to broadcast the tape before it was leaked to the Washington Post’s David Fahrenthold, who is a friend of Oppenheim’s from prestigious Harvard University.

NBC News fired Billy Bush for his role in the tape. “That feels like ancient history,” Oppenheim said in April of Bush’s exit.

Shortly after NBC had weathered that scandal, Oppenheim was promoted to NBC News president. In this role, he reports to the powerful NBC News chairman Andy Lack, and has less oversight and responsibilities than his counterparts at other networks (many parts of NBC News report directly to Lack). NBC News insiders tell Fox News that Oppenheim has a reputation for being largely disengaged and frequently reminding people that he could any day up and go back to Los Angeles.

Oppenheim himself addressed the Weinstein situation when speaking to NBC News staffers at a previously scheduled meeting on Wednesday. An NBC News employee provided Fox News with a copy of his comments.

“The notion that we would try to cover for a powerful person is deeply offensive to all of us. … We didn’t feel we had all the elements that we needed to air it,” Oppenheim said. “Suffice to say, the stunning story, the incredible story that we all read yesterday, was not the story that we were looking at when we made our judgment several months ago.”

However, the HuffPost reporter who brought NBC’s decision to light responded to the statement, reminding readers that NBC News had audio of Weinstein admitting sexual assault.

Insiders at NBC were speculating Wednesday if the spiking of the Weinstein story could cost Oppenheim his job. The executive is already coming under enormous pressure over the badly botched rollout of former Fox News host Megyn Kelly, who was hired by NBC News for a reported $23 million a year. Oppenheim was tasked with overseeing her new daytime show, which has been widely panned and is rating considerably lower than the vastly less expensive 9 a.m. “Today” show hour it replaced. “Megyn Kelly Today” is also dragging down the ratings of Kathie Lee Gifford and Hoda Kotb’s previously successful 10 a.m. show because it’s cratered their lead-in.

Oppenheim also traveled with Kelly to Moscow to produce her interview with Russian President Vladimir Putin, which was widely mocked.

In a notice reviewed by Fox News, the DOJ announced that five jurisdictions “have preliminarily been found to have laws, policies, or practices that may violate” a key federal statute concerning cooperation with federal immigration officials.

They are: Chicago, New Orleans, New York City, Philadelphia and Cook County, Ill.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a written statement that sanctuary cities “adopt the view that the protection of criminal aliens is more important than the protection of law-abiding citizens and of the rule of law.”

“I urge all jurisdictions found to be out of compliance in this preliminary review to reconsider their policies that undermine the safety of their residents,” he said.

The statute in question generally bars local officials from restricting the sharing of immigration and citizenship information with federal immigration officials.

JUDGE SAYS SESSIONS CAN'T WITHHOLD GRANT MONEY TO SANCTUARY CITIES

Sessions earlier this year said any cities and counties out of compliance could lose certain federal grant money.

However, a federal judge in September blocked Sessions from withholding those grants for now, while a Chicago lawsuit against the department plays out in the courts.

Thursday’s notice shows the Department of Justice is still aiming to make a final determination on which jurisdictions are skirting the law.

The Justice Department said the five cities and counties in question will have until Oct. 27 to “provide additional evidence that the interpretation and application of their laws, policies, or practices comply with the statute.”

Officials in those jurisdictions have defended their policies. After the September court ruling, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel called the decision “an affirmation of the rule of law.""

According to the Chicago Tribune, he called it a “clear rejection of the false choice that the Trump Justice Department wanted Chicago to make between our values, our principles and our priorities.""

Several additional jurisdictions had been flagged in a May 2016 inspector general report as having laws that might conflict with federal requirements. But the DOJ on Thursday cleared those jurisdictions, including Milwaukee and the state of Connecticut.

During my years of painting people’s homes, I’ve learned that small spaces don’t have to be boring or go unnoticed. All it takes is a little paint. By adding paint in strategic places around the home, you can easily and inexpensively transform a space. Plus, there is a good chance you could accomplish at least one of these eight painting projects during the course of one weekend.

Here are eight spaces to consider painting and my tips and tricks on making even the smallest places have a big impact.

1. Entryway. When a guest arrives, their first impression is based on your home’s exterior and the front door. Realtors call this curb appeal. But the very next thing guests will notice is the area right inside your front door, so you should use it to make a statement.

If your home has a formal entry, choose a paint color that is one to two shades darker than the next room. A darker paint color in the entryway can make the space feel more inviting, like a warm hug.

If your home has an open floor plan without a defined entryway, use paint to create one. Try a bold color on the wall surrounding the front door and an adjacent wall as visual borders for the entry.

2. Hall bath. Small bathrooms might appear to be limited when it comes to design, but they can easily be transformed with a quick paint color update.

How do you pick a color for this small bathroom? Look around your home for spots of color that crop up in your art or drapes. For example, a living room that is mostly beige with blue accent pieces would coordinate well with a bathroom painted in that same shade of blue.

Dark colors also have been trending with homeowners I’ve worked with lately. To offset the dark nature of the paint, we typically recommend keeping the other design details, such as the floors and sink, light to make sure the room still feels open and bright.

Worried one color will overwhelm the small space? Consider installing a chair rail as a natural divider. Then paint the lower portion of the wall in a statement color while leaving the wall area above a neutral tone.

3. Bookshelf. Whether the bookshelves in your home are built-in or freestanding, you can easily create style with paint. Remove the shelves from the surround and paint the back wall of the case. Don’t be afraid to go bold with your paint color, because once the shelves and objects on the shelves are in place, your color choice will seem more subtle. You will get an instant pop of color without being too in-your-face.

4. Closet. This space is often overlooked when it comes to paint, but a fresh coat of paint on the walls and shelving in your closet can go a long way. With a small- or medium-sized closet, keep your paint color choice bright and light.

With a large walk-in closet, consider using a paint color that complements the attached room.

For shelving, use an oil-based paint for durability against scratches and scuffs.

5. Hallway. Hallways are typically long and narrow and, depending on the lighting, can also be dark. When choosing a paint color for the hallway, consider the paint colors in connecting rooms and then go one to two shades lighter. The colors will complement each other and coordinate the home’s overall design. Plus, a lighter shade will brighten up the passageway.

6. Accent wall. If you have a small amount of paint and want to make the biggest impact on your home’s design, then an accent wall is your best bet. Choose a wall in your living room or master bedroom that you want to highlight, such as the area behind the sofa or bed.

Once it is painted, hang coordinating artwork on the accent wall to finish the design.

7. Kitchen nooks and crannies. Typically, I find there isn’t too much paintable space in the kitchen. But when I do find it, it’s between the cabinets, appliances and backsplash.

When space is limited, I always encourage owners to go bold and use colors that offset the room’s features. For example, in a kitchen with white cabinets and natural stone countertops, pick a hunter green or dark blue. In large quantities, these dark shades might feel overwhelming, but in small quantities, they give the room a strong dimension.

8. Laundry room. You can’t avoid the task of laundry, so at least make it a room that is easy on the eyes and generates positivity. Think of a paint color you would never dream of using in the social areas of your home but would make you happy, such as a playful orange, a bold purple or a sunshine yellow. Who knows, being around your favorite color might even make the chore a little more enjoyable.",Transform a whole house by painting these 8 small spaces,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/09/22/transform-whole-house-by-painting-these-8-small-spaces.html

By Holman W. Jenkins, Jr., The Wall Street Journal



One of the few successes of John McCain’s 2008 campaign was a 30-second ad called “Celeb.” It interspersed images of Paris Hilton and Britney Spears with Barack Obama and his adoring crowds. A narrator said: “He’s the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead?”

Pundits and political pros dismissed the spot as off-target and unconvincing. Mr. McCain seemed almost embarrassed by it, claiming his campaign was just having “fun.”

Yet the implication that Mr. Obama was a glitzy Hollywood-style confection resonated with voters. Mr. Obama, just coming off his ecstatic appearance in Berlin, saw his poll numbers drop noticeably. His advisers were quoted in the press acknowledging the ad’s power.

Which brings us to Harvey Weinstein. If Hollywood people are anything like normal people, they should be nearly as offended by Mr. Weinstein’s presumptions about them as they are by his alleged bullying of women for sex. Where does he get off assuming his colleagues can be so easily manipulated, will so readily fall in line, just because he cites, as he did in his recent self-defense, their shared liberal politics?

How can somebody with his smarts be so heavy-handed and obvious as to think he can mint an instant pass for his transgressions merely by alluding to his opposition to the National Rifle Association and President Trump ?

Then again, maybe we’re missing the real point. Mr. Weinstein was reminding liberal elites that his trouble is their trouble, because they tolerated him for so long. That’s why this scandal may have legs.

He was a guest at the Obama White House 13 times. He gave hundreds of thousands to the Clintons. In 2016, he hosted or headlined multiple fundraisers for Mrs. Clinton with people like Leonardo DiCaprio, Helen Mirren, Julia Roberts and Sarah Jessica Parker.

He was coached by Team Clinton for a campaign appearance on CBS . In turn, he coached campaign chief Robby Mook on how to answer the Bernie Sanders threat.

He’s also a man who the Los Angeles Times now tells us was “generally loathed” in Hollywood. His sexual predations were so well known that they were the subject of a joke on “30 Rock.” His behavior, we now learn, has been the subject of ongoing reporting projects at the New Yorker, New York magazine and the New York Times, which finally blew Mr. Weinstein out of the water with its 3,500-word account last week.",Sanctimony Bites Weinstein Democrats,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/10/12/sanctimony-bites-weinstein-democrats

There was always a basic problem with the so-called Iran nuclear deal inked back in 2015 that was never going to be resolved: Washington and Tehran have vastly different interests across the Middle East. It was never going to be easy to somehow compartmentalize the relationship, to in some way come to terms over Iran’s nuclear program but not resolve countless other issues that have always driven these two nations apart. And it could someday tear the deal to shreds.

But sheer necessity dictates that now is not the time for such an action. In fact, I would argue a move by President Trump to ‘decertify’ the agreement is against America’s national interests.

To be brutally honest, The Islamic Republic of Iran is no friend of the United States—period. Its regional aspirations are nothing short of an attempt to become the dominant power in the Middle East and displace America from the region. The regime is a state-sponsor of terror that will use whatever brutal and violent means it can to achieve its objectives. And it’s no secret that Iran is a human rights-abuser of the worst kind, even working with fellow pariah-state North Korea to develop advanced missile platforms that could someday target U.S. forces in the region.

But the deal that President Obama made with Tehran back in 2015—wrinkles and all—is worth keeping for a very pragmatic, realistic reason: the Trump Administration has much bigger problems on its plate.

Decertifying the deal now—with the danger of Tehran building nuclear weapons that are now pushed out at least a decade or more under the deal—would take away much needed bandwidth from confronting much bigger challenges Team Trump must address that are of much more critical domestic and international importance. And considering the very real possibility that decertifying the deal could very well put both nations on the path towards potential conflict—if Tehran attempts to make a run towards nuclear weapons, fearing an eventual U.S. move towards regime change—President Trump must make the hard choice to stay the course.",The Conservative Case to Keep the Iran Deal,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/10/12/conservative-case-keep-iran-deal

By The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board



The Boy Scouts of America (BSA) announced Wednesday that next year it will allow girls to join the Cub Scouts. By 2019 it will start a program for older girls to become Eagle Scouts. At first it seems the Scouts have finally surrendered in the culture war, but the reality is more complicated.

Boy Scout membership has fallen by about a third since 2000, and today some 2.4 million young people take part in Scouting. The organization has long tried to broaden its appeal with programs like Sea Scouting and Venturing, which are open to women. In its announcement the organization noted that it wants to offer more programs for entire families. One survey showed 90% of parents not involved with Scouting were interested in getting their daughters into a program like the Cub Scouts.

Scouting conjures images of hiking in the outdoors and learning to tie knots, and the outdoors should remain central to its mission to build confidence that comes from mastering one’s surroundings. But Scouting has long offered merit badges in skills like computer programming and personal finance that are also helpful to girls and boys.

Currently Cub Scouts are organized into local packs made up of dens of about a half-dozen elementary-school boys. Once girls can enter the Cub Scouts, dens will remain single-gender. Packs can decide whether to be mixed- or single-gender. And girls who want to become Eagle Scouts will do so in a program designed specifically for girls. “This unique approach allows the organization to maintain the integrity of the single gender model while also meeting the needs of today’s families,” the Scouts said.

The unanimous decision by the BSA board may also be a compromise to prevent total gender integration. The group’s statement acknowledged that girls have tried to join for years, and after taking so much abuse for resisting gay scouts until 2013, the group couldn’t want another media or court fight over gender. Earlier this year, it opened membership to transgender boys.",The Boy-Girl Scouts of America,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/10/12/boy-girl-scouts-america#commenting

Multiple allegations of rape, sexual harassment and trading sex for movie roles have forced one of the most powerful men in show business out of his company and begging for help and forgiveness.

But the ripples extending from the wake of Weinstein’s dramatic fall extend much further than his business and personal relationships and so far show no signs of abating.

CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES MAKE SEARCHING FOR MISSING TOUGH""We are literally looking at explosive vegetation,"" Pimlott said.","The raging wildfires across Northern California that have left at least 23 people dead and hundreds missing while scorching the state's famed wine country may have been sparked by downed power lines and blown transformers, according to emergency radio traffic released Wednesday.

State officials have not yet officially said what caused the blazes that have destroyed at least 3,500 homes and businesses. But dispatch audio obtained by KTVU FOX 2 News reveal firefighters in Napa and Sonoma Counties called in more than a dozen reports of downed power lines, live wires, and blown transformers late Sunday in the first hours of the wildfire outbreak.

Multiple fires were reported by firefighters near the sites of downed power lines and fallen trees.

In one radio exchange between firefighters in Napa County, crews called in downed lines and a blown transformer around 9:15 p.m. Sunday. About 15 minutes later, crews also reported a fire in the same area. It was unclear if that particular fire grew into a larger blaze or was contained, according to KTVU FOX 2.

The owner of the power equipment, Pacific Gas and Electric Company, said in a statement Wednesday ""hurricane-strength winds in excess of 75 mph,"" and ""millions of trees weakened by years of drought and recent renewed vegetation growth from winter storms, all contributed to some trees, branches and debris impacting our electric lines across the North Bay.""

FIRE SURVIVOR GNAWED BY REGRET OVER ELDERLY NEIGHBORS

""In some cases we have found instances of wires down, broken poles and impacted infrastructure. Where those have occurred, we have reported them to our state utility regulator and CalFire,"" the company said. ""Our thoughts are with all those individuals who were impacted by these devastating wildfires. We want our customers, families and friends to know that we will stand beside them and work together throughout this restoration process.""

The company, just like all utility companies in California, is required to keep vegetation more than 10 feet away from its power polls and towers, and to remove flammable debris from around the surrounding ground, according to KTVU FOX 2.

Utility companies in California have previously been found responsible for major wildfires due to inadequate maintenance of their power infrastructure.

The state Public Utilities Commission fined PG&E for $8.3 million in April for failing to maintain a power line that sparked a fire in September 2015 that killed 2 people and destroyed 549 homes, according to the East Bay Times.

CalFire announced last year that it will seek to force PG&E to pay $90 million in firefighting costs for that blaze, the newspaper reported. A spokesperson for the company told the East Bay Times questions about maintenance of the lines in relation to the current wildfires were “highly speculative.”

While authorities work to figure out an official cause of the fires, the blazes could expand Thursday because the area is expecting wind gusts up to 45 mph, with nearly non-existent humidity in areas north of San Francisco.

""It's going to continue to get worse before it gets better,"" state fire Chief Ken Pimlott said Wednesday.

The 22 fires spanned more than 265 square miles, many of them completely out of control. Modern, strategic attacks that have kept destruction and death tolls low in recent years just haven't worked against its ferocity.

CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES MAKE SEARCHING FOR MISSING TOUGH

""We are literally looking at explosive vegetation,"" Pimlott said. ""Make no mistake…this is a serious, critical, catastrophic event.""

Gov. Jerry Brown said the fires were ""one of the biggest, most serious, and it's not over.""

Helicopters and air tankers were assisting thousands of firefighters trying to beat back the flames. Until now, the efforts have focused on ""life safety"" rather than extinguishing the blazes, partly because the flames were shifting with winds and targeting new communities without warning.

Sonoma County Sheriff Robert Giordano said hundreds of people were still reported missing, but officials believe many of those people will be found. Chaotic evacuations and poor communications over the past few days have made locating friends and family difficult.

But the sheriff said he does expect the death toll to climb.

""The devastation is enormous,"" he said. ""We can't even get into most areas.""

As previously reported, McCain, who formerly worked as a contributor for Fox News, is stepping in for Jedediah Bila. She is expected to lead the charge for conservatives on the panel now that Bila has stepped down amid controversial rumors regarding the show’s infamous post-election interview with Hillary Clinton.

McCain took the stage to begin thanking her co-hosts for allowing her to join their panel and bring a different viewpoint to the show, but got emotional quicker than she expected when the conversation turned to her father, who recently revealed he is battling brain cancer.

“Pauli Murray represents the best of Yale: a pre-eminent intellectual inspired to lead and prepared to serve her community and her country,” Yale President Peter Salovey said in April 2016.

According to the school, Murray also helped organize the March on Washington with Martin Luther King, Jr. and was appointed by former President John F. Kennedy to the Committee on Civil and Political Rights of the President’s Commission on the Status of Women.

“On top of killing me, they find me, without hearing my story,” Escudero said, joking that she is dead to everyone but the banks, to whom she pays loans and mortgage on a regular basis. “On the government’s computers I am dead, but for the banks I am alive and kicking.”

In April 2016, she found out that a woman with her name and data had been buried six years prior in Malaga – about 127 miles away.

She said her daughter called the cemetery and confirmed the burial date and that the remains has been transferred to an ossuary because maintenance fees had not been paid. She also confirmed her mother’s social security and date of birth.

“'Look,' my daughter told them, 'that person is my mother and she is here right next to me,'” Escudero said. “Imagine the woman’s face at the cemetery.”

Earlier this month she filed a petition with Malaga courts to have the grave opened and has offered to do a DNA test – anything – to prove that the woman buried is not her.

Escudero says no one has explained to her how the woman has died, but believes that she has been confused with a sister with whom she has no contact and whose whereabouts are unknown. She said she has no connection to Malaga.",Spanish woman wants to open up grave to prove she's alive,https://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/09/27/spanish-woman-wants-to-open-up-grave-to-prove-shes-alive.html

The Daily Mail published images of Weinstein holding up his middle fingers, as a TMZ report surfaced claiming that Weinstein took off in a private jet Wednesday evening from Van Nuys Airport bound for Wickenburg, Arizona. The outlet noted that the destination is very close to the Meadows rehab center, which is uniquely equipped to deal with sex addiction issues, but there’s no word yet on specifically where the 65-year-old will receive treatment.

Previous reports indicated that he was going to leave the country for treatment amid recent revelations that he’d been using his position of power within The Weinstein Company to sexually proposition, harass and assault women in show business. However, TMZ reports that those plans were scrapped as his team wanted him to receive inpatient treatment within the country.

Weinstein was caught by papparazzi outside his daughter's house on Wednesday afternoon and he stated he was ""not doing OK.""

""I gotta get help guys,"" he told the paparazzi as he got into a car. ""You know what? We all make mistakes -- second chance, I hope.""

He then took a jab at Hollywood A-listers, many of whom have turned on him in recent days.

""And you know what? I've always been loyal to you guys,"" he told the photographers, adding ""not like those f--king pricks who treat you like s--t. I've been the good guy.""



In addition to the firestorm of negative press surrounding Weinstein, his wife of 10 years, Georgina Chapman, announced that she’s leaving him on Wednesday.

Multiple allegations of rape, sexual harassment and trading sex for movie roles have forced one of the most powerful men in show business out of his company and begging for help and forgiveness.

But the ripples extending from the wake of Weinstein’s dramatic fall extend much further than his business and personal relationships and so far show no signs of abating.

From the women he allegedly abused, to the associates who allegedly knew about his behavior all along but stayed silent, to the A-list actors and actresses who depend on him for their career-making roles, many of the biggest Tinseltown titans are wondering what their lives — and show business itself — will look like in a post-Weinstein town.

The clues

Who knew what, and when? While nobody has come out to say they knew Weinstein was abusing and attacking women, there have been hints over the years that all was not well at Miramax and The Weinstein Company.

In 2013, Seth MacFarlane joked during the Academy Awards nomination press conference that the five best supporting actress nominees “no longer have to pretend to be attracted to Harvey Weinstein.” His co-presenter Emma Stone uncomfortably laughed at his punchline.

Nathan Lane recounted an altercation with Weinstein when the film producer threw him against a wall at Hillary Clinton’s birthday party.

Ewan McGregor alleged on Wednesday via Twitter that it was a known Hollywood secret writing, “It's about time this came to light and he is getting [his] just deserts. Heard rumours over the years but this is awful. Bye Bully!""

Rose McGowan, one of Weinstein’s accusers, shared a screenshot of an undated exchange she had with several people in the past. She captioned the post, “Bob Weinstein is a POS. They allllll knew.” Bob, is the brother of Harvey, who recently denounced his brother as a ""sick man.""

Asia Argento, who accused the former movie mogul of rape, said she reenacted the alleged sexual assault in a 1999 film. She claims Weinstein saw the scene and joked about it.

The hand wringing

Many of those close to Weinstein have spoken out against their former friend, all while claiming ignorance of the extent of his behavior.

Ben Affleck lashed out on Weinstein on Tuesday. He wrote on social media, “The additional allegations of assault that I read this morning made me sick. This is completely unacceptable, and I find myself asking what I can do to make sure this doesn’t happen to others. We need to do better at protecting our sisters, friends, co-workers and daughters. We must support those who come forward, condemn this type of behavior when we see it and help ensure there are more women in positions of power.""

Matt Damon was accused of trying to quash a scathing piece about Weinstein but he claims he is innocent. In light of Weinstein’s allegations, Damon said he was surprised, telling Deadline: “I did five or six movies with Harvey. I never saw this. I think a lot of actors have come out and said, everybody’s saying we all knew. That’s not true. This type of predation happens behind closed doors, and out of public view. If there was ever an event that I was at and Harvey was doing this kind of thing and I didn’t see it, then I am so deeply sorry, because I would have stopped it. And I will peel my eyes back now, farther than I ever have, to look for this type of behavior. Because we know that it happens. I feel horrible for these women and it’s wonderful they have this incredible courage and are standing up now.""

George Clooney echoed Damon’s sentiments of shock to The Daily Beast. “I’ve known Harvey for 20 years. … But I can tell you that I’ve never seen any of this behavior — ever.” He added, “It’s indefensible. That’s the only word you can start with. Harvey’s admitted to it, and it’s indefensible.”

Leonardo DiCaprio said on Facebook, “There is no excuse for sexual harassment or sexual assault — no matter who you are and no matter what profession. I applaud the strength and courage of the women who came forward and made their voices heard.""

Colin Firth revealed to The Guardian that Weinstein was intimidating, saying, “He was a powerful and frightening man to stand up to. It must have been terrifying for these women to step up and call him out. And horrifying to be subjected to that kind of harassment. I applaud their courage.”

Benedict Cumberbatch, who stars in the upcoming Weinstein production, “The Current War,” released a statement: “We need to collectively stand up and support victims of abuse such as the brave and inspiring women who have spoken out against him and say we hear you and believe you. That way others may be emboldened by our support to come forward and speak. But we shouldn’t wait until there are any more stories like this. We, as an industry and as a society at large need to play our part. There has to be zero tolerance of any such behavior in any walk of life. We owe that to these women’s bravery in coming forward.""

Hollywood without Harvey

While Hollywood reels, many are trying to come to terms with short- and long-term effects of this scandal on the entertainment industry. Experts predict more accusations may come to light.

“The days of the Hollywood establishment bullying and browbeating reporters into burying stories about serial bad behavior are over. There are simply too many media outlets, too many ways to disseminate information, and not enough gatekeepers,” said Scott Pinsker, a branding and communications expert. “What was once whispered behind closed doors will become headline news. … Nobody believes that Harvey Weinstein is the only predator in Tinsel Town. More heads will roll.""

Kevin Blatt, a celebrity crisis manager based in Los Angeles told Fox News, the Weinstein drama is just the beginning of what will be more accusations against powerful men in Hollywood.

“The short-term effects are that many powerful studio execs, casting agents and people in power in Hollywood will be forced to govern themselves accordingly. The long-term effects? There will be many industry women looking to expose those who wronged them in the past. This is just the tip of the iceberg,” Blatt predicted.

But not everyone is convinced the abuse of power will end.

“Absolutely nothing will change long-term in Hollywood. It’s not a town of men versus women. It’s a town of the powerful versus the desperate,” said Hollywood film producer Colin Goldman. “To believe the Weinstein scandal changes everything is to believe it’s the first-ever story of those in power abusing those who want something from them very badly. It’s happening again, somewhere, right now, today in the industry.”",Harvey Weinstein accusations cause chaos in Hollywood,http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/12/harvey-weinstein-accusations-cause-chaos-in-hollywood.html

An executive order Trump plans to sign Thursday morning aims to offer “alternatives” to ObamaCare plans and increase competition to bring down costs.

“The time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across state lines, which will create a truly competitive national marketplace that will bring costs way down and provide far better care,” Trump said in a statement.

According to officials, Trump will direct the secretary of Labor to consider expanding access to Association Health Plans, which could allow employers to form groups across state lines offering coverage. According to the White House, these plans could offer lower rates.

The order also calls on other federal agencies to consider expanding coverage in low-cost, short-term insurance plans not subject to ObamaCare rules.

The move comes after congressional Republicans repeatedly have been unable to pass legislation repealing or reforming the Affordable Care Act, which critics say has led to rising premiums and diminishing coverage options – in some cases forcing consumers to lose their previous plans and doctors. Trump’s executive order could clear the way for cheaper, more bare-bones insurance policies.

Trump's order is likely to encounter opposition from medical associations, consumer groups and even insurers -- the same coalition that has blocked congressional Republicans. They say it would raise costs for the sick, while the lower-premium coverage for healthy people would come with significant gaps.

The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Russian hackers used Kaspersky Lab software installed on a NSA contractor’s computer to steal sensitive information. However, the role of Israeli intelligence in uncovering that intrusion and Russian hackers’ broader use of Kaspersky software in the search for U.S. secrets was not previously known, the New York Times said.

The NSA declined to comment on this story when contacted by Fox News.

Last month the Department of Homeland Security banned federal agencies and departments from using Kaspersky Lab products, citing national security concerns. U.S. officials, who alleged ties between the company and Russian intelligence, gave American government agencies and departments 90 days to get rid of Kaspersky Lab software.

Kaspersky Lab has repeatedly denied the allegations that its products are a threat to U.S. national security, a message it reiterated following the New York Times report. “Kaspersky Lab was not involved in and does not possess any knowledge of the situation in question,” it said, in a statement emailed to Fox News. “As the integrity of our products is fundamental to our business, Kaspersky Lab patches any vulnerabilities it identifies or that are reported to the company.”

“Kaspersky Lab reiterates its willingness to work alongside U.S. authorities to address any concerns they may have about its products as well as its systems, and respectfully requests any relevant, verifiable information that would help the company in its own investigation to certifiably refute the false accusations,” it added.

ISRAEL SECURITY CHIEF: TECH PREVENTED MORE THAN 2,000 'LONE-WOLF' TERROR ATTACKS LAST YEAR

The Russian and Israeli governments have not yet responded to a request for comment on this story from Fox News.

Attention is now focused on a mysterious 2015 cyberattack on Kaspersky Lab. A report released by the company in June of that year described the attack as a variant of the existing ‘Duqu’ malware, which it dubbed ‘Duqu 2.0’. While Kasperky Lab’s report made no reference to Israel, security experts have drawn comparisons between Duqu and the Stuxnet worm that crippled Iran's nuclear production in 2010. The U.S. and Israel have been linked to the development of Stuxnet.

“With regards to unverified assertions that this situation relates to Duqu2, a sophisticated cyber-attack of which Kaspersky Lab was not the only target, we are confident that we have identified and removed all of the infections that happened during that incident,” said Kaspersky Lab, in its statement emailed to Fox News. “Kaspersky Lab publicly reported the attack, and the company offered its assistance to affected or interested organizations to help mitigate this threat.”

Nonetheless, the New York Times report of “spies watching spies watching spies” keeps Kaspersky Lab firmly in the cybersecurity spotlight at a time when U.S. lawmakers are closely scrutinizing the Russian company.

Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H, has been a vocal critic of federal government’s use of Kaspersky Lab products. Following the Wall Street Journal report last week, Shaheen wrote a letter to the leadership of the Senate Armed Services Committee requesting a hearing on the matter. Shaheen is a member of the Armed Services Committee.

The number of reported missing persons also rose Wednesday to at least 600 people, up from 200 the day before, authorities said. But they say that number is caused by chaotic conditions making it hard for people to find loved ones and poor communication.

Officials expect the number of missing persons to drop but are asking people to mark themselves as safe on the official registry and alert authorities.

State officials have not yet officially said what caused the blazes that have destroyed at least 3,500 homes and businesses. But dispatch audio obtained by KTVU FOX 2 News reveal firefighters in Napa and Sonoma Counties called in more than a dozen reports of downed power lines, live wires, and blown transformers late Sunday in the first hours of the wildfire outbreak.

Multiple fires were reported by firefighters near the sites of downed power lines and fallen trees.

In one radio exchange between firefighters in Napa County, crews called in downed lines and a blown transformer around 9:15 p.m. Sunday. About 15 minutes later, crews also reported a fire in the same area. It was unclear if that particular fire grew into a larger blaze or was contained, according to KTVU FOX 2.

The owner of the power equipment, Pacific Gas and Electric Company, said in a statement Wednesday ""hurricane-strength winds in excess of 75 mph,"" and ""millions of trees weakened by years of drought and recent renewed vegetation growth from winter storms, all contributed to some trees, branches and debris impacting our electric lines across the North Bay.""

FIRE SURVIVOR GNAWED BY REGRET OVER ELDERLY NEIGHBORS

""In some cases we have found instances of wires down, broken poles and impacted infrastructure. Where those have occurred, we have reported them to our state utility regulator and CalFire,"" the company said. ""Our thoughts are with all those individuals who were impacted by these devastating wildfires. We want our customers, families and friends to know that we will stand beside them and work together throughout this restoration process.""

The company, just like all utility companies in California, is required to keep vegetation more than 10 feet away from its power polls and towers, and to remove flammable debris from around the surrounding ground, according to KTVU FOX 2.

Utility companies in California have previously been found responsible for major wildfires due to inadequate maintenance of their power infrastructure.

The state Public Utilities Commission fined PG&E for $8.3 million in April for failing to maintain a power line that sparked a fire in September 2015 that killed 2 people and destroyed 549 homes, according to the East Bay Times.

CalFire announced last year that it will seek to force PG&E to pay $90 million in firefighting costs for that blaze, the newspaper reported. A spokesperson for the company told the East Bay Times questions about maintenance of the lines in relation to the current wildfires were “highly speculative.”

While authorities work to figure out an official cause of the fires, the blazes could expand Thursday because the area is expecting wind gusts up to 45 mph, with nearly non-existent humidity in areas north of San Francisco.

""It's going to continue to get worse before it gets better,"" state fire Chief Ken Pimlott said Wednesday.

The 22 fires spanned more than 265 square miles, many of them completely out of control. Modern, strategic attacks that have kept destruction and death tolls low in recent years just haven't worked against its ferocity.

CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES MAKE SEARCHING FOR MISSING TOUGH

""We are literally looking at explosive vegetation,"" Pimlott said. ""Make no mistake…this is a serious, critical, catastrophic event.""

Gov. Jerry Brown said the fires were ""one of the biggest, most serious, and it's not over.""

Helicopters and air tankers were assisting thousands of firefighters trying to beat back the flames. Until now, the efforts have focused on ""life safety"" rather than extinguishing the blazes, partly because the flames were shifting with winds and targeting new communities without warning.

Sonoma County Sheriff Robert Giordano said hundreds of people were still reported missing, but officials believe many of those people will be found. Chaotic evacuations and poor communications over the past few days have made locating friends and family difficult.

But the sheriff said he does expect the death toll to climb.

""The devastation is enormous,"" he said. ""We can't even get into most areas.""

Ultimately, the doctors couldn't pinpoint exactly what caused the air escaping out of the girl's respiratory tract.","When the boy band One Direction sang about trying to ""scream out my lungs"" in its ballad ""Moments,"" the group likely wasn't expecting anyone to take the lyrics literally. But one devoted fan's boisterous screams landed her in the emergency room after a concert a few years ago, according to a new case report.

The then-16-year-old girl told doctors that she had been screaming forcefully at the concert when she started to feel short of breath. The next day, her shortness of breath hadn't gone away, so she went to the emergency room.

Initially, the doctors examining the girl didn't think her condition was too severe, said lead case report author Dr. J. Mack Slaughter Jr., who was a resident in emergency medicine at UT Southwestern Medical Center at the time he saw the patient. Though the girl was breathing quickly, her lungs sounded normal, Slaughter Jr. said.

But then, the doctors noticed something odd: When they pressed down on the skin around the girl's chest and neck, it felt like they were crushing Rice Krispies beneath their fingers, Slaughter Jr. told Live Science.

This is a sign called ""crepitus,"" which happens when air gets into the soft tissue beneath the skin. When you press down on it, you can hear a popping or crackling sound.

""It was a really surprising finding,"" Slaughter Jr. said, adding that it was an immediate sign that something was wrong.

A chest X-ray revealed that the girl had air in places where it shouldn't be in the body, including the space around her heart, between the lungs and the walls of her chest, and even in the narrow space behind the back of her throat, according to the report.

When air gets into the space between the lungs and the walls of the chest, the condition is called pneumothorax, or a collapsed lung. ""It's a dramatic term,"" Slaughter Jr. said, but in the girl's case, it was very mild. ""Technically, she had collapsed lungs, but just ever so slightly,"" he added. (In severe cases, the lungs can become so compressed that they can longer adequately exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide in and out of the blood.)

The doctors deduced that the girl's passionate screaming had forced air out of the respiratory tract and into these other cavities. But a lingering question remained: Through what part of the respiratory tract did the air get out?

To find the point of escape, the girl was given a CAT scan. It was possible that there was a tear somewhere along the respiratory tract, Slaughter Jr. said. But the doctors didn't find anything. Another possibility, he said, could be that she had a tiny hole somewhere along the tract that opened up only if enough force was applied — for example, from very intense screaming — and then had sealed shut again.

The girl also had type 1 diabetes, according to the report, and at times, that can put people at risk of air escaping from the respiratory tract into other body cavities, Slaughter Jr. said. This could happen if a person's blood sugar levels are too high, leading the body to produce acidic compounds called ketones. These compounds make the blood very acidic, so the body tries fix the condition by breathing really fast to get rid of the acid. That rapid breathing could lead to tears in the respiratory tract.

But the doctors tested the girl's blood and found she wasn't experiencing this condition, Slaughter Jr. said.

Ultimately, the doctors couldn't pinpoint exactly what caused the air escaping out of the girl's respiratory tract.

The girl stayed in the hospital overnight and was given oxygen, according to the report. The next day, her condition hadn't gotten any worse, and she was allowed to go home. The patient fully recovered, the report said.

The case report was published Oct. 4 in the Journal of Emergency Medicine.

Abedin is familiar in dealing with sex scandal fallouts. Her soon-to-be ex-husband was sentenced to 21 months in prison after he was caught sexting a 15-year-old girl. He pleaded guilty to sending sexually explicit texts to the girl across state lines in May. The sentencing came years after he admitted in a tearful news conference that he accidentally posted a picture of his crotch on Twitter.

Chapman reportedly began reaching out several crisis advisors and public relations experts over the weekend when a New York Times report exposed the allegations against her husband. Weinstein was fired from his own company on Sunday. Chapman said she was leaving her husband of 10 years and making their two children her “first priority.”

Weinstein was spotted heading to an Arizona rehab center as more Hollywood actresses, including Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie and Cara Delevingne, claimed they were sexually harassed by the producer.

Weinstein told Page Six he was “profoundly devastated” about his wife leaving him, but “fully support[s]” her decision.

The country is currently focused on the treatment of women in the entertainment industry on the heels of Harvey Weinstein’s decades-old history of sexual harassment coming to light. Because of this, old footage of Kimmel has resurfaced from before his transformation into the liberal darling of America.

Kimmel was once the co-host of “The Man Show,” which regularly featured bikini-clad women simply jumping on trampolines. This week, a bit from the show circulated in which Kimmel approaching women on the street and asking them to guess what was in his pants.

“I’ve stuffed something in my pants, and you’re allowed to feel around on the outside of the pants. You’ll have 10 seconds to then guess what is in my pants,” Kimmel said to a woman he apparently met on the street. “You should use two hands.”

Later in the bit he asked one woman to “put her mouth on it” and made sure another participant was at least 18 years old because, “Uncle Jimmy doesn’t need to do time.”

The Federalist co-founder Sean Davis tweeted in response to the footage, “Just last week CNN declared Kimmel to be ‘America's conscience.’ Oops.”

Even Kimmel’s boss, Disney CEO Bob Iger has taken notice of the fact that the “Jimmy Kimmel Live” host is essentially a comedian-turned-activist who could polarize viewers.

“That show is to entertain… I think he should be careful"" - Disney CEO Bob Iger

“That show is to entertain… I think he should be careful,” Iger recently told The New York Times.

Kimmel emerged as an outspoken proponent the Republican Congress’ attempt to undo the Affordable Care Act and was even thanked by many liberals when the bill was eventually killed. He recently delivered a monologue regarding the mass shooting in Las Vegas and teared up when discussing what occurred in his hometown. However, he has been largely silent when it comes to Weinstein – perhaps because he has a ton of clips floating around the Internet that appear crude and sexist.

Other popular segments on “The Man Show” include a mock commercial for “Bosom Springs,” a spoof beverage company billed as the water for “wet t-shirts,” and a visit to Snoop Dogg’s house in which Kimmel pointed out that a statue of a female was “just the right height” while he thrusted his groin toward it. The show even featured a “Juggy Talent Show” in which women dressed in bathing suits demonstrated their unique “talents,” such as fitting an entire banana in their mouth.

“The Man Show” featured so many things that most Americans would find offensive in the modern cultural landscape that it’s impossible to name them all. A quick YouTube search reveals Kimmel asking to see people on the street’s underwear, stuffing his pants to make himself appear well endowed and even asking porn stars for household hints on things such as how to get wine out of a wet t-shirt.

“Make sure you get it really wet,” an adult film star said while pouring liquid on herself.

“The Man Show” was created by Kimmel and fellow comedian Adam Carolla and they starred on the Comedy Central program from 1999 until 2003. When Kimmel wasn’t making sexist jokes during that time, he was often in blackface make-up impersonating African-American NBA legend Karl Malone. Kimmel left and soon after landed at ABC, where he cleaned up his act and started hosting “Jimmy Kimmel Live.”

ABC’s late-night star was a fairly run-of-the-mill, non-political talk show host for the first 10-plus years of the shows run, famous for pulling practical jokes on celebrities and having Hollywood elite read mean tweets about themselves. Once of the show’s more notable segments involved Kimmel joking that he was “f***ing Ben Affleck,” who recently had to apologize for his own groping scandal.

It all changed in early 2017 when Kimmel detailed the open-heart surgery his newborn son, William, had to undergo. He explained that many children wouldn’t of had the opportunity to survive without the Affordable Care Act. Mediaite columnist Joseph A. Wulfsohn asked why the ABC host hasn’t delivered an “emotional monologue on sexual harassment in Hollywood.”

“He cries that everyone should have health care and that guns are the problem without providing any real solutions, yet he’s silent on the out-of-control abuse women have faced in showbiz for years,” Wulfsohn wrote. “He’s a coward.”",Jimmy Kimmel was a vulgar comic long before he was 'America's conscience',https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/12/jimmy-kimmel-was-vulgar-comic-long-before-was-americas-conscience.html

An immigration debate at Seattle University School of Law is a plague of a different sort, but deadly in a different way. The victim here is the right to free speech.

The Washington Free Beacon reports that Annette Clark, the dean of Seattle University’s Law School, has revoked the school’s sponsorship of a Federalist Society event. The reason? The proposed debate on immigration, hosted by the school’s Access to Justice Institute, might be “harmful” to minority students and “undocumented immigrants,” aka people who broke the law to get to America, though we are not supposed to talk like that these days.

At first I thought it was a joke. It is. But a joke played on those elites who claim to believe in tolerance, academic freedom and inclusion. Dean Clark’s edict reflects her and the school’s intolerance, academic propaganda and exclusion of any view that does not conform to the university’s imposed ideology. Isn’t this the stuff of re-education camps and gulags?

Many college campuses claim devotion to diversity, while practicing and imposing conformity. To them, diversity has to do with skin color, ethnicity and sexual orientation. It is secular liberalism dressed up in different garb. Real diversity would include people of different opinions.

At Seattle U’s Law School, the Federalist Society, a conservative organization that believes in an originalist view of the Constitution, was preparing for an immigration debate. The last I checked a debate is supposed to include opposing points of view. The purpose of a debate is to inform people so they can decide which view is superior to the other. In the ’80s, these were the kinds of debates in which I participated on many college campuses. With only a few exceptions I was granted a respectful hearing, as was my debate opponent. Often we would attend a dinner before the debate, or a reception afterward, where students and faculty could observe us interacting with decorum, humor and mutual respect.

Invitations to college campuses began disappearing in the ’90s and I haven’t had any since. The stories of high-profile speakers being denied the right to speak or shouted down and demonstrated against should they actually make it onto a campus are legion.

The kind of censorship practiced in Seattle is not unique to that school either. It is trending across the country. Increasingly, campuses have become “safe spaces” so that “snowflakes” will not be troubled by ideas that rattle their still developing brains, which should, instead of stagnating, constantly evolve. If they think they already know everything, why spend time and money going to college?

The greater question is this: Why do so many parents, especially conservative parents, send their children to schools that undermine their faith and values, distort history and promote causes that will not help them get a job once they graduate? A corollary question: Why do students take on so much debt to attend universities where their “consciences” might be raised on the liberal side, but where they are shielded from what real life looks like?

Nat Hentoff, the late liberal journalist and social critic, said the answer to speech you don’t like is not less speech, but more speech.

Hudek, who was arrested in July for trying to pry open an exit door on his flight from Seattle to China, and also for assaulting the passengers and flight attendants who tried to restrain him, told a federal magistrate judge on Tuesday that he consumed edible marijuana before the flight, which caused his outburst.

""My understanding is that it was legal to buy and consume marijuana in [Washington] state,"" Hudek wrote in an affidavit, per the Tampa Bay Times. ""After purchasing the edible marijuana, I ate it.""

""I have never had a remotely similar incident in all my times of flying on an airplane,"" he added.

Hudek’s doctor, too, attested in an affidavit that cannabis could induce ""paranoia, confusion, hallucinations and combativeness"" in users.

This, along with other statements from Hudek’s friends, family and two more physicians, was evidently enough to persuade Magistrate Judge James Donohue, of Washington, to release Hudek, 23, to the custody of his mother in Tampa, reports The Seattle Times.

There’s a catch, however. Hudek is not allowed to fly back to Tampa, and must instead drive or travel by train. He is also not allowed to use marijuana.

Hudek first made headlines this summer, after causing a disturbance aboard a July 6 flight from Seattle to Beijing. Authorities say Hudek left his seat about an hour into the flight, while the plane was over the Pacific Ocean, just northwest of Vancouver Island. He then entered the restroom, exited to ask a question of the flight attendant, re-entered the restroom, and later re-emerged with his shirt off, according to documents obtained by the Tampa Bay Times. He then lunged for the exit door, screaming, “I want to get out!”

Flight attendants and passengers tried to subdue Hudek as he actively fought them off, punching a flight attendant and hitting another passenger on the head with a wine bottle. A crew member also claimed to have broken a wine bottle over Hudek’s head, which apparently didn’t faze the 23-year-old.

Menendez, who was indicted in April 2015, is currently facing 12 counts of corruption charges that include bribery.

Thankfully, this go round is not fatal. But a year ago I was rushed into an ICU with my blood oxygen level steadily declining below 90 percent, and my lungs slowly suffocating me. And as nurses were sticking needles in my arms and pumping me full of fluids, doctors were calling my wife to tell her they thought she had lung cancer.

I have to tell you that American politics really does not matter when you have kids and are dying. You begin to seriously ask yourself what you want your kids to know if you’re gone.

I was far more worried about my kids’ relationship with God and their mother than about their politics or the political fight of the day. American politics today is such small ball gutter politics. The stakes are so small that the fights are all that matter. And I want my kids to have no part of that. Sure, there are fights that matter. But there are many more fights you think matter than actually do.

Having very nearly died, my priorities have taken more than a small shift in the last year. I’d rather be preaching than blogging. My faith is way more important to me, but my kids faith is way more important to me than my own. They are the priority.

So I set out to write them letters about the things I want them to know. I want them to know what I called David Souter and how it affected not just my life, but their mother’s. I want them to know about where I grew up and why I have raised them as I have. I even want them to know their favorite recipes.

Second, what on earth does the NRA have to do with your mistreatment of women?
It’s hard to exaggerate the hypocrisy of Weinstein in attacking the NRA as somehow germane to his personal problems.
To Harvey Weinstein: like Wesley in Forrest Gump, your misdirection won’t get you off the hook for your own misdeeds against real-life “Jennys.”","In the movie ""Forrest Gump,"" the vulnerable character Jenny is violently smacked by her unlikable and smug hippie boyfriend Wesley, the fictitious head of the Berkeley’s Students for a Democratic Society. Thankfully Forrest, resplendent in full military dress and wearing his fresh Medal of honor, intervenes and pummels Wesley, stopping the abuse. Wesley later half-apologizes to Jenny saying “things got a little out of hand…it’s just this war, and that lying son of a bitch [President] Johnson!”

Talk about misdirection! This scene came to mind when I read Harvey Weinstein’s inane explanation on Thursday, October 5 of his past abuse of women. He had the temerity to blame shift away from his own behavior to…wait for it…the NRA. Perhaps I shouldn’t be surprised as Hollywood liberals love to castigate America’s largest and oldest civil rights organization. But Harvey’s statement took the scapegoating to a new level. He wrote “I am going to need a place to channel that anger so I’ve decided I’m going to give the NRA my full attention. I hope [NRA CEO] Wayne LaPierre will enjoy his retirement party.”

What on earth does the NRA have to do with Weinstein's mistreatment of women?

Incredible. First, why, pray tell, do you have any right to be “angry,” Harvey? If myriad reports are credible, then at the least, you serially abused women psychologically and used your position of incredible Hollywood power to sexually harass them -- and perhaps even much worse. Second, what on earth does the NRA have to do with your mistreatment of women?

If anything, the NRA empowers women as it consistently defends their right to bear arms so that they are NOT victimized by male assailants who may use physical strength to abuse women. It’s hard to exaggerate the hypocrisy of Weinstein in attacking the NRA as somehow germane to his personal problems.

To that point of hypocrisy, Chris Cox, the director of the NRA Institute for Legislative Action, told me “the NRA’s spent millions teaching safe and responsible gun ownership while Harvey’s made a fortune off of movies that many find grotesquely glamorize gun violence. At the same time, he’s reportedly spent decades assaulting women and now he wants to lecture us about morality.”

To be fair, Weinstein is hardly alone in this hypocrisy. Rosie O’Donnell once said “I don’t care if you want to hunt. I don’t care if you think it’s your right…you are not allowed to have a gun.” Shortly after this statement, her bodyguard applied for a concealed gun permit. More recently, Jimmy Kimmel has regularly scolded Americans who believe in the Second Amendment, and yet his show has reportedly ramped up its security detail of off-duty police, presumably armed.

Memo to Hollywood: tens of millions of working class Americans cannot afford professional security. They enthusiastically embrace their Constitutional right to bear arms…for protection, for sport, for collecting – and we neither need nor appreciate the condescension and disrespect from elites.

A staff writer with Deadspin reported that the public information officer with the Colorado Springs Police Department told him to stop calling regarding the defecating female jogger whose story went viral in September.

However, Lt. Howard Black told Fox News on Wednesday that it’s “absurd” that anyone would be discouraged from calling the department about a story and an incident.

“There is no update. I am just not going to be doing interviews,” he added. “Our concern is that this individual be identified.”

While the U.S. stopped funding UNESCO after it voted to include Palestine as a member in 2011, the State Department has maintained a UNESCO office at its Paris headquarters and sought to weigh in on policy behind the scenes. The withdrawal was confirmed Thursday by U.S. officials speaking on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to be publicly named discussing the decision. It was not clear when the move would be formally announced.

The decision comes as the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization is voting to choose a new director this week, in tense balloting overshadowed by the agency's funding troubles and divisions over Palestinian membership.

Many saw the vote to include Palestine as evidence of long-running, ingrained anti-Israel bias within the United Nations, where Israel and its allies are far outnumbered by Arab countries and their supporters.

UNESCO is best known for its World Heritage program to protect cultural sites and traditions around the world. The agency also works to improve education for girls in desperately poor countries and in scientific fields, to promote better understanding of the horrors of the Holocaust and to defend media freedom, among other activities.

The Trump administration has been preparing for a likely withdrawal for months, and a decision was expected before the end of the year, according to U.S. officials. Several diplomats who were to have been posted to the mission this summer were told that their positions were on hold and advised to seek other jobs.

Faulkner added, “Three years ago, we enhanced cable news with a show that combines news and opinion, predominantly from the female point of view, and immediately, Outnumbered became the number one show in its timeslot. I am proud of the work we’re continuing to do there, and blessed to have this added opportunity to create a new program that will help inform our viewers and keep them engaged in a conversation surrounding the day’s headlines.”

Bruce Hornsby could be heard at Key West’s Mallory Square as a “reclamation party” got underway, Thursday afternoon. The feeling was positive and the outlook was bright.

Hours later, Key West Mayor Craig Cates came in to Two Friends Patio Restaurant for dinner, as nearby Duval Street began to show signs of life.

“Key West is going to be open for business soon,” said Cates.

When asked about the higher volume of people out and about, the mayor replied, “Well, we’re taking visitors now. We haven’t advertised yet,” he said.

Cates, however, pointed out that the hardest hit parts of the Keys are still picking up the pieces from Irma’s devastation. “We understand our neighbors to the north in the Florida Keys got more damage than us,” he said.

In nearby Big Pine Key, the cleanup is still ongoing.

Among those cleaning up are 85-year-old Wes Harris and his wife. “We’ve been married 63 years,” he said.

The couple rode out the storm near their now beat-up home.

The wheelchair ramp into Harris’ home was just recently repaired by first responders, but there’s still so much more to do.

“See that rock? You see how big that rock is?” Harris said as he pointed to a large boulder in his yard. “That’s not my rock. I don’t know where the hell it came from.”

The legally blind U.S. Army veteran, who suffers from spinal stenosis, lost his orchid ranch, which he says had between 7,000 and 8,000 flowers.

Harris is so tough that the idea of getting a little emotional over the relief effort in the aftermath of the storm makes him annoyed.

“I just can’t believe how everybody has helped. It’s absolutely unbelievable,” Harris said.

Harris’ post-storm story isn’t necessarily unique. Residents told 7News about problems with their house, their boat, or in some cases, both.

Big names also came to help out the Keys, in the form of former football player Tim Tebow and U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.

“So many people are so tough, and what they’ve gone through,” said Tebow. “You know what’s even more special? So many people, who don’t know what’s even going on with their houses, but they’re still volunteering for other people that need help.”

Residents appreciated Tebow’s visit. “He’s such a huge model for me, so it’s a nice thing that he came down here to the Keys,” said one woman.

7News cameras captured Rubio posing for pictures, as food, ice and relief supplies got to those in need.

When asked what he would say to those residents who fear they may be forgotten, Rubio responded: “They won’t be forgotten by us — I don’t know if someone else will — primarily because we’ve spent a lot of time, personally, in the Keys, up and down this place. I mean my family, we’ve had so many incredible memories here. We want to see the Keys come back.”

Meanwhile, Harris indicated he will make it through that strong current called adversity, probably because of his big heart. “You’ve got to keep stroking, bud. That’s all you can do,” he said.

As the reclamation party begins in Key West, many residents feel that, because the cleanup is still underway, the party is happening too soon. however, others feel that it needs to happen to show that the Florida Keys are still alive.

Officials said tourism will return to Key West in a limited capacity on Sunday with the arrival of a cruise ship at the Margaritaville Pier. It is scheduled to arrive at noon.

Identifying quality wood furniture can be difficult these days. Many pieces look great in the store, only to prove flimsy once you get them home and start to use them. Here’s what to look for, and what to avoid, when shopping for your next piece of wood furniture.

When made with high-quality materials and solid construction, wood furniture can last for decades and sometimes even centuries. But not everything you see in stores is built to last. Buy something that’s made poorly and you’ll start to see wear and tear way too soon. How can you tell the difference? It’s harder than you might think. The first thing to pay attention to is the wood itself.

Solid wood. The highest-quality material for wood furniture is solid wood. This type of furniture will be made from single pieces of wood or wood boards that are glued together to make panels — trees are only so wide, after all. If something is described as being made with solid wood, find out if that describes the entire piece or just certain parts.

Hardwood. Solid wood can be categorized as either hardwood or softwood. Hardwood comes from slower-growing trees and the wood is denser and more resistant to dings. Common hardwoods include oak, ash, walnut, cherry and maple.

Softwood. Softwood comes from faster-growing trees and the wood is less dense. Some common softwoods are pine, fir and poplar. Since these trees grow faster, furniture made using their wood tends to be less expensive than pieces made from hardwood.

Domestic wood. Domestic wood comes from trees that are grown and processed in the United States. Common domestic wood species include oak, maple, cherry, walnut, ash, poplar and pine.

A quick note about how wood is described: The species can describe either the material or the stain color. So something described as walnut might be stained that color but actually be made from pine. This isn’t necessarily bad — just make sure you know what you’re getting. You shouldn’t be paying walnut prices for a piece of furniture made from less-expensive wood.

Imported wood. A lot of imported furniture is made from tropical wood species such as rubberwood (sometimes known as plantation hardwood), mango, acacia or sheesham (a type of rosewood). These species can produce a sturdy piece of furniture, but they may be susceptible to cracking if they’re coming from a humid environment to a drier one.

Benefits of solid wood. Ensuring that your furniture is 100 percent solid wood is a pretty fail-safe way to know that you’re purchasing something high-quality. Solid wood construction is extremely long-lasting and can be easily refinished and repaired down the road.

Cons of solid wood. Solid wood is definitely the best choice for furniture but, as with any natural material, there can be downsides. Solid wood is more susceptible to changes in climate, which may cause it to crack or warp. It’s also more expensive than furniture made from engineered wood products.

Plywood. Plywood (sometimes called engineered hardwood) is made by gluing together thin layers of solid wood. When used in furniture construction, plywood is covered with a thin layer of stained and finished wood — a veneer.

Pros of plywood. The main benefit of plywood is that it’s stable when the climate changes and is less likely to warp or crack in dry climates. It can also give you a sturdy piece of furniture at a lower cost than solid wood.

Cons of plywood. Sometimes the quality of plywood comes down to the quality of the veneer. Poor-quality veneers can chip, revealing the lower-quality wood underneath. Damage may also be difficult to repair since the bulk of the furniture is made using a different wood species than the veneer. Also, some plywood is made using chemicals with formaldehyde, which can affect indoor air quality, although formaldehyde-free plywood is available.

MDF. Medium-density fiberboard is made from wood waste products (basically sawdust) that have been mixed with resins. The mixture is compressed to create large, flat boards. For furniture, MDF is finished with a layer of real-wood veneer or non-wood laminate.

Pros and cons of MDF. There are more cons than pros when you’re talking about MDF furniture. Pieces made from it are less expensive than those made of solid wood or plywood, which makes them budget-friendly. However, MDF requires a lot of chemicals to make and is the highest-formaldehyde-emitting wood product out there. Other downsides: It can easily be damaged by water, it’s difficult to repair, it doesn’t hold screws very well and it’s heavy.

Particle board. Made similarly to MDF, particle board uses larger wood scraps to create boards. You can differentiate particle board from MDF by spotting the pockets of air when looking at it from the side.

Pros and cons of particle board. The one thing particle board has going for it is that it’s inexpensive. And then there are the downsides: It emits formaldehyde, requires a lot of chemicals to produce, is susceptible to moisture damage and really doesn’t hold screws well. Particle board furniture tends to loosen up quickly, resulting in wobbles.

Veneers. A veneer is a thin sheet of real wood that is applied to the outside of a piece of wood furniture. It can be added to any of the wood products mentioned above. Veneers are used when you want to match up wood grain to create a design, or to cover a lower-cost piece of furniture.

Selecting veneered furniture. Veneer quality varies widely. Look for those that are thicker, have good adhesion and are glued to solid wood or plywood as opposed to MDF or particle board. Poorly done veneers can peel and chip.

Isn’t Michelle Obama adorable? She actually thinks she is a typical woman in the United States, and that she can speak for all of us.

Michelle says she has no interest in running for president, trying to shatter what Hillary Clinton called the “highest and hardest glass ceiling,” but she might consider bursting out of that elitist, condescending Beltway Bubble.

Speaking recently at the Pennsylvania Conference for Women, Obama pushed women to speak up for themselves in the workplace. “Don’t waste your seat at the table,” she said. “If you are scared to use your voice, then you’ve got to get up and give it to someone who isn’t afraid to use the spot.”

""This event underscores the turbulent times we're living in when senseless killings are taken to such an extreme level,"" radio music exec Mike McVay told Fox News. ""You'd find many in the country music community supportive of the right to bear arms.

""There will be a debate,"" added McVay, EVP of content and Programming for Cumulus Media and Westwood One. ""We'll know more in a couple of weeks how it's going to change.""

The debate has already started; Caleb Keefer, the guitarist for the Josh Abbott Band, who performed at the Route 91 Harvest Festival hours before the shooting occurred, spoke out in favor of gun control on Monday.

""I've been a proponent of the 2nd amendment my entire life,"" Keefer wrote on Twitter. ""Until the events of last night. I cannot express how wrong I was...We need gun control RIGHT. NOW.""

Echoing Keefer's statements is the daughter of country music legend Johnny Cash, Rosanne Cash, a longtime advocate for gun control, who penned an op-ed urging her fellow musicians to take action.

Cash said the National Rifle Association (NRA) ""funds domestic terrorism"" and country music artists associated with its group ""NRA Country"" must speak up against it.

""For the past few decades, the National Rifle Association has increasingly nurtured an alliance with country music artists and their fans. You can see it in 'N.R.A.

Country star Luke Bryan seemed to want to keep the focus on the victims. When asked about the tragedy on ""Good Morning America"" Wednesday alongside his fellow ""American Idol"" judges, Bryan steered clear of politics.

The $50 costume — like other unauthorized costumes — does not officially use “Stranger Things” in the title, but the likeness to Eleven, played by 13-year-old Millie Bobby Brown, is indisputable. Brown, as Eleven, appeared on the Netflix series wearing a blonde wig, a pink dress with a high collar, and a jacket. The character also had a fondness for frozen waffles. The costume, called the Upside Down Honey — a reference to the show's alternate ""Upside Down"" universe — consists of a blonde wig, a pink dress, a jacket and a waffle-shaped purse.

The model in the costume also suffered from Eleven's same affliction: a bloody nose.

The costume's pink dress, however, has been shortened significantly, and the high collar has been lowered. The tennis shoes Brown wears have also been replaced with tan pumps, though the shoes themselves are not included with the costume.

While the U.S. stopped funding UNESCO after it voted to include Palestine as a member in 2011, the State Department has maintained a UNESCO office at its Paris headquarters and sought to weigh in on policy behind the scenes. The withdrawal was confirmed Thursday by U.S. officials speaking on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to be publicly named discussing the decision. It was not clear when the move would be formally announced.

The decision comes as the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization is voting to choose a new director this week, in tense balloting overshadowed by the agency's funding troubles and divisions over Palestinian membership.

Many saw the vote to include Palestine as evidence of long-running, ingrained anti-Israel bias within the United Nations, where Israel and its allies are far outnumbered by Arab countries and their supporters.

UNESCO is best known for its World Heritage program to protect cultural sites and traditions around the world. The agency also works to improve education for girls in desperately poor countries and in scientific fields, to promote better understanding of the horrors of the Holocaust and to defend media freedom, among other activities.

The Trump administration has been preparing for a likely withdrawal for months, and a decision was expected before the end of the year, according to U.S. officials. Several diplomats who were to have been posted to the mission this summer were told that their positions were on hold and advised to seek other jobs.

Rock also published a Facebook post slamming “the extreme left” for accusing him of bigotry despite his history of philanthropy in Detroit.

And just last week, Rock made another political speech during a concert at the Fish Fry festival in Nashville, talking about the Las Vegas massacre and honoring U.S. service members and the American flag.

""It's just a show of true testimony that – everybody being here and all the love in this place tonight – that nobody's scared to come out,"" Rock said, Rolling Stone magazine reported.

The outspokenness of the two stars, and their common connection to Michigan, has many fans calling for a politically charged rap battle or, less seriously, a showdown in a U.S. Senate race.

Their home turf -- Detroit’s suburban Macomb County – is a source of constant fascination for pollsters and pundits trying to take the pulse of white Middle America, Politico reported.

The county is heavily working class and its voters comfortably backed the Democratic Party in the 1960s. But with increasing cultural alienation, the county flipped to being Republicans, giving birth to the “Reagan Democrats” -- those who favor the social values of the GOP but prefer Democratic economic policies.

In their years on HGTV’s show, ""Fixer Upper,"" hosts Chip and Joanna Gaines achieved far more than merely getting Americans to embrace open floor plans and shiplap; they made marriage look fun again.

The Texas couple’s decision to end the show after soon-to-be-aired Season Five ensures it won’t devolve into them simply playing certain roles, trying to recapture the magic of earlier seasons.

Along the way, thanks to the pairing of Joanna’s gift for interior design and Chip’s skilled construction craftsmanship, they made a lot of beautiful homes—showing concretely how the teamwork of marriage could create something bigger.

“This is just us recognizing that we need to catch our breath for a moment,” the Gaineses wrote on their blog. “Our plan is to take this time to shore up and strengthen the spots that are weak, rest the places that are tired and give lots of love and attention to both our family and our businesses.” In a video accompanying their blog post, Joanna spoke specifically about how quickly the couple’s four children were growing, noting that their eldest was almost a teenager and expressing how they were ready to “hunker down with our kiddos” for a time.

This is exactly what made the Gaineses so appealing. They do care about time with their family—and they’re not the kind of reality TV professionals who want to turn their family into a permanent fixture on the screen by being “on” all the time. Part of the couple’s appeal has always been their family-friendliness, their down-to-earth qualities, and the clear priority they give to living in accordance with their values.

But their decision to end the show is also appealing because the Gaineses themselves have changed: in the years since ""Fixer Upper"" began, they’ve become involved in multiple home goods lines, launched a magazine, written a book, and even opened a bakery in their hometown of Waco, Texas. While I’m happy for the Gaines’ success, the fact is they’re not the same couple facing regular problems that they were when the show launched—and frankly, yes, a reality show true to their own current reality (exploring questions like what mega chain is worth trusting for a home goods line partnership, for example) would simply not be as relatable or enjoyable to watch.

But I’m grateful for the years they gave us on ""Fixer Upper.""

There’s a real dearth of shows or, frankly, any entertainment that depicts marriage as fun. And while no doubt the Gaineses amped it up a little for the camera, the dynamics under-girding the show—the push and pull between the goofy Chip and the more serious Joanna—certainly seemed authentic, as did the joy they had in just hanging out with each other, occasionally trying to get a rise out of one another.

Along the way, thanks to the pairing of Joanna’s gift for interior design and Chip’s skilled construction craftsmanship, they made a lot of beautiful homes—showing concretely how the teamwork of marriage could create something bigger.

In her 2011 book, ""Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?"" TV writer and actress Mindy Kaling included a section, “C’mon, Married People,” in which she wrote:

""I don’t want to hear about the endless struggles to keep sex exciting, or the work it takes to plan a date night. I want to hear that you guys watch every episode of The Bachelorettetogether in secret shame, or that one got the other hooked on Breaking Bad and if either watches it without the other, they’re dead meat. I want to see you guys high-five each other like teammates on a recreational softball team you both do for fun. I’m not saying that marriage should always be easy. But we seem to get so gloomily worked up about it these days.""

Kaling, whose own show ""The Mindy Project"" unfortunately devolved into a gloomy look at the hardships of relationships these days, concluded with the following plea:

“Married people, it’s up to you. It’s entirely on your shoulders to keep this sinking institution afloat. It’s a stately old ship, and a lot of people, like me, want to get on board. Please be psyched, and convey that psychedness to us.”

And that’s exactly what the Gaineses have done on ""Fixer Upper."" In an era when marriage rates are down, people flirt with notions of open marriages and polygamy, and singles scour Tinder for one-night-stands, a show about home renovation unexpectedly became a celebration of how a husband and wife could be friends and partners, could complement each other and have a genuinely good time just hanging out with each other. In their interactions with each other and their four children, the Gaineses proved happiness isn’t impossible for an old-fashioned family in our modern era.",What Chip and Joanna Gaines teach us about marriage,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/05/what-chip-and-joanna-gaines-teach-us-about-marriage.html

-- Supreme Court of the United States in Street v. New York (1969)

Sometimes the public expression of unwanted ideas reaches directly into our living rooms. When President Donald Trump attacked a half-dozen or so professional football players who, instead of standing during the traditional playing of the national anthem prior to football games, “took a knee” by kneeling on one or both of their knees during the anthem, hundreds more players on national television took a knee in defiance of the president.

Here is the back story.

Last year, a quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, Colin Kaepernick, began quietly taking a knee at NFL games to protest what he said was the excessive use of force by police. He was the subject of mild but largely below-the-radar criticism by those who thought sincerely that taking a knee publicly during the playing of the national anthem was a sign of disrespect for the flag and the anthem and thus for this country.

When a few of his buddies and former colleagues -- he is no longer a member of an NFL team -- followed suit for a variety of reasons, all of which centered around the right to protest the policies of the government, Trump saw a political opening.

At a rally in Alabama last month, Trump aggressively attacked the practice of taking a knee. He argued that it was so disrespectful to the American flag and the national anthem that those who had taken a knee should be fired from their jobs.

This pronouncement focused a spotlight on the six or so scattered players who had followed Kaepernick’s lead, and soon hundreds were doing so. The president took their behavior as an affront to him and to the nation, and he persisted in his attacks on the players. Soon, some team owners joined their players in various means of expressing solidarity with those who had taken a knee.

When the players union backed up these silent expressions of political opinions, it argued that all of its members have a constitutional right to express themselves in uniform in their workplace. Do they? The short answer is that it depends on where the players are when they take a knee.

Some jurisdictions -- such as California, the District of Columbia, New Jersey and New York -- give more protection to employees for expressive conduct in the workplace than others do. When the expressive conduct -- taking a knee, bowing one's head, locking arms with colleagues -- occurs in the workplace, the issue is not necessarily one of free speech, because the First Amendment only comes into play when the government itself is accused of infringing upon or compelling speech. In the NFL, the alleged infringers of speech or compellers of speech are team management, not the government.

Expressive conduct -- lawful behavior that offers a political opinion -- is the constitutional equivalent of free speech. So interfering with expressive conduct or commanding its cessation in conformity to management’s political or patriotic views constitutes interfering with speech. May employers do that?

In states where expressive conduct in the workplace is protected, employees may express themselves as long as they do not materially interfere with the business of the workplace. In states without that employee protection, they may not do so.

So in states such as Texas, an employee who refuses to comply with an instruction from management to conform to certain behavior in public -- e.g., standing during the playing of the national anthem -- can be disciplined, as Texas lacks the added protections for individual workplace expressions that a few states provide.

However, even in the states that lack the employee expression protection, if management’s instructions to conform require conformance on property that the government owns, such as a publicly owned stadium, then management is treated constitutionally as if it were the government. Just as the government cannot interfere with speech to suppress its content or to compel conformity, neither may team management when teams play on government-owned land.

Thus, in states where the government owns the stadiums or where expressive conduct in the workplace is protected, employees may engage in expressive conduct in defiance of management, as long as their conduct does not interfere with the workplace. Just as the government may interfere with speech for non-content-related reasons -- for example, noise at night or safety in a crowd -- management may interfere with speech when the speech itself interferes with the business of the workplace.

If team management could show that taking a knee materially interferes with the workplace product -- money for the owners resulting from players winning football games -- because it chases away ticket buyers or reduces advertising or media revenue or impairs team morale and thus produces poor play, it would have a strong case, even in the states with employee protection laws and even in venues owned by the government.

In the famous flag burning cases a few years ago, the Supreme Court made clear that in America, we have no revered symbols that command orthodox respect. The flag itself represents the right to treat it as one wishes. We are free to respect the flag and to shun those who do not, but we may not harm a hair on their heads.

I am with the French philosopher Voltaire, who, regarding folks who had literally lost their heads, is reputed to have said, “I disagree with what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.”",Judge Andrew Napolitano: Is taking a knee protected speech?,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/12/judge-andrew-napolitano-is-taking-knee-protected-speech.html

A teacher unwittingly saved the life of a 6-year-old student after urging her to get an eye test - which revealed a massive brain tumor.

Nia Ferris, 31, noticed something was wrong with Evie Hughes' vision and advised her parents to consult an optician in case she needed glasses.

But they were stunned to be told their daughter was completely blind in one eye because of a slow-growing tumor which had probably been there since birth.

Evie was rushed to Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool, where she underwent emergency surgery this week to remove the growth.

Ferris, a teacher at Ysgol Morfa Nefyn school in Gwynedd, north west Wales, said she was shocked to realize the problem was down to a tumor.

""I spotted something in one of her eyes,"" she said. ""I wouldn't say it was lazy - but it wasn't pointing in the same direction as the other.

""I let her father know when he came to pick her up that day and said he should probably get it checked out at the opticians,"" she said. ""Obviously I was totally shocked to find out that it was a brain tumor.""

Her parents Heather, 33, and Geraint, 36, have praised Ferris for her actions.

""Her teacher pointed out that one of her eyes was a little slower responding when she looked around,"" Heather said. ""We hadn't noticed. We went to see the opticians on Tuesday to see if she needed glasses. We were then told that she was completely blind in her left eye.""

""They told us the eye is probably going to stay like that because the optic nerve has gone completely pale because of the tumor,"" she said. ""The doctors told us the tumor has probably been there since she was born, but has been slow-growing.""

After a spell in Ysbyty Gwynedd Hospital in Bangor, Evie was transferred to Alder Hey Children's Hospital, in Liverpool, last Friday.

She is scheduled to undergo surgery to remove the tumor this week.

They have been sending us messages to check up on Evie every day and they alerted us to the problem in the first place. It could have been a lot worse had they not spotted it, so we can't thank them enough.""

Within three days an online crowd-funding campaign had raised nearly $1,000 to support the family, who live in Pen Llŷn, north west Wales.

Heather added that they had been left in disbelief at the level of response.

Any move to decertify the Iran deal will take away the momentum needed to confront this clear and present danger.
And that is the key promise President Trump made—to make America “first” again.
And that means keeping America in the Iran deal.","There was always a basic problem with the so-called Iran nuclear deal inked back in 2015 that was never going to be resolved: Washington and Tehran have vastly different interests across the Middle East. It was never going to be easy to somehow compartmentalize the relationship, to in some way come to terms over Iran’s nuclear program but not resolve countless other issues that have always driven these two nations apart. And it could someday tear the deal to shreds.

But sheer necessity dictates that now is not the time for such an action. In fact, I would argue a move by President Trump to ‘decertify’ the agreement is against America’s national interests.

To be brutally honest, The Islamic Republic of Iran is no friend of the United States—period. Its regional aspirations are nothing short of an attempt to become the dominant power in the Middle East and displace America from the region. The regime is a state-sponsor of terror that will use whatever brutal and violent means it can to achieve its objectives. And it’s no secret that Iran is a human rights-abuser of the worst kind, even working with fellow pariah-state North Korea to develop advanced missile platforms that could someday target U.S. forces in the region.

But the deal that President Obama made with Tehran back in 2015—wrinkles and all—is worth keeping for a very pragmatic, realistic reason: the Trump Administration has much bigger problems on its plate.

Decertifying the deal now—with the danger of Tehran building nuclear weapons that are now pushed out at least a decade or more under the deal—would take away much needed bandwidth from confronting much bigger challenges Team Trump must address that are of much more critical domestic and international importance. And considering the very real possibility that decertifying the deal could very well put both nations on the path towards potential conflict—if Tehran attempts to make a run towards nuclear weapons, fearing an eventual U.S. move towards regime change—President Trump must make the hard choice to stay the course.

I would identify five core problems Team Trump needs to tackle right now—all that could be in jeopardy of being marginalized if tensions with Iran were to come to a head thanks to decertification. These include:

A Stalled Domestic Agenda: President Trump is unstoppable when he hammers away at his opponents on the issues that turned him from a 150/1 underdog to our nation’s 45th president. Americans voted for Donald Trump because he promised to end our illegal immigration crisis and secure the border, to repeal ObamaCare once and for all, to modernize the tax code and rebuild our badly neglected infrastructure. He needs to press ahead to enact that agenda—period. A confrontation with Iran now could very well use up all the vital political capitol he will need to expend to make his promises the law of the land. And nothing could be more important—and go a long way to seeing him reelected. Getting mixed up in a crisis with Iran could doom this agenda—forever.

North Korea: Now armed with nuclear weapons that our own military commanders are assuming have the capability to hit the U.S. homeland, North Korea is an existential threat President Trump needs to make his top foreign policy priority. There is nothing more important—nothing.

Any move to decertify the Iran deal will take away the momentum needed to confront this clear and present danger. The administration is already in the process of trying to build a global coalition to isolate Pyongyang economically, financially and diplomatically. Team Trump will also likely need to move more offensive military assets into Northeast Asia over the long-term, increase its missile defense capabilities in Asia and at home, as well as convince China to enforce all sanctions and bring the Kim regime to the bargaining table. A self-created crisis with Iran could very well endanger these efforts, and ensure North Korea is a nuclear weapons state for many years to come.

A Rising China: While the world might be rightly transfixed over the North Korea crisis, over the long-term, America will also need to formulate a grand strategy to deal with a rising China. Beijing now has the second largest economy in the world and a military machine to match. With China’s President Xi Jinping pushing his nation's influence into all corners of Asia -- from parts of the former Soviet Union to essentially turning the South China Sea into its own Lake Beijing -- China is on the cusp of superpower status. With countless issues between us and a big presidential visit to Asia coming in the next few weeks, taking on Iran now would once again reinforce a narrative Asian diplomats here in Washington constantly repeat over and over—that Washington is slowly losing Asia to China and is obsessed with the Middle East.

ISIS: While defeat of the Islamic State seems a near certainty—and a national interest we share with Iran—we must keep our focus on destroying the caliphate as our number one objective in the Middle East. As the Islamic State morphs from dying nation-state into a terror network flung all over the globe, America must continue to press forward in making sure ISIS never regains any ground. Needlessly confronting Iran now would endanger such a goal.

Trade: President Trump was speaking truth to power when he argued that America needed fairer trade practices that put our nation's workers first. The administration is working hard to modernize NAFTA, partnering with Asian nations like South Korea and Vietnam to correct job-crushing trade imbalances, and potentially working towards new Free Trade Agreements with some of our closest allies like Japan. All of these goals will require a focused administration that will need to drive some very hard bargains, bargains that will take much time and energy. If Washington were to decertify the deal with Iran and a crisis were to ensue, not only would it have an impact on our Asian allies, but there simply might not be any political bandwidth to make these deals a reality.

Smart foreign policy is always keeping in mind prioritization, ensuring that America’s national interests are front and center. And that is the key promise President Trump made—to make America “first” again. And that means keeping America in the Iran deal.",The conservative case to keep the Iran deal,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/12/conservative-case-to-keep-iran-deal.html

Excess space is a luxury that most of us do not enjoy while our kids are living at home. But many of my clients find that once their grown children have moved out of the house and established their own households, they suddenly have extra unused spaces. At some point, those childhood bedrooms get cleaned out and stand waiting for a fresh coat of paint and a new purpose.

If you’re lucky enough to have extra square footage in your nest, here are eight ideas for turning that space into something fit for your current lifestyle.

1. A walk-in closet and dressing room. I love the idea of transforming an extra bedroom into a beautiful walk-in closet and dressing room. Several of my clients have done this, gaining both functionality and luxury. One client was even able to connect her new dressing room to her master bath — a nice perk if your floor plan allows. Many companies specialize in custom cabinetry and closets and can help you add this extra bit of comfort to your home.

2. A home office. Some people telecommute, others finish work projects or emails after hours at home, while still others simply enjoy having a dedicated home office for paying bills and taking care of other personal business. An extra bedroom is a perfect option for a home office because the door can be closed for solitude and focus or to hide clutter. You might line closets in the room with custom shelving and cabinets. Or, if this level of construction is not in your budget, you might purchase some beautiful storage solutions at furniture stores that can help you create a good-looking and organized home office.

3. A guest bedroom. Perhaps your adult children live out of town and stay for several nights when they visit. Or maybe other friends or family members often bunk in your home. A dedicated guest room might be just what you need. To make this a relatively inexpensive project, you might repurpose some furniture from a child’s former bedroom. A fresh coat of paint, new bedding, and updated accessories may be all you need to complete its new look.

4. A craft room. If you are someone who enjoys scrapbooking, jewelry making, sewing or similar hobbies, a dedicated craft room may be exactly what you crave. Frequently, craft projects span days or even weeks, and putting supplies away in the middle of a project can be cumbersome. Even if your funds do not allow for built-ins, a large table and wall shelving can work wonders for storing and organizing craft materials.

5. A reading nook. Maybe you have been longing for a quiet, comfortable place to relax with a good book — a small spare bedroom easily could be outfitted for this purpose. You may be able to relocate a comfortable chair from elsewhere in your home. Add a good reading lamp and a small book shelf and, if you want to go further, paint the walls a new color and add accessories, artwork and throw pillows. A cozy blanket in a bright color is another inexpensive way to add style to your reading spot.

6. An exercise gym. Outfit a small extra bedroom with exercise equipment and a wall-mounted television. Watching your favorite show while working out can make the time much more pleasant — I’m speaking from experience here. Also, large wall mirrors not only make a small bedroom appear larger but can help you ensure correct form and prevent injuries.

7. A yoga or pilates studio. With an available bedroom, a quiet dedicated space for yoga or pilates may be an attainable luxury. If your space and budget allow, enhancing a new studio by adding sliding doors out to a private garden is a wonderful way to create a special place with plenty of light and fresh air. A bubbling fountain augments the mood. Painting the walls a cool, calming color such as blue or gray can also boost the tranquility.

8. A multifunctional space. If you have only one spare bedroom but a variety of needs, a Murphy bed or wall bed may be the solution for you. Multiple companies specialize in beds that fold effortlessly into an attractive wall cabinet when not needed. That way, you can use your spare room as a home office, craft space or exercise studio without a bed taking up floor space — at least not until just before your visiting children arrive.",How to make use and better your life with a spare bedroom,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/09/28/how-to-make-use-and-better-your-life-with-spare-bedroom.html

Karan made remarks on Sunday to Daily Mail suggesting that Weinstein’s alleged victims may have been “asking for it” in an interview questioning the way women dress and present themselves. The designer has since apologized for her comments, releasing a statement Monday saying she believes ""sexual harassment is NOT acceptable and this is an issue that MUST be addressed once and for all regardless of the individual.""

STAR OF 'RACIST' DOVE AD SAYS COMPANY SHOULD'VE DEFENDED ITS 'CREATIVE VISION'

But despite her apology, the DKNY founder is facing intense backlash, with many calling for a boycott of her brand — even though Karan herself no longer runs the label, which is owned by G-III Apparel Group, according to WWD.

Celebrities soon weighed in, calling the designer out for her comments. On NBC’s “Megan Kelly Today,” Kelly shared her disapproval with the way Karan implied that women may be inviting “trouble” based on how they dress.

“This attitude of blaming women for their own harassment is actually one of the reasons why women choose not to come forward after they get harassed because they fear victim shaming. They fear it. They know it’s going to happen. How about we not pile it on, Donna? How about we use this moment to encourage women to find their own voices despite the risks and to stand up for themselves, which is hard enough, without rich, powerful, well-connected fashion moguls lecturing them on their clothing choices?"" said Kelly.

""And speaking of fashion choices, here’s one for you. I’m done with Donna Karan,” she added.

Actress Rose McGowan, one of the women who settled with Weinstein, sent out a tweet calling the designer “deplorable.”

Celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain, whose girlfriend Asia Argento accused Weinstein of rape, also tweeted his displeasure with Karan.

Mia Farrow tweeted that she’ll no longer be wearing Karan’s designs.

Many others on social media are calling for a boycott of the Donna Karan brand, as well as turning her own marketing and advertisements against her.

G-III felt the repercussions of Karan’s comments, as well. The company’s stock was hit in early-morning trading, but managed to rise 0.51 percent Tuesday to close at $27.75, WWD reports.

Chapman, Weinstein’s wife, is also likely to take some heat thanks to her husband’s actions. The Hollywood Reporter reports that Weinstein — often a front-row figure at his wife’s fashion shows — used his connections to earn her label notoriety early on, helping place Marchesa gowns on celebrities such as Sandra Bullock, Penelope Cruz, Renee Zellweger, Anne Hathaway, Kate Hudson and Jennifer Lopez.

“Marchesa’s breathtaking success has the fashion world talking – and rolling its eyes, too,” wrote the Los Angeles Times per The Guardian in the label’s early days. “Just how much of that success, observers wonder, is due to the Harvey factor?”

While Chapman announced Tuesday she’s divorcing Weinstein, fashion insiders wonder if her label can survive its association with the producer.

Chapman and her partner, former model Keren Craig, had little experience as designers when they founded the label in 2004. Weinstein was reportedly instrumental in its early success, securing red-carpet placement of the designs on numerous Hollywood A-listers.

""He was the mastermind behind Marchesa — orchestrating deals and using his influence in terms of the celebrity connections for her on behalf of the brand,"" said an L.A. fashion publicist to THR. She added that her understanding of Chapman and Weinstein’s marriage was that ""they both benefited from the relationship, but she certainly knew about his bad behavior.""

Another long-time L.A. based publicist recounted a time when Felicity Huffman was told by Weinstein that he wouldn't put any money behind promoting her 2005 film “Transamerica” unless she wore Marchesa on the red carpet, THR reports.

The flying museum, better known as the “Madras Maiden” touched down in Columbia, S.C. Sunday, where volunteers give 30-minute tours to veterans, visitors or families of those who served in the military.

“They do fine…I’m proud of them. [They’re] down in that plane like they were born in it,” WWII Army veteran William Pate said about the volunteers.

From 1944 to 1947, Pate jumped out of C-47’s and C-82’s as an 82nd Airborne paratrooper.

“I enjoyed what I was doing. If I could, I would do it again. But I have a lot of age on me now. I ain’t no spring chicken,” he told Fox News.

Pate and other veterans in attendance swapped war stories with each other and the crew after taking one of the flights over the city.

“It’s just an honor to be able to hear their stories, talk to their families and just keep their memories alive for generations,” Rodney Schneider said.

An aircraft maintainer by trade, Schneider explained his love for planes stretched back to his childhood. This motivated him to reach out to the Liberty Foundation, which organizes the event.

“I’ve been with the airplane now seven-days straight. Sometimes its weeks between when I’m needed,"" Schneider said.

Robert “Max” Maiden, 21, is a co-pilot for the bomber. He flies to different cities every weekend for six months.

“I’ve always loved flying old airplanes…They have a cool story to tell and they are an important part of history,” Maiden said. “You really see people get really emotional and they sit there and they go, 'Aww man this is what my dad did,' or ‘my dad built them’ or 'my dad flew them or is a gunner.' It’s really cool to share that with people.”

Erin Creed traveled to Columbia from Virginia with her father and husband to honor her grandfather, who fought the Nazis in Europe.

“I just could not believe I was on a World War Two plane,” she said. “I had his picture and his favorite hat and I just couldn’t believe [I] was flying in memory of him.”

One of only 12 B-17’s still flying the “Madras Maiden” was built toward the end of the war but never saw combat. In 2016, The Liberty Foundation began operating the aircraft and spends over a million dollars every year for upkeep. The money that is generated from ticket sales or donations helps to cover the costs.

“If that goes away, it goes back into a museum and starts collecting dust and you don’t get to hear it or smell it,” Schneider explained.

The crew’s age and skills may vary, but one thing remains the same -- the love for planes and veterans.

“We get to ride on a WWII airplane that not everybody can do and just the satisfaction of just doing it,” Schneider said.

MAN CAUGHT SMUGGLING $30K OF GOLD IN HIS RECTUM, AIRPORT OFFICIALS SAY

Though not all were hiding the gold on their person – some stashed the nuggets in their hand luggage or children’s strollers – the “ingenious way of concealment,” as India’s Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) calls it, was how most passengers tried to sneak the precious metal into the country.

The rectum gold was discovered upon “thorough examination,” the DRI said. Once the nuggets were found, they were confiscated by authorities. In total, the DRI confiscated over $46,000 in gold.

The haul was large, but no individual smuggler was caught carrying enough gold to meet the criminal threshold and were allowed to go free.

Gold is the country’s second largest import after crude oil. However, gold can fetch high customs fees, which makes smuggling seem desirable to some.

A spokesman for the DRI said Sunday’s haul was far from the largest – a 2015 operation netted almost 64kg (141lbs) of gold smuggled by three entire planeloads of passengers, The Guardian reports.

As echoed in Monday night’s address, President Trump’s reassertion of U.S. leadership around the world was a foundational component of his campaign.","On Monday evening, President Trump addressed the nation to outline his new strategy to win the war in Afghanistan.

After a series of accusations by lawmakers and the media suggesting that the president had been dragging his feet on the conflict, Trump confidently committed to sending an additional 4,000 troops to Afghanistan and indicated that the United States will work closely with NATO allies, as well as regional allies in Pakistan and India to resolve the conflict.

To open his address, the president followed through on an important recommendation that I have made over the past week.

Although President Trump could not have effectively made a speech about the events in Charlottesville and the need for unity in our country alone, he did use tonight’s address to lay the groundwork for healing the wounds of division in our country, essentially using the examples of unity and common purpose that our armed service members consistently display.

Despite President Trump’s overt confidence and soaring rhetoric on Monday night, his new plan is too little, too late.

This is the first step in a national reconciliation process that will take more time effort and commitment to implement. Along these lines, the President needs to lower his voice, reduce his tweets, and seek common ground with Republicans and Democrats alike.

That means explicitly no more discussion, much less analysis, of what happened in Charlottesville, no more characterization of Nazis and white supremacists, nor left wing activists, as “very fine people” as the president did in his press conference last week.

Further, President Trump needs to begin working toward compromise on key issues like health care, tax reform and infrastructure.

Otherwise his presidency -- at the very least -- will be far less successful than it might otherwise be.

On Monday night, however, the president successfully changed the national conversation to foreign policy and military strategy.

In regard to the president’s new strategy, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis has indicated that he has already made preparations to expeditiously carry out the president’s new guidance and effectively “destroy the terrorist hub” in Afghanistan.

At this time, 4,000 additional U.S. troops are far too few to stop the full range of terrorist and insurgent threats menacing the United States and challenging the Afghan government.

To be sure, as Senator John McCain has stated, the president’s new strategy is “a big step in the right direction with the new strategy for Afghanistan.”

However, as Senator McCain continued, “the unfortunate truth is that this strategy is long overdue, and in the interim, the Taliban has made dangerous inroads.”

In large measure, President Obama is to blame for the current state of affairs in Afghanistan, specifically the resurgence of the Taliban and emergence of other dangerous groups during the former president’s second term.

It is my view that despite President Trump’s overt confidence and soaring rhetoric on Monday night, his new plan is too little, too late.

More acutely, the promises made in the speech simply do not align with the harrowing reality that the new troops will find once on the ground in Afghanistan.

Modern Middle Eastern history tells us that no foreign power has ever succeeded in Afghanistan and there is no reason to believe things will change with this small additional troop allocation.

As is well-known, and President Trump reminded us tonight, the war in Afghanistan is the longest military conflict in U.S. history.

Given the recent gains made by the Taliban, Haqqani, Islamic State in Khorasan, and other terrorist groups, more is needed to successfully reassert the Afghan government’s control, as well as bring American involvement to an end.

Clearly, bringing the conflict to an end could potentially stand as one of President Trump’s greatest achievements.

But given the complexities of the political and military situations on the ground in Afghanistan, this achievement will take a serious commitment, extending well beyond what the United States has already dedicated over the past sixteen years.

As the president stated, victory will now have a “clear definition, involving five key facets: attacking our enemies, obliterating ISIS, crushing Al Qaeda, preventing the Taliban from taking over the country, and stopping mass terror attacks against Americans before they emerge.”

These causes are all well and good and it is my hope the president and our military succeeds.

To do so, I share Senator McCain's recommendations for the president, which are that he must regularly address the American people about why we are fighting, effectively articulate the details of his strategy and his expectations to those fighting, effectively make the case to the American people why the additional commitment of lives and resources are worth it, and, above all, clearly define success and the specific “conditions” on the ground we are seeking.

As echoed in Monday night’s address, President Trump’s reassertion of U.S. leadership around the world was a foundational component of his campaign.

“The pizza pouch is part of our completely re-engineered ‘oven-hot delivery system,’” said Zipporah Allen, Pizza Hut vice president of brand marketing and consumer insight, told NRN on Monday. The pouch, which accommodates three boxed pizzas, was designed for a 20 to 35-minute delivery period.

A post shared by Pizza Hut 🍕 (@pizzahut) on Oct 9, 2017 at 2:17pm PDT

The pouch’s three layers consist of a 3M Thinsulate lining, a heat-reflecting aluminum material and a polyester fiber padding. Each layer was meticulously thought out, drawing from materials used in cold-weather jackets, space blankets and home insulation.

Along with the updated pizza pouch, the new box comes with some fresh features of its own. In addition to the heat-trapping corrugated sides, there will be a new tray for the pizza to sit on.

“In particular, the crisp sheet will go into every Pizza Hut box,” Allen said. “The role of the crisp sheet is to keep the crust crisp and craveable as the pizza is being transported from the oven the consumer.”

Its regional aspirations are nothing short of an attempt to become the dominant power in the Middle East and displace America from the region. The regime is a state-sponsor of terror that will use whatever brutal and violent means it can to achieve its objectives. And it’s no secret that Iran is a human rights-abuser of the worst kind, even working with fellow pariah-state North Korea to develop advanced missile platforms that could someday target U.S. forces in the region.

But the deal that President Obama made with Tehran back in 2015—wrinkles and all—is worth keeping for a very pragmatic, realistic reason: the Trump Administration has much bigger problems on its plate.

Decertifying the deal now—with the danger of Tehran building nuclear weapons that are now pushed out at least a decade or more under the deal—would take away much needed bandwidth from confronting much bigger challenges Team Trump must address that are of much more critical domestic and international importance. And considering the very real possibility that decertifying the deal could very well put both nations on the path towards potential conflict—if Tehran attempts to make a run towards nuclear weapons, fearing an eventual U.S. move towards regime change—President Trump must make the hard choice to stay the course.",The Conservative Case to Keep the Iran Deal,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/10/12/conservative-case-keep-iran-deal#commenting

In the meantime, here are some other things California has banned or might soon.

Plastic bags

California became the first state in the U.S. to ban single-use plastic bags in 2015, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune. Businesses that continue to offer the bags have to charge customers a fee.

Travel

California blocked state-funded travel to multiple states in June that had what the state attorney general considered anti-LGBT policies. Those states were: Alabama, Kentucky, South Dakota and Texas.

Non-essential state-funded travel was already banned from Kansas, Mississippi, North Carolina and Tennessee.

Certain pets

California bars the possession of certain “restricted animals” without a specific permit, including hamsters, ferrets and gerbils.

Hedgehogs, certain parakeets and piranhas are also banned from being kept as pets.

Cars with internal combustion engines

Cars with internal combustion engines could soon be banned in California.

Mary Nichols, the California Air Resources Board chair, told Bloomberg that Gov. Jerry Brown is interested in a potential ban. However, she said banning cars with internal combustion engines wouldn’t happen in the next 10 years.

Foie gras

California’s foie gras ban was reinstated this month by a federal appeals court. It found that a state law preventing sales of the food product made by force-feeding ducks and geese was not preempted by federal authority to regulate poultry products.

The ban was signed into law in 2004 after proponents said the process of fattening the birds’ livers was cruel and inhumane. The law took effect in 2012, but was blocked by a court in 2015, delighting chefs who wanted to serve it.

The decision won’t immediately go into effect.

The defeat ends a streak of seven consecutive appearances for the U.S. at soccer's quadrennial showcase, dating back to 1990.

The U.S. entered its final qualifier with a berth uncertain for the first time since 1989. Home losses to Mexico last November and Costa Rica last month left the Americans little margin for error.

The 28th-ranked Americans needed merely a tie against 99th-ranked Trinidad, which lost its sixth straight qualifier last week. But the defeat -- coupled with Honduras' come-from-behind 3-2 win over Mexico and Panama's 2-1 victory over Costa Rica on Ramon Torres' 88th-minute goal -- dropped the Americans from third place into fifth in the six-nation final round of the North and Central American and Caribbean region.

Mexico and Costa Rica already had clinched berths, and Panama claimed the third and final automatic spot and will go the World Cup for the first time. Honduras will meet Australia in a two-game playoff next month for another spot at next year's 32-nation tournament.



Shocked American players slumped on the bench, and Matt Besler sat on the field after the final whistle as Panama's game ended and then Costa Rica's. At the end, dejected U.S. players filed into their locker rooms with blank looks.



Missing the World Cup is a devastating blow to the U.S. Soccer Federation, which has steadily built the sport in the last quarter-century with the help of sponsors and television partners. It also is a trauma for Fox, which broadcasts the next three World Cups after taking the U.S. rights from ESPN. The USSF hopes to co-host the 2026 tournament with Mexico and Canada, and Morocco is the only other bidder.



After an 0-2 start in the hexagonal last fall under Jurgen Klinsmann, the USSF replaced him last November with Bruce Arena, the American coach from 1998-2006. The team revived with home wins over Honduras and Trinidad last spring and draws at Panama and Mexico. But the 2-0 defeat to Costa Rica in New Jersey at the start of Labor Day weekend proved one hurdle too many to overcome.



""No excuses for us not getting the second goal and at least a point,"" Arena said. ""It's a blemish for us.""



The Americans fell behind in the 17th minute when defender Omar Gonzalez made a casual attempt with his left foot to clear Alvin Jones' cross and sent the ball looping over the outstretched right arm of goalkeeper Tim Howard from 18 yards.



Jones doubled the lead in the 37th with a 35-yard strike, again to Howard's upper right corner, and nearly scored another in the 44th when his swerving shot bounced off Howard's chest and spilled into the penalty area.



Christian Pulisic, the Americans' 19-year-old star midfielder, scored in the 47th minute from the arc with a right-footed shot. He played a role in 12 of the 17 Americans goals in the hexagonal.



One minute later, Howard made a kick save on Shahdon Winchester's short-range shot, and DeAndre Yedlin blocked Levi Garcia's follow-up attempt.



The U.S. bench was tense, as Honduras scored twice early in the second half to take the lead over visiting Mexico in the 60th minute and Panama tied the score against visiting Costa Rica in the 52nd.



Clint Dempsey, who entered at the start of the second half, was denied by goalkeeper Adrian Foncette's leaping save in the 69th and hit a post from 22 yards in the 77th. Pulisic's shot in the 87th was saved by Foncette.



All American reserves were standing for much of the final minutes, and Arena had repeated exasperated looks.



Just a few hundred fans were in the stands at 10,000-capacity Ato Boldon Stadium, located 24 miles south of the capital, Port-of-Spain. Paul Caligiuri's famous goal at the National Stadium in 1989 put the U.S. in the World Cup for the first time since 1950.



Among the spectators were a few dozen American Outlaws, the U.S. supporters group.

Pro-life students represent a growing majority who want to have the same free speech rights as other groups.","The uproar over Vice President Mike Pence’s decision to leave the Colts-49ers game after some NFL players took a knee during the national anthem again highlights the intense cultural debate over free speech that seems of utmost importance to the media and activists. Yet not all “speech” is treated as equal in coverage and attention.

Over the last few weeks, the free speech rights of students on college campuses have been violated as peaceful chalk messages from students have been destroyed, flyers pulled down and permits for new pro-life groups and speakers slow walked through the approval process to prevent voices from being heard. If you haven’t heard about the college blockade taking place even this week, perhaps it is because the students whose voices are being forcibly silenced favor life over abortion. And while they may not get the attention that millionaire athletes can garner, their points of view are no less valid.

Pro-life students represent a growing majority who want to have the same free speech rights as other groups.

For the past 11 years, Students for Life has been on the forefront of the campus free speech movement, witnessing a rising tide of opposition to those who do not agree with the dictates of a politically correct worldview. As national opinion on abortion has shifted toward the pro-life viewpoint over the past few years, I mistakenly thought that -- apart from some aging, hostile school administrators -- most of the drama was behind us.

But then the 2016 election happened. And now, pro-abortion forces, fearing the withdrawal of taxpayer dollars from Planned Parenthood, pro-life Supreme Court appointments, and a barrage of pro-life legislation and regulations, are doing everything they can to silence a growing pro-life majority and fight back against the voices of the very people they claim to represent.

As the New Yorker observed this week: “In the half century between the elections of Governor Reagan and President Trump, the left and the right would appear to have switched sides, the left fighting against free speech and the right fighting for it.”

And on college campuses, a polluted political environment is turning ugly. A recent poll even shows that 20 percent of students now support using violence to prevent controversial speakers from being heard on campus.

Students for Life of America is unfortunately all too aware of the attacks on free speech on high school and college campuses. Consider just a few examples from last spring:

When Queens College denied Norvilia Etienne the right to start a Students for Life group on her campus, we immediately went into action, contacting our attorneys at Alliance Defending Freedom. They filed a lawsuit on her behalf and within three days, Queens College backed down and let Norvilia start her group, which has taken off on campus. We’re still dealing with the administration now, though, as the group has been denied equal treatment in receiving student activity funding and their club status may be still be revoked under the university’s existing policies.

At Fresno State, a professor bragged on campus about erasing our chalked messages directing women to non-violent health care and directing others to do so as well. He claimed it was part of his free speech to destroy messages that he did not like. These situations happen regularly, such as at Kutztown University, where school officials scrubbed away our messages, and more recently at George Mason University, where school police told our Students for Life members that is was the freedom of speech rights of the pro-abortion protestors to vandalize our messages.

At California State University, San Marcos, a Students for Life group applied for funding for an on-campus display, but was told there was a $500 cap on their requests. Yet, LGBT groups on campus were able to receive hundreds of thousands of dollars in funding from student government, without an apparent cap.

The list could go on. Our student groups are routinely denied equal access to school fees funding. For example, Colorado State University denied our group’s request for a""‘Diversity Grant,"" meant to bring awareness of a variety of issues, because a pro-life speaker could offend some people at the school.

The right to free speech on campus must be protected. At Students for Life of America, we welcome debate on issues and do not try to squelch the free speech rights of groups that might disagree with us, such as pro-abortion or feminist groups. In fact, we welcome it. College and high school should be a training ground for young people to explore, express, and share ideas; in just a few years, they will be running the show in Washington and on Wall Street.

Pro-life students represent a growing majority who want to have the same free speech rights as other groups. And officials in charge of high schools and colleges must stop slow-walking Students for Life group registrations with the cynical hope of delaying approval until after interested students have graduated. High schools and college must stop denying our groups funding for speakers and events. And high schools and colleges must stop using unconstitutional arguments about us being ""controversial,"" ""political,"" or ""religious"" as a cudgel against our clubs' formation.

Just as heated debates over slavery, civil rights, and women’s rights swept through the culture as conversations and confrontations debated the value of all lives, no matter the race, creed, color or gender, so to a rigorous debate over the value of preborn life must be heard. Students on college campuses deserve the same respect as millionaire athletes in expressing and sharing their points of view, for without a right to life, no other debate can truly engaged.",Shouldn’t pro-life students have the same free speech rights as millionaire athletes?,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/12/shouldn-t-pro-life-students-have-same-free-speech-rights-as-millionaire-athletes.html

“We don’t even know what we did wrong,” he says.

Describing her family as “very frequent world travelers”, Gatling shared Schilling’s video with her own Facebook post, pointing out that her son has been on 70 flights, and her daughter has been on about 30. Between “30-90” percent of those have been Southwest, she said. She was appalled that the plane staffers said her children were “being a disturbance,” thought they did not scream or cry at all during the trip.

“The only further explanation was ‘running up and down the isle and jumping on tray tables,” the mother wrote, although she doesn't believe that's a valid explanation, either. Further, she noted that they never opened the tray table and only got up once to use the restroom. As Paige followed her mother to the restroom from their near-rear seats, Schilling said a flight attendant stepped on his wife’s previously sprained ankle, making her “cry in pain.”

Lastly, Schilling said he was arrested for making “physical contact with a supervisor” while on board, for bumping someone with their stroller, which he also denies. Detained for six hours, Gatling and the kids waited at the airport until Schilling was released at 1 a.m. Ultimately, Gatling told Yahoo Lifestyle that her husband was charged with battery for the incident, and that a November court date is set.

The glass bridge, on the eastern face of the Taihang Mountain, hangs 3,871 feet above sea level, which would probably be a thrilling (or terrifying) height even without novelty cracking glass.

But for some people, the possibility of near and imminent death is how you spell fun. Apparently. For tourists, not so much. In videos posted by visitors, some respond with excitement, while some respond with out-and-out terror.

According to Mashable, the East Taihang administration has released an apology, explaining that the look of the near-shattered glass was meant to be “provocative.”

Some of the panels also had shattered fragments of glass placed between the layers so that when you walk over them, the glass sounds and looks as if it’s breaking. Not exactly the most welcome noise at 3,000 feet.

It doesn't help that in recent years there have been previous reports of China's popular glass bridges and walkways actually shattering.

Although the administration has apologized, there are no plans to replace the panels.

Many users on the Chinese social media site Weibo have been outraged by seeing people being frightened on the glass bridge.

In the movie ""Forrest Gump,"" the vulnerable character Jenny is violently smacked by her unlikable and smug hippie boyfriend Wesley, the fictitious head of the Berkeley’s Students for a Democratic Society. Thankfully Forrest, resplendent in full military dress and wearing his fresh Medal of honor, intervenes and pummels Wesley, stopping the abuse.

Clinton appeared on Fareed Zakaria’s CNN show Wednesday and addressed the Weinstein’s allegations. Weinstein has contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Clinton Foundation and contributed $46,350 to her 2016 presidential campaign.

ASIA ARGENTO’S BOYFRIEND ANTHONY BOURDAIN SPEAKS OUT FOLLOWING HARVEY WEINSTEIN RAPE ACCUSATION

“I was — I was just sick,” Clinton told Zakaria. “I was shocked. I was appalled. And, you know, like so many people who’ve come forward and spoken out, this was a different side of a person who I and many others had known in the past.”

Clinton told Zakaria she was not aware of Weinstein’s actions.

""I certainly didn't, and I don't know who did. But I can only speak for myself, and I think I speak for many others who knew him primarily through politics,"" Clinton said.

Weinstein and his family have given more than one million dollars in political contributions to Democratic lawmakers, candidates and their allies, the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics reported.

Clinton said she would donate the money she was given by Weinstein to charity.

Bourdain took to Twitter to share his thoughts in a series of tweets.

“And I have to say, Hillary's interview with Fareed Zakaria was shameful in its deflection and its disingenuousness,” Bourdain tweeted.

“Know what Hillary Clinton is NOT? She’s not stupid. Or unsophisticated about the world. The Weinstein stories had been out there for years,” Bourdain continued.

He added, ""Secretary Clinton was one of the most intelligent, well prepared, well briefed politicians ever. So, yes. I’d hoped for a better response.""

HILLARY CLINTON BREAKS SILENCE ON HARVEY WEINSTEIN: ‘I WAS SHOCKED AND APPALLED’

However, Bourdain, whose show is broadcasted on CNN, also tweeted he admired Clinton but felt the interview was “a real disappointment.” He also reiterated that Clinton was not responsible for anything Weinstein has done.

""I can assure you that the victims of Mr. Weinstein's three decades of predatory behavior are disappointed too. I'm sitting next to one,” Bourdain said of his girlfriend, Argento.

Bourdain concluded: “This Weinstein story is deeply personal to me -- and far far far more personal and painful to people I love and people I care about.”

Clinton was criticized earlier this week for remaining silent following the expose released by The New York Times last week that claimed Weinstein had settled sexual harassment lawsuits with at least eight women. The New Yorker followed up Tuesday with more allegations.

Clinton released a statement through her spokesman Nick Merrill on Twitter Tuesday following the New Yorker’s bombshell report.

“I was shocked and appalled by the revelations about Harvey Weinstein,"" she stated. ""The behavior described by women coming forward cannot be tolerated. Their courage and the support of others is critical in helping to stop this kind of behavior.”

Take a break from social media: Social media contains negative stories, unkind words, judgment, comparison, and unrealistic standards in the news feed.
Use the time you would have spent on social media to help create good news.","The news of Las Vegas came in as fast and as devastating as Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria and as violent as the raging fires tearing through California. I could imagine the sudden horror of the thousands of men, women, and children dancing and singing one minute, and then scrambling for their lives before the next downbeat. It must have felt like a roof ripping off and leaving thousands of people traumatized in its wake. My husband and son, Marcus and Levi Hummon, are both in the music industry and have lots of friends who were in Las Vegas, so our communities have felt this mass shooting rip apart our own sense of security.

I have felt both grief and anger on behalf of the victims and their families. I can understand how people might wonder why God would allow such a horrific thing to happen to innocent people but God didn't do this, God is grieving with us. This is a time to question a lot of things, but I believe that this is not a time to question our faith. This is a time to lean into our faith, as our faith is what carries us through. This is a time for remembering all we have lost through violence and injustice and to be a community. Community is the common thread, woven by the fiber of love, that binds us together. And I know something about love: Love heals. It heals people, and it will heal our nation, too.

At Thistle Farms, a community of survivors of prostitution, addiction, and trafficking, where I have worked for the past 20 years, one sentiment remains constant; hearts expand as they heal. For women recovering from childhood trauma and sexual violence, the painful edges of their hearts discover new depths of compassion along the path of healing. America, too, can grow both stronger in the pain and more radically passionate for loving one another. Once we all allow healing to smooth over rough edges in our own hearts, it will push the boundaries of love a little further for all of us.

We can transform brokenness into compassion, anger into advocacy, and fear into courage. On a daily basis, I see the survivors in our community being transformed by love. Healing is beautifully simple and surprisingly accessible.

If you are wondering what you can do to find some peace and healing in your own life, I encourage you to:

Make time for quiet reflection: Find a green pasture, sit on a pew, stretch out on an exercise mat, soak in a bathtub—go anywhere that is your quiet space so that you can get still. Sip tea, light a candle, go silent.

Pray: Everyone defines this differently. You can pray out loud, on paper, or before bed. If we desire healing, we journey inward, reflect, face the pain, and find new spaces in our hearts to love each other.

Give generously: This can be your time, money or talents. We refuel our spirits by helping another person or contributing to the greater good. Volunteer.

Take a break from social media: Social media contains negative stories, unkind words, judgment, comparison, and unrealistic standards in the news feed. Use the time you would have spent on social media to help create good news. Nurture the relationships in your life that don’t rely on a screen.

With every action, we can become more peaceful, more loving, and more compassionate towards ourselves and others. This is what makes healing a journey; In the small steps we make daily, we find, looking back, that we have made a big difference along the way.

While I don’t know why we have faced a relentless amount of tragedy across our country this past year, what I do know is that love will be stronger and will last longer. In grieving, hearts can grow stronger, and in pain, there is comfort. What I know is healing, in the face of violence and senseless acts, will always find a way. Peace and love to you.",Love can heal our nation,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/12/love-can-heal-our-nation.html

Weinstein was caught by papparazzi outside his daughter's house on Wednesday afternoon and he stated he was ""not doing OK.""

Last Saturday, the couple wed outside of Dayton, OH. But before the two said “I do,” their friend Jake Clark set the stage for their walk down the aisle as “flower man.”

“I don’t think [Jake] thought we were serious about it,” Amanda tells Yahoo Style. “Our wedding was an adult wedding only, so it made sense for there to be a flower man instead of a little girl. It’s definitely our style to be different and funny and outgoing. We did not want a traditional wedding anyway.”

According to Yahoo Style, Clark approached the couple after they got engaged and volunteered himself to be part of the wedding party. Amanda and Daniel took him up on the offer, and now the pictures of Clark's walk down the aisle have received nearly 200 reactions and over 60 shares on Facebook.

Clark strutted down the aisle with not one, but three fanny packs – all stuffed with fallen fall leaves. During the rehearsal, Amanda thought the fallen leaves were pretty, but Clark says of the atypical wedding foliage, “Unfortunately, a lot of them were shredded when I pulled them out, and some people got some leaves to the face as well, which they seemed to be good sports about.”

As for the multiple fanny packs, Clark wanted to “go big or go home.”

“I figured if I’m going to be flower man, I’m going to go all out — go big or go home,” Clark tells Yahoo. “I could have just carried around a basket, but I thought, ‘How could I make it a little more over the top?’ So I decided three fanny packs, not one. The showcase fanny pack was actually a unicorn fanny pack.”

The “flower man” idea seems to be catching on. Photographer Sarah Graybeal, who shot the DeDoncker wedding, received many comments on her Facebook from people saying “wedding goals,” and “keep this in mind.""

In the 2016 YouTube video, Coleman refers to ""the Kafkaesque nightmare in which we find ourselves"" and urges ""governments on both sides"" to reach a deal for their freedom.
Two young children appear in the video with them, and Coleman has told her family that she gave birth to two children in captivity.
“Please don’t become the next Jimmy Carter,” Coleman says in the 2016 video, reading a prepared statement and making a plea to former President Barack Obama.","An American woman, her Canadian husband and their three young children -- who had been held captive since 2012 by the Taliban-affiliated Haqqani network -- were freed after an operation involving Pakistani forces, officials announced Thursday.

Caitlan Coleman, 32, was seven months pregnant when she and her husband, Josh Boyle, were abducted.

The operation that set Coleman, Boyle and their children free was undertaken by Pakistani forces based on actionable intelligence provided by U.S. authorities, according to a statement by the ISPR. U.S. intelligence agencies had been tracking the hostages and shared the location with Pakistani counterparts when the hostages shifted into Pakistani territory Wednesday.

""Today they are free. This is a positive moment for our country's relationship with Pakistan,"" President Donald Trump said in a statement Thursday. ""The Pakistani government's cooperation is a sign that it is honoring America's wishes for it to do more to provide security in the region.""

Trump appeared to hint at the news of Coleman's release during a speech in Coleman's home state of Pennsylvania a day earlier.

""Something happened today, where a country that totally disrespected us called with some very, very important news,"" Trump said Wednesday. ""And one of my generals came in. They said, 'You know, I have to tell you, a year ago they would've never done that.' It was a great sign of respect. You'll probably be hearing about it over the next few days. But this is a country that did not respect us. This is a country that respects us now. The world is starting to respect us again, believe me.""

TRUMP RAMPS UP PRESSURE ON PAKISTAN IN SPEECH

Coleman and Boyle were last seen in a hostage video in December 2016 pleading for their governments to intervene.

The two vanished after setting off in the summer of 2012 for a journey that took them to Russia, the central Asian countries of Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, and then to Afghanistan.

“Please don’t become the next Jimmy Carter” - Caitlan Coleman in a 2016 plea to former U.S. President Barack Obama

Coleman's parents, Jim and Lyn Coleman, last heard from their son-in-law on Oct. 8, 2012, from an internet cafe in what Josh described as an ""unsafe"" part of Afghanistan.

The announcement of the release comes a month after President Trump announced a new strategy to deal with Afghanistan and Pakistan, saying the Taliban and other militant groups would no longer find safe haven in Pakistan.

Defense Secretary James Mattis and Gen. Joseph Dunford told Congress last week Pakistan would no longer be a sanctuary for terrorism.

In the 2016 YouTube video, Coleman refers to ""the Kafkaesque nightmare in which we find ourselves"" and urges ""governments on both sides"" to reach a deal for their freedom. She then adds: ""My children have seen their mother defiled.""

Two young children appear in the video with them, and Coleman has told her family that she gave birth to two children in captivity. It was revealed Thursday that Coleman had a third child.

“Please don’t become the next Jimmy Carter,” Coleman says in the 2016 video, reading a prepared statement and making a plea to former President Barack Obama. “Just give the offenders something so they and you can save face so we can leave the region permanently.”

TRUMP APPROVES SENDING 4,000 MORE TROOPS TO AFGHANISTAN, SENIOR OFFICIAL SAYS

The video came to public attention through the Site Intelligence Group, which monitors extremist activity online. SITE said it was dated Dec. 3.

The Haqqani network has orchestrated a vast array of brutal attacks in Afghanistan in recent years, against both locals and the U.S. military, but unlike their Taliban associates, they are deemed to be more motivated by money than faith.

In that interview with Circa News in 2016, Jim Coleman issued a plea to top Taliban commanders to be ""kind and merciful"" and let the couple go.

""As a man, father and now grandfather, I am asking you to show mercy and release my daughter, her husband, and our beautiful grandchildren,"" Jim Coleman said. ""Please grant them an opportunity to continue their lives with us, and bring peace to their families.""

Equifax responded to the breach with ""supreme arrogance,"" but it seems the company failed to learn anything from its security failings. Proof of that appeared yesterday when the Equifax website was compromised yet again.

As Arstechnica reports, for several hours yesterday, October 11, anyone visiting the Equifax website may have been presented with a Flash Player update prompt. It was fake, and opting to install the update saw your PC infected with adware (specifically Adware.Eorezo).

Here's a video showing how the malicious Flash Player update prompt appears while browsing the site:

The situation was made worse because only three antivirus providers (of 65) detected the adware being used and offered protection (Panda, Symantec, and Webroot). Everyone else was left dealing with an infected machine, or at least having one of the four domains the hack redirects through flagged as suspicious by security suites.

Independent security analyst Randy Abrams discovered the hack and managed to trigger it several times yesterday. However, today it seems to have disappeared from the Equifax website. Either someone at Equifax noticed and removed the hack, or the hackers have gone quiet realizing the media was on to them.

What that means is that someone in a high position at NBC overruled subordinates who thought the story should air.
Farrow has numerous women on the record, and three of them say that Weinstein raped them (he strongly denies all the allegations in a statement).
And we do know that Farrow had a chilling audiotape months ago, when he was still working the story for NBC.
Now that Weinstein is radioactive and out of power, everyone who didn’t speak out is feeling free to pile on.","The more we learn about the magnitude of Harvey Weinstein’s gross mistreatment of women, the more unanswered questions surface about who knew about this, in journalism and in Hollywood, and why they didn’t do anything.

High on the list: NBC passing on what turned out to be the biggest entertainment scandal in at least a couple of years. And that information comes from none other than Ronan Farrow, a special NBC correspondent who wound up taking his well-documented exclusive to the New Yorker.

Rachel Maddow told Farrow on her MSNBC show that ""the story wasn’t publishable"" at the time he presented it to the network—which is reported to have been as recently as August.

""I walked into the door at the New Yorker with an explosively reportable piece that should have been public earlier,"" Farrow said, ""and immediately, obviously, the New Yorker recognized that, and it is not accurate to say that it was not reportable. In fact, there were multiple determinations that it was reportable at NBC.""

Good for Farrow, who is Mia Farrow’s son, for being so blunt. What that means is that someone in a high position at NBC overruled subordinates who thought the story should air.

Farrow has numerous women on the record, and three of them say that Weinstein raped them (he strongly denies all the allegations in a statement).

NBC News President Noah Oppenheim told his staff yesterday:

""Ronan, who was not working for us exclusively, began reporting on that story for NBC. We are proud of that. We launched him on that story, we encouraged him to report that story ... The notion that we would try to cover for a powerful person is deeply offensive to all of us.""



He added: ""We reached a point over the summer, where as an organization, we didn’t feel that we had all the elements that we needed to air it ... Suffice to say, the stunning story, the incredible story that we all read yesterday, was not the story that we were looking at when we made our judgment several months ago.""

But it’s hard to imagine that all the women suddenly agreed to allow their names to be used in the few weeks before the New Yorker went to press.

And we do know that Farrow had a chilling audiotape months ago, when he was still working the story for NBC. In a New York police sting, we hear Weinstein trying to badger an Italian model into coming into his hotel room, and admitting it when she says he groped her breast the day before. That in itself should have been a story for NBC.

It’s hard to ignore the fact that Weinstein’s company had business relationships with NBC Universal and NBC’s Bravo channel. Or that he was a big-time Hollywood liberal and Democratic donor.

The Daily Beast says that ""at least eight women claiming to have been sexually harassed, abused, or assaulted by Weinstein had agreed to go on camera—most of them anonymously in shadow, but two alleged victims with their names and faces. A third alleged victim was willing to allow her name to be used, but not her on-camera image.""

Now that Angelina Jolie, Gwyneth Paltrow, Heather Graham and Rosanna Arquette—these are just the more famous names—are telling stories of how Weinstein tried to take advantage of them, more evidence is emerging of how many staffers at his companies knew of this behavior and helped Harvey set up the meetings. Farrow’s piece even described a ""honeypot"" scenario in which women would be lured to ""meetings"" with the boss, only to be left alone with him.

And with a number of journalists now saying that Weinstein’s conduct was an open secret in movie and media circles, the question remains why almost none of this made it to publication.

One possible factor is Weinstein’s widely reported technique of using leaks to retaliate against his critics and those who cross him.

As Washington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan reports:

""Just last week, as a blockbuster New York Times story on Weinstein moved toward publication, negative information about one of Weinstein’s accusers was offered to a Washington Post reporter. The timing could, of course, be coincidental, but seems suspicious and tracks with Weinstein’s well-known practices. (The Post had begun checking into it when The Times story, naming the accuser, was published.)""

Now that Weinstein is radioactive and out of power, everyone who didn’t speak out is feeling free to pile on. But there’s no way his conduct should have remained such a secret for so long.",The Harvey Weinstein mess: What did people know and when did they know it?,http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/12/harvey-weinstein-mess-what-did-people-know-and-when-did-know-it.html

In an editorial she penned for The Guardian on Tuesday — called “I am the woman in the ‘racist Dove ad’: I am not a Victim” — Lola Ogunyemi said she agreed with Dove’s decision to apologize for how the ad was received, but also that it was never Dove’s intention to portray her “as inferior, or as the ‘before’ in a before-and-after shot.”

Instead, she claimed Dove’s initial objective was to “use our differences to highlight the fact that all skin deserves gentleness.”

DOVE APOLOGIZES FOR CAUSING 'OFFENSE' WITH BODY WASH AD

Dove’s body wash ad, which was pulled during the backlash, featured several different women stripping off their nude-colored t-shirts to reveal an entirely different woman. In screenshots of the ad, Ogunyemi, who is black, can be seen removing her shirt and transforming into a white woman. Afterward, the white woman does the same, and transforms into a completely different woman, and so on.

“There were seven of us in the full version, different races and ages, each of us answering the same question: ‘If your skin were a wash label, what would it say?’” explained Ogunyemi.

Upon its release, controversy over the ad soon erupted on Twitter, with users calling it “unacceptable” and deeming it racist. Others called for a boycott of the product altogether.

And while Ogunyemi said she understands why the screenshots caused backlash, she ultimately feels that the photos were misinterpreted.

“Having said that, I can also see that a lot has been left out,” wrote Ogunyemi of the public’s outrage. “The narrative has been written without giving consumers context on which to base an informed opinion.”

Ogunyemi, too, said she is upset about becoming the “unwitting poster child for racist advertising” in the wake of the controversy.

“While I agree with Dove’s response to unequivocally apologize for any offense caused, they could have also defended their creative vision, and their choice to include me, an unequivocally dark-skinned black woman, as a face of their campaign,” Ogunyemi wrote. “I am not just some silent victim of a mistaken beauty campaign. I am strong, I am beautiful, and I will not be erased.”

In an interview with the BBC on Wednesday, Ogunyemi reiterated that critics might have a different opinion of the ad had they seen the full thing, reports Reuters.

“The screenshots that have taken the media by storm paint a slightly different picture,” she said.

""I don't feel it was racist,"" she also said.

Hudek, who was arrested in July for trying to pry open an exit door on his flight from Seattle to China, and also for assaulting the passengers and flight attendants who tried to restrain him, told a federal magistrate judge on Tuesday that he consumed edible marijuana before the flight, which caused his outburst.

""My understanding is that it was legal to buy and consume marijuana in [Washington] state,"" Hudek wrote in an affidavit, per the Tampa Bay Times. ""After purchasing the edible marijuana, I ate it.""

""I have never had a remotely similar incident in all my times of flying on an airplane,"" he added.

Hudek’s doctor, too, attested in an affidavit that cannabis could induce ""paranoia, confusion, hallucinations and combativeness"" in users.

This, along with other statements from Hudek’s friends, family and two more physicians, was evidently enough to persuade Magistrate Judge James Donohue, of Washington, to release Hudek, 23, to the custody of his mother in Tampa, reports The Seattle Times.

There’s a catch, however. Hudek is not allowed to fly back to Tampa, and must instead drive or travel by train. He is also not allowed to use marijuana.

Hudek first made headlines this summer, after causing a disturbance aboard a July 6 flight from Seattle to Beijing. Authorities say Hudek left his seat about an hour into the flight, while the plane was over the Pacific Ocean, just northwest of Vancouver Island. He then entered the restroom, exited to ask a question of the flight attendant, re-entered the restroom, and later re-emerged with his shirt off, according to documents obtained by the Tampa Bay Times. He then lunged for the exit door, screaming, “I want to get out!”

Flight attendants and passengers tried to subdue Hudek as he actively fought them off, punching a flight attendant and hitting another passenger on the head with a wine bottle. A crew member also claimed to have broken a wine bottle over Hudek’s head, which apparently didn’t faze the 23-year-old.

The country is currently focused on the treatment of women in the entertainment industry on the heels of Harvey Weinstein’s decades-old history of sexual harassment coming to light. Because of this, old footage of Kimmel has resurfaced from before his transformation into the liberal darling of America.

Kimmel was once the co-host of “The Man Show,” which regularly featured bikini-clad women simply jumping on trampolines. This week, a bit from the show circulated in which Kimmel approaching women on the street and asking them to guess what was in his pants.

“I’ve stuffed something in my pants, and you’re allowed to feel around on the outside of the pants. You’ll have 10 seconds to then guess what is in my pants,” Kimmel said to a woman he apparently met on the street. “You should use two hands.”

Later in the bit he asked one woman to “put her mouth on it” and made sure another participant was at least 18 years old because, “Uncle Jimmy doesn’t need to do time.”

The Federalist co-founder Sean Davis tweeted in response to the footage, “Just last week CNN declared Kimmel to be ‘America's conscience.’ Oops.”

Even Kimmel’s boss, Disney CEO Bob Iger has taken notice of the fact that the “Jimmy Kimmel Live” host is essentially a comedian-turned-activist who could polarize viewers.

“That show is to entertain… I think he should be careful"" - Disney CEO Bob Iger

“That show is to entertain… I think he should be careful,” Iger recently told The New York Times.

Kimmel emerged as an outspoken proponent the Republican Congress’ attempt to undo the Affordable Care Act and was even thanked by many liberals when the bill was eventually killed. He recently delivered a monologue regarding the mass shooting in Las Vegas and teared up when discussing what occurred in his hometown. However, he has been largely silent when it comes to Weinstein – perhaps because he has a ton of clips floating around the Internet that appear crude and sexist.

Other popular segments on “The Man Show” include a mock commercial for “Bosom Springs,” a spoof beverage company billed as the water for “wet t-shirts,” and a visit to Snoop Dogg’s house in which Kimmel pointed out that a statue of a female was “just the right height” while he thrusted his groin toward it. The show even featured a “Juggy Talent Show” in which women dressed in bathing suits demonstrated their unique “talents,” such as fitting an entire banana in their mouth.

“The Man Show” featured so many things that most Americans would find offensive in the modern cultural landscape that it’s impossible to name them all. A quick YouTube search reveals Kimmel asking to see people on the street’s underwear, stuffing his pants to make himself appear well endowed and even asking porn stars for household hints on things such as how to get wine out of a wet t-shirt.

“Make sure you get it really wet,” an adult film star said while pouring liquid on herself.

“The Man Show” was created by Kimmel and fellow comedian Adam Carolla and they starred on the Comedy Central program from 1999 until 2003. When Kimmel wasn’t making sexist jokes during that time, he was often in blackface make-up impersonating African-American NBA legend Karl Malone. Kimmel left and soon after landed at ABC, where he cleaned up his act and started hosting “Jimmy Kimmel Live.”

ABC’s late-night star was a fairly run-of-the-mill, non-political talk show host for the first 10-plus years of the shows run, famous for pulling practical jokes on celebrities and having Hollywood elite read mean tweets about themselves. Once of the show’s more notable segments involved Kimmel joking that he was “f***ing Ben Affleck,” who recently had to apologize for his own groping scandal.

It all changed in early 2017 when Kimmel detailed the open-heart surgery his newborn son, William, had to undergo.

In a notice reviewed by Fox News, the DOJ announced that five jurisdictions “have preliminarily been found to have laws, policies, or practices that may violate” a key federal statute concerning cooperation with federal immigration officials.

They are: Chicago, New Orleans, New York City, Philadelphia and Cook County, Ill.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a written statement that sanctuary cities “adopt the view that the protection of criminal aliens is more important than the protection of law-abiding citizens and of the rule of law.”

“I urge all jurisdictions found to be out of compliance in this preliminary review to reconsider their policies that undermine the safety of their residents,” he said.

The statute in question generally bars local officials from restricting the sharing of immigration and citizenship information with federal immigration officials.

JUDGE SAYS SESSIONS CAN'T WITHHOLD GRANT MONEY TO SANCTUARY CITIES

Sessions earlier this year said any cities and counties out of compliance could lose certain federal grant money.

However, a federal judge in September blocked Sessions from withholding those grants for now, while a Chicago lawsuit against the department plays out in the courts.

Thursday’s notice shows the Department of Justice is still aiming to make a final determination on which jurisdictions are skirting the law.

The Justice Department said the five cities and counties in question will have until Oct. 27 to “provide additional evidence that the interpretation and application of their laws, policies, or practices comply with the statute.”

Officials in those jurisdictions have defended their policies. After the September court ruling, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel called the decision “an affirmation of the rule of law.""

According to the Chicago Tribune, he called it a “clear rejection of the false choice that the Trump Justice Department wanted Chicago to make between our values, our principles and our priorities.""

Several additional jurisdictions had been flagged in a May 2016 inspector general report as having laws that might conflict with federal requirements. But the DOJ on Thursday cleared those jurisdictions, including Milwaukee and the state of Connecticut.

This story has been updated to reflect the ZH2 was displayed at AUSA 2017 and not revealed.","The US Army and General Motors have teamed up to explore a new method of power for Army vehicles that could deliver near silent operation and hard-to-detect heat signatures.

The new vehicle, known as the Chevrolet Colorado ZH2, was displayed at the Association of the United States Army (AUSA) exhibition yesterday. The truck, which uses hydrogen fuel-cells, immediately drew a crowd filled with active duty military personnel.

Based on the existing Chevrolet Colorado truck, the ZH2 has a lot of modifications for military purposes. For starters, it is reinforced inside and out. To tackle the extreme terrain the military faces, it also has a specially modified suspension.

AUSA 2017 IN PICTURES

The fuel-cell-powered electric vehicle is more than six and a half feet tall and more than seven feet wide. It has 37-inch tires and based on a stretched midsize pickup chassis. If chosen to go downrange, then it would be the very first combat vehicle powered with a hydrogen fuel-cell.

GM has worked closely with the U.S. Army Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) on the vehicle. Testing this fuel-cell vehicle for potential military uses began in January of this year and is expected to last a year.

Beating the heat and the noise

With wide potential, hydrogen fuel-cells could mean significantly reduced heat signatures and near silent power-train systems.

Heat signatures are a big challenge for combat. Normally, a vehicle with an internal combustion engine is going to give off a lot of heat. This heat can be detected to reveal location and compromise a team’s location.

But if the enemy is hunting for Army vehicles with infrared cameras and they scan the ZH2 while it is running, the heat this new vehicle gives off is so low that it makes the vehicle almost invisible.

Humvees give off approximately 750 degrees of heat, so they can be detected from more than three miles away. The ZH2’s fuel-cell electric drivetrain, on the other hand, only gives off approximately 140 degrees making it harder to detect and allowing the vehicle to get closer to a target before detection. Some estimates place detection at about one mile away.

Why does that matter? For starters, it means that an enemy has far less warning American forces are about to arrive and far less time to react.

Army testing

Hydrogen fuel cell tech is advancing rapidly – but is it stable enough and safe enough for Army use?

Performance and safety are two key issues that must be proven for the military to even consider adopting a new vehicle.

Chevrolet’s view is that hydrogen fuel stored at pressure is no more dangerous than conventional fuel. The ZH2 tanks store hydrogen at 10,000 psi. So far in the military testing, it seems to be safe enough for use in ground vehicles.

To evaluate the safety of the hydrogen fuel storage, the ZH2 tank has reportedly been shot with 7.62 mm standard, incendiary and armor piercing rounds. It has also been shot with .50 caliber rounds. Buzz at AUSA suggests that a rocket-propelled grenade round penetrated, but failed to explode.

Based on testing so far, the tanks seem almost bulletproof. But if the tank does become breached, then the ZH2 is designed to vent the volatile hydrogen.

More power

In the bed of the ZH2, there is also a portable generator (known as a Exportable Power Take Off unit) that can provide power. If a military team arrives in an area without electricity, then they just have to pull the generator out of the vehicle and they’re good to go.

It could be particularly handy for teams working in remote forward operating base to power essentials like communications and surveillance tech. Or a reconnaissance team could use the generator to enable staying in place for longer, for example.

This fuel-cell-powered military vehicle also produces water as a byproduct. Eventually, the water could be captured and used by teams as well.

Providing a generator is handy, but hydrogen to power that vehicle and generator in the battlespace is currently not exactly easy to come by.

Jet Propellant 8 (otherwise known as JP8) is, however, easy to come by and is used for common things like tanks and trucks. TARDEC has a reformer that converts JP8 to hydrogen.

So if military vehicles use this sort of revolutionary fuel cell power in the future, then the H2 tanks could be filled using this reformer device.

BURGER KING'S NEW SPICY NUGGETS ARE A DIRECT ATTACK ON WENDY'S

“The pizza pouch is part of our completely re-engineered ‘oven-hot delivery system,’” said Zipporah Allen, Pizza Hut vice president of brand marketing and consumer insight, told NRN on Monday. The pouch, which accommodates three boxed pizzas, was designed for a 20 to 35-minute delivery period.

A post shared by Pizza Hut 🍕 (@pizzahut) on Oct 9, 2017 at 2:17pm PDT

The pouch’s three layers consist of a 3M Thinsulate lining, a heat-reflecting aluminum material and a polyester fiber padding. Each layer was meticulously thought out, drawing from materials used in cold-weather jackets, space blankets and home insulation.

Along with the updated pizza pouch, the new box comes with some fresh features of its own. In addition to the heat-trapping corrugated sides, there will be a new tray for the pizza to sit on.

“In particular, the crisp sheet will go into every Pizza Hut box,” Allen said. “The role of the crisp sheet is to keep the crust crisp and craveable as the pizza is being transported from the oven the consumer.”

The crisp sheet is cardboard that is ridged, Allen said, “so you get the insulation from the air between the ridges.”

Then comes the better algorithm to ensure more efficient drivers and more accurate delivery times, with text notifications to keep the customer updated -- making for a quick and perfectly hot pie.

These updates are part of Yum Brands’ $130 million investment plan for Pizza Hut to improve restaurant technology and equipment.

“We have cracked the code on how to deliver pizzas hotter,"" Allen told CNBC. ""This is consistent with where we see our growth, with digital and delivery.""

Yet not all “speech” is treated as equal in coverage and attention.

Over the last few weeks, the free speech rights of students on college campuses have been violated as peaceful chalk messages from students have been destroyed, flyers pulled down and permits for new pro-life groups and speakers slow walked through the approval process to prevent voices from being heard. If you haven’t heard about the college blockade taking place even this week, perhaps it is because the students whose voices are being forcibly silenced favor life over abortion. And while they may not get the attention that millionaire athletes can garner, their points of view are no less valid.

Pro-life students represent a growing majority who want to have the same free speech rights as other groups.

For the past 11 years, Students for Life has been on the forefront of the campus free speech movement, witnessing a rising tide of opposition to those who do not agree with the dictates of a politically correct worldview. As national opinion on abortion has shifted toward the pro-life viewpoint over the past few years, I mistakenly thought that -- apart from some aging, hostile school administrators -- most of the drama was behind us.

But then the 2016 election happened. And now, pro-abortion forces, fearing the withdrawal of taxpayer dollars from Planned Parenthood, pro-life Supreme Court appointments, and a barrage of pro-life legislation and regulations, are doing everything they can to silence a growing pro-life majority and fight back against the voices of the very people they claim to represent.

As the New Yorker observed this week: “In the half century between the elections of Governor Reagan and President Trump, the left and the right would appear to have switched sides, the left fighting against free speech and the right fighting for it.”

And on college campuses, a polluted political environment is turning ugly. A recent poll even shows that 20 percent of students now support using violence to prevent controversial speakers from being heard on campus.

Students for Life of America is unfortunately all too aware of the attacks on free speech on high school and college campuses. Consider just a few examples from last spring:

When Queens College denied Norvilia Etienne the right to start a Students for Life group on her campus, we immediately went into action, contacting our attorneys at Alliance Defending Freedom. They filed a lawsuit on her behalf and within three days, Queens College backed down and let Norvilia start her group, which has taken off on campus. We’re still dealing with the administration now, though, as the group has been denied equal treatment in receiving student activity funding and their club status may be still be revoked under the university’s existing policies.

At Fresno State, a professor bragged on campus about erasing our chalked messages directing women to non-violent health care and directing others to do so as well. He claimed it was part of his free speech to destroy messages that he did not like. These situations happen regularly, such as at Kutztown University, where school officials scrubbed away our messages, and more recently at George Mason University, where school police told our Students for Life members that is was the freedom of speech rights of the pro-abortion protestors to vandalize our messages.

At California State University, San Marcos, a Students for Life group applied for funding for an on-campus display, but was told there was a $500 cap on their requests. Yet, LGBT groups on campus were able to receive hundreds of thousands of dollars in funding from student government, without an apparent cap.

The list could go on. Our student groups are routinely denied equal access to school fees funding. For example, Colorado State University denied our group’s request for a""‘Diversity Grant,"" meant to bring awareness of a variety of issues, because a pro-life speaker could offend some people at the school.

The right to free speech on campus must be protected. At Students for Life of America, we welcome debate on issues and do not try to squelch the free speech rights of groups that might disagree with us, such as pro-abortion or feminist groups. In fact, we welcome it. College and high school should be a training ground for young people to explore, express, and share ideas; in just a few years, they will be running the show in Washington and on Wall Street.

Pro-life students represent a growing majority who want to have the same free speech rights as other groups. And officials in charge of high schools and colleges must stop slow-walking Students for Life group registrations with the cynical hope of delaying approval until after interested students have graduated. High schools and college must stop denying our groups funding for speakers and events. And high schools and colleges must stop using unconstitutional arguments about us being ""controversial,"" ""political,"" or ""religious"" as a cudgel against our clubs' formation.

Just as heated debates over slavery, civil rights, and women’s rights swept through the culture as conversations and confrontations debated the value of all lives, no matter the race, creed, color or gender, so to a rigorous debate over the value of preborn life must be heard. Students on college campuses deserve the same respect as millionaire athletes in expressing and sharing their points of view, for without a right to life, no other debate can truly engaged.",Shouldn’t pro-life students have the same free speech rights as millionaire athletes?,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/12/shouldn-t-pro-life-students-have-same-free-speech-rights-as-millionaire-athletes.html

Winds up to 45 mph (72 kph) were expected to pummel areas north of San Francisco where at least 23 people have died and at least 3,500 homes and businesses have been destroyed. The conditions could erase modest gains made by firefighters.

""It's going to continue to get worse before it gets better,"" state fire Chief Ken Pimlott said Wednesday.

Entire cities had evacuated in anticipation of the next round of flames, their streets empty, the only motion coming from ashes falling like snowflakes.

In Calistoga, a historic resort town known for wine tastings and hot springs, 5,300 people were under evacuation orders. Tens of thousands more have been driven from their homes by the flames. A few left behind cookies for firefighters and signs reading, ""Please save our home!""

The 22 fires, many out of control, spanned more than 265 square miles (686 square kilometers) as the inferno entered its fourth day. Strategic attacks that have kept wildfire destruction and death tolls low in recent years haven't worked against the ferocity of the blazes.

""We are literally looking at explosive vegetation,"" Pimlott said.

""Make no mistake,"" he added later, ""this is a serious, critical, catastrophic event.""

Residents in the community of Boyes Hot Springs in Sonoma County were told to clear out Wednesday, and the streets were quickly lined with cars packed with fleeing people.

""That's very bad,"" resident Nick Hinman said when a deputy warned him that the driving winds could shift the wildfires toward the town of Sonoma, where 11,000 people live. ""It'll go up like a candle.""

The ash rained down on e Sonoma Valley, covering windshields, as winds picked up. Countless emergency vehicles hurried toward the flames, sirens blaring, as evacuees sped away after jamming possessions into their cars and filling their gas tanks.

Officials voiced concern that the 22 separate blazes would merge into larger infernos.

""We have had big fires in the past. This is one of the biggest, most serious, and it's not over,"" Gov. Jerry Brown said at a news conference Wednesday, alongside the state's top emergency officials.

They said 8,000 firefighters and other personnel were battling the blazes, with more resources pouring in from Arizona, Nevada, Washington and Oregon.

Flames have raced across the wine-growing region and the scenic coastal area of Mendocino farther north, leveling whole neighborhoods and leaving brick chimneys and charred appliances to mark the sites where homes once stood.

In Boyes Hot Springs, residents had watched ridges over the west side of town for days to gauge how close the orange flames had come. On Wednesday, the ridges were obscured by growing clouds of smoke.

With fires advancing from several sides in Sonoma Valley, law enforcement officers on loan from other areas barred residents of evacuated communities from returning to see how their homes and businesses had fared. Roadblocks were set up between Sonoma and devastated areas of Santa Rosa.

Alejandro Rodriguez had been evacuated from one tiny Sonoma Valley town, only to have deputies come to the neighborhood where he had relocated and tell residents to pack up and go.

""I want to see my house, see if anything's left,"" Rodriguez said, gesturing at officers at one roadblock. ""They won't tell us nothing.""

Sonoma County Sheriff Robert Giordano said hundreds of people had been reported missing. But officials believe many will eventually be found. Chaotic evacuations and poor communications over the past few days have made locating friends and family difficult.

The sheriff expects the death toll to climb.

""The devastation is enormous,"" he said. ""We can't even get into most areas.""

Helicopters and air tankers were assisting thousands of firefighters trying to beat back the flames. Until now, the efforts have focused on ""life safety"" rather than extinguishing the blazes, partly because the flames were shifting with winds and targeting communities without warning.

Fires were ""burning faster than firefighters can run, in some situations,"" Emergency Operations Director Mark Ghilarducci said.

In Southern California, cooler weather and moist ocean air helped firefighters gain ground against a wildfire that has scorched nearly 14 square miles (36 sq. kilometers).

Orange County fire officials said the blaze was 60 percent contained.

Travelers will walk through a tunnel which will be projected with a virtual aquarium As people walk through, 80 built-in cameras will scan their faces and irises. When they reach the end, they’ll either be allowed through with a message that reads “Have a nice trip,” or held up with a red sign that alerts security, The Verge reports.

The images inside the tunnel can be changed to display landscapes or advertisements. The purpose is not just to hide the cameras, but to encourage people to look around, allowing the cameras to capture better-quality face scans.

“The fish [are] a sort of entertainment and something new for the traveler but, at the end of the day, it attracts the vision of the travelers to different corners in the tunnel for the cameras to capture his / her face print,” Major Gen Obaid Al Hameeri, deputy director general of Dubai residency and foreign affairs, told The National.

The project, which is being developed in partnership with Emirates airline, can be seen beginning in 2018 in Terminal 3, with other terminals to follow in phases through 2020, according to The Verge.

In fact AQ's activities in Afghanistan is part of the reason for President Trump's decision to give Defense Secretary Jim Mattis the jurisdiction to deploy more American forces to the war-torn country. An estimated 9,800 American troops are already in Afghanistan, with around 2,000 of them designated to fighting insurgent groups — with AQ still a key player.

“Al Qaeda is at least a few hundred strong,” recently resigned Afghan Army Chief of Staff, Qadam Shah Shahim, told Fox News. “They keep their operations very secret, work closely with the big groups for protection, and still pose a threat to the world.”

In December, Gen. John Nicholson, America’s top military commander in Afghanistan, stated that the U.S. had killed or captured hundreds of AQ fighters in 2016 alone — and that the group’s numbers were far higher than previously issued estimates. The year before, U.S. and Afghan forces together dismantled AQ networks and a large training camp in Kandahar, in what turned out to be one of the largest joint raids ever.

So 16 years since 9/11 and six years after its financier and leader Usama bin Laden was killed, how does the terror outfit still operate? Officials say AQ’s stamina and mild resurgence in recent years can be accredited to its ability to foster tag-team partnerships with other terrorist groups.

“Al Qaeda still has a prominent role, once these networks are established, they persist,” Dr. Abdullah Abdullah, the Chief Executive Officer of Afghanistan told Fox News. “Just because we don’t hear as much about it doesn’t mean it no longer exists.”

The attacks AQ members are involved in, he said, are these days mostly orchestrated by ISIS. The two networks are known to routinely work together, particularly in the northern provinces of Kunduz and Badakhshan, funneling fighters through the porous border from Chitral, Pakistan.

“Al Qaeda and ISIS have a lot of commonalities and they share the same Salafi ideology,” said Sayed Ishaq Gailani, a Sufi politician who founded the National Solidarity Movement of Afghanistan, referring to the extremely conservative arm of the Islamic religion practiced by some Sunni Muslims.

But what also keeps AQ thriving is the group’s good relations with the other main jihadist players across the country; they also have cooperation agreements for access to havens in areas controlled by other terrorists.

“We are seeing AQ remobilize themselves, especially in the eastern provinces of Nangarhar and Kandahar where they cooperate mostly with the Taliban,” said a high-ranking official with the National Directorate of Security, the Afghan equivalent of the FBI. “And now there is talk of a base in Bagram.”

And in the southeastern province of Zabul, AQ is believed to operate under the umbrella of the Haqqani network (HQN), a Taliban offshoot known for its extreme brutality and rampant kidnapping for ransom. The group previously held U.S. soldier Bowe Bergdahl, and still has in custody U.S. hiker Caitlan Coleman and her husband and children.

AQ provides fighters, expertise and material support to HQN when needed, intelligence officials highlighted, and several times its members have participated in joint operations with the Taliban and HQN. Furthermore, Afghan officials allege that AQ’s murky alliance with Pakistan remains its most fundamental lifeline as most of its training and supplies originate from the neighboring nation.

The Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, often referred to as the Punjabi Taliban, is said to work directly with AQ in Pakistan’s federally administered tribal areas alongside the Afghanistan border. In March, U.S. forces struck and killed noted AQ leader Qari Yasin in Afghanistan’s Paktika province.

The Balochistan, Pakistan, native was responsible for the death of two American service members in a 2008 Islamabad hotel bombing as well as an attack on Sri Lanka’s cricket team the following year. Yasin was known to also have ties with the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan and facilitate agreements between the two parties.

AQ additionally has merger agreements with smaller militant factions in the area, including Lashkar-e-Taiba which was founded in the mid 1980s with bin Laden funding, as well as Jaish-e-Mohammed, a Pakistan jihadist group devoted to fighting India over the state of Kashmir.

And according to Shahim and several other intelligence officials who spoke to Fox News under the condition of anonymity, AQ’s leader, the 66-year-old Ayman al-Zawahri — an Egyptian militant who was the longtime No. 2 and took over after bin Laden was slain by U.S. Navy SEALs — is more than likely living covertly in Pakistan.

Sources said recent indicators of his whereabouts have focused on the remote area between the villages of Atter Shisha and Dhodial in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region — some 23 miles north of Abbottabad, where bin Laden lived. It also was recently reported that Zawahri is possibly spending at least some of his time shielded by the population density of Pakistan’s largest city, Karachi.

""Zawahri continues to operate a big network, he is still very dangerous and provides the guidance and strategy,” one well-placed Afghan intelligence source told Fox News. “And he still enjoys Gulf state funding.”

He remains at the top of the U.S. government’s Rewards for Justice Most Wanted list, alongside ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, with a $25 million price tag on offer for each of them to be brought to justice.

But U.S-led forces soon may have another bin Laden to contend with at the AQ helm. The slain leader's 28-year-old son Hamza has recently emerged — with blessings from Zawahri — as the esteemed figure to mobilize the upcoming generation of jihadists of take over the AQ helm.

“Prepare diligently to inflict crippling losses on those who have disbelieved,” Hamza, believed to be the 15th of bin Laden’s 20 children, says softly in an audio recording that surfaced late last month. “Follow in the footsteps of martyrdom seekers before you.”

He goes on to explicitly signal followers to court revenge for the deaths of Syrian children killed in airstrikes by launching attacks inside America and Europe. Hamza, who is said to be married with at least two children, too is alleged to have long resided in the northwestern tribal region of Pakistan.

The DOD didn't respond to questions pertaining to Al Qaeda or its current leadership in the region, but stated that the ""revised Afghanistan strategy will be presented to the President for his approval in the coming weeks.""

The president made the comments in a series of early-morning tweets.

“’Puerto Rico survived the Hurricanes, now a financial crisis looms largely of their own making.’ Says Sharyl Attkisson. A total lack of accountability say[s] the Governor. Electric and all infrastructure was disaster before hurricanes,” Trump said.

“Congress to decide how much to spend…We cannot keep FEMA, the Military & the First Responders, who have been amazing (under the most difficult circumstances) in P.R. forever!”

The president’s comments come just one week after he visited the U.S. territory that is struggling to recover from the devastation left by Hurricane Maria, the strongest hurricane to hit Puerto Rico in nearly a century.

Trump’s trip to Puerto Rico was criticized, for among other things commenting on how the storm's death toll was far lower than that of a “real catastrophe like Katrina” in 2005.

“Sixteen people versus in the thousands,” Trump said. “You can be very proud of all your people.”

The president has repeatedly called for more help “on a local level” from Puerto Rico and has had an intermittent feud with the San Juan mayor, who also has faced criticism for engaging in political combat when other officials on the island are not.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., shot back Thursday at Trump's latest tweets.

""Why do you continue to treat Puerto Ricans differently than other Americans when it comes to natural disasters?"" Schumer tweeted.

Ryan plans to meet with local officials and emergency personnel.

The House is expected to vote this week on an emergency spending package including billions of dollars more in relief for Puerto Rico, Texas and Florida in the wake of deadly storms Maria, Harvey and Irma this hurricane season.

5:50 p.m.

Pakistan's military says soldiers have recovered five Western hostages held by the Taliban for years.

Pakistan's army did not name those held, only saying it worked with U.S. intelligence officials to track down the hostages and free them after discovering they had been brought into Pakistan.

However, two army officials who spoke to The Associated Press on Thursday identified the hostages as Canadian Joshua Boyle, his American wife Caitlan Coleman and their children who were kidnapped in Afghanistan in 2012. They spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to release the information.

-- Supreme Court of the United States in Street v. New York (1969)

Sometimes the public expression of unwanted ideas reaches directly into our living rooms. When President Donald Trump attacked a half-dozen or so professional football players who, instead of standing during the traditional playing of the national anthem prior to football games, “took a knee” by kneeling on one or both of their knees during the anthem, hundreds more players on national television took a knee in defiance of the president.

Here is the back story.

Last year, a quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, Colin Kaepernick, began quietly taking a knee at NFL games to protest what he said was the excessive use of force by police. He was the subject of mild but largely below-the-radar criticism by those who thought sincerely that taking a knee publicly during the playing of the national anthem was a sign of disrespect for the flag and the anthem and thus for this country.

When a few of his buddies and former colleagues -- he is no longer a member of an NFL team -- followed suit for a variety of reasons, all of which centered around the right to protest the policies of the government, Trump saw a political opening.

At a rally in Alabama last month, Trump aggressively attacked the practice of taking a knee. He argued that it was so disrespectful to the American flag and the national anthem that those who had taken a knee should be fired from their jobs.

This pronouncement focused a spotlight on the six or so scattered players who had followed Kaepernick’s lead, and soon hundreds were doing so. The president took their behavior as an affront to him and to the nation, and he persisted in his attacks on the players. Soon, some team owners joined their players in various means of expressing solidarity with those who had taken a knee.

When the players union backed up these silent expressions of political opinions, it argued that all of its members have a constitutional right to express themselves in uniform in their workplace. Do they? The short answer is that it depends on where the players are when they take a knee.

Some jurisdictions -- such as California, the District of Columbia, New Jersey and New York -- give more protection to employees for expressive conduct in the workplace than others do. When the expressive conduct -- taking a knee, bowing one's head, locking arms with colleagues -- occurs in the workplace, the issue is not necessarily one of free speech, because the First Amendment only comes into play when the government itself is accused of infringing upon or compelling speech. In the NFL, the alleged infringers of speech or compellers of speech are team management, not the government.

Expressive conduct -- lawful behavior that offers a political opinion -- is the constitutional equivalent of free speech. So interfering with expressive conduct or commanding its cessation in conformity to management’s political or patriotic views constitutes interfering with speech. May employers do that?

In states where expressive conduct in the workplace is protected, employees may express themselves as long as they do not materially interfere with the business of the workplace. In states without that employee protection, they may not do so.

So in states such as Texas, an employee who refuses to comply with an instruction from management to conform to certain behavior in public -- e.g., standing during the playing of the national anthem -- can be disciplined, as Texas lacks the added protections for individual workplace expressions that a few states provide.

However, even in the states that lack the employee expression protection, if management’s instructions to conform require conformance on property that the government owns, such as a publicly owned stadium, then management is treated constitutionally as if it were the government. Just as the government cannot interfere with speech to suppress its content or to compel conformity, neither may team management when teams play on government-owned land.

Thus, in states where the government owns the stadiums or where expressive conduct in the workplace is protected, employees may engage in expressive conduct in defiance of management, as long as their conduct does not interfere with the workplace. Just as the government may interfere with speech for non-content-related reasons -- for example, noise at night or safety in a crowd -- management may interfere with speech when the speech itself interferes with the business of the workplace.

If team management could show that taking a knee materially interferes with the workplace product -- money for the owners resulting from players winning football games -- because it chases away ticket buyers or reduces advertising or media revenue or impairs team morale and thus produces poor play, it would have a strong case, even in the states with employee protection laws and even in venues owned by the government.

In the famous flag burning cases a few years ago, the Supreme Court made clear that in America, we have no revered symbols that command orthodox respect. The flag itself represents the right to treat it as one wishes. We are free to respect the flag and to shun those who do not, but we may not harm a hair on their heads.

The container was set up at the park last year to collect worn and torn American flags that needed to be properly retired by the Boy Scouts. The youth organization holds symbolic ceremonies to retire old or damaged flags, which is done in a methodical and “respectful” matter, according to the Boy Scouts.

But investigators with the Los Angeles Fire Department believe an arsonist deliberately set fire to the container at Granada Hills Veterans Park. A suspect has been taken into custody, Fox 11 reported.

Barbara Wright, whose son Ronald set up the container as part of his Eagle Scout Project before joining the Army, told the news station that it was “appalling” to see the burnt flags. Deliberately burning or damaging a flag without the ceremony is considered desecration.

“It was just appalling that somebody would do such a thing to our flag, our nation’s symbol, it was devastating,” she said. “[My son] was very upset about it and he just wants to see it restored to its original status.”

She said the container, placed at the park last August, has been popular among those who want to properly dispose of old or damaged flags.

“We have collected so many flags from within the first week of it being placed here,” she added, estimating at least 1,000 flags have been collected over the past year.

By The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board



The Boy Scouts of America (BSA) announced Wednesday that next year it will allow girls to join the Cub Scouts. By 2019 it will start a program for older girls to become Eagle Scouts. At first it seems the Scouts have finally surrendered in the culture war, but the reality is more complicated.

Boy Scout membership has fallen by about a third since 2000, and today some 2.4 million young people take part in Scouting. The organization has long tried to broaden its appeal with programs like Sea Scouting and Venturing, which are open to women. In its announcement the organization noted that it wants to offer more programs for entire families. One survey showed 90% of parents not involved with Scouting were interested in getting their daughters into a program like the Cub Scouts.

Scouting conjures images of hiking in the outdoors and learning to tie knots, and the outdoors should remain central to its mission to build confidence that comes from mastering one’s surroundings. But Scouting has long offered merit badges in skills like computer programming and personal finance that are also helpful to girls and boys.

Currently Cub Scouts are organized into local packs made up of dens of about a half-dozen elementary-school boys. Once girls can enter the Cub Scouts, dens will remain single-gender. Packs can decide whether to be mixed- or single-gender. And girls who want to become Eagle Scouts will do so in a program designed specifically for girls. “This unique approach allows the organization to maintain the integrity of the single gender model while also meeting the needs of today’s families,” the Scouts said.

The unanimous decision by the BSA board may also be a compromise to prevent total gender integration. The group’s statement acknowledged that girls have tried to join for years, and after taking so much abuse for resisting gay scouts until 2013, the group couldn’t want another media or court fight over gender.

Goodell noted, however, the NFL respects the opinions of players who've knelt, sat or raised a fist in protest.

“Building on many discussions with clubs and players, we have worked to develop a plan that we will review with you at next week’s League meeting,"" Goodell wrote. ""This would include such elements as an in-season platform to promote the work of our players on these core issues, and that will help to promote positive change in our country.""

Goodell said conversations with players about the anthem issue would continue and he hoped the NFL and owners could have a “full and open discussion” during next week’s meeting.

Goodell's letter follows President Trump’s tweets Tuesday that suggested the U.S. change its tax laws to punish organizations such as the NFL if members were found to be “disrespecting” the national anthem or flag.

""Why is the NFL getting massive tax breaks while at the same time disrespecting our Anthem, Flag and Country? Change tax law!"" Trump wrote.

Trump has also called on NFL owners to discipline players who don't stand for the anthem. On Sunday, Vice President Pence walked out on his home-state Indianapolis Colts game when members of the opposing team, the San Francisco 49ers, took a knee during the national anthem.

Pence tweeted around kickoff: ""I left today's Colts game because @POTUS and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem.""

VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE LEAVES COLTS-49ERS GAME AFTER PLAYERS KNEEL DURING ANTHEM

Trump tweeted Sunday he asked Pence to leave the stadium if players knelt or sat during the national anthem.

Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones became the first NFL owner to suggest repercussions for displays of protest during the national anthem.

The protests began last year when former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick sat or knelt during the national anthem as a way to bring attention to the killings of black men by police officers. Kaepernick, a free agent, has not yet been signed by a team after opting out of his contract with the 49ers.

To most women, Michelle Obama seems to have enjoyed a dream life.
Michelle Obama was perfectly positioned to manage this nexus of politics and business, helped by her husband’s status as a rising star in Chicago’s minority firmament.
And they don’t need to be lectured by Michelle Obama.","Isn’t Michelle Obama adorable? She actually thinks she is a typical woman in the United States, and that she can speak for all of us.

Michelle says she has no interest in running for president, trying to shatter what Hillary Clinton called the “highest and hardest glass ceiling,” but she might consider bursting out of that elitist, condescending Beltway Bubble.

Speaking recently at the Pennsylvania Conference for Women, Obama pushed women to speak up for themselves in the workplace. “Don’t waste your seat at the table,” she said. “If you are scared to use your voice, then you’ve got to get up and give it to someone who isn’t afraid to use the spot.”

Such good advice, coming from someone whose idea of hardship was graduating from Princeton University and Harvard Law School, and whose husband has always been there to provide for her.

To most women, Michelle Obama seems to have enjoyed a dream life. Married to a political supernova, spending eight years in the White House (which she once described as having “prisonlike elements”), moving on to a life of luxury and power; she has no idea how the real world functions. Her advice could get a lot of women fired.

In other words, she thinks women who voted for Trump did as they were told. And yet, isn’t that what Michelle is doing? Telling women what to think and what to say?

In 2014 she told the White House Working Families Summit how she once applied for a job at the University of Chicago Medical Center with her newborn baby in tow, and on the spot demanded flexible hours so that she could care for her growing family. She told her prospective employer, ""If you want me to do the job, you've got to pay me to do the job and you've got to give me flexibility.""

Doesn’t that sound like a terrific negotiating premise? I can’t do the job unless you bend the rules for me, possibly alienating my co-workers? Come on. Most women (or men) insisting on such special treatment would be shown the door.

“That was one of the first times I demanded flexibility,” Michelle says proudly about that early interview, as she exhorts others to follow her lead. For many of us who have juggled the demands of motherhood and work, the advice doesn’t ring true. It is the rare young job applicant, male or female, who can lay down demands, and women embarking on motherhood are typically more anxious than most to appear committed to their job. They need to be, as employers are understandably anxious about the competing demands on their time.

As a result, many of us put off having families until we were far enough along in our careers to negotiate some flexibility and consideration.

At the time that Michelle made that bold demand, her husband was a state senator in Illinois, and preparing to run for the U.S. Senate. He had earlier been a high-profile community organizer in Chicago, earning significant visibility within the city’s black community. Michelle initially worked at a top Chicago law firm; at the time she references she was being recruited to build the medical group’s community relations with Chicago’s South Side, where her husband had paved the way for her.

As the Washington Post revealed in 2008, Michelle Obama worked to redirect health care in the impoverished neighborhoods surrounding the hospital to local clinics, freeing up the Medical Center to care for patients with insurance who could pay more for the hospital’s care. The initiative was controversial; critics claimed the undertaking boosted the non-profit’s hospital’s bottom line at the expense of its commitment to the surrounding neighborhoods. To boost her efforts, she hired David Axlerod’s PR firm. Michelle Obama was perfectly positioned to manage this nexus of politics and business, helped by her husband’s status as a rising star in Chicago’s minority firmament. Hence, she had an excellent platform from which to demand special consideration.

She was paid well over $100,000 early on, which jumped to more than $300,000 when she became a Vice President, the year after her husband became a U.S. Senator. One of the earmarks the freshman senator petitioned for was a million dollar request for the UC Medical Center, which was never granted. Michelle had a strong wind at her back, named Barack.

Michelle has other advice these days – indeed, she is becoming the Edgar Bergen of our times, throwing her “voice” into the mouths of American women. Like the famed puppet master speaking for Charlie McCarthy, Michelle is spewing dictates, including recently telling women at an event in Boston “As far as I’m concerned, any woman who voted against Hillary Clinton voted against their own voice in a way. . . . We look at those two candidates, as women, and many of us said, ‘That guy. He’s better for me. His voice is more true to me.’ Well, to me that just says you don’t like your voice. You like the thing we’re told to like.”

In other words, she thinks women who voted for Trump did as they were told. And yet, isn’t that what Michelle is doing? Telling women what to think and what to say?

The question, ""A few people in my family have had breast cancer. Should I get genetic testing?"" was answered by Megan Frone, certified genetic counselor, National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.

If you have multiple people on the same side of the family with breast cancer or with other types (such as ovarian or pancreatic), with rare cancers (such as cancer in both breasts or breast cancer in men), or cancer diagnosed at an early age, you may have an increased risk for breast and other cancers.

BREAST CANCER AWARENESS MONTH: KEY TERMS YOU SHOULD KNOW

Say you do decide to get screened—it's a simple blood or saliva test. It's important to see a certified genetic counselor. (You can find one near you at nsgc.org/page/find-a-gc-search.) Many people are familiar with the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, which signal greater risk for breast and other cancers, such as ovarian, but there is a whole world of other genes that could mean the same.

Because we're finding new genes all the time, the results—and what you should do with the information—are not always as clear-cut as with the BRCA genes, where we have years of research on treatment outcomes. (In that case, management may include yearly breast MRIs or risk-reducing surgeries like a bilateral mastectomy.) A genetic counselor will be current on the latest news on which genes to test for based on your family history and how to interpret the sometimes murky results.

BREAST CANCER STAGES AND SURVIVAL RATES

And before you even take the test, the genetic counselor can discuss privacy concerns. A 2008 law prevents discrimination based on DNA by employers and health insurance providers, but the law does not cover disability, life, or long-term-care insurance. She can help you make an informed decision.

Damon crashed Kimmel’s interview with Chris Hemsworth, who was on the show to promote his new film “Thor: Ragnorak.”

Kimmel, who has a fake feud with “The Martian” actor, said, “It’s the mighty Thor not the muddy bore, so maybe take a walk!”

Hemsworth joked along and insisted he did not ask Damon to accompany him in the interview.

“I mean, I’m friends with him, but —”

“Why are you friends with him?” Kimmel asked.

“I feel sorry for him,” Hemsworth said. “He has nothing; he has nothing. I saw a friend in need and I just thought to extend a handshake.”

Kimmel did not ask Damon any questions regarding Weinstein or the allegations.

The segment aired hours after Damon came forward to address reports that he helped cover up a story about Weinstein.

Sharon Waxman, former New York Times writer and current CEO and editor-in-chief of TheWrap, was working on an article for the Times in 2004 that traced sexual misconduct allegations to Weinstein.

Waxman claimed Fabrizio Lombardo, Miramax Italy’s head in 2004, was there to ensure women were available to Weinstein at all times. The story was shot down to remove any mention of sexual misconduct after associates of Weinstein, which reportedly included Damon and Russell Crowe, called to vouch for Lombardo at the behest of Weinstein.

“My recollection was that it was about a one-minute phone call. Harvey had called me and said, they’re writing a story about Fabrizio, who I knew from ‘The Talented Mr. Ripley.’ He has organized our premiere in Italy and so I knew him in a professional capacity and I’d had dinner at his house,” Damon told Deadline.

“Harvey said, 'Sharon Waxman is writing a story about Fabrizio and it’s really negative. Can you just call and tell her what your experience with Fabrizio was?' So I did, and that’s what I said to her. It didn’t even make the piece that she wrote.”

HILARIE BURTON: BEN AFFLECK GROPED ME ON ‘TRL’ WHEN ‘I WAS A KID’

Damon said he was not aware of the content of the story he was commenting on and affirmed he was not among the number of celebrities claiming they knew about Weinstein’s actions prior to the expose by the New York Times and The New Yorker.

""I did five or six movies with Harvey. I never saw this. I think a lot of actors have come out and said, everybody’s saying we all knew. That’s not true,"" Damon told Deadline. ""This type of predation happens behind closed doors, and out of public view. If there was ever an event that I was at and Harvey was doing this kind of thing and I didn’t see it, then I am so deeply sorry, because I would have stopped it.""

Last week, The New York Times reported Weinstein had paid off women who accused the Hollywood producer of sexual harassment for decades. On Tuesday, the New Yorker released its own expose of Weinstein that included three accusations of rape.

Pattison brought a giant watermelon topped with a pink bow.

The gift was not received well by his fellow firefighters – 90 percent of whom are black – and resulted in Pattison’s swift termination before he had officially started.

Fox2 reports that several African-American firefighters at Engine 55 were offended by the watermelon, which has been used as a racist symbol since the slavery era.

Engine 55 firefighter Patrick Trout said Pattison bringing the watermelon was “probably a bad call.”

“When you get your first detail at a firehouse, you pretty much know what you are getting yourself into,” Trout said to Fox2.

Pattison reportedly said the watermelon – which was delivered whole and not served – was intended to be a gift, not a joke.

However, the fire department decided after an investigation into the incident that the best action was to fire Pattison.

""After a thorough investigation, it was determined that the best course of action was to terminate the employment of this probationary employee,” Fire Commissioner Eric Jones said in a statement.

“There is zero tolerance for discriminatory behavior inside the Detroit Fire Department. On Saturday, Sept. 30, 2017, at Engine 55, a trial firefighter (probationary employee) engaged in unsatisfactory work behavior which was deemed offensive and racially insensitive to members of the Detroit Fire Department,” the statement said.

When McCarty was asked if it is “racially insensitive to bring a watermelon into a fire house,” the Chief said that it is “to some people.”

Though, the Chief admits he thinkd there may have been a different course of action than firing Pattison, and that he didn’t think Pattison deserved to lose his job.

“Between what he did and losing his job, there were a few things that could have been done,” McCarty said.

McCarty went on to say that a group of firefighters wanted Pattison fired, but many wanted him to be able to stay so they could begin a discussion about why his gift was seen as offensive and start a dialogue.

Since Pattison’s termination, a petition has been started demanding his reinstatement. As of Tuesday evening, over 700 have signed it.

Here are some reasons why a humble pullout cabinet for waste deserves a little consideration and a space in your kitchen.

Out of sight, out of mind. When you think about your dream kitchen, what do you imagine? I’ll bet the garbage bin is not the first thing that comes to mind. But then, this is the whole point of a waste pullout: It tucks the garbage, recycling and other waste bins out of sight but within easy access. That way you don’t have to look at a messy freestanding bin or struggle with a tiny, seemingly always full can tucked under the sink.

Seamless integration. Because a waste pullout is essentially just a very deep drawer, it can easily be integrated into the look of your cabinetry, bringing some great contemporary functionality to very traditional or transitional style.

In fact, it’s quite common for a pullout drawer to be faced out with multiple false fronts to help it blend more seamlessly into a cabinet scheme.

Ease of use. If you cook often, one of the trickiest and yet most common tasks is sweeping away the remnants from chopping. You can carefully carry a chopping board to the bin, or you can bring the bin to the chopping board. Locating your garbage or compost pullout below a chopping zone means you can sweep waste directly into the bin with ease.

Here’s another smart take on this idea: a pullout chopping block (in place of a typical drawer) positioned above a waste pullout, with a simple hole to allow for trimmings to be swept directly into the bin. A great option for small kitchens, as the whole chopping station can be closed away when not in use, and the main counter can still be used for other things.

Waste sorting. Pullout cabinets aren’t just useful for holding your garbage bins. More and more cities today not only facilitate recycling or composting, they also require some level of waste sorting, and this requires managing multiple bins.

Depending on the system you use, you can easily have space for two sizable bins, or many smaller ones, configured with one tucked behind the other in a full-depth cabinet, or side by side, or many other configurations to suit your typical needs.

Odor control. One major concern that people often have with waste bins is the odors that can linger in the kitchen. There are several possible ways to combat this issue, and one is by using compartments with individual lids for organic waste.

Some waste pullout systems even integrate a special bin with a securely sealing lid specifically to hold compost, so you don’t have to change it with excessive frequency just to keep odors in check. Keep in mind how quickly it will fill; you’ll want to plan ahead so that organic waste isn’t left sitting exposed to air for too long.

Another option is to put different types of waste into their own cabinets with appropriately sized bins so that you only have to open the relevant compartment at any particular time. You can devote more space for plastics and less for compost, or vice versa, depending on your needs.

All-in-one storage. If you want to make sure nobody has an excuse for not changing the bin when it’s full, try a drawer that includes a small storage drawer inside, and you can keep garbage bags and related products right by the bins themselves.

You can also use interior drawers to split compartments into smaller subcompartments or to keep cleaning products or deodorizers on hand.

A fit for any budget. Want a fully luxe look? For just a little extra investment, a system with side panels (which can be custom fitted by your cabinetmaker) will more fully cover the bins for a discreet look even while the cabinet is pulled open.

Meanwhile, at the other end of the budget spectrum, pullout systems integrated into a standard door cabinet can turn any underused space into a garbage pullout with room for multiple bins without a total renovation. Plus, for dexterous chefs, they can be pulled and pushed by foot to facilitate disposal even when hands are full.",7 reasons to consider pullout waste and recycling cabinets,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/08/03/7-reasons-to-consider-pullout-waste-and-recycling-cabinets.html

The kitchen has more places for cooties than anywhere else in your home – even more than your bathroom, on average. We are going to look at those spots where bacteria love to hide and give you some tips and tools to keep them clean and sanitary.

1. Sinks. You might be surprised to learn that there are more germs in your kitchen sink than are in your toilet. From raw meat juices, dirty dishes and leftover food particles, the kitchen sink is a hotbed for bacteria. Therefore, any day that you use your sink for preparing food or soaking dishes, pots and pans, it should be washed down with hot soapy water and a sponge.

2. Sponges. Speaking of sponges, there have been many discussions online about the germs found in sponges and what will work to clean them. Recently, The New York Times ran an article that quoted a study from Germany claiming that cleaning a sponge only makes the bacteria on them worse. But after further research, the author wrote another article that said cleaning your sponge is still important to do. So the debate seems to remain up in the air.

However, if you still want to clean your sponge, you can either put it in the microwave on high for a minute or try a new tool called a SpongeBath that uses citric acid to keep the sponge clean and disinfected.

3. Hand towels. Hand towels are magnets for nasty germs. More often than not, we mindlessly wipe our hands on our towels, without thinking what we’re leaving behind. Raw meat juices, raw eggs from batter or even rotting food can often be found on a kitchen towel.

The trick is to change them at least once a week — more often if the towels get a lot of use — and wash dirty ones in hot water. You can also add a teaspoon of bleach to the wash to kill bacteria.

4. Knobs and handles. Every kitchen has more than a few door knobs and handles. Between everyday germs that are on your hands and the food germs you find in the kitchen, those cabinet knobs and handles can be full of bacteria.

You can use a simple solution of distilled white vinegar and some rubbing alcohol in a spray bottle and wipe with a microfiber cloth. The vinegar alone kills 98% of the bacteria, and the alcohol should kill the rest.

5. Salt and pepper shakers. Bet you never thought of your salt or pepper shakers as a place where germs are being transferred, but when was the last time you wiped them down with something other than a wet cloth (if that). These items are being handled by everyone in your family, and therefore germs are being spread to everyone.

6. Refrigerator handles. The handles of your refrigerator are touched countless times a day. Add in the fact that you are opening the fridge with hands that are preparing a meal and you can imagine all the germs and bacteria that are on those handles.

Get into the habit of wiping them down daily if possible. Use the same white vinegar and rubbing alcohol solution previously mentioned.

7. Cutting boards. Wooden cutting boards have proved to be full of more bacteria than a toilet seat. If used for cutting raw meat, they can also contain salmonella, which can lead to cross contamination.

To clean a cutting board, submerge it in hot soapy water after each use. You can also disinfect it with a mix of distilled white vinegar, lemon juice and salt. Consider plastic cutting boards that can go in the dishwasher.

8. Remote controls. TV remotes in any room of the house are apt to hold a variety of germs. But the remote in the kitchen is the worst of all. Food bacteria from meal prepping might be all over it.

Consider keeping the remote inside a ziplock bag and operating it through the bag. That way the germs are on the bag and not in all the cracks and crevices of the remote.

In fact - it was no secret at all.

The rich and the beautiful and the powerful turned a blind eye to the alleged sexual predator in their midst.

And if the allegations are true - many prominent Mainstream Media organizations and journalists covered up his sickening behavior.

And, economic consequences aside, addiction has deep emotional consequences and can destroy what is an otherwise healthy family business.
How to create a substance-free family culture that can sustain a family business?
Make no bones about the fact that substance abuse is not what your family does.
It’s a genuine investment that will pay dividends – for your family business, yes, but more importantly, for your family’s sense of belonging.","Just last month, the Department of Health and Human Services announced its intention to dedicate an extra $144 million towards fighting the opioid crisis – a decision which, while helpful, is long overdue. Substance abuse, and opioid abuse in particular, continues to wreak havoc on this country. Ninety-one Americans die each day from opioid abuse, and drug offenders make up the large part of our nation’s incarcerated population.

It’s a health care problem, it’s a criminal justice problem – but it’s also a family problem, and it’s one that is especially challenging for families who run a family business. I’ve spent all of my life and much of my career observing and advising family businesses, and time and time again I’ve seen that substance abuse plays a large role in the sad fact that 70 percent of family-owned businesses don’t make it past one generation. The collateral damage when a family business falls apart extends to the employees, the stockholders, the lenders, the suppliers, the customers, and even the tax base and economic health of the entire community.

And, economic consequences aside, addiction has deep emotional consequences and can destroy what is an otherwise healthy family business. A longtime friend of mine recently confided in me his sorrow over his two sons, both of whom had been doing wonderfully in college – until they discovered alcohol and quickly become addicted.

My friend tried putting his sons in treatment programs, but it didn’t work. He tried tough love, but his kids wound up hating him. His business prospered, but today his children won’t speak to him. He can’t hand his business on to them, his hoped-for legacy is in tatters, and much of what gave his life meaning has vaporized. What good, he asks himself, does it do to succeed financially and fail as a family?

I was deeply saddened by my friend’s story, but even more saddened to learn that he’s not alone.

One study found that more than half of family businesses had or were struggling with an addiction issue within the family. This may sound shocking, but it stacks up with other statistics: One in ten Americans have struggled with some kind of drug abuse and one in eight with alcohol abuse. Many American families don’t know whether their life’s work will live beyond them into the next generation or whether addiction and substance abuse will have the final say.

So – what to do? How to create a substance-free family culture that can sustain a family business? How to avoid heartbreaking situations like the one my friend found himself in?

There’s no one single answer, and even among healthy families, things will look different. But I’ve generally found that among the families that last, three core values were emphasized:

Be clear. Make no bones about the fact that substance abuse is not what your family does. Parents have far more influence than they know. According to Joe Califano, former Secretary of Health Education and Welfare under President Carter and the founder of the Center on Addiction and Substance (CASA), “Parent power is the greatest weapon we have to curb substance abuse.”

He encourages parents to emphasize that substance abuse is not simply illegal but seriously dangerous, and to take the same attitude towards it that they do towards asbestos. Most parents would be in an uproar if they found out their child’s school has asbestos, but are willing to let substance abuse in school slide. And kids respond to this kind of clear condemnation: Those who know their parents would be “very upset” are more likely to abstain from drugs and alcohol than those who know their parents would only be “a little” or “not upset at all.”

Be together. Oftentimes, risky behaviors result from unloving homes. When children do not feel loved and valued by their parents, they are far more likely to look for love elsewhere – and oftentimes, that means succumbing to peer pressure to win admiration and acceptance.

Simply spending time together – without screens and without distractions – will increase family bonding and a child’s sense of worth and belonging. CASA found that teens who eat dinner with their parents fewer than three nights each week are more susceptible to smoking, drinking and drug abuse than those who eat with their parents five nights or more each week.

Be fun. Teach kids early on that you can have fun and be creative without substances. If they see you getting creative and enjoying yourself without alcohol and drugs, they’re less likely to turn to those things as a way to have fun.

Whatever you do, whether it be sports, board games, arts and crafts, or music, it’s important to intentionally set aside time to do it.

These things are important for all families that want to develop a strong family culture – but they are especially important for parents who themselves come from families that struggle with substance abuse. Creating a stable family is particularly hard when you have genetics and family patterns working against you – but not impossible.

Dr. Falk Lohoff, a scholar at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, argues that “While genetic factors can increase the risk of becoming addicted, they are not deterministic. There are also protective factors.” And one of the biggest protective factors is simple delay. CASA found that with each year of delay in substance use, the likelihood of addiction drops.

By putting the hard work in now of establishing clear values, spending quality time together and having creative, clean fun, you can create the kind of culture where your children will not only be able to perpetuate the family business, but will actually want to work for you and with you. It’s a genuine investment that will pay dividends – for your family business, yes, but more importantly, for your family’s sense of belonging. ​",Mitzi Perdue: Substance abuse is sinking America's family businesses.

Wouldn’t it be a surprise if the supposedly anti-immigrant Donald Trump fixed immigration by doing one pragmatic deal after another?","Over dinner in early September, President Trump made a tentative deal-not-a-deal with Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. Undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children (the Dreamers) could stay, but legislation would not be tied to a border wall. Trump seemed to realize, unlike his predecessors, that the art of the deal involves a step-by-step process. Before you can land a big deal, you need a working relationship built on a few smaller deals. The firing of Steve Bannon signaled that substance was taking priority over empty fights.

Now it seems that the purists have won, those who would rather fight than forge a deal. As of Sunday night’s White House letter and list of demands, there are seventy requirements “that must be included as part of any legislation.…”

Is this what the American people want? Regardless if you support or oppose Trump on immigration details, the bigger issue is whether to take the steps necessary to forge real reform or play politics. The Sunday letter is playing politics, and a setback for reform. What if the President pushed instead for the step-by-step approach? The end result would likely be a nightmare for Democrats: establishing law-and-order, giving the White House a win, and crushing the myth that immigration reform is racist.

My colleague David Brady and I recently worked with YouGov to do a survey of American attitudes on immigration that goes into greater depth than any poll before. We asked 1,000 American adults typical questions such as whether immigration should be increased or decreased, but we also tried to find areas of consensus by asking about more than a dozen specific policy ideas.

If Trump wants a win, he should strike a pragmatic deal on a simple bill. The president would have strong support for a bill that grants legal status to Dreamers, not citizenship (exactly like DACA), with no other tradeoffs. Save those for the next step.

The big surprise to us is that the American people are far more welcoming to immigrants – legal immigrants especially – than you might realize, but also want respect for the rule of law. Americans’ welcoming attitudes are in stark contrast to polling of other countries, and Americans have not changed much despite the election of Donald Trump and the partisan fires that are burning. Conservatives and liberals alike celebrate ethnic diversity.

Yet a vast majority (88 percent) of the public thinks that current “politicians would rather fight over immigration than fix it.” An even greater proportion (95 percent) of elderly respondents agree, what with their clear memories of the Reagan-led compromise in 1986 and the Johnson-led legislative overhaul of immigration in 1965. What this means is that if Trump and the Democrats can work together on this issue, it will be an event worth celebrating. Just maybe democracy can work in the modern era.

More than two-thirds (71 percent) of the public thinks that “Politicians should compromise on immigration policy.” Compromise is significantly more popular among Democrats than Republicans, but we also found that Democratic voters hold more extremist views on a 7-point scale of immigration attitudes, whereas Republicans tend to be more evenly spread.

What should be done about the 11 million illegal immigrants in the U.S.? There is no majority support for either deportation (33 percent) nor for the other extreme of granting a pathway to citizenship (16 percent). Instead, there is a mix of support for granting legal status without citizenship (29 percent), doing nothing (10 percent) and deporting adults only (12 percent).

The mistake will be to overreach by seeking a comprehensive piece of legislation. In the Ahab theory of landing a big fish, that can work. In reality, comprehensive legislation has failed for decades. Purists and partisans routinely sabotage those comprehensive bills, as Senator Obama did to the McCain-Kennedy effort in 2007, and as Steve Miller is doing now. If Trump wants a win, he should strike a pragmatic deal on a simple bill. The president would have strong support for a bill that grants legal status to Dreamers, not citizenship (exactly like DACA), with no other tradeoffs. Save those for the next step.

The most popular reform is mandating that employers in all fifty states electronically verify the citizenship and legal work status of employees – known as “E-verify.” Another idea with 72 percent support is called Kate’s law in honor of Kate Steinle: “Prison terms of 10-25 years for illegal immigrants who re-enter the U.S. after being convicted of certain crimes here and deported.” Democratic voters support both of those ideas.

The public does not agree with the principle of reducing legal immigration levels, but they do support reforming who gets in. Two-thirds of the public prefer a shift toward merit-based immigration rules. In fact, support for a merit-based legal immigration system had widespread support from Democrats (60 percent) as well as Republicans (74 percent) and Independents (68 percent). Sixty-seven percent of Hispanics support this shift, too.

The reality is that the past six presidents (Carter, Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Bush, and Obama) have been explicitly pro-immigration, yet comprehensive legislation has proven to be a white whale. Wouldn’t it be a surprise if the supposedly anti-immigrant Donald Trump fixed immigration by doing one pragmatic deal after another? We can dream. Unfortunately, the president may be captaining the wrong boat.","Trump, Democrats, Republicans, America – EVERYONE can win on immigration if we stop playing politics",http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/11/trump-democrats-republicans-america-everyone-can-win-on-immigration-if-stop-playing-politics.html

On top of that, the legalization of assisted suicide injects government and profit-driven insurance companies into everyone’s end-of-life decisions.
Legislators across the nation of all political persuasions are recognizing that assisted suicide is bad policy and puts people like me at risk.
But the truth is, assisted suicide affects everyone.","I’m thankful I don’t live in a state like Oregon, where assisted suicide is legal. When I was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer and told I would probably be dead in four months, I went in an instant from living the American Dream with my wife and son to living a nightmare. In that moment of depression, I might have chosen to end my life.

After a seizure sent me to the hospital, the neurosurgeon told me I had a brain tumor known as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and that the tumor was inoperable. In fact, three different doctors told me there was nothing that they could do.

The news was overwhelmingly depressing. As a United States Marine Corps veteran of the Iraq War, I could have lost my life on a faraway battlefield serving my country. Thankfully I survived, but I had now received a death sentence at home.

With the support of my family, I chose to fight the cancer. I have had some great success with an experimental, cutting-edge treatment and am still alive three years after I was told I had only a few months to live.

Not everyone is so lucky to have the support I do. Since my diagnosis of terminal brain cancer my wife and I welcomed our second son into the world. I would have missed out on so much if I had been given – and had accepted – the option of assisted suicide.

Assisted suicide laws require a prognosis of six months or less to live, but how can we let our life-and-death decisions rest on these prognoses, when even the most experienced doctors are often wrong? My own experience reveals how tragic that could turn out to be.

We also know from the 2016 Oregon Health Report that in Oregon, which 20 years ago became the first state to make assisted suicide legal, only 4 percent of patients considering ending their lives were referred for psychological evaluation.

Yet a 2008 study, published in the peer-reviewed medical journal The BMJ, revealed that 25 percent of patients requesting assisted suicide suffered from major depressive disorder. These numbers suggest that people with mental illness could well be prescribed a death-too-soon, instead of the treatment they deserve.

On top of that, the legalization of assisted suicide injects government and profit-driven insurance companies into everyone’s end-of-life decisions. Just in the last year, more cases have surfaced of patients being denied coverage for care, showing how legalizing assisted suicide results in more abuse and less choice.

Take, for example, Stephanie Packer, a California mother of four suffering from a serious case of scleroderma, a chronic connective tissue disease. She reported that her insurance company denied her coverage for chemotherapy treatment but would pay for her to kill herself.

Then there is Dr. Brian Callister, a Nevada physician who asked insurance medical directors to approve lifesaving, curative treatments for a patient in California and another in Oregon – two states that have legalized assisted suicide. Callister’s requests were denied, and the patients were offered coverage for suicide drugs instead.

People are starting to realize the threat that assisted suicide poses. Though an onslaught of new bills has been introduced, 23 states have rejected laws designed to legalize assisted suicide this year.

And states like Alabama and Ohio recently enacted laws to strengthen the prohibition of assisted suicide. Legislators across the nation of all political persuasions are recognizing that assisted suicide is bad policy and puts people like me at risk.

Some vulnerable populations, like people with disabilities and terminal illness, are at more immediate risk to be adversely affected by the legalization of assisted suicide. But the truth is, assisted suicide affects everyone.

Wesley later half-apologizes to Jenny saying “things got a little out of hand…it’s just this war, and that lying son of a bitch [President] Johnson!”

Talk about misdirection! This scene came to mind when I read Harvey Weinstein’s inane explanation on Thursday, October 5 of his past abuse of women. He had the temerity to blame shift away from his own behavior to…wait for it…the NRA. Perhaps I shouldn’t be surprised as Hollywood liberals love to castigate America’s largest and oldest civil rights organization. But Harvey’s statement took the scapegoating to a new level. He wrote “I am going to need a place to channel that anger so I’ve decided I’m going to give the NRA my full attention. I hope [NRA CEO] Wayne LaPierre will enjoy his retirement party.”

What on earth does the NRA have to do with Weinstein's mistreatment of women?

Incredible. First, why, pray tell, do you have any right to be “angry,” Harvey? If myriad reports are credible, then at the least, you serially abused women psychologically and used your position of incredible Hollywood power to sexually harass them -- and perhaps even much worse. Second, what on earth does the NRA have to do with your mistreatment of women?

If anything, the NRA empowers women as it consistently defends their right to bear arms so that they are NOT victimized by male assailants who may use physical strength to abuse women. It’s hard to exaggerate the hypocrisy of Weinstein in attacking the NRA as somehow germane to his personal problems.

To that point of hypocrisy, Chris Cox, the director of the NRA Institute for Legislative Action, told me “the NRA’s spent millions teaching safe and responsible gun ownership while Harvey’s made a fortune off of movies that many find grotesquely glamorize gun violence. At the same time, he’s reportedly spent decades assaulting women and now he wants to lecture us about morality.”

To be fair, Weinstein is hardly alone in this hypocrisy. Rosie O’Donnell once said “I don’t care if you want to hunt. I don’t care if you think it’s your right…you are not allowed to have a gun.” Shortly after this statement, her bodyguard applied for a concealed gun permit. More recently, Jimmy Kimmel has regularly scolded Americans who believe in the Second Amendment, and yet his show has reportedly ramped up its security detail of off-duty police, presumably armed.

Memo to Hollywood: tens of millions of working class Americans cannot afford professional security. They enthusiastically embrace their Constitutional right to bear arms…for protection, for sport, for collecting – and we neither need nor appreciate the condescension and disrespect from elites.

Any move to decertify the Iran deal will take away the momentum needed to confront this clear and present danger.
And that is the key promise President Trump made—to make America “first” again.
And that means keeping America in the Iran deal.","There was always a basic problem with the so-called Iran nuclear deal inked back in 2015 that was never going to be resolved: Washington and Tehran have vastly different interests across the Middle East. It was never going to be easy to somehow compartmentalize the relationship, to in some way come to terms over Iran’s nuclear program but not resolve countless other issues that have always driven these two nations apart. And it could someday tear the deal to shreds.

But sheer necessity dictates that now is not the time for such an action. In fact, I would argue a move by President Trump to ‘decertify’ the agreement is against America’s national interests.

To be brutally honest, The Islamic Republic of Iran is no friend of the United States—period. Its regional aspirations are nothing short of an attempt to become the dominant power in the Middle East and displace America from the region. The regime is a state-sponsor of terror that will use whatever brutal and violent means it can to achieve its objectives. And it’s no secret that Iran is a human rights-abuser of the worst kind, even working with fellow pariah-state North Korea to develop advanced missile platforms that could someday target U.S. forces in the region.

But the deal that President Obama made with Tehran back in 2015—wrinkles and all—is worth keeping for a very pragmatic, realistic reason: the Trump Administration has much bigger problems on its plate.

Decertifying the deal now—with the danger of Tehran building nuclear weapons that are now pushed out at least a decade or more under the deal—would take away much needed bandwidth from confronting much bigger challenges Team Trump must address that are of much more critical domestic and international importance. And considering the very real possibility that decertifying the deal could very well put both nations on the path towards potential conflict—if Tehran attempts to make a run towards nuclear weapons, fearing an eventual U.S. move towards regime change—President Trump must make the hard choice to stay the course.

I would identify five core problems Team Trump needs to tackle right now—all that could be in jeopardy of being marginalized if tensions with Iran were to come to a head thanks to decertification. These include:

A Stalled Domestic Agenda: President Trump is unstoppable when he hammers away at his opponents on the issues that turned him from a 150/1 underdog to our nation’s 45th president. Americans voted for Donald Trump because he promised to end our illegal immigration crisis and secure the border, to repeal ObamaCare once and for all, to modernize the tax code and rebuild our badly neglected infrastructure. He needs to press ahead to enact that agenda—period. A confrontation with Iran now could very well use up all the vital political capitol he will need to expend to make his promises the law of the land. And nothing could be more important—and go a long way to seeing him reelected. Getting mixed up in a crisis with Iran could doom this agenda—forever.

North Korea: Now armed with nuclear weapons that our own military commanders are assuming have the capability to hit the U.S. homeland, North Korea is an existential threat President Trump needs to make his top foreign policy priority. There is nothing more important—nothing.

Any move to decertify the Iran deal will take away the momentum needed to confront this clear and present danger. The administration is already in the process of trying to build a global coalition to isolate Pyongyang economically, financially and diplomatically. Team Trump will also likely need to move more offensive military assets into Northeast Asia over the long-term, increase its missile defense capabilities in Asia and at home, as well as convince China to enforce all sanctions and bring the Kim regime to the bargaining table. A self-created crisis with Iran could very well endanger these efforts, and ensure North Korea is a nuclear weapons state for many years to come.

A Rising China: While the world might be rightly transfixed over the North Korea crisis, over the long-term, America will also need to formulate a grand strategy to deal with a rising China. Beijing now has the second largest economy in the world and a military machine to match. With China’s President Xi Jinping pushing his nation's influence into all corners of Asia -- from parts of the former Soviet Union to essentially turning the South China Sea into its own Lake Beijing -- China is on the cusp of superpower status. With countless issues between us and a big presidential visit to Asia coming in the next few weeks, taking on Iran now would once again reinforce a narrative Asian diplomats here in Washington constantly repeat over and over—that Washington is slowly losing Asia to China and is obsessed with the Middle East.

ISIS: While defeat of the Islamic State seems a near certainty—and a national interest we share with Iran—we must keep our focus on destroying the caliphate as our number one objective in the Middle East. As the Islamic State morphs from dying nation-state into a terror network flung all over the globe, America must continue to press forward in making sure ISIS never regains any ground. Needlessly confronting Iran now would endanger such a goal.

Trade: President Trump was speaking truth to power when he argued that America needed fairer trade practices that put our nation's workers first. The administration is working hard to modernize NAFTA, partnering with Asian nations like South Korea and Vietnam to correct job-crushing trade imbalances, and potentially working towards new Free Trade Agreements with some of our closest allies like Japan. All of these goals will require a focused administration that will need to drive some very hard bargains, bargains that will take much time and energy. If Washington were to decertify the deal with Iran and a crisis were to ensue, not only would it have an impact on our Asian allies, but there simply might not be any political bandwidth to make these deals a reality.

Smart foreign policy is always keeping in mind prioritization, ensuring that America’s national interests are front and center. And that is the key promise President Trump made—to make America “first” again. And that means keeping America in the Iran deal.",The conservative case to keep the Iran deal,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/12/conservative-case-to-keep-iran-deal.html

The first sight of a daffodil, whether in your garden or in a store, is proof that spring is here. Even better, they’re practically foolproof to grow. They’re perennial bulbs, coming back year after year. They’re cold hardy and don’t need summer water to thrive. They’re also not a target for deer or gophers. If you want to enjoy these bulbs come spring, though, fall is the time to plant.

Caution: Keep daffodil bulbs away from pets, as they are toxic.

Botanical name: Narcissus spp.

Common names: Daffodil, jonquil, narcissus

Origin: Native to Europe and North Africa

Bloom season: Late winter and spring; rebloom every year

Where they grow: Hardy to minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 40 degrees Celsius (USDA zones 3 to 9)

Light requirements: Full sun

Water requirements: Regular water when growing and blooming

Benefits and tolerances: Easy to grow; tolerate most soils and prefer dry conditions in summer; deer, rabbits, gophers, squirrels and chipmunks all avoid them.

When to plant: Begin planting bulbs when the soil begins to cool, approximately two to four weeks before you expect the ground to freeze in colder climates. That might be as early as September in the coldest climates but is more likely October in most locations.

If you live in a warm-winter climate where freezes are late or unlikely, buy the bulbs early when you have the best selection; then store them in a cool, dry spot out of sunlight until your soil temperature has reached about 60 degrees Fahrenheit, or 15.6 degrees Celsius, usually around mid-November.

Daffodil basics. Daffodil lovers and experts categorize the Narcissus genus into 13 divisions. If that is overwhelming, take the easier approach and use familiar common names. Daffodil is used for those with larger blooms, while narcissus refers to those with smaller flowers, which usually bloom early. The paperwhite narcissus, a favorite for forcing, falls into this latter category. Jonquil denotes the N. jonquilla species and its hybrids.

Choosing bulbs. Look for bulbs that feel firm and heavy and don’t show any signs of injury. Store in a cool, dry, airy spot out of direct sunlight before planting.

You might also find other daffodil species and hybrids. ‘Tête-à-Tête’ and fragrant ‘Tiny Bubbles’ are only about 6 inches tall and work well in rock gardens.

If your local selection is limited or you want something unusual, order bulbs online. They will be shipped to you when it’s the right time to plant in your climate zone. Some good sources for bulbs include Brent and Becky’s Bulbs, John Scheepers and White Flower Farm.

Where to plant. Choose a spot in full sun, although in the hottest climates they will prefer partial shade once they finish blooming. Daffodils will tolerate most soils as long as they drain well, though they prefer acidic to neutral soil. Amend your soil before planting if it doesn’t drain well.

How to use it. Plant en masse or set them among other plants in a garden bed or border. Daffodils also are good choices for containers.

Daffodils can be used to create a woodland or meadow effect. Simply toss a handful of bulbs into a prepared planting area in order to create a more naturalistic design. Adjust the bulbs as needed so the center and one end of the bed are more densely planted, giving the effect that the bulbs have gradually spread from a single spot.

Daffodils are popular cut flowers as well. They’re fine when used alone in an arrangement, but they emit a fluid that will cause other flowers to wilt. If you’re using them in a mixed arrangement, soak them overnight in a separate vase or container before adding them in with the other flowers.

How to plant. Set bulbs, pointed ends up, into the soil two to three times as deep as they are tall, between 3 and 5 inches deep for smaller bulbs and up to 6 inches deep for larger ones. Be sure there will be at least 3 inches of soil over the bulbs in colder climates. Space smaller bulbs about three times their width when planting and larger ones at least 6 to 8 inches apart. If you want, you can add a small amount of bulb fertilizer around the bulbs at this time. Cover with soil, and water thoroughly.

Growing notes. Daffodils are easy to care for once they’re in the ground. Provide additional water in fall if it is dry and through the winter in drought-prone areas. Provide regular water if Mother Nature doesn’t while they are growing and when they’re in bloom. Keep watering until the leaves start to turn yellow; then stop.

Daffodils don’t need summer water. If they get much rain, be sure the soil drains well to prevent bulb rot and other problems.

You don’t need to fertilize bulbs. If you do want to give the blooms some extra help, top-dress the area around the bulbs with a 5-10-10 granular fertilizer when the leaves begin to emerge.

Deadhead the blooms once they’ve faded if you want, but keep the leaves in place. Remove the leaves once they’re completely yellow, lightly work the soil around the plants and then add mulch. You can also add a small amount of 5-10-10 fertilizer around the bulbs at this time if flower production is fading.

Divide only when flower production begins to falter. The best time to do this is right before the foliage completely yellows. Simply dig up the clumps and divide into smaller sections. Replant immediately, or store them in paper bags or ventilated sacks (nylons work well) in a cool, dry, airy spot out of the sun.

Pests are rare, but the narcissus bulb fly can be a problem. Don’t plant any bulbs that are soft or damaged, and cultivate and mulch after foliage dies down to prevent them from finding their way to the bulbs.

Container culture. Daffodils are standouts in containers. You can plant a single daffodil in a 1-gallon container, three to four in a 2-gallon container or masses of them in larger containers. Add potting soil to your container so the bulbs will sit at the same depth as they would in the garden. Rather than spacing them out, crowd the bulbs together to get a massed effect when they’re in bloom. Water thoroughly, and provide water throughout the fall and winter and into the growing season if you don’t get regular rain or snow cover.

In warmer-winter climates, keep the container outdoors and provide additional water if you don’t have enough rainfall. In cold-winter climates where containers are vulnerable, bring into a greenhouse or unheated garage or shed. Water regularly if they won’t receive regular moisture. Bring the containers to the foreground of your garden when they’re in bloom. (You can even sink them into the ground.)

For larger bulbs, one season in a container is all you can expect. Smaller ones, however, can last several years. If you want to keep them going, move containers to an out-of-the-way, sunny spot after the blooms fade. Once the leaves are yellowed, cut them off and add a 5-10-10 fertilizer around the bulbs. Cover with mulch. Begin watering again in fall as needed.",Your planting guide for beautiful yellow daffodils,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/04/your-planting-guide-for-beautiful-yellow-daffodils.html

At a rally in Alabama last month, Trump aggressively attacked the practice of taking a knee. He argued that it was so disrespectful to the American flag and the national anthem that those who had taken a knee should be fired from their jobs.

This pronouncement focused a spotlight on the six or so scattered players who had followed Kaepernick’s lead, and soon hundreds were doing so. The president took their behavior as an affront to him and to the nation, and he persisted in his attacks on the players. Soon, some team owners joined their players in various means of expressing solidarity with those who had taken a knee.

When the players union backed up these silent expressions of political opinions, it argued that all of its members have a constitutional right to express themselves in uniform in their workplace. Do they? The short answer is that it depends on where the players are when they take a knee.",Judge Andrew Napolitano: Is Taking a Knee Protected Speech?,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/10/12/judge-andrew-napolitano-taking-knee-protected-speech

The famed Chicago Bears coach came under fire for making the comments during a radio interview on Monday about NFL players kneeling during the national anthem. He issued an apology the next day, saying he was talking about professional football and not society as a whole.

“I have absolutely seen oppression in society in the last 100 years,” the Hall of Fame tight end and Super Bowl-winning coach said in statement to WGN-TV in Chicago. “The interview was about the NFL and related issues. That’s where my head was at.”

The interview aired before the Chicago Bears played the Minnesota Vikings on Monday night.

The 77-year-old old Ditka previously has made harsh comments about players who take a knee, which has sparked fierce debate about issues such as patriotism and protest. He said he would bench players who didn’t stand during the anthem.

Ditka went further on Monday, saying he didn’t know what “social injustices” players are protesting.

“There has been no oppression in the last 100 years that I know of,” he said.

Ditka’s comments triggered a quick backlash, with many chastising him for seemingly ignoring or not knowing about Jim Crow Laws that enforced racial segregation and the lynching of African Americans that occurred well into Ditka’s lifetime.

“Great coach ... clueless person,” tweeted retired NFL player Steve Smith.

A crazed gunman took the lives of at least 59 people and injured more than 500 innocent country music fans at the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas on Sunday night.

The tight-knit country music community immediately came together to commemorate those who were murdered and to stand behind the victims and their families.

Some of the industry's biggest stars like Keith Urban and Vince Gill performed at a vigil hosted by the Nashville Convention & Visitors Corp and the Country Music Association drawing a reported crowd of 600 people on Monday night.

Urban serenaded the audience with Simon & Garfunkel's ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" after recalling his 9-year-old daughter asking him if he knew any of the victims.

""[Fans are] like family,"" Urban said at the vigil. ""It's the one thing about country music. It is a community. I do know those people. It just hit me.""

Nashville Mayor Megan Barry said at the emotional event, ""Love is the answer and the only thing we know.""

Country singer Lee Brice, who performed at the Route 91 Harvest Festival two nights before the deadly shooting, told Fox News he feels ""attacked by an enemy.""

""I feel like the fans are probably reacting for the most part like I’m reacting,"" Brice told us. ""They feel the same way – they feel like they’re being attacked by an enemy but they’re not going to let that enemy win. The enemy is hate.""

Then my thoughts shifted and I began reflecting on the chaos, both natural and man-made, that has affected our nation in recent days.
I affirm the greatness of God and yet, at the same time wonder as the condition of the world.","The term “scorched earth” is usually one we associate with a military policy that targets anything that may be useful to the enemy. As a resident of Southern California, more specifically, Anaheim Hills, the term has recently taken on a different meaning.

Earlier this week, my wife and I were given 30 minutes to evacuate our home of 12 years. To make matters more complicated, I was en route to the airport when I received the text from my wife asking, ""What do you want me to pack in the car? I have to leave in minutes.""

My mind raced trying to determine what was important and irreplaceable. All I could think of was family photos and the flag that draped my dad's coffin at Arlington National Cemetery. In the midst of the chaos and disbelief, our friends and neighbors rallied to assist us in our time of need.

My thoughts shifted and I began reflecting on the chaos, both natural and man-made, that has affected our nation in recent days. I began to wonder if I had become numb to all the tragedy. I don't even have time to mourn the fact that we had to evacuate our home.

The next day, I found myself sitting in another airport trying to process everything that had happened in the past 24 hours. At first I reflected on our kind neighbors and how even in the worst of times we can see the good in humanity and love of God. Then my thoughts shifted and I began reflecting on the chaos, both natural and man-made, that has affected our nation in recent days. I began to wonder if I had become numb to all the tragedy. I don't even have time to mourn the fact that we had to evacuate our home.

Thinking about all of this, I found myself asking, “Where is God?” As a nation, we are facing an increase in lawlessness and what appears to me, an unusual number of natural disasters.

It’s a natural human response to ask questions for things we can’t understand or process. I get it; moral evil can be explained by the free will of man but much of the things we face (cancer, death, hurricanes and fires) are not a result of our free will. So where do I go from here? Either God or nature (which He created) must cause these physical evils. But these things seem incompatible with an all-loving, all-powerful God.

I'm left with what I call a ""divine tension."" I affirm the greatness of God and yet, at the same time wonder as the condition of the world.

C. S. Lewis captured my tension when he wrote, “God whispers to us in our pleasures, speaks in our conscience, but [God] shouts in our pain: it is his megaphone to rouse a deaf world.”

I admit I hear God better in the struggle than I do in its absence. Tears, heartbreak, loneliness and hurt all add to my humanity and character.

“I love the Star-Spangled Banner so much because I love America,” Suraci said.","It was just another college football game on Saturday in Hartford, Connecticut, until just before kickoff, an announcement came over the loud speakers that there would be no playing of the national anthem.

Everyone was on the field, the coin toss had just happened, and players had their helmets off, standing at attention, ready for the anthem to be played, Coach Jeff Devanney told Fox News.

But after a few moments of silence, it was announced the PA system failed – and there would be no playing of the Anthem.

Trinity senior fullback Ethan Suraci told Fox News the silence “felt like forever, honestly. You could hear the crowd and the opposing team” expressing disappointment over the announcement.

Suraci said he immediately started belting out the words to what he calls “America’s song,” which also happens to be his favorite song, and it seemed everyone joined in.

""There were almost three different waves of the Star-Spangled Banner going,” Coach Devanney said. Trinity’s team, Hamilton’s team, and the crowd each had started singing “almost like an echo,” but he added, “It all seemed to end on the same note.”

“That was awesome!” said sportscaster Jake Donnelly, who captured the video and posted it on YouTube. “Not many tenors on either end of the field here this afternoon, but a bunch of players that absolutely love America and love the National Anthem. That was one of the coolest things I have ever seen,” Donnelly added.

“It was a fantastic display of unity and patriotism and gave everyone in the crowd, the teams, and hopefully those who watch the video; chills of hope for a better United States of America and happiness to see us as a society beginning to heal - despite the polarization we see among the citizens and our politicians,” Suraci said.

The incident came a day before Vice President Mike Pence’s decision to leave Sunday’s NFL game between the Indianapolis Colts and the San Francisco 49ers, when several 49er players kneeled during the Anthem.

Coach Devanney said he discussed the NFL protests with his team, calling it a “complicated issue.”

President Trump tweeted Wednesday it’s “about time” NFL’s Goodell called on players to stand for the national anthem.

The senior political science major, who identifies as a Republican and voted for Trump, agrees.

“I am in total agreement with one's constitutional right to protest. However, these players are protesting in an incorrect forum,” he said. “Why insult an entire country and all those who fell for her?”

The 5-foot-10-inch, 225-pound fullback always stands and proudly holds his hand over his heart, just as he did on Saturday.

No one really knows who first started singing the anthem in at the Jessee/Miller Field, but Coach Devanney told Fox News, “I wouldn’t be shocked if Ethan was the first one, given his love of the song.”

In fact, Suraci listens to the “Star-Spangled Banner” as sung by Celine Dion every day after he’s done with school.

To most women, Michelle Obama seems to have enjoyed a dream life.
Michelle Obama was perfectly positioned to manage this nexus of politics and business, helped by her husband’s status as a rising star in Chicago’s minority firmament.
And they don’t need to be lectured by Michelle Obama.","Isn’t Michelle Obama adorable? She actually thinks she is a typical woman in the United States, and that she can speak for all of us.

Michelle says she has no interest in running for president, trying to shatter what Hillary Clinton called the “highest and hardest glass ceiling,” but she might consider bursting out of that elitist, condescending Beltway Bubble.

Speaking recently at the Pennsylvania Conference for Women, Obama pushed women to speak up for themselves in the workplace. “Don’t waste your seat at the table,” she said. “If you are scared to use your voice, then you’ve got to get up and give it to someone who isn’t afraid to use the spot.”

Such good advice, coming from someone whose idea of hardship was graduating from Princeton University and Harvard Law School, and whose husband has always been there to provide for her.

To most women, Michelle Obama seems to have enjoyed a dream life. Married to a political supernova, spending eight years in the White House (which she once described as having “prisonlike elements”), moving on to a life of luxury and power; she has no idea how the real world functions. Her advice could get a lot of women fired.

In other words, she thinks women who voted for Trump did as they were told. And yet, isn’t that what Michelle is doing? Telling women what to think and what to say?

In 2014 she told the White House Working Families Summit how she once applied for a job at the University of Chicago Medical Center with her newborn baby in tow, and on the spot demanded flexible hours so that she could care for her growing family. She told her prospective employer, ""If you want me to do the job, you've got to pay me to do the job and you've got to give me flexibility.""

Doesn’t that sound like a terrific negotiating premise? I can’t do the job unless you bend the rules for me, possibly alienating my co-workers? Come on. Most women (or men) insisting on such special treatment would be shown the door.

“That was one of the first times I demanded flexibility,” Michelle says proudly about that early interview, as she exhorts others to follow her lead. For many of us who have juggled the demands of motherhood and work, the advice doesn’t ring true. It is the rare young job applicant, male or female, who can lay down demands, and women embarking on motherhood are typically more anxious than most to appear committed to their job. They need to be, as employers are understandably anxious about the competing demands on their time.

As a result, many of us put off having families until we were far enough along in our careers to negotiate some flexibility and consideration.

At the time that Michelle made that bold demand, her husband was a state senator in Illinois, and preparing to run for the U.S. Senate. He had earlier been a high-profile community organizer in Chicago, earning significant visibility within the city’s black community. Michelle initially worked at a top Chicago law firm; at the time she references she was being recruited to build the medical group’s community relations with Chicago’s South Side, where her husband had paved the way for her.

As the Washington Post revealed in 2008, Michelle Obama worked to redirect health care in the impoverished neighborhoods surrounding the hospital to local clinics, freeing up the Medical Center to care for patients with insurance who could pay more for the hospital’s care. The initiative was controversial; critics claimed the undertaking boosted the non-profit’s hospital’s bottom line at the expense of its commitment to the surrounding neighborhoods. To boost her efforts, she hired David Axlerod’s PR firm. Michelle Obama was perfectly positioned to manage this nexus of politics and business, helped by her husband’s status as a rising star in Chicago’s minority firmament. Hence, she had an excellent platform from which to demand special consideration.

She was paid well over $100,000 early on, which jumped to more than $300,000 when she became a Vice President, the year after her husband became a U.S. Senator. One of the earmarks the freshman senator petitioned for was a million dollar request for the UC Medical Center, which was never granted. Michelle had a strong wind at her back, named Barack.

Michelle has other advice these days – indeed, she is becoming the Edgar Bergen of our times, throwing her “voice” into the mouths of American women. Like the famed puppet master speaking for Charlie McCarthy, Michelle is spewing dictates, including recently telling women at an event in Boston “As far as I’m concerned, any woman who voted against Hillary Clinton voted against their own voice in a way. . . . We look at those two candidates, as women, and many of us said, ‘That guy. He’s better for me. His voice is more true to me.’ Well, to me that just says you don’t like your voice. You like the thing we’re told to like.”

In other words, she thinks women who voted for Trump did as they were told. And yet, isn’t that what Michelle is doing? Telling women what to think and what to say?

2 led the Yankees to a second straight World Series title.","Didi Gregorius, following in the October footprints left by Derek Jeter, homered twice off Corey Kluber as the New York Yankees beat the Cleveland Indians 5-2 in Game 5 on Wednesday night.

With the win, the Yankees completed their comeback from a 2-0 deficit in the Division Series to dethrone the AL champions.

These bend-but-don't-break Yankees staved off elimination for the fourth time in this postseason and advanced to play the Houston Astros in the AL Championship Series starting Friday at Minute Maid Park.

The AL West champion Astros, led by 5-foot-6 second-base dynamo and MVP candidate Jose Altuve, went 5-2 against the wild-card winners this season.

After winning twice in New York, the Yankees -- with little offensive help from rookie star Aaron Judge -- came into Progressive Field and finished off the Indians, who won 102 games during the regular season, ripped off a historic 22-game streak and were favored to get back to the World Series after losing in seven games a year ago to the Chicago Cubs.

Cleveland's Series drought turns 70 next year -- baseball's longest dry spell.

The Indians closed to 3-2 in the fifth against starter CC Sabathia before David Robertson pitched 2 2/3 hitless innings for the win. Yankees closer Aroldis Chapman, who faced Cleveland in last year's spine-tingling World Series and signed an $86 million free agent contract in December, worked two innings for the save.

Chapman went to the mound with a three-run lead in the ninth after Brett Gardner battled Cody Allen for 12 pitches before hitting an RBI single, with New York's fifth run scoring when Todd Frazier raced home on right fielder Jay Bruce's throwing error.

Gardner's gritty at-bat was symbolic of these Yankees. They wouldn't give in.

When Austin Jackson was called out on strikes to end it, the Yankees rushed to the mound to celebrate with a wide-eyed Chapman.

These baby Bronx Bombers became the 10th team to overcome a 2-0 deficit to win a best-of-five playoff series. New York also did it in 2001, rallying to beat Oakland -- a series remembered for Jeter's backhand flip to home plate.

Gregorius, who took over at shortstop following Jeter's retirement after the 2014 season, hit a solo homer in the first off Kluber and added a two-run shot in the third off Cleveland's ace, who didn't look like himself during either start in this series.

One win shy of a Series title last year, the Indians had only one goal in mind in 2017.

They came up short again, and have now lost six consecutive games with a chance to clinch a postseason series dating to last year's World Series, when they squandered a 3-1 lead to the Chicago Cubs.

Cleveland is the first team in history to blow a two-game series lead in consecutive postseasons.

Everything was set up for the Indians: Kluber on the mound, Game 5 at home, sensational setup man Andrew Miller rested.

The Yankees, though, wouldn't be denied. They battled back from a 3-0 deficit in the first inning of their wild-card game against Minnesota and then had to overcome a crushing loss in Game 2, when manager Joe Girardi's decision not to challenge a hit batter, drew heavy criticism and possibly cost New York during in a 9-8 loss in 13 innings.

But these young Yankees, who are ahead of schedule to be contenders, displayed pinstriped pride.

""This team has never stopped fighting and never stopped believing,"" Girardi said before Game 5. ""That's the mark of a very good team. They know how to persevere and continue to grind out everything, whether it's an at-bat or it's on the other side, you're facing a batter, how you grind it out.""

The Yankees did it without much help from Judge, who struck out four times in Game 5, and went 1 for 20 (.050) in the series with 16 strikeouts.

But the 6-foot-7 rookie might have saved New York's season in Game 3, when he reached above the right-field wall to rob Francisco Lindor of a two-run homer in a 1-0 win.

Kluber was one of baseball's most consistent pitchers all season, winning 18 games and leading the AL with a 2.25 ERA. He's a favorite to win his second Cy Young Award.

However, October has been cruel to the right-hander. He allowed nine runs, including four homers, over 6 1/3 innings in two postseason starts, hardly what he or the Indians expected.

Gregorius came in batting just .077 (1 for 13) in the series and only .133 (2 of 15) in his career against Kluber before tagging the right-hander for two homers in the first three innings.

The 27-year-old with the easy smile and sweet swing gave the Yankees a 3-0 lead in the third, pulling an 0-1 pitch into the lower deck in right. Gregorius set a franchise record for home runs in a season by a shortstop with 25, one more than Jeter hit in 1999 when No. 2 led the Yankees to a second straight World Series title.



Just as in Game 2, Kluber didn't get out of the first unscathed.



Gregorius got New York off to an ideal start, homering with two outs in the first when Kluber grooved a fastball. The shot deep into the seats in right raised the anxiety level to an already jittery Cleveland crowd fearing the worst.

A few hours later, those fears were realized.","Yanks beat Indians, will face Astros for AL title",https://www.foxnews.com/sports/2017/10/12/yanks-beat-indians-will-face-astros-for-al-title.html

U.S. and Pakistani officials say an American woman, her Canadian husband and their three young children have been released after years of being held by the Haqqani network in Pakistan.

Pakistan's military says soldiers have recovered five Western hostages held by the Taliban for years.

Pakistan's army did not name those held, only saying it worked with U.S. intelligence officials to track down the hostages and free them after discovering they had been brought into Pakistan.

However, two army officials who spoke to The Associated Press on Thursday identified the hostages as Canadian Joshua Boyle, his American wife Caitlan Coleman and their children who were kidnapped in Afghanistan in 2012. They spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to release the information.

Caitlan Coleman had told her family she gave birth to two children in captivity.",The Latest: Trump lauds family's release from long captivity,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/10/12/latest-trump-lauds-familys-release-from-long-captivity.html

Bush in the annual Warrior 100K mountain bike ride has a personal story of overcoming adversity. Warriors and civilians alike train for months for the privilege of challenging the rocky switchback single-track trails on Bush’s Texas ranch. The ride has its own momentum, and each year it is more about the networks that are forming and the obstacles being overcome than the physical challenge of the ride itself.

Out on the trail, the veterans ride in a kind of formation, banding together to assist someone who falls or has difficulty. Self-appointed supervisors, who must have been officers in war, bark out orders to start and stop. I am proud that my training allowed me to make it all the way up the challenging windy trail called Waterfall, over the narrow bridges and around the ridge in the lowest gear, and that I completed the two-day event on Sunday without falling.

But this ride wasn’t about me.

Many of the warriors who participate in the 100K carry incredible stories of courage and fortitude. President Bush said he was proud of retired Maj. Peter Way, who lost most of his right leg in Afghanistan and is transitioning from a hand cycle to a pedal-assisted e-bike with the help of a special leg prosthesis. He injured his back during the first day of this year’s ride, but he was back the next day, enduring intense pain, with the support of his brethren in Team 43, to ride at the conclusion of the event.

Research has shown that at least 20 percent of veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars suffer from post-traumatic stress or depression, but less than half seek help.

The theme this year was the Bush Institute’s new Warrior Wellness Alliance, which approaches the debilitating invisible wounds of war (traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress) with the wisdom that no one knows how to help a vet like another vet.

As President Bush told me in an interview, “One, admit you got a problem. Pretty logical. If a vet kind of keeps it in inside, no one will understand what I think, no one can possibly relate to what I feel like, and doesn’t share, obviously that leads to negative consequences.

“Secondly, when you seek help, you and I can be … we can be sympathetic. But we can’t possibly relate to what it’s like to see a friend killed in combat. And yet there are others who can. And here in this group, people have progressed from severe depression, a severe case of PTS, to a moderate case. In some cases, a light case of it, and they can share with their pal what it took. And so it’s logical, and it works.”

The Warrior Wellness Alliance focuses on the roles of spouses and caregivers, and it connects peer-to-peer veteran networks with expert health care providers around the country. The Stephen A. Cohen Military Family Clinics are heavily involved, including the one at my own medical center. Research has shown that at least 20 percent of veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars suffer from post-traumatic stress or depression, but less than half seek help.

The alliance hopes to help overcome this by building support systems like Team 43, which come together at sports events like the bike ride and share stories, struggles and hopes.

One of the most inspiring stories involves Marine Cpl. Dave Smith, who spoke at the first Warrior 100K mountain bike ride that I attended in 2012 and returned this year to ride with the alumni. He wears a haunted expression in President Bush’s evocative portrait in his book Portraits of Courage.

In Iraq in 2004, Smith’s unit came under heavy fire, and while trying to defend his position, he accidentally shot a fellow Marine in the leg. He has suffered for it ever since. He once put a shotgun in his mouth and almost pulled the trigger. He stopped himself at the last minute, thinking of a fellow vet who committed suicide and hurt many who cared about him.

Smith’s motto now is “Never give up.” He says he has sustained post-traumatic growth and that his heavy networking with fellow vets has helped him rebuild his life.

“A lot of it had to do with serving other people,” President Bush told me. “He got his spirit back, now married, and seems great.”
