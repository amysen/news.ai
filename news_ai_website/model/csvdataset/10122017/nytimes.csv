The work that amnesties, statutes of limitations and other such rules do is often invisible.","But in fact, statutes of limitations mean that most crimes can’t be prosecuted at all after a certain amount of time has passed, usually no more than a few years. The principle is so strong that only a small number of very serious crimes can be prosecuted indefinitely.

The same is true of civil lawsuits. Plaintiffs can sue only within a set window of time. After that, even if they have suffered serious harm, they are out of luck.

Taxes? The Internal Revenue Service currently offers an amnesty program for people who’ve stashed money overseas. If they come clean and pay, they avoid some or all penalties.

Even property law has a version of this, found in common-law rules saying that if someone has been using land a certain way for decades, that person is granted the legal right to continue — even if someone else actually owns the property in question.

And those are just some of the official limits in laws and court opinions. There are also the countless little everyday amnesties when officials exercise their discretion: the prosecutor who declines to pursue a case or drops certain charges as part of a plea bargain, the police officer who doesn’t write a ticket.

In other words, if you define amnesty broadly, as a rule or discretionary decision that exempts certain people from the legal consequences of their wrongdoing, then the American legal system is amnesties all the way down.

Serving the public by not enforcing the law

Those rules all share one unifying principle: that sometimes the public interest is best served by not enforcing the law. That even if a person is culpable for a serious offense, sometimes we gain more, as a society, by not holding the person legally responsible.

Tony O’Rourke, a professor at the University at Buffalo School of Law currently serving as a fellow with the Federal Defenders Service of New York, called criminal statutes of limitations an important part of due process protections.

“Prosecutions, if they occur too far in time from when the offense occurs, no longer vindicate the goals of punishment,” Mr. O’Rourke said, except in the case of some especially serious offenses. Statutes of limitations are a way to protect both the public and defendants against government overreach.

“It is absolutely a limitation on the power of the state, in the same way that the Bill of Rights is a limitation on the power of the state, and the due process clause is a limitation on the power of the state,” he said.

James Forman, a professor at Yale Law School, says that because prosecutors act on behalf of society and its citizens, “part of the message that prosecutors are sending when they decide not to prosecute is that we, as a society, don’t want someone to suffer the stigma of a criminal conviction for this action.” That element of discretion and forgiveness can bolster the legitimacy of the system.

There are gains in efficiency as well, said Miriam Baer, a professor at Brooklyn Law School and a former federal prosecutor. “It’s not a one-way street,” she said. “If drafted correctly, the government gets something, too.”

Tax amnesties, for instance, increase the revenue that is collected. And the government then doesn’t have to investigate and prosecute the tax crimes.

There can be downsides to such amnesty programs, Ms. Baer cautioned. If not set up carefully, they can encourage people to break the law in the hope that they will eventually be forgiven rather than punished.

But that can often be avoided through careful drafting. And ultimately, she said, amnesties are common because the gains in productivity and efficiency are worth that risk.

Why is immigration different?

Immigration law, by comparison, is a bit of an outlier. There is no set period of time after which an undocumented immigrant is automatically safe from deportation.

To be clear, the unlawful presence of an undocumented immigrant is generally not a crime, nor is being in the country without papers. So the immigration and criminal systems are not an apples-to-apples comparison.

But at the same time, courts recognize that deportation is similar to criminal punishment in terms of its severity. That is why criminal lawyers are legally required to inform their clients about the immigration consequences of guilty pleas, Mr. O’Rourke said, in order to provide constitutionally adequate counsel.

Yet immigration offenses are far less serious than crimes, like homicides, that don’t have statutes of limitation, Mr. Forman said.

“Certainly, offenses on par to being in the country illegally, they tend to have one, two, three-year statutes of limitations,” he said.

Nor does the immigration system offer a realistic equivalent of property law’s common-law provisions that protect the status quo after years of peaceful use: Decades-long records of law-abiding life in the United States — particularly for those who arrived after 1972 — do not give undocumented immigrants citizenship.

And although there have been temporary immigration amnesties in the past, they have been rare and unpredictable. And today, in contrast with, say, the tax system, there is no large-scale amnesty program available.

The most recent large-scale amnesty was under President Reagan, whose immigration reforms granted legal status to nearly three million people in 1986.

But that amnesty came with an enforcement crackdown stopping the flow of temporary workers across the southern border. Researchers have found that caused many to put down roots in the United States instead of returning seasonally to Mexico and Central America. Since then, the United States has had a large population of undocumented immigrants who live, work and have families in the United States, but who have little hope of achieving legal status.

A narrower program, the LIFE act, offered legal status to some undocumented immigrants in the 1990s if they had family members who were United States citizens and could petition on their behalf. But it ended in 2001.

A need for finality

That means that there is effectively only one imperfect release valve for the immigration system: the discretion of the people responsible for enforcement.

The president and Department of Homeland Security can issue guidelines saying that certain groups of people, such as those without criminal records, should not be deported.

The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, commonly known as DACA, was essentially a form of structured prosecutorial discretion ordered by the president.

But that kind of discretion offers only temporary relief from deportation, not the finality of a statute of limitations or other similar relief.

That difference was thrown into sharp relief last month, when President Trump ended the DACA program, leaving recipients fearful that they will now be subject to deportation.

The work that amnesties, statutes of limitations and other such rules do is often invisible. The backlogs prevented are hard to detect, the resources saved unnoticed. But they serve vital functions.

“It’s a routine and robust part of our justice system,” Mr. Forman said. “Everybody in the system knows that it’s a myth that you can go after everyone all the time. You just can’t.”","The Word May Be Toxic, but Amnesty Is Everywhere",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/upshot/the-word-may-be-toxic-but-amnesty-is-everywhere.html

In nontheme news, I have to say that the long Downs made me smile. I loved SHOT TO HELL for its unexpectedness, and “FROST/NIXON” is a nice, Scrabbly entry to write into the grid.

Tricky Clues

49A: “Strands in a cell?” looks like it refers either to the microscopic type of cell or a jail cell, although strands in a jail cell doesn’t make much sense. The answer refers to microscopic cells and the strands of genetic material within. If you are not sure whether the answer is RNA or DNA, fill in the “NA” and work that first crossing. 40D is AUDI, so the answer is DNA. See? You don’t have to be a scientist to do the crossword.

59D: I thought this one might bring out some of my fellow vegetable gardeners, because I’m sure I’m not the only one who believed that yams were tubers, not ROOTs. Apparently, “all tubers are root crops, but not all root crops are tubers,” and there are many ways to distinguish the part of a plant that grows underground. The main point you should take away from all this is that they’re good for you and you should eat your vegetables.

Constructor Notes

This idea for this theme came from thinking about Schrödinger puzzles, and wondering if I could potentially create one so that entries that contain more than one distinct stand-alone letter, for example, VITAMIN which can be followed by A, B, C, D, E, or K, intersect another such entry. Ideally, the shared possible letters for each pair of theme entries would be some combination of A, B, C and D, so that the revealer MULTIPLE CHOICE could be used. This didn’t end up panning out, but it did lead me, through a somewhat stream-of-consciousness manner of contemplating crossword themes, to come up with the one you see here. The first version of this puzzle had the theme entries VITAMINS, MUSICAL NOTES, CHEMICAL SYMBOLS, GREEK LETTERS and ALPHABET, and was rejected on the basis that ALPHABET was too obvious, and GREEK LETTERS was inconsistent. It was tough to find a new set of symmetrical theme entries, but I’m pleased with the current set. In each case, the category contains other members besides the ones that are composed of a single letter, and the letters are the members of the category themselves rather than being abbreviations, unlike something such as L M S for SHIRT SIZES. I spent a decent amount of time trying to remove the black square between TILE and GREEK and its symmetrical partner to allow for two pairs of long parallel downs, but I didn’t like the compromises on the fill, so I decided to stick to 78 words. Given that this ended up as a Monday (I had expected it to be a Tuesday) and the importance of smooth fill for Monday puzzles, I stand by this decision, and though there aren’t a ton of bonuses here, I’m fond of SHOT TO HELL and some of the mid-length fill like U.S. NEWS and HANSEL (he’s so hot right now). I don’t have a lot to say as far as the clues go, but a few of mine I’m glad to see survive the edit are 49-Across, 9-Down, 31-Down and 56-Down. Though I’m not sure it will be particularly applicable to this puzzle, I like the inside nod in the clue that Will and Joel came up with for AHA. In any case it’s great to be back, and I hope (fingers crossed) that my puzzle will be a pleasant start to everyone’s week.

Ms. Duff described Biddestone, which has a population of about 500, as “a lovely sort of old-fashioned, proper English village, which hasn’t been spoiled at all.” There is a supermarket about 10 minutes away. Bath, which is between 10 and 15 miles away, has excellent schools, Ms. Duff said. Chippenham railway station, which has train service to Paddington Station in London, is five miles away; the train trip takes about 75 minutes. The international airport in Bristol is just under an hour’s drive, and Heathrow is less than 90 miles east.

MARKET OVERVIEW

The Cotswolds, an area about two-thirds the size of Rhode Island, attracts a variety of buyers from outside the region, agents said.

About half are commuters from London who move to cities along the train line, and the rest are second-home buyers smitten with quintessential English villages, said James Mackenzie, head of Strutt & Parker’s national country house department.

“Everybody wants rolling hills and a view,” Mr. Mackenzie said.

The north, he added, is frequented by “media types” and politicians, including the former prime minister David Cameron, while the south is favored by some of England’s nobility. The Soho Farmhouse, a private club that opened several years ago, has been drawing international clientele to the Cotswolds, he added.

While home prices across London dipped about 5 percent compared with the same period last year, other parts of England, including in and around the Cotswolds, have fared better, according to a September report on England’s residential market by Knight Frank. In Bath and Cheltenham, prices were up 4.7 percent and 6.4 percent over last year. Across the United Kingdom, prices rose around 2 percent, Knight Frank found.

According to the Office for National Statistics, prices in the Cotswolds rose 16.2 percent between July 2016 and 2017, reaching around 385,000 British pounds (or about $505,000), while prices in London fell 18.4 percent over the same period, reaching around £740,000 ($970,000).

David Parris, the managing director of the Jackson-Stops real estate offices in the Cotswolds, said the region’s figures were distorted by a small number of high-value transactions; he estimated that, excepting those, prices rose around 5 percent in that period.

Londoners, particularly a growing number who work remotely, have recently been looking for value in the Cotswolds, he added. Prime properties there cost £500 to £550 per square foot (about $660 to $720), but can reach £3,000 ($3,900) per square foot in prime, central London. The average in the Cotswolds is £300 to £400 per square foot (or about $390 to $530).

“London used to be a place where you could make a lot of money on housing,” he said, adding that because of appreciation, it was once possible to buy a piece of property and make £100,000 in three years. “That’s come to an end; whether that’s temporary or permanent, we don’t know.”

The number of second-home buyers in the Cotswolds, however, has declined, possibly because of an increase in stamp duty levied on second-home purchases that went into effect in April 2016. Mr. Mackenzie said that for homes in the £500,000 to £1.25 million range in the Cotswolds, prices have increased 5 percent since last year. But for homes priced between £1.25 million and £3 million, the stamp duty “hits hard,” he said, which has resulted in stagnating prices or even a drop of one percent or so over the past 18 months.

Above that price range, he added, the market is “fickle,” with some properties having their asking prices reduced and others having multiple interested buyers.

WHO BUYS IN THE COTSWOLDS

The majority of buyers in the Cotswolds are British, Mr. Parris said, estimating that 10 percent of his agency’s are foreign, based on Jackson-Stops sales from April 2016 through March 2017.

Mr. Mackenzie said that about 40 percent of his agency’s recent Cotswolds buyers have been foreign, based on Strutt & Parker sales for roughly the past 18 months, a number that includes British expatriates returning to the country for retirement, particularly from Hong Kong. About 5 or 10 percent are buyers from the United States, he said, who may be taking advantage of the strong dollar.

BUYING BASICS

Foreigners face no restrictions on buying property in England. Transactions are typically handled by a lawyer, and each side retains its own representation. The buyer’s and seller’s lawyers must be from different firms, said Felicity Sergeant, a partner at Streathers Solicitors, a law firm in London.

Buyers of properties that cost more than £125,000 (about $164,000) pay a stamp duty land tax, calculated on a sliding scale.

Last year, some parts of Britain enacted a higher stamp duty land tax rate if a buyer or buyer’s spouse owns or partly owns other property anywhere in the world. Above standard stamp duty, second-home transactions are taxed an additional 3 percent. Buyers who sell their primary residences within three years of purchasing a second home may be eligible for a refund of the additional stamp duty fee, Ms. Sergeant said.

For a primary residence, closing costs paid by the buyer on a £1 million property — including the stamp duty land tax fee, legal fees, a land registry fee and fees for various due diligence searches — total around £47,500 (or about $62,000), she said. On a second home, the stamp duty would be an additional £30,000 ($39,000).

We reveal more of Whiterose’s overall plan. It is still cryptic and still a mystery, but she clearly has an agenda and that agenda does involve parallel universes. The most powerful people in the world — not unlike a lot of people in our real world — go after these loftier goals because they can, because they have the money and the power to do so. In the “Mr. Robot” world there is a character who is fixated on this idea of parallel universes. Do they exist? And can she somehow find a way to harness that?

The first season of “Mr. Robot” was almost universally acclaimed but the reception for the second was more mixed. Did you anticipate that?

No, to be honest with you. I think the second season was much better than the first season in every way, from the performances to the writing to certainly the way the show was shot and executed. So I was a little taken aback that it did get the mixed reviews. But I think the ask on the audience was bigger.

I’m not a huge fan of very plotty shows. I’m much more of a fan of character-driven stories. The second season really delved into not just Elliot and his inner conflict, but all the other characters. It turned much more into an ensemble, and that’s something I appreciate.

At the same time, it had devices like the extended charade of the prison being rendered as Elliot’s mother’s house. Do you anticipate that viewers will figure out such gambits? Or are you hoping they will be shocked?

Do you ever worry that the trickery will overshadow the story?

I’m hoping that’s dependent on the viewer. If you have the mind-set where you are examining the plot and looking for the details, then you’re going to go on Reddit, and you’re going to dissect it and crowdsource the answers with your friends or other fans. And if you’re not — and there’s a good percentage of the population that doesn’t do that — then you’re going to have a very different experience.

One of my favorite shows this year was “Twin Peaks,” and what I loved about it was it defied narrative logic. There was no way to come together and crack a puzzle and figure it out in that way, and I think that was very intentional. It was almost antiplot — it seemed like David Lynch was ignoring plot completely and just sticking to tone, and how it feels and the vibe the show gives off. That, to me, is what resonates the most: When I can get sucked into a show and not have to worry about the logic and the sequence of events.

Is Lynch an influence on you when it comes to things like pacing?

A hundred percent. In fact, a lot of the criticism for the second season was on pace and on the plot being confusing. Lynch is a master, so I don’t dare to compare myself to him. But that was kind of the point: We wanted to lift you out of the narrative logic of trying to always be a step ahead of where the plot is going to go.

“Mr. Robot” definitely has a strong, consistent tone but you take aesthetic detours, like the sitcom episode last year or the long, single takes. How do those fit within the overall storytelling?

TV was classically a medium where the writer was king, but for me it was always about the filmmaking. Any time I approach a scene, it’s not just what’s on the page — it’s how the camera’s going to show or not show what’s on the page. It’s which character are we going to align with and what music is going to be playing. In the writers room, one of the things we talk about in a scene is, what’s the first image we see? What are the sounds that we hear? Because it’s all about the experience and not just the story.

If all you care about is: I need to understand every moment in this episode, and I need to understand where it’s going and I need to understand what everyone is doing and what everyone wants, then just read a breakdown on Wikipedia. For me that’s so secondary to: How does this make you feel?

Why are you so interested in duality, as a concept?

I’ve always been fascinated by this idea of who we are versus who we want to be. We’re always trying to change our diet or exercise more or read more books or go out more. We’re always trying to evolve because we have some picture of what we think we should be. That sort of internal struggle is, for me, a lifelong one and one I think a lot of people face every day. It’s interesting, especially in the context of today, where you are constantly being asked to curate your identity on social media and in other parts of your life.

The story is still set in 2015 but in the premiere there was a montage that included footage of President Trump, which would be anachronistic. Was that an impressionistic element?

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Yes, the specific sequence you’re talking about is Elliot kind of foreshadowing the doom and gloom that could come from a society that gives up and gives in to the powers that be. And sure, one of those moments actually happened here in our world a year after that moment in the show. That sequence in a lot of ways is meant to be impressionistic, but that whole speech ends with Elliot realizing that he’s at fault. He’s to blame for everything that’s happened. That sentiment was something me and the writers also felt during the election last year.

I don’t care if you’re a Democrat or a Republican or a conservative, the election of Trump is a national tragedy for multiple reasons. It will go down as one of the worst tragedies in American history. But he’s not a dictator. This happened because we either allowed it or voted for it. That’s the sentiment that we were trying to communicate in that sequence. And even though this is technically set in 2015, the feeling and the sentiment still apply to today.

What will surprise people this year about this season?

As I tell you that I’m so antiplot, I will say maybe they will be surprised that this year is a lot more plot-driven. [Laughs.] I don’t ever consider “Mr. Robot” to be an action-driven show but I feel like this season you’re going to see a lot more action.

Tech might improve everything.
And it’s probably also terrible in ways we’re only just starting to understand.","Not only am I lucky enough to have my dream job, but it’s perfectly timed, too. In the years that I’ve written the column, the technology business has swallowed the world, becoming by far the largest and most consequential industry on the globe. Silicon Valley today is like Wall Street in the 1980s, or the defense industry in the 1950s: enjoying gargantuan growth and shaping much of the rest of the rest of the economy, not to mention art, culture, politics, education and healthcare.

So why am I feeling so bad about tech?

Well, who isn’t, right? Look around you. It’s difficult to get jazzed about smartphones and social networks when smartphones and social networks might be ruining the world. The technologies we were most excited about 10 years ago are now implicated in just about every catastrophe of the day. (See how Russian propagandists used Facebook and Twitter to inject false narratives into the news media last year.)

The industry is spawning groundbreaking new services, like artificial intelligence or augmented reality, that may well improve much about our lives — self-driving cars, for instance, could save tens of thousands of lives a year. But A.I. may also put millions of people out of work, and some worry that it could wreak global havoc. (Seriously; Elon Musk worries A.I. could spark World War III.)

More immediately, there’s the threat of ever-growing corporate control over much of what we do. Over the next few weeks, starting today, I’m writing a series of columns about the group I like to call the Frightful Five: Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft, which make up half of the top 10 most valuable companies on the American stock market, and which collectively influence just about everything else that happens in tech, as well as the rest of the global economy.

These companies are not evil; they’re all led and staffed by smart, well-meaning people who believe that technology can radically improve the world. But as I argue in the series, we have not, as a society, come to grips with the scope of their control over our lives. And we don’t have many good ways to limit it, if we decided that’s what we’d like to do.

A lot of these worries aren’t new. Though Silicon Valley runs on heedless optimism, much of The Times’s coverage has long been properly skeptical and critical of the implications of new tech. Consider the evil of “revenge porn,” or the rise in accidents caused by drivers looking at their phones. I’ve shared other fears: In 2008, I wrote a book predicting that the internet would lead us into a “post-fact” world.

Still, until this year, the problems caused by tech felt manageable — bumps on the road to a better tomorrow that we’d eventually figure out. I managed to retain the capacity to be viscerally excited by tech, to instantly fall for its potential and possibilities. And I bought into it personally. You should see my house: I’ve outfitted it with every kind of doodad you can imagine, including cameras that record everything we do, lights that switch on by voice, a toilet you have to plug in and, once, an electronic trashcan. (Manual is better, trust me.) There’s a lot about it I now can’t live without; every time I want to snap a picture of my kids, which is maybe five times an hour, I’m grateful for the smartphone.

And yet now it all comes freighted with worry. That’s what’s different. In 2007, when Mr. Jobs unveiled the iPhone, just about everyone greeted the new device as an unalloyed good. I was one of them. Here was a genuinely new thing that would Make Your Life Better, we all thought: It would be convenient, it would be fun, it wasn’t serious or dangerous or globe-shattering. That’s no longer true.

Like players in “The Front Page,” hordes of cigar-chomping, fedora-wearing men plied their trade as a contact sport that was not above recreating scenes or putting a prop or two — like a lonesome looking doll — into everyday moments of tragedy.

In this cast of characters, Weegee was the Dante of New York’s nighttime demimonde. His photos, of swells and speakeasies, crime and crowds, or perps and play, are a singular record of New York City in the 1930s and ’40s. And just when you thought you had seen all of his work, a new book, “Extra! Weegee,” features vintage prints — many previously unseen — that captures Weegee’s singular point of view.

Daniel Blau, the book’s editor, admitted that he had “never really liked Weegee.” Obviously, he has since come to his senses, putting together an impressive volume that captures the many sides of New York as it approached World War II. The images were found in the archives of the Newspaper Enterprise Association, a syndicate founded at the turn of the last century by Edward Willis Scripps. The photos — which had been taken for the association’s Acme Newspictures service — passed through the hands of several owners, and were discovered in storage in 2012 by Ryan Adams.

These prints, Mr. Blau wrote in the book, changed his mind, as he saw pictures vastly different from those he had encountered 30 years earlier in some badly reproduced volume. And in a nod to the current daily torrent of images, these photos had an air of mystery, he said, and the mark of a master.

Weegee, born Ascher Fellig in 1899 in what is now Ukraine, lived a spartan existence down by the old New York Police headquarters in Lower Manhattan. That’s not surprising, since his realm was the streets. And the images he shot revealed not just a knowledge of people and places, but an appreciation for the ironic, odd or absurd.

A car dangles off the roadway that encircles Grand Central Terminal, with a “ONE WAY” arrow pointing at it, while two men stand under an awning, not oblivious, but not impressed, either. In another, an overturned vehicle rests on its side, with a sign reading “SLOW DOWN” hovering behind it like an unheeded warning.

Working crowds, you have images of a sweaty, packed throng in Coney Island and people celebrating the end of World War II. A jubilant sailor is surrounded by four women, flanking a sign he held declaring: “$2,000 In Bank Now I’m Looking for a Wife,” with “18-40” added at the bottom. An image of gawkers at a murder scene is a collage of mostly children’s faces, some goofy, arrayed around one woman whose grief is etched on her face.

He also found the lighter side, showing teenaged bobbysoxers jitterbugging in the aisles of a theater, dogs and cats, and even a gorilla. The book is divided into chapters that all start with “EXTRA!” and are devoted to topics like Crime, Cool, Friends, Characters and more.

Of course, the main character on this sidewalk stage is Weegee himself. Mr. Blau deftly connects the man and his era to how we and Hollywood — to which Weegee decamped in 1947 to try his hand at acting — now perceive it.

“Our reference points to these mysterious words can be found in Hollywood entertainment such as ‘The Sopranos’ or ‘Boardwalk Empire,’” Mr. Blau wrote. “Weegee made these possible. He was a game changer — breaking new ground in both photography and photojournalism. Using a camera to tell a story as others used their pen or speech.”

Mr. Blau concludes that while Weegee may have left to be a movie actor, he had long been on that path.

“By then he had already made all the films he wanted,” he wrote. “All films made of a single frame. All telling a story in one take. Today I love these short films.”

Hillary Clinton warned during the campaign, in a foreign policy speech in June 2016, “This is not someone who should ever have the nuclear codes, because it’s not hard to imagine Donald Trump leading us into a war just because somebody got under his very thin skin.”

In July 2016, Tony Schwartz, Trump’s ghostwriter for his best-selling memoir “The Art of the Deal,” revealed to The New Yorker, “I feel a deep sense of remorse that I contributed to presenting Trump in a way that brought him wider attention and made him more appealing than he is.”

He continued, “I genuinely believe that if Trump wins and gets the nuclear codes, there is an excellent possibility it will lead to the end of civilization.”

That same month, Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia warned at the Democratic National Convention about “giving the nuclear codes to a man who praises Vladimir Putin and Saddam Hussein.”

In August 2016, a Republican representative, Richard Hanna of New York, endorsed Hillary Clinton because, as he put it: “I think Trump is a national embarrassment. Is he really the guy you want to have the nuclear codes?”

By the time Clinton had her first debate against Trump, she had sharpened this nuclear attack line, but something about it still felt dull: “A man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes.”

Something about all these warnings, while true, felt of another time, like they were happening during the Cold War, rather than tailored for an election about the culture wars. Still, a Fox News poll conducted a month before the election found that voters overwhelmingly trusted Clinton to do a better job making decisions about using nuclear weapons.

But enough Americans looked past these warnings, just as they pushed past so many others, to hand Trump the election. After all, the nuclear question was theoretical and academic, right? No, it wasn’t.

In fact, after the election, concern about Trump controlling our nuclear arsenal only congealed.

The worry is so real that in January, a Democratic representative, Ted Lieu of California, introduced the Restricting First Use of Nuclear Weapons Act, which is designed “to prohibit the conduct of a first-use nuclear strike absent a declaration of war by Congress.”

In May, The Washington Times quoted Senator Ed Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, as saying, “We do not trust him with our nuclear weapons arsenal” and “We do not want him to use nuclear weapons first in the North Korean standoff — not just there in Korea, but all across the planet.”

The article also quotes Markey as saying of Trump, “As his comments become more erratic and inconsistent on the use of nuclear weapons, we think it’s imperative for the United States Congress to reclaim its constitutional authority to have the power to determine whether or not these nuclear weapons are used first against any country.”

Trump continues his war of words and measuring of egos with Kim Jong-un of North Korea. While I still find the threat of a nuclear strike remote, it grows less and less remote with every passing day and every insult.

Kim Jong-un is irrational and unhinged, but so is Trump.

No matter whether I agreed with President Barack Obama’s policies or not, I never once worried that he might ignite a nuclear war. That assurance has now been removed. As my colleague Nicholas Kristof, who recently visited North Korea, said of the possibility of a war between our country and theirs, “War is preventable, but I’m not sure it will be prevented.”

This is what Senator Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican, meant when he talked to The New York Times last week. The Times reported that Corker charged that Trump was “treating his office like ‘a reality show,’ with reckless threats toward other countries that could set the nation ‘on the path to World War III.’ ”

Plenty of people tried to warn us about this moment, but not enough Americans took heed. To them, this was sky-is-falling hyperbole. The use of nuclear weapons was a thing of history and Hollywood.

But it is ever so clear that the threat is urgent and real and that the only thing standing between a nuclear strike and us is a set of short fingers that constantly type out Twitter insults.

But how does North Korea see the United States?

Today, we have a rare look inside the country.

• Nicholas Kristof, a New York Times columnist who writes about human rights and global affairs, talks about his recent trip to Pyongyang.

When Jerry Jones says that players can’t be “disrespectful,” what he’s really saying is that black people are not supposed to complain that we are routinely killed by the police, even when unarmed. We are supposed to embrace the idea that our lives should not be valued, because floating the opinion that maybe we shouldn’t be killed for no reason might offend advertisers.

It’s also hard to reconcile ESPN’s decision to suspend Jemele Hill for not quite calling for a boycott with the outspokenness that ESPN prizes in anchors who are not black women, who say things much more offensive and only get a slap on the wrist.

Suspending Jemele Hill is the sort of desperate move ESPN undoubtedly hopes might attract more viewers, much like the network’s sudden decision not to allow an Asian-American broadcaster named Robert Lee to call a college-football game last August. ESPN’s subscriber base dropped to 87 million households in September from a high of 100.1 million in 2011, and the network has laid off more than 100 people this year in addition to 300 workers in October 2015.

Even though 51 percent of Americans believe the N.F.L. protests are appropriate, we are apparently supposed to give the network a high-five for suspending an anchor who agrees with us because the network is awkwardly attempting to promote a form of so-called patriotism that would require many of us to decide that our own lives aren’t worth prizing.

It’s been hard to watch the N.F.L. this season. Like a lot of fans, I’m worried the league isn’t sufficiently dedicated to treating concussions and addressing domestic violence. And for me, a black woman, these worries have been compounded by the league’s grab bag of positions on the players’ police brutality protests, from mild support to mild disapproval. A surprisingly high percentage of my willingness to continue to watch the game hangs on whether the league will allow protests.

But Jerry Jones’s comments are the sort that may move the league toward a place where police brutality protests are not allowed, one where African-Americans could be asked to watch a sport that is determined to remind us that our opinions on whether we should be killed while unarmed are not valued. And somehow ESPN is determined to make this situation worse by showing that a black anchor is just as restricted in exercising her free speech rights as the players she covers.

While I realize that neither professional sports leagues nor national television networks are likely to be the forces leading the anti-police-brutality revolution, I am quietly happy whenever anyone in a position of power decides to say something that might stop someone somewhere from killing a person who looks like me.

“For practicality and having no children, I recognized that at some point in my life, I will need help,” she said.","Another option is disability insurance, which is intended for healthy working-age people, who are more likely to become disabled than die.

Disability insurance is more expensive than life insurance, but these two planning solutions require comparatively little effort. Most people understand they should have both forms of insurance, though not everyone chooses to buy it.

The planning becomes more complex with the so-called softer issues: the questions to which there are multiple but sometimes conflicting answers. Who should be contacted if something goes wrong? How do I want my personal possessions divided? What are my thoughts about going into a nursing home? Do I want to be resuscitated if I go into cardiac arrest? Any thoughts on a funeral?

“The best way to plan for an event you can’t control is to put your own plan in place,” said Sharon Klein, president of the New York metropolitan region for Wilmington Trust. “Otherwise, someone else is going to be putting a plan in place for you.”

Clients of a firm like Wilmington Trust are wealthy and receive a higher level of attention from advisers. But there are plenty of web-based services that aim to help anyone plan.

Everplans is one site. It guides users through a list of documents and discussions that need to be considered: wills, insurance, a health care directive, passwords for email and social media accounts, funeral planning. But it also has sections for storing keepsakes like family recipes or for leaving instructions about pet care or how things work in the home.

“We want to help people think of the unexpected,” said Abby Schneiderman, co-founder and co-chief executive of Everplans. “It could be anything unexpected. Natural disaster, flood, fire, illness, a death — you don’t know. The idea is: Don’t wait until it’s too late.”

The service, which costs individuals $75 a year, prods users to do more. It offers a 10-minute “just in case” plan that asks people to put down as much information as they know from memory, Ms Schneiderman said.

“We want to be a one-stop shop, but we also try to get people to take it a piece at a time,” she said. For instance, the service sends out electronic reminders to prompt users to take one more step.

Final Roadmap is another such site. It was born out of a nurse’s frustration with families being unprepared for the decisions and logistical considerations that happen at the end of life.

Steve Byrne, a co-founder of Final Roadmap, said the website, which charges a one-time fee of $249, held legal and financial documents, instructions for death, and messages for loved ones.

“All of those notifications can prevent problems that supersede money problems,” he said. Without proper instructions, those decisions “can blow up and result in siblings not ever talking to each other.”

Wealthier people tend to rely on advisers who are privy to a raft of information to help them, especially when it comes to tax planning, which could become more urgent if President Trump’s proposal to repeal the estate and other transfer taxes is passed. Adam von Poblitz, head of Citi Private Bank’s North American trust division, said the repeal of a tax that took 40 percent of a couple’s assets above the current $11 million exemption would increase the need for creating a trust because more money would pass to heirs.

“You need trusts to protect the assets from creditors but also from the beneficiaries themselves,” he said. “That protection aspect doesn’t go away” if the estate tax is repealed.

Not planning for the expected can also cause unnecessary confusion and stress.

“There’s a growing emphasis placed on how do you want to live the end of your days,” said Rachel J. Sherman, vice president of client service at Market Street Trust Company, which began as the family office for the founders of Corning Glass Works. “It needs more attention. People don’t want to be a burden.”

Monette Booth, 73, who lives in the Virgin Islands, said she had learned from her mother and aunt to keep her affairs in order. They “stressed to us children that life is never guaranteed and one should always plan for the future,” she said.

After her husband, Peter, a retired Corning executive, died in 2011, she stepped up her planning to ensure that she could grow old where she wanted, that she would not burden her relatives and that her assets would eventually be disposed of as she wished.

“For practicality and having no children, I recognized that at some point in my life, I will need help,” she said. “It’s taken a load off my mind to have made the decision.”

Ms. Booth said she had become part of a “circle of friends” in which she and others shared information that someone would need if one of them became incapacitated.

She said the planning was not difficult to contemplate. “I thought it made a lot of sense,” she said. “Otherwise, one is being an ostrich and not paying attention. This is part of an inevitable process.”

Most people are not this pragmatic, let alone proactive and organized. One solution for affluent people is a revocable trust, which can be used as a repository for financial assets but also documents to guide the family.

Ms. Klein of Wilmington Trust said many clients had revocable trusts drafted so that they became irrevocable in the event of disability or death. She said they could then function as a more sophisticated power of attorney; they could also help avoid the probate process of a will that delays access to the assets.

Yet deciding what to do to prepare, for example, for the possibility of becoming incapacitated by illness is a test of managing expectations around the unexpected. Jeffrey Maurer, chief executive of Evercore Wealth Management, said he presented the case rationally.

“My major concern for clients, friends and family, for myself, is what is the likelihood, if one were a gambling person, that I’m going to outlive my current cognitive abilities?” he said.

The answer determines what protections people should put in place, if they can afford them.

Plans can have limits. Barry Sinrod, who retired early as a market researcher and went on to write several best-selling books, said he and his wife, Shelly, had thought they planned well in case one of them became incapacitated. They even had a provision for assisted suicide.

His wife learned in 2003 that she had Parkinson’s disease but managed well until she learned that she had dementia. By 2010, he said, she did not know him or their children. He looked for someone to assist his wife in dying but found there was no one who would do it, because by that point, she was not competent to appear before a judge.

She died in 2014. “I said, I don’t want this to happen to me,” said Mr. Sinrod, 75, of Delray Beach, Fla.

When he met his second wife, whom he married in January, he brought up his desire to die with dignity, he said.

“Now, I have this document that says my second wife will take me to the Netherlands to die if my kids won’t take me,” Mr. Sinrod said. “My kids don’t like the idea of this, but they understand.”

What followed was perhaps the biggest sex scandal in American history. O.K., I’m totally exaggerating. (Remember that whopper in the 19th century with Grover Cleveland’s illegitimate child?) But the Donald-Marla-Ivana story was unusual in that at the time, nobody involved in it was all that important. Trump was a celebrity real estate developer, but there were plenty of equally rich and glamorous figures in New York, many of them having adultery issues of their own.

The difference was that Trump pushed the story, calling his allies in the media with new tidbits or lines of defense. It was as if Grover Cleveland had press agents trying to make sure his side of the love-child scandal was in a headline every day.

You will not hear anything about that angle in Ivana’s book. In fact, once the affair comes center stage, you hardly hear anything about Donald at all. He seems to be a sort of passive bystander. (“After the showgirl got pregnant and had a daughter, Donald married her.”)

The villain of the book is “Marla freaking Maples” the “showgirl” who broke up her marriage and produced The New York Post’s all-time famous front-page headline: “Best Sex I’ve Ever Had.” If Marla had kidnapped Donald, thrown him in a trunk and driven him off to a shotgun wedding, she could not have been more evil.

Ivana’s eagerness to gloss over the sins of an ex who now happens to be president of the most powerful nation on the planet is hardly the worst issue of sexism the country has to discuss this week. But it’s still a useful reminder that Trump has gotten away with absolutely appalling behavior throughout his life, right down to his yelping “locker room talk” whenever people bring up that recording of him bragging about grabbing women’s private parts.

Toward the end of the book Trump is “kind enough to waive the $20,000 fee” when Ivana held her third marriage at Mar-a-Lago. The later husbands were pretty terrible, too. One of them had a large, thuggish son who spent one family gathering throttling — oh no! — Donald Jr.

The ensuing machinations also pull in Blake’s estranged, gay, environmentalist son, Steven (James Mackay), and the family’s adversaries, the Colbys.

For nostalgic fans of the original, this might seem like an unnecessary homage. For the CW’s target fan base, born largely after the original went off the air, it’s a retread of themes from more exciting soaps. For everyone, it’s so far forgettable.

“Dynasty,” on the other hand, is obvious in plot and dialogue. It’s the kind of show where you know you’ve met the black sheep of the family because he says, “I’m the black sheep,” and Fallon’s secret lover welcomes her back to sultry Atlanta by saying, “It wasn’t as hot without you here.”

The casting is at least promising. Ms. Gillies (“Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll”) seizes the screen as the lusty, ambitious Fallon, and Alan Dale is imperious as the snooty Carrington butler (another holdover figure from the original). And the show’s depiction of luxury is even more over-the-top, maybe reflecting a world in which the 0.001 percent are richer and more powerful than in the 1980s.

But it all feels superfluous. Then again, the original “Dynasty” didn’t really have its zing until the second season, when villainess Alexis (Joan Collins) put the “nasty” into its title.

And in the waning hours of last week, as he struggled to retain control of the business in the wake of allegations first reported by The New York Times, Harvey Weinstein fired off an email to his brother and other board members asserting that they knew about the payoffs, according to people who spoke on the condition of anonymity about the confidential communication.

Lance Maerov, the board member who handled the contract negotiations, acknowledged in an interview that he had been told of settlements, but said that he had assumed they were used to cover up consensual affairs. Mr. Maerov said that his chief concern had been whether Mr. Weinstein’s behavior posed a legal liability for the business, and that after receiving assurances that no company money was used and that no complaints against Mr. Weinstein were pending, he had approved the contract.

The Weinstein Investigation

Mr. Glasser declined to comment, as did Bob Weinstein. The board members Tarak Ben Ammar and Richard Koenigsberg did not respond to messages.

The contract came up for renewal just as Ambra Battilana, an Italian model, reported to the police that Harvey Weinstein had groped her during a work meeting at his Manhattan office. (Working with the police, she captured Mr. Weinstein speaking about the encounter in audio that was published along with an article in The New Yorker on Tuesday.)

The district attorney’s office declined to press charges, and Mr. Weinstein insisted that it was a setup, but some board members and top executives worried that Mr. Weinstein had engaged in a pattern of behavior that could jeopardize the company.

After the episode, Mr. Maerov said, Mr. Weinstein refused to let the board review his personnel file directly. Instead, it was examined by an outside lawyer, H. Rodgin Cohen, who assured the board in a September 2015 letter that it was legally safe to retain Mr. Weinstein because there were no unresolved complaints or threats of litigation against him, according to two people who saw the letter and spoke on the condition of anonymity.

In the file, Mr. Cohen came across a single sexual harassment allegation, from 2014, involving a former temporary employee, Emily Nestor, according to a person familiar with his review.

Ms. Nestor was new to the job at the company’s Los Angeles office when Mr. Weinstein invited her to breakfast at the Peninsula Beverly Hills and made her an offer: If she accepted his sexual advances, he would boost her career, according to accounts, viewed by The Times, that she provided to colleagues who passed them along to executives. She declined the offer and never intended to complain to human resources personnel, internal records show.

It is unclear whether the board was told of her allegation — by the executives or by Mr. Cohen, who declined to comment for this article. Mr. Maerov said, “Her name came up in 2015, but I don’t remember who brought it up.”

Mr. Cohen’s letter to the board did not describe the contents of Mr. Weinstein’s file, nor did it address whether Mr. Weinstein had entered into private settlements with women who complained of misconduct.

Mr. Boies said that at the time of the contract negotiations, he was aware of three or four settlements with women. He would not specify which ones, and would not say who within the company or the board was told of them or how the information was communicated.

His law firm, Boies, Schiller & Flexner, has represented the Weinstein Company and its predecessor, Miramax, in a variety of legal matters. He has also worked directly for Mr. Weinstein, as was the case during the contract negotiations. Mr. Boies said there was one settlement to which he “gave advice at or about the time it was being entered into” but declined to say which one.

The Times reported last week that Mr. Weinstein had entered into private settlements with at least eight women who complained of misconduct while he was at the Weinstein Company or Miramax. The Times was able to identify five of them. In the 1990s, payments were made to two female Miramax employees and the actress Rose McGowan. In 2015, settlements were struck with Ms. Battilana and Lauren O’Connor, an employee of the Weinstein Company who submitted a searing memo in November that year alleging persistent sexual harassment by Mr. Weinstein.

Mr. Maerov said that he had been prepared to investigate Ms. O’Connor’s allegations but that Mr. Weinstein’s lawyers told him she had withdrawn her complaint as part of a settlement. He said they also told him that Ms. O’Connor had submitted a letter of appreciation to the company and continued to work there for a period of time. He said he did not see a need to press for more details or follow through with an investigation.

He recalled being told of the existence of other settlements, but never their details. He said he assumed they involved consensual affairs because Mr. Weinstein had insinuated that he was a philanderer. He said he was never told of a settlement with Ms. Battilana or any other payments made to women who alleged misconduct.

To address any lingering concern about Mr. Weinstein’s behavior, Mr. Maerov said he successfully pushed a new code of conduct at the company that included a detailed description of sexual harassment. The contracts for Mr. Weinstein and other top executives also came with a new clause: They would face costly fines if the company ever had to pay a settlement for their misconduct.

In our current news cycle, the comments on NYT Cooking — The New York Times’s recipe site — can seem like an oasis of calm. Indeed, the site’s most recommended comment to date mulls the life-or-death question of whether flour should be measured before or after sifting.

Even NYT Cooking’s nomenclature for reader feedback exudes politeness and diplomacy. “When the site was founded,” says the Food editor Sam Sifton, “we made a conscious decision to call for recipe ‘notes’ instead of ‘comments.’ We know people feel strongly about the recipes we run, and we’re happy to read and share what they have to say, but we want the site to be really and truly useful to readers. We felt that asking for ‘notes’ on recipes would lead to a more collegial and fact-based atmosphere than one filled with mere comment and opinion. That’s worked to a large extent.”

But every now and then ... a “note” takes a wildly unexpected turn.

“Superb recipe,” Christopher Johnson opined recently after trying a lemon soufflé recipe. “So light and fluffy it feels like a tangy cloud! My wife hates me and life is meaningless. Be sure to be careful with the variety of lemon because it can sometimes be too tart. Good luck!”

This blithe dropping of an overshare smack dab in the middle of a conversation about dessert ingredients is far from routine. But “dishes” (pardon the pun) are what cooking is all about — perhaps because food is such a visceral, basic, universal need, so tied up in our memories and emotions, from romantic passion to sadness to downright anger. Recipe communities can feel like a safe space in which to vent.

Then she stamped the backs of the canvases with a Louvre seal, added her own signature and escorted them from the museum.
“The Metro is like the subway in New York,” Mr. Guilbert said.","Andre Martin and Renaud Wald made off with the paintings from the Louvre without triggering the dreaded “red procedure.” That’s the high-tech system that automatically seals exits and locks doors throughout the vast museum within two minutes of a security breach. The duo then carried the artworks to a nearby Metro station and casually boarded a train.

Just two cool customers who just pulled off the most brazen daylight art heist ever captured on film?

Non. The two are Louvre copyists, upholders of what Ivan Guilbert, a Parisian photojournalist, calls “a beautiful tradition” that dates to the French Revolution. In November 1793, one month after Marie Antoinette was beheaded, the revolutionary national assembly declared the Louvre Palace, Louis XIV’s former residence on the Right Bank of the Seine, open to the public. All citizens were welcomed to enjoy the national art treasures stored there, previously for the pleasure of the golden carriage set only.

Called the Central Museum of the Arts of the Republic, the people’s musée took the democratic ideal a step further. Any professional, amateur or aspiring painter was invited to enter the museum, set up an easel — provided free of charge to this day — and have a go at copying a masterpiece.

Thousands have since followed suit. Among them are such art history boldfaced names as Paul Cézanne, Edgar Degas, Marc Chagall, Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dalí. The goal for them, and the present-day copyists whom Mr. Guilbert photographed for Le Parisien Magazine, is to learn the secrets of color, technique and composition by copying the works of some of the greatest artists of all time. “It’s like a free school,” says Mr. Guilbert.

Photo

“You have to copy and recopy the masters,” Degas once said, “and it’s only after having proved oneself as a good copyist that you can reasonably try to do a still life of a radish.”

The ambitions of the copyists Mr. Guilbert photographed went well beyond fruits and vegetables. Marius Allier, a 26-year-old graduate of the School of Fine Arts in Paris, drew crowds as he tackled Eugène Delacroix’s “Women of Algiers (in their Apartment).” The 1834 painting presents challenges that have made it long popular among copyists, including Picasso, who later painted his own variations in the 1950s.

Catherine Balpe, an amateur painter, copied Theodore Chasseriau’s 1843 portrait, “The Two Sisters,” as a gift for her husband. Sam Rachamin journeyed from his home in Israel to render his copy of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres’s 1808 painting, “The Bather.”

Mr. Martin, 58, is a professional painter — but of houses, not canvases. A self-taught artist who paints using an easel and much smaller brushes when he’s not climbing ladders, copied “View of Pirna from the Sonnenstein Castle” by the Italian artist Bernardo Bellotto.

Though the Louvre, unlike other leading museums, does not charge copyists for the privilege, applicants can wait up to two years for one of the 250 permits the museum issues annually. Valid for three months, it allows them to work in the museum’s galleries from 9:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. most days, except Sundays and holidays, from September through June.

Photo

Tourists and other museum visitors can bring cameras into the Louvre and take pictures. But because Mr. Guilbert planned to shoot for publication, he applied for, and received permission to spend three days in the galleries with the copyists. “For me, the assignment was like a romantic experience,” he says.

With the Louvre’s magnificent interior architecture enhancing the composition of his shots, Mr. Guilbert chose to use the same light that illuminates the masterworks, to strong effect. “I never used a flash,” he says. “It’s most interesting to work with what you’re given.”

Finished with their copies, Mssrs. Martin and Wald, a photographer who copied Agnolo Bronzino’s “Portrait of a Man Holding a Statuette,” met with Isabelle Vieilleville, director of the Louvre’s copy office. To guard against forgeries, she checked that the two copyists had used canvases that were one-fifth smaller or larger than the original, and that the original artists’ signatures were not reproduced on the copies. Then she stamped the backs of the canvases with a Louvre seal, added her own signature and escorted them from the museum.

On the train, masterworks in hand, they drew little more than a double take or two. “The Metro is like the subway in New York,” Mr. Guilbert said. “There was not really much reaction from the other passengers. They have seen it all.”

Diane Cook and Len Jenshel present some answers in their new book, “Wise Trees,” which will be published by Abrams in October.
They were in Japan documenting a nighttime cherry tree ritual when Ms. Cook learned that her father was dying.
“Taking that strength from the trees, we had this idea of looking at wise trees around the world,” said Ms. Cook.
I need to go back to that tree,’” Ms. Cook recalled.","Trees can live without us, but we cannot live without trees.

With a history dating back to the dinosaurs, trees are the planet’s documentarians, watching us cycle through life while providing oxygen, shade and shelter. Trees, the oldest of which, according to Peter Wohlleben’s “The Hidden Life of Trees,” has 9,500 years, are a critical part of the human experience. We rely on them, from their deep roots to fluttering leaves.

But — at least when we’re not cutting them down — how do we influence trees? Diane Cook and Len Jenshel present some answers in their new book, “Wise Trees,” which will be published by Abrams in October. Traveling to more than 70 locations, they found trees that represent “landscapes of complexity where nature and humanity converge.” In other words, trees with stories, like the young sycamore that witnessed the Civil War, or the elm that survived the Oklahoma City bombing. These photos show how events have shaped trees, their energy, and sometimes, literally, the shape of their limbs.

“Forty-million trees are being lost every day,” said Mr. Jenshel. “We love the environment and wanted to do something that would make people think differently about trees.”

Though Mr. Jenshel and Ms. Cook — who are married, collaborate on all their projects and frequently finish each other’s sentences — have a long history of photographing trees, a much more personal seed for their project was planted in the spring of 2012. They were in Japan documenting a nighttime cherry tree ritual when Ms. Cook learned that her father was dying. Struggling to process the information, she found herself watching the fragile petals of the cherry blossoms slowly drift to the ground, one by one.

“We did what the Japanese have been doing for centuries,” said Ms. Cook. “To take in that beauty, appreciate its ephemeral nature, and know that life does go on.”

Her father died soon after, but a new project was born, influenced by the cherry blossoms and a National Geographic magazine commission. “Taking that strength from the trees, we had this idea of looking at wise trees around the world,” said Ms. Cook. “And the importance trees have had throughout history in so many cultures.”

After the Sept. 11 attacks, search and rescue workers were looking for human remains among the rubble, when they found part of a Callery pear tree, which traditionally is the first tree to bloom in spring and the last to change leaves in autumn. Though its trunk was scorched and many branches missing, the tree had survived the attacks. Now a symbol of strength and survival, the pear tree was nursed back to health at a Bronx nursery and, nearly a decade later, replanted at the World Trade Center memorial.

Other trees have been a part of unspeakable cruelties. From 1846 to 1870, in Goliad, Tex., an oak known as “The Hanging Tree,” provided shade for court sessions and branches for lynching.

“It’s not always a happy story,” said Ms. Cook.

One of the rain or monkeypod trees in Cambodia (imported from South or Central America), was isolated from the others as “The Killing Tree.” In 1975 when Pol Pot’s murderous rule started, the tree was used to bash children’s heads while their mothers were forced to watch.

“It took us days to recover from that experience of photographing that tree,” said Ms. Cook. “That left the deepest scar on us.”

Other trees seem to travel, and quite far. It is not clear how the adansonia gregorii (or boab) tree got to Western Australia. Perhaps it was the result of seeds dropped from the fruits by early migrants. It was a good thing, though, for the local aboriginals who used the tree as a spiritual home and lifeline, since it can hold up to 26 gallons of water.

In India, from the ancient tree deities to current bodhis of enlightenment, most trees are seen as sacred. In a Varanasi sweet shop, they found a neem tree, said to cure all ailments. Long after they shot the photo, Ms. Cook noticed her spouse’s anxiety.

“Len kept saying, ‘I don’t think we got the picture. I need to go back to that tree,’” Ms. Cook recalled. “I totally knew it was about the sweets.”

36A: One way to develop as a solver is to take the occasional educated guess based on known letters in the grid. Perhaps you’ve never seen “The Phantom of the Opera,” but you are left with the letter pattern _ _ _ IS after confidentially filling in INERT and STAYS at 38/39D. Well, what’s the first five-letter city ending in IS that comes to mind? You may come up initially with both PARIS and TUNIS, and can check the first letter with the crossing clue “Totally captivated” at 25D. Using the “P” in PARIS, 25D could be RAPT ... and there you have it. You’ve just expanded your toehold through a quick guess-and-check.

6D: I got my friends from college into crosswords last year, and a common struggle they had was deciphering exactly which exclamation answered a clue like this. AHA? OHO? Perhaps GEE or WOW? Nope. Despite the plausibility of these guesses, you must check your crossings.

54D: While “going ape” means “losing one’s cool,” this is a cutesy clue inspired by “Tarzan of the Apes.” Love it. Although it’s not the easiest, especially when GO APE looks so odd in a grid.

Constructor Notes

Joy Behar: I started doing The New York Times puzzle right after college, when I found myself working a job that had a lot of down time. It was difficult at first, and still is, especially on Saturday, when the puzzle is very challenging. I found that if I stuck with it, I could finish it. This proved to be a good lesson for other chores and projects. In recent years, I found my name used in the puzzles. I figured they needed the vowels. Even so, it was a thrill. As far as construction, once we landed on a theme (comedians), it was not too difficult to come up with puns for comedians’ names. The grid’s restrictions didn’t allow as many names as I would have liked, but that’s life in the crossword world. The best part of doing the puzzle every day is that it provides a distraction like no other: From politics, the phone and the refrigerator. So thank you. Lynn Lempel: This collaboration was something of a blind date set up by Will, and it was all done via email. We both decided from Day 1 that the theme would be comedians, but it took a while to get from there to this puzzle. At first we thought of using names like (Lucille) BALL, (Bob) HOPE, and (Chris) ROCK that could be used in everyday phrases — and we batted around some possibilities. We also considered a few ideas that included revealers. But then, among ideas for those themes, Joy included PRYOR COMMITMENT … and I knew immediately that she’d come up with something different and perfect. She’d found our theme angle for sure, and her example was even 15 letters for a terrific central grid-spanner. After emailing back and forth, we decided on this set. Three of the five theme entries (PRINZE, PRYOR, and IDLE) were Joy’s ideas, and all but one of the theme clues were hers (all but BARR). Unfortunately, BARR HOPPING didn’t fit. A few names that didn’t work were Chaplin/chaplain, Marx/marks, and Bee/be. I did the grid, which Joy approved. And I wrote clues that she then went through and edited, preferring to make them more challenging. Will changed very few of them. If you guessed that Joy wrote the great clue for GO APE, you’d be right. Also the ones for RESCUE DOG and HELIX, just to name two that I especially liked. Working on this with Joy was great fun. Her emails were guaranteed to include some funny choices I never would have thought of. I loved the way the puzzle turned out. I hope all of you solvers do, too.

Thank you, Ms. Behar and Ms. Lempel, for such a lovely Tuesday puzzle. Truly hope to see more from you, whether it be on television or in print.

PhotoIn an interview with Lincoln Kirstein, who wrote an essay for Evans’s 1938 book “American Photographs,” Evans said, “Take Atget, whose work I now know very well.","From grizzled cotton farmers to quiet small-town buildings and roadside stands, Walker Evans built his reputation on chronicling America’s out-of-the-way places and people. And while he was a prodigious chronicler of vernacular American culture, his own roots were hardly common. Born Walker Evans III, the scion of a prominent family, he grew up in privilege, attending Phillips Academy and then Williams College, dropping out after one year.

A turning point for Evans was his decision — like many young men of means — to go to Paris in 1926 to study for a year at the Sorbonne. His stay filled his head with ideas gleaned from Flaubert and Baudelaire, but it was another Frenchman — Eugène Atget — whose work affected him the most, leading to the dry, observational style that became his visual signature.

Clément Chéroux, a French curator, organized a massive Walker Evans retrospective at the Centre Pompidou in Paris, which recently traveled to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, (where he is now the head of the photography department). He said Evans tried to emulate in America what Atget did in Paris.

“Atget has tried to define, through his photographs — what is the Parisian vernacular? What is the visual spirit of Paris? And Evans has done exactly the same with America,” Mr. Chéroux said. “What is so interesting for me, in this exchange between American and French culture, is that he has tried to define the American vernacular culture, but with the method and style of French culture.”

Evans embodied a paradox: a member of the American elite drawn to unfussy places, urban workers and desperate farmers, becoming best known for his seminal project with James Agee, “Let Us Now Praise Famous Men,” about America’s poor and downtrodden during the Great Depression.

For Mr. Chéroux, this paradox was an interesting way to understand Evans. The curator has done scholarly research into the vernacular, which he defines as “useful, domestic and popular” in an essay in the exhibition catalog. “Maybe one of the reasons why I’m fascinated with Evans is because there is so much paradox in his work,” he said. “There is this dialectical tension between Europe and the U.S., and there is also this very strong dialectical tension between an aristocratic or elite point of view, and a subject which is definitely popular culture, and workers.”

The specific nature of the Atget-Evans vision, with its emphasis on large format, razor sharp, perfectly observed, almost preternaturally quiet moments, allows the photographs to impress viewers nearly a century later. Evans had a simple explanation: Atget’s photographs had a transcendent quality, which he tried to emulate.

Photo

In an interview with Lincoln Kirstein, who wrote an essay for Evans’s 1938 book “American Photographs,” Evans said, “Take Atget, whose work I now know very well. In his work you do feel what some people call poetry. I do call it that also, but a better word for it, to me, is, well – when Atget does even a tree root, he transcends that thing. And by God somebody else does not.”

By looking at things previously unobserved, or subjects once thought beneath the purview of art, Evans created a vision of America that is still inextricable from our national identity. And while his initial exposure to Atget’s work might have been coincidental — his friend Berenice Abbott showed him a trove of the Frenchman’s work — his subsequent choice of subject matter was not.

In another essay in the exhibition catalog, Evans said his early work was influenced by his feelings about the United States. “I was really anti-American at the time,” he said. “America was a big business and I wanted to escape. It nauseated me. My photography was a semi-conscious reaction against right-thinking and optimism; it was an attack on the establishment. I could just hear my father saying, ‘Why do you want to look at those scenes, they’re depressing. Why don’t you look at the nice things in life?’ Nothing original about that though.”

This might be the key to understanding his role in the history of photography, as he heavily influenced subsequent generations, including the famed “New Topographics” movement of the 1970s. (When asked via email whether Evans’s work had inspired him and his colleagues, Stephen Shore simply replied, “Yes.”)

According to Mr. Chéroux, Evans was able to adopt a neutral stance and let the magic, or inherent tension, of a scene speak for itself. He notably contrasted this style against the showy, artsy technique employed by contemporaries like Alfred Stieglitz and the Modernists.

“He wants to disappear in front of his subject, to let this emotion transfer from the subject to the viewer,” he said of Evans. “I think this is really what he understood. It’s the reason why he is so close to Atget. All the photographers who think that the subject is more important than themselves are in this position.”

The retrospective, while focusing on the past, and including selections from Evans’s personal collection of vernacular art, also allows viewers to appreciate how photography, a slice out of time, relates to the present. In particular, his 1937 photographs showing people displaced by floods in the South are just as relevant today.

“That’s the power of art,” Mr. Chéroux said, “to address some historical questions, but to address them in the present time. To create a kind of effect that is both present and past, and I think this is something photography is really great at.”

But perhaps nowhere in the city has the trajectory of opioid addiction been as complex as in the Bronx, where overdose deaths were declining until a new surge began at the turn of the decade, and where more residents are lost to overdoses than anywhere else in the city.

A lot of “Raising Trump” is Ivana bragging that the children were never spoiled — unlike those Kardashians. There’s a lot about her glamorous wardrobe and triumphs as a C.E.O. in the family businesses. (“My version of helicopter parenting was to bring the kids to work with me in the Trump chopper.”)

And you just keep plowing on because you figure sooner or later she’s going to get to The Affair.

Finally, it’s 1989 in Aspen. A young woman comes up to Ivana and says: “I’m Marla and I love your husband. Do you?”

What followed was perhaps the biggest sex scandal in American history. O.K., I’m totally exaggerating. (Remember that whopper in the 19th century with Grover Cleveland’s illegitimate child?) But the Donald-Marla-Ivana story was unusual in that at the time, nobody involved in it was all that important. Trump was a celebrity real estate developer, but there were plenty of equally rich and glamorous figures in New York, many of them having adultery issues of their own.

The difference was that Trump pushed the story, calling his allies in the media with new tidbits or lines of defense. It was as if Grover Cleveland had press agents trying to make sure his side of the love-child scandal was in a headline every day.

You will not hear anything about that angle in Ivana’s book. In fact, once the affair comes center stage, you hardly hear anything about Donald at all. He seems to be a sort of passive bystander. (“After the showgirl got pregnant and had a daughter, Donald married her.”)

The villain of the book is “Marla freaking Maples” the “showgirl” who broke up her marriage and produced The New York Post’s all-time famous front-page headline: “Best Sex I’ve Ever Had.” If Marla had kidnapped Donald, thrown him in a trunk and driven him off to a shotgun wedding, she could not have been more evil.

Ivana’s eagerness to gloss over the sins of an ex who now happens to be president of the most powerful nation on the planet is hardly the worst issue of sexism the country has to discuss this week. But it’s still a useful reminder that Trump has gotten away with absolutely appalling behavior throughout his life, right down to his yelping “locker room talk” whenever people bring up that recording of him bragging about grabbing women’s private parts.

Toward the end of the book Trump is “kind enough to waive the $20,000 fee” when Ivana held her third marriage at Mar-a-Lago. The later husbands were pretty terrible, too. One of them had a large, thuggish son who spent one family gathering throttling — oh no! — Donald Jr.

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — I’m not sure whether it stems from a solving, constructing, or editing mind-set, but I’m always fascinated by the variety of “circled letter” themes in puzzles. Circles can highlight letters within a single entry that spell a word, whether they’re adjacent or spread out. At times, they can be arranged to form images the solver must identify. There have even been puzzles where the circles were used to bring attention to noncircled letters.

Thus, with nearly infinite theme possibilities of this type, it’s no surprise that Jacob Stulberg has come up with an interesting “circled letters” puzzle based on a fresh revealer. Let’s take a look:

Today’s Theme

Mr. Stulberg has made the revealer, THREE-RING CIRCUS, almost come to life: the grid contains three common circus performers arranged in a “ring” as indicated by the clusters of circled letters. When read clockwise, they spell out GLASS EATER, FIRE DANCER, and WIRE WALKER.

This is a very impressive feat. Not only did Mr. Stulberg have to find three circus performers large enough to form into rings, but each one had to be hidden within normal entries so that the surrounding fill could still be smooth.

Normally, when constructing a crossword, each letter has two constraints: it must work with both Across and Down entries. However, for a puzzle like this, the requirement of spelling out a circular phrase serves as a third constraint that makes filling the grid exponentially more difficult. Sure, we have tougher bits of fill like KER, LATH and ASSAI in the bottom-right corner alone ... but these are small prices to pay for such an intricate theme.

A local high school band in Jeffersonville was playing a thunderous welcome as he entered a large, partly built barn. Inside he was greeted by the festival’s mastermind: Eddie Adams, the Pulitzer Prize-winning war photographer.

“Everybody who was anybody was there and I didn’t even know they existed,” said Mr. Rasmussen, now the director of photography for digital and print media at ESPN. “I went to this small agricultural college in Utah and didn’t know anybody, but in less than a week I left there with four or five lifelong friends. Sometimes you spend your whole life seeking your community and for me that was the moment that I found it.”

Mr. Rasmussen will return to Jeffersonville this weekend for the 30th Eddie Adams Workshop, which has since become one of the most important stops for up-and-coming photojournalists.

Mr. Adams died in 2004, but the workshop continues under the aegis of his wife, Alyssa Adams, and the assistance of around 150 volunteers. Some things have changed since the first session — Kodak slide film gave way to digital imagery in the late 1990s and audio and video have been added. Some sponsors have fallen away as the industry has withered, and while tuition is still free, students pay $375 for lodging.

The workshop is structured much as it was 30 years ago, with 10 groups of 10 students managed by a well-known photographer as team leader, a photo editor and a producer. This year, all the teams are led by photographers who were once students in the workshop.

For Jimmy Colton, a well-traveled photo editor who will be attending his 27th consecutive session this week, the workshop is about family. He calls himself Uncle Jimmy, and considers all 2,700 students he has worked with to be his nieces and nephews. The barn is also a place of family ghosts for Mr. Colton, whose brother Jay, and father, Sandy, both volunteered as photo editors before their deaths.

The core values of the workshop continue to be “a level of ethics beyond reproach, having great concern for your subjects and treating everyone as you would like to be treated,” Mr. Colton said.

Mr. Adams purchased the 64-acre farm in Jeffersonville in 1976 intending to convert it into a center for photography. But progress on rebuilding the ramshackle structures was slow as assignment work kept him busy. It was after he met Alyssa in 1983 that the plans for a free, merit-based workshop came together. They married shortly after the first workshop.

“This workshop is not a ‘how to,’ it’s more inspirational and aspirational,” Ms. Adams said. “This is a place where you can let your hair down and experiment a little as a student.”

The workshop does not romanticize photojournalism, and it acknowledges the price many photojournalists have paid while covering conflict. An annual memorial service for photographers who have died during war recognizes friends of Mr. Adams who were killed in Vietnam, like Henri Huet and Larry Burrows, as well as more recent casualties like Chris Hondros, who attended the 1993 workshop. An annual Award is given to a student by the Chris Hondros Foundation.

Recognizing colleagues who have been killed emphasizes that “the truth matters, pictures matter, and you can make a difference with your pictures not just in war,” said Nancy Andrews, who attended the first workshop in 1988 and has volunteered as a photo editor and will be a team leader this year. She returns for the sense of community and generosity, she said.

“I’m actually improved when you, my colleague, or you, my student, make a great picture” said Ms. Andrews, who was a Washington Post staff photographer and director of photography at The Detroit Free Press. “It’s not like there are finite numbers of great pictures out there and you stole one of them so now I can’t get one. It elevates the profession and I might be better as a result.”

Admission to the workshop, for students and professionals with less than three years’ experience is through portfolios judged by a panel of photo editors.

Not being included can be a difficult blow.

Ruth Fremson was among those young photographers who did not make the cut in the late 1980s. She remembers the rejection well, though she has since been part of three Pulitzer Prize-winning teams as a staff photographer for The Associated Press and starting in 2000 at The New York Times. While it is a great way “to jump-start your career, it is not the only way,” she said.

She has been a team leader at the workshop the last two years and is returning this weekend as a kitchen volunteer to help prepare food for the students.

“It’s such a gift to be able to participate in it because the team leaders and volunteers get as much out of the workshop as the students,” she said. “I’ve had the benefit of many great mentors who have championed my career and this is a great place to pay it forward.”

FRIDAY PUZZLE — When you’ve had a busy or a tough week — a week where it feels as if your hair is on fire — your best bet is to find a distraction. Ideally, this distraction should be good for you (or at least not terribly harmful) and should allow you to focus hard on it so that you can temporarily displace thoughts about what kindled that hair fire to begin with.

My own go-to distractions are running, reading, cooking and knitting. When I really need to distract myself and focus down, I enjoy British-style cryptic crosswords. I’m sure you have your own distractions.

My point is, once the hair fire is extinguished and the smoke settles, you deserve a reward for making it through. The Venn diagram of “distractions from hair fires” and “rewards” probably overlaps quite a bit, but in my opinion, sitting down on a Friday with a lovely beverage and a Patrick Berry themeless crossword is one of the best ways to end the week. I put that firmly in the rewards circle.

Mr. Berry can bring some fresh entries to his grids and bring back entries that have not been seen for a while. The middle section — BARBARA JORDAN, SOCIAL STUDIES and ACCOUNT HOLDER — is O.K. in terms of liveliness, but those are all debuts, so bonus points there. What I really liked was the openness of the center, which gave Mr. Berry room to cross those center entries with ROBERT ALTMAN, METEOR SHOWERS and SENATOR ELECT.

Back Story

The controversy over football players kneeling during the U.S. national anthem rages on.

But an older patriotic ritual ran aground on geopolitical tensions.

Photo

That’s the Pledge of Allegiance, which was first recited in public schools on this day in 1892.

The pledge was written by Francis Bellamy, a Baptist minister and socialist, to be rolled out with a nationwide push to celebrate Columbus Day in schools. It was soon widely recognized.

Mr. Bellamy instructed that a salute be performed: right arm extended upward, with the palm twisting up at the first mention of the flag.

When fascist regimes emerged in Italy and Germany using extended-arm salutes, Bellamy’s began to fall from favor. As one author wrote, the “similarities in the salute had begun to attract comment as early as the mid-1930s.”

On Dec. 22, 1942, Congress amended the U.S. Flag Code to instruct that the pledge “be rendered by standing at attention facing the flag with the right hand over the heart” — the stance in use today.

Charles McDermid contributed reporting.

The workshop does not romanticize photojournalism, and it acknowledges the price many photojournalists have paid while covering conflict. An annual memorial service for photographers who have died during war recognizes friends of Mr. Adams who were killed in Vietnam, like Henri Huet and Larry Burrows, as well as more recent casualties like Chris Hondros, who attended the 1993 workshop. An annual Award is given to a student by the Chris Hondros Foundation.

Recognizing colleagues who have been killed emphasizes that “the truth matters, pictures matter, and you can make a difference with your pictures not just in war,” said Nancy Andrews, who attended the first workshop in 1988 and has volunteered as a photo editor and will be a team leader this year. She returns for the sense of community and generosity, she said.

“I’m actually improved when you, my colleague, or you, my student, make a great picture” said Ms. Andrews, who was a Washington Post staff photographer and director of photography at The Detroit Free Press. “It’s not like there are finite numbers of great pictures out there and you stole one of them so now I can’t get one. It elevates the profession and I might be better as a result.”

Admission to the workshop, for students and professionals with less than three years’ experience is through portfolios judged by a panel of photo editors.

Not being included can be a difficult blow.

Ruth Fremson was among those young photographers who did not make the cut in the late 1980s. She remembers the rejection well, though she has since been part of three Pulitzer Prize-winning teams as a staff photographer for The Associated Press and starting in 2000 at The New York Times. While it is a great way “to jump-start your career, it is not the only way,” she said.

She has been a team leader at the workshop the last two years and is returning this weekend as a kitchen volunteer to help prepare food for the students.

“It’s such a gift to be able to participate in it because the team leaders and volunteers get as much out of the workshop as the students,” she said. “I’ve had the benefit of many great mentors who have championed my career and this is a great place to pay it forward.”

“Mountain lions interact infrequently — in our study about once every 11 to 12 days during winter,” he said. More social animals like meerkats, wolves and chimpanzees interact consistently throughout the day. But that didn’t mean they were all loners.

“To document reciprocity among mountain lions, we needed to step back and assess behaviors over longer time spans,” he said. By taking the longer view, “we captured the patterns of behavior that have no doubt been occurring among mountain lions all along.”

Dr. Elbroch said he was compelled to perform the research after observing two female pumas share a carcass in 2012 in a forest near Grand Teton National Park. Though he had initially assumed the two animals were sisters, later study revealed them to be unrelated. “So many questions exploded in my head that I just had to pursue some answers,” Dr. Elbroch said.

In the current study, the puma communities were determined largely by the territorial boundaries of the males, said Dr. Elbroch. “Males acted like governors of fiefdoms, structuring how all mountain lions across the landscape interacted with each other,” he said.

Though pumas are found throughout the Americas, hunting and human development have reduced their footprint in North America, where they are now found mostly in Mexico, southern Florida and the Western United States. Though they are listed as an endangered or protected species in many areas, hunting is still allowed in many parts of the U.S.

If pumas are living in communities, it raises new questions about the impact that hunting, especially adult males, may have on the animals, said Dr. Elbroch.

The impact of climate change on the winds is uncertain, although some scientists think that global warming may at least be making the winds drier. “That is a pretty key parameter for fire risk,” said Alex Hall, a climate researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles.

The winds, known as Diablo winds in Northern California and Santa Ana winds further south, have their origin in the high desert of the Great Basin of Nevada and parts of Utah. High-pressure air that builds over that region flows toward lower-pressure air over California and the coast.

Along the way the air descends to lower elevations, which causes it to compress and become hotter and drier. The air picks up speed as it descends and funnels through canyons or across peaks that are lower than their neighbors.

“The wind is seeking the path of least resistance to lower pressure,” Dr. Hall said. “That tends to be where there are gaps in the topography.”

The result is hot, dry winds with speeds that can exceed 70 miles per hour. In the wildfires that have devastated parts of Northern California’s wine country since Sunday night, the highest gusts were recorded in Sonoma County, at 79 m.p.h.

The state got some respite from the winds on Tuesday, but they were expected to pick up again Wednesday and Thursday. Scientists said such variation is typical, as there is natural variability to large-scale climate patterns like high-pressure systems. If the high pressure over the Great Basin moves eastward, for example, the air will be less likely to flow westward, and that may allow cooler, gentler winds to move into California from offshore.",California Winds Are Fueling Fires.

No more D.C.!” Mr. Isabella insisted.","Before the end of the year, he plans to open a vast dining emporium at Tysons Galleria, a luxury mall in McLean, Va. His French restaurant Requin is scheduled to open this month at the Wharf, a $2.5 billion development on 24 acres along Washington’s long-neglected riverfront. The restaurant, surrounded by a sprawl of condominiums, stores and other eating spots, is the only detached, stand-alone restaurant on the site.

Requin, a modernist food church at the center of a fabricated village, is a metaphor of sorts for Mr. Isabella’s unique stature among Washington restaurateurs — a perch attained, in large part, through simple proliferation.

Photo

Mr. Isabella owes his culinary fecundity to smart location plays, and a large and loyal team of chefs, bartenders, construction managers and two Greek-American brothers who have been the spine of his most-replicated outpost, Kapnos Taverna. He commands a United Nations of cuisines: the down-home Italian food of his youth, Greek and Mediterranean cooking, coastal Mexican fare and even some ramen.

From the pizzas at Graffiato to the succulent chicken parm sandwiches at G to the bomba rices served in a hotel-dining-room-cum-souk at Arroz to the spit-roasted lamb at Kapnos, his menus have largely drawn enthusiasm from Washington critics and diners. Yes, there is a cookbook. And there is cross-marketing: You can buy a G sandwich at Graffiato, where you can also purchase a take-home pizza kit.

In many ways, Mr. Isabella is the very model of the modern major chef: His $30 million empire has put his food into airports, a baseball stadium, events with catering, lunchboxes delivered to office workers and his own take on a food hall, while he moves along, sharklike, with various versions of his sit-down restaurants.

This has taken him, as it has many other chefs, out of the kitchen. His knife set now comes out only at home.

Mr. Isabella also had the Spidey sense to settle into Washington, where breakneck growth and the attendant investor cash have all exploded in recent years. His work force of 600 employees will nearly double once his new places open.

“He succeeds by putting a lot of trust and responsibility in people he grooms and finds,” said Anna Spiegel, food editor of Washingtonian magazine.

“He isn’t front and center,” as if he were just a chef with a single restaurant, she said. “This isn’t the Mike show. There isn’t the illusion of that.”

She added, “It’s not always the most cutting-edge food, but it’s food that pushes the boundaries just enough while remaining comfortable for people.”

Mr. Isabella, 42, seems to spend each day checking on an existing restaurant, peeking at a behind-schedule construction site, meeting with a catering client. He zooms back and forth in his black Range Rover, dragging on a cigarette between stops and musing aloud about something that has to be done that isn’t being done but might be done, or not.

“I have so much in my head,” he said on a recent afternoon, lamenting the absence of his assistant, who sends emails simultaneously transcribing whatever pops out.

He grew up in New Jersey and studied at the now-closed Restaurant School of New York, and spent the early part of his career along the Acela corridor, working in fine dining in New York before heading to Philadelphia, where he cooked for, among others, the chef Marcus Samuelsson and the prolific restaurateur Stephen Starr.

After a brief stint in Atlanta, where Mr. Isabella learned about Greek flavors and techniques, he came to Washington in 2007 to work at Mr. Andrés’s eastern-Mediterranean restaurant Zaytinya. “We wanted to be closer to home but not in our hometowns,” he said, referring to New Jersey and Pennsylvania, where his wife, Stacy, was raised.

IN 2009, Mr. Isabella, then head chef at Zaytinya, met Mr. Colicchio at the home of the cookbook writer Joan Nathan, where he cooked a dinner in honor of President Obama’s first inauguration. (Mr. Colicchio had to perform the Heimlich maneuver on Ms. Nathan after an incident involving Persian shish kebab, but that’s another story.)

Mr. Isabella turned on his signature confidence, pressing the “Top Chef” judge to let him in. “I could already tell he had an outsized personality and was very ambitious,” Mr. Colicchio said.

When Mr. Isabella returned to Washington after the show, he continued for a while at Zaytinya, but in 2011 struck out on his own with Graffiato, an Italian start-up in Chinatown inspired by his grandmother’s cooking. “Mike has used the opportunity to make a good name for himself,” Mr. Andrés said. “Since I met Mike, he always wanted more.”

Mr. Isabella’s pace invites the pitfalls that have tripped up many before him: overextending oneself, losing control over quality.

Photo

“With anyone who grows as fast as he has, one has wonder how they do it, or if he can keep up,” said Marjorie Meek-Bradley, a “Top Chef” finalist who has worked with him in kitchens for decades, and once served as his chef de cuisine at Graffiato. (Another ”Top Chef” alumna, Jennifer Carroll, is the executive chef and a partner at the original Requin Brasserie in Fairfax, Va. — and, as “Top Chef” fans may remember, the target of one of Mr. Isabella’s infamous rants, after she outpaced him at opening oysters.)

So far, careful hiring and training have been his secret sauce, Mr. Isabella said. George and Nick Pagonis, the culinary and managerial backbones of the five various Kapnos restaurants, have been with Mr. Isabella since the beginning. Taha Ismail, his beverage director, has worked with him since their Zaytinya days.

“If you grow too big too fast you have to hire, hire, hire, and if you build too fast you dilute your brand,” Ms. Meek-Bradley said. “It becomes, ‘Oh, they are never in the kitchen, they have too much going on,’ when you don’t have the right people in place. Mike understands the need to bring in some strong teams. He is a good person to work for and rewards hard work.”

Chefs in Washington are a tight group, proud and at times defensive of a city that was long ignored as other cities’ restaurants and bars lapped up praise. (Recent years have brought critical acclaim — Washington was named America’s best restaurant city last year by Bon Appétit — and an influx of chefs, despite the lack of a large culinary school or training culture.)

Chefs here back one another up, when needed, with spare pots and pans; they cook together on the extensive charity circuit, and are happy to share excess tomatoes, the names of suppliers and advice.

“When I worked at Per Se in New York, no one was friends with the people at Jean-Georges, which was across the street,” Ms. Meek-Bradley said. “The thing I love about D.C. is there is this sense of camaraderie here and sense of pride.”

Mr. Isabella remains very much a part of that world, dining often with chef friends at home. Still, the scale of his enterprises sets him apart.

Although he long ago shed his bad-boy image, his name can sometimes prompt undefined unease among food professionals here, as if his high profile were a personal threat to the city’s nascent culinary status.

“Of course, people are going to be a little resentful or jealous,” Ms. Meek-Bradley said. “But that’s what happens when you are willing to take those calculated risks that a lot of us are not willing to do, or don’t do.”

The ultimate test of his ambitions may come at Isabella Eatery in the Tysons Galleria, which will pack nine different spaces into 41,000 square feet, served by one commissary kitchen. Flailing malls have looked to food to lift their businesses, and Mr. Isabella sold General Growth Properties, which owns the Galleria, on a one-stop solution.

In addition to a coffee bar and an ice cream parlor, the complex will serve the greatest hits of Mike Isabella: tacos, a raw bar and Mediterranean, Italian and Japanese offerings.

A cocktail bar will spill out into the traffic area of the mall floor, which retailers no doubt hope will fuel $2,000 handbag sales with ample manhattans and martinis. “His concepts have delicious food,” said Michael Schlow, a chef and restaurateur, “but he realizes that’s not the only way to be successful. It needs to be an experience.”

At a sushi tasting at Yona, one of his spots in Northern Virginia, Mr. Isabella plowed through giant plates of fish that were vying for a spot in its Tysons Galleria outpost.

“No ponzo sauce, too mainstream,” he said, waving off a slice of hamachi. A piece of fluke dressed up with shrimp paste he dismissed as “a little too cheffy.” A lobster roll drew an appreciative nod. Salmon nigiri with pea shoots and avocado and cucumber showed promise, he said, if the vegetables were cut smaller.

Mr. Isabella looked tired, and reflexively grabbed for his phone. Tacos were next. “It’s not always easy,” he said. “People think it’s fun. It’s very filling!”

So clearly, Isabella Eatery will be the end?

“Yes! No more D.C.!” Mr. Isabella insisted. “Well, maybe one more coffee shop.”

The fifth of six children, he was so determined to get to college that he was already budgeting for it as a high school student. (I reproduced his handwritten budget, which he still has, in a 2015 column.)

After successful stints in the paper-shredding and executive compensation industries, Mr. Ranzetta turned to student loan consulting when his older siblings started sending their own children to college and threw up their hands in confusion and despair when trying to borrow to pay for it.

His phone number was on his company website, and every time a tearful call came in, he asked what might have kept the problems from happening in the first place. Inevitably, it came down to people wishing they’d known at the beginning how large their loan payment was going to be relative to their monthly income.

Payback, and the financial literacy work Mr. Ranzetta has been doing for years (which he pays for out of his own savings), is his attempt to open students’ eyes.

Once he persuaded McKinney to help him, he began working with Jenny Nicholson, one of the creators of Spent. Her work on that project was informed by her own childhood, part of which she spent in Tennessee without running water or electricity.

When she entered the University of California, San Diego, she was the first person in her family to go to college. Nobody told her that when the student loan check lands, it can lead to false feelings of being flush with cash, given that a chunk of the money may be needed for months of living expenses. “I was richer, frankly, than I’d ever been in my life,” she said.

She avoided the temptation to spend it all, quickly paid back her loans and entered the social work field before landing in advertising. After the success of Spent, McKinney received lots of proposals from potential clients wanting them to recreate it for some other area of decision-making.

Payback, however, is the first project the firm has accepted like this. A big part of the reason, Ms. Nicholson said, is that the firm recognized that paying for college is not just about debt but also about investment. Every decision — from where you attend to what jobs and activities and classes and majors you choose while you are there — is about trade-offs. How much paid work is enough? How much socializing and spending on fun?

And so the game asks players to consider graduation gifts of cash, laptop purchases, meal plans, dorm supplies, books, hours of paid work, the Greek system, vacations and more. A rapid-fire class registration challenge has dire consequences if you don’t act fast enough.

All the while, you see a running total of your debt. But one of the cleverest things about the game is the constant, cumulative tabulation of focus (which paid work can reduce), connections (is an unpaid internship worth it?) and happiness. That last one comes from Ms. Nicholson’s personal experience, for she eventually realized that focus and happiness were sometimes counterpoints and she might have received a better return on her investment in college if she’d had more fun and more friends.

Veteran financial literacy educators and advocates welcome the additional tool, though some of them were underwhelmed by my notion of a grand, master class on paying for college. After all, not every high school student is college material, and many others are aiming for trade training or military service. Sometimes, all of these teenagers are in the same class, so the course work needs to apply to as many of them as possible.

Still, Brian Page, a high school teacher in Reading, Ohio, said he welcomed an additional teaching tool that is highly experiential. He should know, since he’s the educator I wrote about three years ago who takes his students on a yellow school bus tour of pawnshops and payday-lending stores to do math problems using those businesses’ terms and fine print. “It’s not just what you know,” he said. “It’s what you do with what you know.”

Mr. Page has done some consulting work for Mr. Ranzetta but did not work on Payback and reviewed it at my request. He said he especially liked the various ways that players could lose the game and not even complete college, while still accruing debt. That is the worst of all worlds, he noted, since they need to repay the loans but don’t end up with the sheepskin that will make it much easier to get a decent-paying job and thus afford the monthly payments.

There is one other hurdle that teachers may need to clear to be comfortable with using Payback in the classroom. Talking about paying for college inevitably leads to questions about which families have what, how much they’re willing to pay (if anything) and what teenagers even know about their family’s finances. Ms. Nicholson knew from her own experience as the poor kid in class that this could be a source of tension, so the game doesn’t ask for household income. Instead, it assumes a certain level of family contribution plus scholarships. Then, different shortages (that debt can fill) emerge, depending on the colleges a player chooses.

Still, teachers may quite reasonably fear a delicate dance around personal data when teaching about paying for college generally. “The potential teacher reluctance is with the social aspect, not with the topic,” said Laura Levine, the president and chief executive of the nonprofit group JumpStart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy.

With the right planning, however, educators should be able to sidestep revealing too much in front of students’ peers. Students may well have questions for the teacher after class, and Mr. Ranzetta hopes they bring the questions home, too. “My hope is that this is the beginning of a great discussion,” he said.

There is risk that any such game, with its winners and losers, may result in students not attending college or not borrowing enough to do so successfully. But Ms. Nicholson said she hoped that the elements of fun and connections baked into the game would have an entirely different effect.

“I’ll never get all the details right, and there is always going to be someone who asks if we thought about this or that or living in a cardboard box to save money,” she said. “But I hope everyone who plays will understand the concept that you don’t have to give up everything to succeed.”",A Game to Help Students Pay the Right Price for College,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/29/your-money/paying-for-college/payback-college-loans.html

“Otherwise, someone else is going to be putting a plan in place for you.”Clients of a firm like Wilmington Trust are wealthy and receive a higher level of attention from advisers.
But there are plenty of web-based services that aim to help anyone plan.
They “stressed to us children that life is never guaranteed and one should always plan for the future,” she said.
“For practicality and having no children, I recognized that at some point in my life, I will need help,” she said.","Another option is disability insurance, which is intended for healthy working-age people, who are more likely to become disabled than die.

Disability insurance is more expensive than life insurance, but these two planning solutions require comparatively little effort. Most people understand they should have both forms of insurance, though not everyone chooses to buy it.

The planning becomes more complex with the so-called softer issues: the questions to which there are multiple but sometimes conflicting answers. Who should be contacted if something goes wrong? How do I want my personal possessions divided? What are my thoughts about going into a nursing home? Do I want to be resuscitated if I go into cardiac arrest? Any thoughts on a funeral?

“The best way to plan for an event you can’t control is to put your own plan in place,” said Sharon Klein, president of the New York metropolitan region for Wilmington Trust. “Otherwise, someone else is going to be putting a plan in place for you.”

Clients of a firm like Wilmington Trust are wealthy and receive a higher level of attention from advisers. But there are plenty of web-based services that aim to help anyone plan.

Everplans is one site. It guides users through a list of documents and discussions that need to be considered: wills, insurance, a health care directive, passwords for email and social media accounts, funeral planning. But it also has sections for storing keepsakes like family recipes or for leaving instructions about pet care or how things work in the home.

“We want to help people think of the unexpected,” said Abby Schneiderman, co-founder and co-chief executive of Everplans. “It could be anything unexpected. Natural disaster, flood, fire, illness, a death — you don’t know. The idea is: Don’t wait until it’s too late.”

The service, which costs individuals $75 a year, prods users to do more. It offers a 10-minute “just in case” plan that asks people to put down as much information as they know from memory, Ms Schneiderman said.

“We want to be a one-stop shop, but we also try to get people to take it a piece at a time,” she said. For instance, the service sends out electronic reminders to prompt users to take one more step.

Final Roadmap is another such site. It was born out of a nurse’s frustration with families being unprepared for the decisions and logistical considerations that happen at the end of life.

Steve Byrne, a co-founder of Final Roadmap, said the website, which charges a one-time fee of $249, held legal and financial documents, instructions for death, and messages for loved ones.

“All of those notifications can prevent problems that supersede money problems,” he said. Without proper instructions, those decisions “can blow up and result in siblings not ever talking to each other.”

Wealthier people tend to rely on advisers who are privy to a raft of information to help them, especially when it comes to tax planning, which could become more urgent if President Trump’s proposal to repeal the estate and other transfer taxes is passed. Adam von Poblitz, head of Citi Private Bank’s North American trust division, said the repeal of a tax that took 40 percent of a couple’s assets above the current $11 million exemption would increase the need for creating a trust because more money would pass to heirs.

“You need trusts to protect the assets from creditors but also from the beneficiaries themselves,” he said. “That protection aspect doesn’t go away” if the estate tax is repealed.

Not planning for the expected can also cause unnecessary confusion and stress.

“There’s a growing emphasis placed on how do you want to live the end of your days,” said Rachel J. Sherman, vice president of client service at Market Street Trust Company, which began as the family office for the founders of Corning Glass Works. “It needs more attention. People don’t want to be a burden.”

Monette Booth, 73, who lives in the Virgin Islands, said she had learned from her mother and aunt to keep her affairs in order. They “stressed to us children that life is never guaranteed and one should always plan for the future,” she said.

After her husband, Peter, a retired Corning executive, died in 2011, she stepped up her planning to ensure that she could grow old where she wanted, that she would not burden her relatives and that her assets would eventually be disposed of as she wished.

“For practicality and having no children, I recognized that at some point in my life, I will need help,” she said. “It’s taken a load off my mind to have made the decision.”

Ms. Booth said she had become part of a “circle of friends” in which she and others shared information that someone would need if one of them became incapacitated.

She said the planning was not difficult to contemplate. “I thought it made a lot of sense,” she said. “Otherwise, one is being an ostrich and not paying attention. This is part of an inevitable process.”

Most people are not this pragmatic, let alone proactive and organized. One solution for affluent people is a revocable trust, which can be used as a repository for financial assets but also documents to guide the family.

Ms. Klein of Wilmington Trust said many clients had revocable trusts drafted so that they became irrevocable in the event of disability or death. She said they could then function as a more sophisticated power of attorney; they could also help avoid the probate process of a will that delays access to the assets.

Yet deciding what to do to prepare, for example, for the possibility of becoming incapacitated by illness is a test of managing expectations around the unexpected. Jeffrey Maurer, chief executive of Evercore Wealth Management, said he presented the case rationally.

“My major concern for clients, friends and family, for myself, is what is the likelihood, if one were a gambling person, that I’m going to outlive my current cognitive abilities?” he said.

The answer determines what protections people should put in place, if they can afford them.

Plans can have limits. Barry Sinrod, who retired early as a market researcher and went on to write several best-selling books, said he and his wife, Shelly, had thought they planned well in case one of them became incapacitated. They even had a provision for assisted suicide.

His wife learned in 2003 that she had Parkinson’s disease but managed well until she learned that she had dementia. By 2010, he said, she did not know him or their children. He looked for someone to assist his wife in dying but found there was no one who would do it, because by that point, she was not competent to appear before a judge.

She died in 2014. “I said, I don’t want this to happen to me,” said Mr. Sinrod, 75, of Delray Beach, Fla.

When he met his second wife, whom he married in January, he brought up his desire to die with dignity, he said.

“Now, I have this document that says my second wife will take me to the Netherlands to die if my kids won’t take me,” Mr. Sinrod said. “My kids don’t like the idea of this, but they understand.”

And they do because he has been so explicit in planning his wishes.",How to Plan for the Unforeseen,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/your-money/financial-planning-wealthy.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Good design needs self-confidence sewn into its seams, and part of that is an expectation that mistakes will be made — risk never comes without them — and that’s O.K. Designers can keep their jobs to design another day. Paradoxically, in an industry predicated on change, the more internal change, the worse.

Once upon a time snagging a top design post was seen as a plum achievement, and the presumption was long-term commitment. Tom Ford was at Gucci for a decade before finally walking away after a power struggle; so, too, his successor, Frida Giannini. Karl Lagerfeld has been at Chanel since 1983 and at Fendi since 1967. John Galliano was at Dior for 15 years before a personal implosion got him fired.

Sure, there was turmoil. Givenchy went through multiple designers between the departure of Hubert de Givenchy in 1995 and the appointment of Riccardo Tisci in 2005 (he stayed 12 years). And also at Céline, from 2005 until Phoebe Philo took over in 2008. But consistency was still seen as the status quo.

That all changed in 2015. Alexander Wang left Balenciaga in late July after just under three years; Raf Simons left Dior in October after just over three years (and Alber Elbaz was fired from Lanvin a week later); and Hedi Slimane departed Saint Laurent the following April, also after three years. It was as if a switch had been flipped. Everything started happening faster.

Alessandra Facchinetti left Tod’s in May 2016 after about three years. Justin O’Shea was fired from Brioni after six months. Fulvio Rigoni just left Ferragamo after a year of officially running the women’s ready-to-wear.

Every season there was a list of debuts. In the last round of shows there was one in New York, two in Milan and three in Paris. The season before that, there were two in New York and two in Milan. Before that, there were four in Paris and one in New York.

And, I admit, it was exciting. There was adrenaline involved. Who knew what would happen next? The roller coaster was kind of intoxicating. But when it wasn’t satisfied, gossip provided an easy fix.

There we were, watching a show — it was full of energetic, accomplished clothes — and someone leaned over and said, “I hear they want to get rid of him.” Aside another great runway, a friend announced, apropos of nothing: “That looks like a final collection to me.”

What she meant was: It looks like the show of a designer who has nothing to lose, and therefore willing to stake it all on a powerful statement. It’s a pretty sad state of affairs when that kind of clarity and daring is equated with departures.

WASHINGTON — The Trump administration announced on Thursday that it would withdraw from Unesco, the United Nations cultural organization, after years of America distancing itself because of what it called the group’s “anti-Israel bias.”

“This decision was not taken lightly,” according to a State Department statement on Thursday. Along with the anti-Israel bias, the department also cited “the need for fundamental reform” and “mounting arrears” at the organization.

While the United States withdrew from the group, the Trump administration said it wanted to continue to be engaged with Unesco to provide American perspective and expertise, but as a nonmember observer. The United States withdrawal goes into effect at the end of 2018.

Unesco, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization known for its designation of world heritage sites, is a global development agency with missions that include promoting sex education, literacy, clean water and equality for women.

The Obama administration cut off funding to Unesco in 2011 because the group admitted Palestinians as full members, which the United States saw as undercutting its influence in countries around the world. America lost its vote in the organization in 2013 because it ended its financial contributions.

10A: It’s midweek, so read those clues carefully. “It’s found by the radius” sounds like it might be a math question, but it’s not; what other kind of “radius” exists? The radius we’re looking for today is a bone in the forearm. It is parallel to the ulna, a fabulous piece of osteocrosswordese (Yes, I made that up).

15A: A clue like “Brought home” evokes the childhood habit some of us might have had for bringing home stray animals and begging our parents to let us keep them. Not me, of course. But some of us. In a midweek puzzle, however, tricks are afoot, and today the clue is referring to how much money you’ve EARNED.

30A: #TIL the word MANUMIT, and it’s very interesting. To manumit is not merely to SET FREE, but to set someone free from slavery. It’s derived from the Latin manus, or hand, and means to “set forth from one’s hand,” or release from control.

2D: I had REFILL before REFUEL.

26D: “Glam rock?” is some nifty misdirection. You were thinking of a bunch of longhaired, bespangled musicians in heavy eyeliner, weren’t you? Not today. Another type of glamorous rock would be a GEM.

Constructor Notes

I’m 20 years old, a junior at Brandeis University, majoring in Chemistry and American Studies. I started writing crosswords my freshman year of college. My school newspaper, the Justice, was using some very underwhelming syndicated crosswords, and I said to myself, “I could write better crosswords than that!” I couldn’t. At least, not at first. I still shudder to think of some of my very early crosswords. But, as I got more and more practice, I started to get decent at it. I continue to write a crossword for them each week. But when I write what I think is a really good puzzle, I send it off to The Times instead. This time, it seems Will agreed with me, and I got in. Not without a number of revisions beforehand, though. It’s a real honor to be in The New York Times for the first time, and I hope it won’t be the last! As for this puzzle’s construction, I don’t have all that much to say about it. The idea had been rattling around in my brain for a while before I got around to making it. I ended up brainstorming by thinking of all the spatial words I could muster, seeing which ones had phrases associated with them, and then seeing what I could come up with for words that fit those phrases. BENEATH ME was by far the answer I was most pleased with. I really learned a lot from the revision process, but I know I’ve got a lot left to learn about making crosswords.

Welcome to the party, Mr. Mahnken. I hope we get to see more from you soon, and 100 percent on your debut.

Signs of Rigidity

Our society is, in my opinion, well above average when it comes to rigidity compared to other Western democracies. We set rules and associated punishments for any wrongdoing we can predict.

You only have to look at driving signs in Sydney to see that. It takes a minute to read them. I think it might even be illegal to read them, such are the risks to your health and other road users’ health.

Who decides the rules, and who are the ‘risky’ subjects? You mentioned those of overseas cultures, but I would add Indigenous Australians and drug addicts to the mix. So often rules are made that make middle-class mums and dads feel safer and more assured, even though they and their families were rarely, if ever, affected by the activities the rules limit or outlaw.

— Ned Cooper

Larrikins United

I’m really surprised at your impression re. rule breakers versus rule followers. I break every rule under the sun, have done so all my life (I’m 66) and I think that pretty much all my peers do the same. So I guess it’s a matter of perception.

— Neil Bolton

Say No to Pregnancy

I had a two-month job as a visiting professor in the United States a couple of years back. The rules to get in for a non-American were astounding. As as woman of more than 70 years I had to insure myself against pregnancy, among other things, in order to be approved. I raised this as a patent absurdity and was told, don’t worry, it’s not discrimination, men have to get the same insurance.

The rule under no condition could be waived.

Personal Responsibility

I’m Australian and I’ve lived in Sydney for all 27 years of my life, though I like to think I am well traveled — don’t we all? I’m also a lawyer.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The reason Australians are sticklers for the rules, and the reason they are so hesitant to stray, is that they absolutely abhor the concept of personal responsibility in a way few other countries do.

If something goes wrong, it’s not the person’s fault. Rather, it’s that the regulatory framework for that arena of human behavior isn’t effective enough. More laws! Won’t someone please think of the children.

Freedom!

I was in the butterfly house at the Melbourne Zoo with my daughter a few months ago admiring the elegant little creatures as they landed on the arms and shoulders of visitors. The beautiful delicate wings so full of colour when all of a sudden an Indian man grabbed a butterfly by the wings and starting waving the poor creature in front of his elderly mother’s face.

Maybe she was blind and he was just trying to let her see it close up but before I knew it I was saying “NO, NO, you cannot do that. You will hurt the poor creature.” Of course they didn’t really understand English that well so just thought I was scared of the butterfly until I started waving my finger disapprovingly like a butterfly lover in distress.

Afterward I did feel really bad, I felt terrible for making someone feel bad when they were just appreciating nature’s wonders, especially a visitor. Maybe it was the closet zoologist in me, who completed the degree but never worked a day in the field, trying to do my bit for animal conservation.

I found myself being extra polite as we passed each other many more times in the tight confines of an overcrowded butterfly house, insisting the elderly mother go before me as we both approached the exit.

I think next time I’ll try to resist the impulse and leave it to natural selection; the butterfly did fly off unharmed of course.

Immigrants Seeking Guidance

I think your daughter was right.

You should have, with the greatest of courtesy, drawn their attention to the “no feeding” rule. If they had been reasonable people they would have been grateful to you for pointing it out.

Speaking as a long-term immigrant to Britain, I can say through personal experience that often it is not a case of (usually newly arrived) immigrants not following the rules. It’s a case of not knowing what the rules are: standing in a queue, not throwing litter out of a car, not interrupting while someone is speaking, remembering to top and tail requests with “please” and “thank you.”

It is not that we have some fundamental objection to doing (or not doing) these things: It’s more that often we don’t know what needs to be done. Somebody please tell us — we want to learn, and through learning save ourselves some embarrassment!

— Vani K. Borooah

Rules and Images

Another interesting quandary I have encountered in my career as a teacher is of migrant families requesting a school for a white Australian blue-eyed blonde teacher for their child over a “brown” teacher — it makes for a proud display of the class photo to relatives back home, signaling they have finally “arrived” in Australia and raising their prestige in society.

Would this classify as a hangover of colonization, discrimination or market forces in the independent education sector, where if you are paying exorbitant school fees you can bend the rules to get what you want?

— Ipshita Nair

Don’t Rock the Boat

In not calling someone out on breaking the rules, it’s because it’s much less hassle and it’s being “too serious” and the rule being broken is “harmless.”

It’s just bread. It’s just food. It’s not a big deal. It’s just a couple of kilometers over the limit, it’s just some paper with your name signed on it and a label of “married.”

The problem is, we don’t really draw a line.

That’s because we can’t help but want to fit into the way our society runs — the casual, hands-off, “nah, she’ll be right mate” approach to everything that is so deeply ingrained in our culture that we struggle to care enough to change anything for fear of being called out — not for breaking the rules, but for disturbing the peaceful, carefree status quo we’ve established.

In July, a few hours after being released from prison, he was arrested and sentenced to another month in jail. He is due in court again on Thursday, when he is likely to be offered a choice between a $250 fine he cannot afford and 30 days in jail.

Jailing Mr. Marsh costs the city $1,650 a month.

He is arrested so often, he says, because as soon as he is spotted by employees of Sumter’s businesses — the post office, fast-food restaurants and convenience stores — they call the police.

Police Chief Russell F. Roark III said his officers had little choice but to arrest Mr. Marsh.

“He scares customers, so we have to intervene,” Chief Roark said. “But we attempt to do other things than make arrests,” like issuing tickets.

A lawyer could go beyond Mr. Marsh’s guilt or innocence, by pressing for solutions like treatment instead of jail.

Mr. Marsh, who suffered a head injury as a teenager, has no one else to look out for him. He has long been out of touch with family members and says he has no friends.

His disability payments are disrupted every time he goes to jail, leaving him penniless on release. He is at the mercy of the South Carolina municipal courts, an idiosyncratic system in which police officers serve as prosecutors, judges are not required to have college degrees, and public defenders are often absent.

Tess Borden, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, said 139 of the state’s 212 municipal courts have no public defenders available.

The A.C.L.U. filed a federal class-action lawsuit on Thursday against the city of Beaufort and the town of Bluffton, saying they are violating defendants’ rights. They hope for a ruling that sets a statewide precedent that all jurisdictions must provide lawyers.

Municipal courts, which handle traffic violations and other low-level crimes, are optional for South Carolina cities, which can choose to rely on state courts to hear the cases.

“Under South Carolina law, municipalities that choose to establish their own courts have a duty to fund public defense,” Ms. Borden said. “Yet the majority of cities and towns flout this obligation, prosecuting poor people without spending a dime on their defense. The result is a grossly unconstitutional system in which lawyers are luxuries available only to those who can afford them.”

It is not clear what entity has the ultimate authority for the state’s municipal courts. Tonnya K. Kohn, administrator for the state Office of Court Administration, said that her office played no role in oversight of municipal courts and that the State Supreme Court was responsible.

But Daniel E. Shearouse, the Supreme Court’s clerk, said Wednesday that the Office of Court Administration — and not the Supreme Court — oversaw municipal court activities. Both Ms. Kohn and Mr. Shearouse declined to comment about defendants not being informed of their Constitutional rights.

In Beaufort, officials did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday, but in an email statement, Debbie Szpanka, a spokeswoman for Bluffton, said: “Bluffton municipal judges inform defendants who appear before the bench that he/she has a right to counsel and if he/she is unable to afford to hire a lawyer that a lawyer will be appointed.”

In the Sumter courtroom where Mr. Marsh has been found guilty dozens of times, judges on a recent day spent minutes on all but a few of the 85 cases involving traffic violations, disturbing the peace, or shoplifting.

“There has to be somebody who is trying to access the website,” said Ms. Hill, who is now a disability rights lawyer.
Imagine if you were trying to apply to school, and every college you went to check out refused to tell you how.”","“As more and more students are aware of their rights, and as websites have become so much of what universities now focus on, in their marketing materials for example, it’s not surprising to me that there will be an increase in these types of lawsuits,” said Arlene Kanter, director of the Disability Law and Policy Program at Syracuse University’s law school.

Whether the plaintiffs will prevail is unclear. The Americans With Disabilities Act, written in 1990, makes no mention of the internet. The Department of Justice, which enforces the act, has issued guidelines about web accessibility but no formal regulations on how to achieve it — and they seem unlikely to materialize soon, after the federal government in July placed web regulations on its list of “inactive” agenda items.

The question has largely been left to judges, who have ruled both for and against disabled plaintiffs. In March, for example, a California judge dismissed a blind man’s suit against Domino’s Pizza, because the chain offered an option to order by telephone. But in June, a Florida judge ruled that the grocery store Winn-Dixie had to offer the same accommodations on its website as it did in stores, and in July, a judge in Brooklyn ruled that the website for Blick Art Materials had to be readily accessible to a blind man.

The result of these conflicting rulings is a legal gray area ripe for, depending on your viewpoint, either significant civil rights advances or exploitation by lawyers looking to make a quick buck through settlements, said Tom Stebbins, executive director of the Lawsuit Reform Alliance of New York.

Absent clarity from the federal government, Mr. Stebbins said, some lawyers have filed identical lawsuits against multiple businesses or universities in the hopes of reaching a settlement with one or more of them.

“These are cut-and-paste lawsuits,” he said. “You just have these lawyers taking advantage of a good-intentioned law to make money.”

The lawsuits filed in New York on behalf of Mr. Delacruz are “all similar,” his lawyer, Dana Gottlieb, wrote in an email. They state that Mr. Delacruz tried to find information, such as tuition costs, school location and academic calendars, but was unable gain access because the websites were not readable by his screen-reading software.

Ms. Gottlieb, of the Gottlieb & Associates law firm, declined to comment further or to say anything more about her client, including his age and what he hoped to study. But Jeffrey M. Gottlieb, the founder of the firm, wrote in an email that private lawyers had to step in to promote web accessibility, given the lack of government action.

“When ‘lawsuit-reform’ organizations protest about the nature of these lawsuits, they are only advancing the interests of wealthy corporate interests that fund them,” he wrote. “If they were truly reform oriented, they would advocate for more government intervention to protect the rights of those who most need protection.”

Most of the colleges did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for Iona College said that it “takes all matters of discrimination seriously and strives to ensure that everyone is treated fairly and appropriately. The college will continue to ensure everyone has equitable access to its facilities including its website.”

Some disability rights advocates, acknowledging the charges that some lawyers are just looking to cash in, have distanced themselves from the suits.

“We do not condone just filing a blizzard of lawsuits in order to get settlements. That’s not solving the underlying problem,” said Chris Danielson, public relations director for the National Federation of the Blind. His organization has pushed instead for clearer federal guidelines on web accessibility.

Critics have also pointed to the Berkeley case as evidence that the strategy can go awry. After the Department of Justice found the university to be in violation of the disabilities act, Berkeley responded by taking down more than 20,000 publicly accessible videos and audio files, a move administrators had called “unenviable” but unavoidable given the “extremely expensive” cost of compliance.

But disability rights lawyers and advocates said the concerns were misplaced.

“There will always be lawyers who are eager to find business,” Ms. Kanter, the Syracuse professor, said. “But if the university is vulnerable, and if they have violated the law by not providing accessibility, that’s what the role of lawyers should be, which is to monitor such complaints.”

Eve Hill, a former deputy assistant attorney general in the civil rights division of the Department of Justice, said lawyers could not manufacture plaintiffs out of thin air. Ultimately, she said, lawyers represent people who — regardless of their lawyers’ motivations — are being barred from accessing public services.

“There has to be somebody who is trying to access the website,” said Ms. Hill, who is now a disability rights lawyer. “Imagine if you were that person.

Details of the deal reached in Cairo were initially unclear. Several western news organizations were excluded from a brief signing ceremony at the headquarters of Egypt’s General Intelligence Service, which brokered talks on Tuesday and Wednesday that led to the agreement.

Ahmed Yousef, an adviser to the Hamas leader, Ismail Haniya, said the two sides had agreed to joint control over the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, a key lifeline for Gaza’s residents.

Reacting to news reports, citing Fatah officials, that Fatah would take control of the crossing, he said, “We will discuss the possibility of allowing the presidential guard from the West Bank to control it.”

Mr. Yousef said the two sides would convene committees to integrate their ministries into a reconciliation government. One major challenge, he said, would be to reduce the bloated, 200,000-strong Palestinian civil service, which he estimated needs to be cut by as much as 20 per cent.

But, he added, the two sides had not discussed a number of critical questions, including a joint strategy for dealing with Israel, the conduct of any future elections and, crucially, the state of the Hamas military wing.

When leaders from Hamas and Fatah signed a similar deal in 2011, Mr. Abbas said, “We have turned the black page of division forever.” But the deal quickly foundered amid opposition from Israel, which denounced it as a “victory for terrorism.”

This time, a broad Arab coalition is backing the deal, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

“This merger is going to cost a lot of money, and they will help us financially,” said Mr. Yousef, referring to Emirati and Saudi support for the deal. “The Egyptians also clearly got a green light from America.

WASHINGTON — An American woman and her family who have been held hostage by militants in Afghanistan for five years have been freed, ending a case that has long frustrated diplomats and F.B.I. agents involved in trying to secure their release, according to people familiar with the situation.

The family was in Pakistan early Thursday, and the White House was preparing to release a statement once they are safely in American hands, according to people who described their status on condition of anonymity because the details have not yet been made public.

Media in the region reported that the Pakistani military had initially taken custody of the family.

The family was freed with the help of another country, the person said, but it was not clear what if any concessions were made to the Haqqani network, the Taliban faction that had seized Caitlan Coleman, 31, and her Canadian husband, Josh Boyle, 34.

Eminem is far from the first rapper to trash the current American president.

The most explicit attack came in August from the California rapper YG. His song “FDT” — the title is an abbreviation whose meaning can’t be spelled out in a family newspaper — calls President Trump a “cancer” and insists: “He can’t make decisions for this country, he gon’ crash us/No, we can’t be a slave for him.”

Kendrick Lamar took aim at the president in March in “The Heart Part 4,” with the lyrics:

Donald Trump is a chump, know how we feel, punk

Tell ’em that God comin’

And Russia need a replay button, y’all up to somethin’

Electorial votes look like memorial votes

But America’s truth ain’t ignorin’ the votes.

And the young rapper Aminé used his television debut on “The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon” back in November to deliver these lines: “9/11, a day that we never forgettin’/11/9, a day that we always regrettin’.”

Then there are scores of implicitly anti-Trump songs that take on issues like police brutality and economic inequality, like Chance the Rapper’s latest, which he performed late last month on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert”: “And y’all just keep clappin’ and keep happen/Like Flint got clean water and y’all don’t got teen daughters and black friends and gay cousins, y’all just gon’ say nothin’.”

Yet Eminem’s “The Storm,” a scathing four-minute attack on the “kamikaze that will probably cause a nuclear holocaust,” which he debuted at the BET Awards on Tuesday night, has already overshadowed all of these previous anti-Trump musical efforts. It’s made major news headlines. It’s already garnered 8.7 million views on YouTube. And there have been some two million tweets about the performance, with praise pouring in from stars including LeBron James and Ellen DeGeneres.

What gives? Some see the overwhelming reaction to the rap as evidence of racism — that Eminem’s song is generating such overwhelming attention because he’s white. There’s no denying that the key difference between the rappers mentioned above and Eminem isn’t that he’s the only one from Detroit.

Last month, China’s legislature approved a law prohibiting disrespect of the anthem, barring the song’s use in commercials or parodies, and outlining punishments for people who do not “stand with respect” and “maintain a dignified bearing” when it is played.

Weekslong street protests in Hong Kong known as the Umbrella Movement ended three years ago without the government ceding any ground on expanding residents’ say in local elections.

But that spirit of protest has been revived in the stadium jeers, which appear to have started two years ago. Hong Kong played China in World Cup qualifiers twice in 2015, and those matches took on an added political dimension coming a year after the street protests.

With a population of seven million, Hong Kong is a minnow in the ocean of international soccer. But the city has a long history with the sport and, with the help of some foreign-born players, often punches above its weight.

China has a huge population to draw from and its teams have been successful in several sports. But its men’s soccer teams have routinely struggled in international competition.

In 1985, Hong Kong beat China, 2-1, in Beijing to eliminate the team from qualifying for the following year’s World Cup, setting off a riot. In the 2015 World Cup qualifiers, Hong Kong tied China twice. To add to the insult, the home fans booed the Chinese national anthem before the game in Hong Kong.

The world governing body for soccer, FIFA, fined the Hong Kong Football Association for fans booing during one of the China matches and also during a 2015 World Cup qualifier against Qatar. The city’s football association has called on fans to behave, and stewards make vain attempts to encourage hard-core supporters to keep quiet during the national anthem.

The anthem, “March of the Volunteers,” was a poem set to music in 1935, and it became popular as a call for resistance against Japan. Its lyricist, Tian Han, died in prison during the Cultural Revolution in 1968.

The anthem law went into effect on Oct. 1. But Hong Kong, a former British colony, maintains a semiautonomous existence that allows it to keep its own economic and legal systems. So Hong Kong will need to enact its own version of the law, which it has yet to do.

Thus far, Hong Kong fans are unbowed.

“We do it spontaneously because we don’t think we are part of the P.R.C.,” said Sanho Chung, 24, who was at Tuesday’s game, using an abbreviation for the People’s Republic of China. “We are different.”

Rights activists and pro-democracy politicians are concerned that the law could be used to suppress free expression.

“I think it will be quite problematic to apply it,” said Dennis Kwok, a member of Hong Kong’s Legislative Council.

He noted that the mainland law allows the police to place violators in administrative detention for 15 days. That method of incarceration, which bypasses the courts, does not exist in Hong Kong.

And the idea of showing reverence will be hard to define, he said. “What does it mean to be respectful of the national anthem?” Mr. Kwok said. “That concept of law is simply unheard-of here, to have to stand in silence. I think we need to be very careful defining what is respectful and what is not.”

Hong Kong officials say the national anthem law is a routine matter that should not prompt concern among residents.

“I just want to reiterate that, rightly so, we are living in a more politicized environment, but we need not adopt this very politicized stance in considering and dealing with any matter,” Carrie Lam, the chief executive of Hong Kong, said in August. “This particular matter of national anthem legislation does not carry any particular scope for politicization.”

In recent months, the authorities have taken several steps to punish people for protesting or for calling for Hong Kong’s independence. Now, even symbolic protests are being suppressed.

Last month, a lawmaker was fined 5,000 Hong Kong dollars, about $640, for turning upside down several small Hong Kong and Chinese flags on desks in the Legislative Council chamber.

And the appearance of posters calling for Hong Kong independence on a wall run by the student union at the Chinese University of Hong Kong set off debate between local and mainland students. School administrators and Hong Kong officials called the signs illegal, but legal scholars said it was questionable whether colonial-era sedition laws could be enforced.

“The introduction of a national anthem law is coming at a time when people who oppose symbols of the Chinese government and symbols of the Chinese Communist Party have reason to fear they could end up behind bars,” said Maya Wang, senior China researcher for Human Rights Watch. “This could have a chilling effect on freedom of expression.”

On Tuesday at the match against Malaysia, Mr. Chung, clad in a red home jersey, stood with fellow fans during halftime. He said the national anthem law would not stop him from booing.

“It does dampen our freedom of speech, forcing us to respect something,” he said. “I worry, but I will still practice my rights.

Many people fear the companies will be able to translate their hold on key digital platforms into wholesale ownership of adjacent industries that depend on those platforms, giving them wider economic and social power.

The entertainment industry is a good place to assess those claims because in different ways, the Five have spent years building platforms for the distribution of art, culture and media. Facebook runs the news; Google’s YouTube has videos and music; Microsoft’s Xbox has games; Amazon runs books, movies and TV (and, through its web-hosting service, AWS, hosts much else, including Netflix); and Apple has pretty much of the same, plus all those apps.

Yet in entertainment, we also see the limits of their efforts to push into new territory. Though their technologies have altered nearly everything about how we buy and experience popular culture, the Five themselves have not been the greatest beneficiaries of the changes.

They are pouring money into entertainment, but they have been cornered by nimbler start-ups like Netflix and Spotify. Amazon has struggled to make a hit show, while Apple’s plans for original TV are perpetually around the corner. (It has now struck a deal to revive “Amazing Stories,” the 1980s Steven Spielberg series; there’s no word on when it will air.) All of the Five have labored to create some killer position in the tumultuous new marketplaces their platforms have enabled.

Several times in conversations with people in Hollywood, I heard the tech people referred to as “dumb money” — the sort of outsiders (in the past, they came from oil, then from finance) who parade through town looking to call the shots. One Hollywood executive who has worked often with tech companies told me: “I wouldn’t say we’ve looked at them with fear, no.”

The Five’s struggles in entertainment, if they persist, suggest that they can be as clueless about the changes wrought by technology as the rest of us — that they do not quite understand, and haven’t yet begun to master, how to translate their technological power into wider cultural power.

Not long ago, this story looked a lot more open-and-shut. With the iPod and iTunes, Apple acquired dominance over a music industry that was struggling to respond to the digital age. Amazon eclipsed Barnes & Noble as the biggest boogeyman of the indie bookstore; for years, it fought bruising battles with the publishing industry over sales contracts that publishers said were too onerous. Through YouTube, Google gained control over not just funny cat videos, but also the modern replacement for radio. (People watch a lot of music videos on YouTube.) And Facebook has become the world’s most popular source of news, a position that has consumed its leaders over much of the last year.

There’s no doubt that technology has upended the economics of modern cultural businesses. In a recent polemic, “Move Fast and Break Things,” Jonathan Taplin, the director emeritus of the Annenberg Innovation Lab at the University of Southern California (and a former rock band manager and movie producer), points out that musicians could once make a decent living off their royalty checks.

Digital technology has now completely undercut that business. YouTube has made every song available online, and even though many artists are paid a cut of the ads placed on YouTube (the company said it paid out $1 billion last year), the money is nothing close to what artists got from selling records.

Mr. Taplin sees what has happened in music as a harbinger for much of the rest of culture. “The rise of the digital giants is directly connected to the fall of the creative industries in our country,” he wrote.

But there is another side to the story. As I’ve argued before, while musicians have had to find new sources of revenue, the rise of online subscriptions and a new consumer willingness to pay have led to an explosion of new cultural voices.

Meanwhile, some earlier doomsaying has not come true: Indie bookstores and print books are making a comeback, while publishers are enjoying record profits. And the tech giants’ eagerness to create entertainment marketplaces has led to a bonanza for some artists. To compete for new members, Apple, Tidal and other streaming services are paying out lavish bonuses; Apple paid Chance the Rapper $500,000 for two weeks of exclusive access to his latest album.

The tech-industry money train is making its biggest hauls in Hollywood. “There are so many new markets for talent and writers to go to, and the creators here love that,” said Marty Kaplan, a professor of entertainment, media and society at the U.S.C. Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. “Instead of having seven buyers for your idea, there are now more like 20 — and that makes everybody happy.”

This story may sound puzzling. The tech giants are the most sophisticated media companies in the world, so why, after prying open their wallets, have they struggled to capture Hollywood?

It’s because technology is not all that matters. The Five acquired their power by mastering the tech industry. They achieved dominance in a field that’s won with information, data and precision.

But even though they now control valuable platforms, as they move to areas that require them to stretch their skills they are finding that they won’t be able to roll in and take over. Several people in Hollywood told me that many of the Five just didn’t seem to “get” the movie and TV business. They had brought Northern California’s tech ideas to Southern California’s entertainment party, and did not understand the value of imagination, talent and subjective inspiration.

This myopia is part of a pattern that will repeat itself often in this series. You see it in how Facebook got caught off guard by how it was used during the election, or in YouTube’s surprise that some of its biggest stars were pushing hateful ideas on its platform.

The tech giants have upended much of society, but even they have difficulty understanding and navigating the chaos of the new platforms they have built.

Speaking in Mexico on Tuesday, the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Thomas J. Donohue, said the negotiations had “reached a critical moment. And the chamber has had no choice but ring the alarm bells.”

“Let me be forceful and direct,” he said. “There are several poison pill proposals still on the table that could doom the entire deal.”

The potential demise of the trade deal prompted supportive messages from labor unions, including the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the United Steelworkers, as well as some Democrats.

“Any trade proposal that makes multinational corporations nervous is a good sign that it’s moving in the right direction for workers,” said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio.

If the deal does fall apart, the United States, Canada and Mexico would revert to average tariffs that are relatively low — just a few percent in most cases. But several agricultural products would face much higher duties. American farmers would see a 25 percent tariff on shipments of beef, 45 percent on turkey and some dairy products, and 75 percent on chicken, potatoes and high fructose corn syrup sent to Mexico.

For months, some of the most powerful business leaders in the country, and the lobbies and political figures that represent them, had hoped that the president’s strong wording was more a negotiating tactic than a real threat and that he would ultimately go along with their agenda of modernization. Nafta is nearly a quarter-century old, and people across the political spectrum say it should be updated for the 21st century while preserving the open trading system that has linked the North American economy.

The pact has allowed industries to reorganize their supply chains around the continent to take advantage of the three countries’ differing resources and strengths, lifting the continent’s economies and more than tripling America’s trade with Canada and Mexico since its inception. Economists contend that many workers have benefited from these changes in the form of higher wages and employment, but many workers have lost their jobs as manufacturing plants relocated to Mexico or Canada, making Nafta a target of labor unions, many Democrats and a few industries.

But most business leaders had hoped that the president, whose Nafta criticism has been unrelenting, would be content to oversee tweaks to modernize the agreement, and then call it a political transformation.

It sometimes looked as if that might be the case. The appointment of Robert Lighthizer as United States trade representative, who pledged in his confirmation hearing to “do no harm” to Nafta, reassured many on Capitol Hill, where Mr. Lighthizer had long served in aide roles. And when the administration released its negotiating goals in July for the deal, they echoed many priorities of previous administrations.

But now, eight weeks into trade talks that were originally supposed to conclude by year’s end, the administration continues to push for concessions that the business community warns would essentially undermine the pact, and which few observers believe Canada and Mexico could agree to politically.

“Everyone knows that much of what is being proposed in key areas are, in effect, non-starters, which begs the question as to what, exactly, the administration is trying to achieve,” Michael Camuñez, a former assistant secretary of commerce under President Barack Obama, wrote in an email. It’s not unreasonable to think that by accommodating the president’s most extreme positions, American negotiators are “simply giving Trump cover to do what he really wants: withdraw from the agreement,” he said.

Phil Levy, a trade adviser for the George W. Bush administration, said the president was most likely looking for a pretext to kill Nafta.

“Find me the last trade agreement that U.S. passed with the chamber in opposition,” Mr. Levy said. “You don’t have a chance. It’s hard enough with the U.S. Chamber in favor.”

The most controversial of the administration’s proposals, floated by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, would incorporate a sunset clause in the deal, causing Nafta to automatically expire unless all three countries voted periodically to continue it. That provision has drawn swift condemnation from the chamber and other industry groups like the National Association of Manufacturers, which say that it would instill so much uncertainty in the future of Nafta that it would basically nullify the trade agreement.

Another contentious push by the United States centers on changing Nafta’s rules governing how much of a product needs to be made in North America in order to enjoy tariff-free trade between the countries. The United States is pushing for higher levels, including a requirement to make 85 percent of the value of automobiles and auto parts in North America, up from 62.5 percent currently, and an additional requirement for 50 percent of the value to come from the United States.

That has pitted some of the world’s biggest auto companies against the Trump administration. Industry representatives say such high and complex barriers could deter companies from manufacturing in the United States altogether.

The administration has also proposed limits on the number of federal government contracts that Mexican and Canadian companies can win, as well as significant changes to how disputes are resolved under Nafta.

Business groups say they are firmly opposed to an American push to curtail a provision called investor-state dispute settlement, which allows companies to sue Canada, Mexico and the United States for unfair treatment under Nafta. Meanwhile, Canada has said that it will not consider dispensing with another provision, Nafta’s Chapter 19, which allows countries to challenge each other’s anti-dumping and countervailing duty decisions before an independent panel.

In his remarks Tuesday, Mr. Donohue called the administration’s proposed changes to these provisions “unnecessary and unacceptable.”

Mr. Donohue’s remarks followed a sharp exchange of words between the Chamber of Commerce, the country’s most powerful business lobby, and the Trump administration on Friday.

John Murphy, senior vice president of international policy for the chamber, said the administration’s proposals had “no identifiable constituency backing them” and had sparked “a remarkable degree of unity in their rejection.” He added that business leaders had perhaps never been at odds with an administration over a trade negotiation on so many fronts.

Hours later, the administration fired back.

“The president has been clear that Nafta has been a disaster for many Americans, and achieving his objectives requires substantial change,” said Emily Davis, a spokeswoman for the trade representative. “These changes of course will be opposed by entrenched Washington lobbyists and trade associations. We have always understood that draining the swamp would be controversial in Washington.”

Mr. Trump is known for taking a tough negotiating stance, and analysts said the administration might view its ambitious opening requests as a way to gain more leverage in the Nafta negotiations.

But Mr. Murphy and others in the business community cautioned that such an approach would probably be ill-fated. In both Canada and Mexico, Mr. Trump is unpopular, and caving to his demands could have devastating consequences for local politicians. Mexican government officials have repeatedly said they would not negotiate with a gun to the head.

“There’s an old adage in negotiations, never take a hostage you wouldn’t shoot,” Mr. Murphy said.",Trump’s Tough Talk on Nafta Raises Prospects of Pact’s Demise,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/business/economy/nafta-trump.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

The deposits are near or under lakes and rivers that stream directly into the Boundary Waters.
The jobs may be seasonal or not pay as well as mining jobs; on the other hand, they are not as backbreaking and they foster a local creative class.","Now, mining supporters, among them Representative Rick Nolan, a Democrat who represents Ely’s district in Congress, are trying to undo the moratorium. The battle is being fought on both moral and economic grounds. Mining advocates stress the hundreds of tangible construction and mining jobs this copper-nickel operation could create in the coming decades. Boundary Waters activists argue that the very presence of mining — its disruption of this area’s natural character, not to mention the specter of pollution — could hamper the region’s “amenity-based” development in a multitude of tangible and intangible ways, from destroying property values to stripping away jobs that feed off this area’s natural beauty.

In the land of iron and water, opposition to copper-nickel mining is more than just a protect-the-wilderness stance; it also reflects a deeper desire to change the area’s character, from hardscrabble mining region to tourist destination that prioritizes protecting the wilderness over creating more mining jobs. Central to the debate between the two camps is a philosophical question: What is the right kind of economy for a place like the Boundary Waters?

For as far back as he can trace it, Dan Forsman’s family has lived here, where iron meets water. His great-great-grandfather migrated from Finland in the 1890s and homesteaded on a 474-acre lake. His great-grandfather, Emil Forsman, worked in the mines before opening a longtime Ely watering hole, Forsman’s Tavern. Emil’s son worked as a maintenance foreman in the crusher at an Ely mine. In 1947, Emil’s eldest grandchild was born above Forsman’s Tavern. That boy, Mike, grew up in Ely, worked for a canoe outfitter for $1.25 an hour, volunteered to join the Marines in the 1960s and worked in the mines for 34 years. His youngest son was Dan. Dan grew up in awe of the giant machines that his mechanic father worked to fix. When he turned 20, after training at a two-year community college to become a heavy-equipment mechanic, he got a job at the same mine as his father.

At 4:40 a.m. on a chilly late-spring morning, I pulled up to Dan Forsman’s house to drive with him to work. The diesel engine of his 2002 Chevy Silverado pickup was already growling. He had gotten up 12 minutes earlier, thrown on torn jeans, a T-shirt and a camouflage hunting jacket and packed a lunch: turkey and American cheese on white bread, a banana and a Little Debbie Cosmic Brownie. The 29-year-old tugged down on a cap that advertised the brand of nitrous oxide he uses to soup up car engines. A block away, he steered past his father’s house and the garage where he learned to tinker. His prized car is a 1979 Chevy Camaro; he can get it up to nearly 150 miles per hour on a nearby drag strip.

Forsman drove up the hill of Ely’s business district. Some people call this a mining town, others a tourist town, but East Sheridan Street shows it to be both. There’s the grilled-cheese shop frequented by tourists and the grocery store that stocks the hot smoked bologna local residents swear by. There are liquor stores that boycotted a local brewery after the brewery publicly sided with clean-water advocates, but down the street is a stylish new wine bar serving that same beer. More than a dozen local canoe outfitters that organize trips into the Boundary Waters are based here. Neighboring storefronts display yard signs: “We support mining. Mining supports us.”

“There are two Elys, two different realities, different visions,” Tom Coombe, the editor of The Ely Echo and a fourth-generation Elyite, told me.

As Forsman’s truck rumbled to the top of the hill, we passed a two-story building that used to be Forsman’s Tavern. Now it’s occupied by Piragis Northwoods Company, a successful canoe outfitter and outdoor store. Steve Piragis has run this shop a decade longer than Dan Forsman has been alive, but Forsman’s family still considers Piragis an outsider — a “packsacker,” the local term for people who moved here for wilderness instead of mining.

Past the city limits and into the heart of Minnesota’s Iron Range, fog lifted over white pine trees. A ring-necked pheasant strutted alongside Wolf Creek Pass. As Forsman parked in the same lot his father used to park in — 52 minutes door to door — steam poured from four chimneys.

Forsman is proud of his part in this 360-employee mining enterprise. He’s proud that his labor makes something tangible: Huge chunks of rock become tiny bits of rock, which are ground and baked into half-inch pellets containing 67.5 percent iron, which leave this processing plant on the rails at a rate of 8,500 tons a day. The pellets are loaded onto ships in Duluth, where they float along Lake Superior to the other Great Lakes. At the bottom tip of Lake Michigan, just east of Chicago, tons of these pellets are fed into the largest blast furnace in the Western Hemisphere and smelted into steel, eventually becoming cars or trucks or household appliances or plate steel for ships and armored vehicles.

Up a flight of metal stairs, Forsman entered the locker room, put on his blue coveralls and laced up his steel-toed boots. Everything in his workplace seems improbably enormous. The mining trucks, with their 12-foot-tall tires, can haul 240 tons of rock from the open-pit mines into the processing facility. Miles away, off a gravel road as wide as a six-lane highway, 280,000 pounds of explosives had been loaded into 132 16-inch-diameter holes in a mining pit — it was blast day. The explosions would shake the earth, breaking up rock for the processing facility. The pit looked like a gray moonscape.

“To make money, you have to make something that wasn’t there,” Forsman told me. “You dig it up or you grow it. Without those things, you’re just making nothing. Without the basic minerals to make a phone, you can’t make an app for the phone. Because there’s nothing there.”

Forsman says he loves and wants to protect the Boundary Waters. He also believes copper mining and clean water can coexist. Then again, the mine that Forsman works in is a taconite mine, not the type of copper-nickel mine that environmentalists decry as a threat to this watershed. But what matters most to Forsman is the need for jobs in this hollowed-out region. Ely’s population has shrunk 30 percent since 1980; school enrollment is a third of what it was in the late 1960s. “If they stop this new mine, what’s the draw to be up here if there’s no jobs?” Also, he notes, those who oppose new mining jobs — “elitists” and “hypocrites,” Forsman calls them — benefit from the same metals that blue-collar workers like him produce. “People don’t understand where things come from anymore,” he said.

When Forsman refers to these “people,” he’s often referring to one person in particular. Her name is Becky Rom, and she is the head of the Campaign to Save the Boundary Waters. What makes him most angry is Rom’s condescension, her moral certainty: “The way she comes off, her attitude and way of doing this, it’s part of the problem.”

“Danny Forsman drives to the mine in his truck, comes home and watches TV, and he doesn’t know this world exists,” says Becky Rom, a 68-year-old lawyer who returned to her childhood home after retirement and now leads the environmental campaign. One afternoon this spring, I stood on a dock with Rom and her husband, Reid Carron, as they lowered a canoe into the South Kawishiwi River. Rom dangled her feet over the water, which was a couple miles of portages, rivers and rapids from the southwestern border of the Boundary Waters. Chokecherry and juneberry trees were in bloom. Sometimes Rom sees moose, otters, timber wolves or black bears. Today a blue jay hopped along the shore near where a beaver had built a lodge of alder limbs. Rom guessed newborn beavers were inside.

Rom has an energy that can be difficult to keep up with, whether she’s channeling it into hourlong soliloquies about the history of the Boundary Waters or a breakneck march into the wilderness. Rom slid into the canoe, her husband in back and me in the middle. The water beneath us was nearly black, tannin-stained, jarringly cold. A few years ago, an environmental group cited the South Kawishiwi as one of America’s 10 most endangered rivers because of the possibility that Twin Metals would begin mining for copper-nickel nearby.

Rom has become the most prominent foe of copper-nickel mining near the Boundary Waters. She makes frequent lobbying visits to St. Paul and Washington to drum up support from administrative and elected officials. Her group commissions studies and opinion polls; she takes part in public debates. But even the miners who hate her most wouldn’t dare call her a packsacker. Rom’s family has lived in Ely as long as the Forsmans. Her grandfather, Caspar Rom, emigrated from Slovenia in the 1890s. In December 1917, three weeks after his ninth child was born, Caspar Rom was leaning over an ore car when a cave-in crushed his head. That newborn son was Bill Rom, Becky’s father. He hunted and fished with his brothers to help his mother put food on the table. In 1946, he opened Canoe Country Outfitters, soon one of the most successful outfitters around. Three years later, Becky was born.

Her father became a leader in the fight for the federal Wilderness Act, whose passage in 1964 helped create federally designated wilderness areas. During the battles over the tightening of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness regulations in the 1970s, Bill Rom became a symbol among local residents, who for generations had enjoyed this land with few restrictions, of environmentalism run amok. Under new rules, airplanes were banned, which meant no more flying seaplanes into remote lakes. Resorts were torn down. Motorboat use was limited. Resentful local residents harassed Rom. In 1975, logging trucks blockaded his business on two of the busiest weekends of the year. Snowmobiles buzzed around his house at night to keep the Roms from sleeping. Becky’s brother camped inside the family business with their dog and a gun. Eventually, Rom sold his business rather than endure protests from people he grew up with.

But his cause left a lasting imprint on his daughter. After Rom and her husband, Reid Carron, retired from the largest law firm in the Twin Cities — she was a commercial real estate lawyer, he a management labor lawyer — they moved north in 2012 to a modern log cabin they had built on land her father bought decades before on Burntside Lake. Today a copy of the 1964 Wilderness Act signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson hangs on Rom’s bedroom wall.

Rom maneuvered the canoe toward the other side of the river. Docks jutted into the water, evidence of homes hidden in the trees. She lifted her paddle and gestured toward some white pines: “This would be all mines,” she said. “The noise, the lights, the dust, it would be everywhere.” A woodpecker pounded its beak into a tree. A smallmouth bass hunting mayflies broke the river’s surface.

The edge of the Boundary Waters is several miles from three mineral deposits that Twin Metals hopes to develop and just a half-mile from a fourth one. The deposits are near or under lakes and rivers that stream directly into the Boundary Waters. Acid mine drainage could potentially flow past 30 resorts, outfitters and campgrounds, as well as hundreds of homes, before reaching the Boundary Waters at Fall Lake. From there, water enters Basswood Lake, a popular fishery that straddles the Canadian border, then Canada’s Quetico Provincial Park and then Voyageurs National Park and Rainy Lake. All told, polluted water could theoretically affect up to 2.3 million acres of American and Canadian public lands, according to a peer-reviewed study published in the Journal of Hydrology. Pollution could harm fish, wild rice and property values. (This sounds alarmist to those who support underground copper-nickel mining near Ely; the multiyear process of planning the mine and clearing it with regulators would, they believe, set up ample safeguards against pollution.)

Rom and her husband climbed out of the canoe. Back in town, they pointed out thriving enterprises. One family company makes outerwear, which nicely complements the family’s other business, a lodge that runs winter dogsledding trips. An outfit called Crapola makes cranberry-apple granola. An art gallery displayed prints from a nature photographer. A fancy new restaurant, a spa, a gift shop that also sells saunas, a renovated historic theater looking for a tenant — Rom regards all these small businesses as evidence that the future here will not replicate the mining past. The jobs may be seasonal or not pay as well as mining jobs; on the other hand, they are not as backbreaking and they foster a local creative class. Last year, National Geographic Adventure ranked Ely as one of the world’s nine best outdoor towns, citing its proximity to vast public lands. Only one other American community — Moab, Utah, near Arches and Canyonlands national parks — made the list.","In Northern Minnesota, Two Economies Square Off: Mining vs. Wilderness",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/magazine/in-northern-minnesota-two-economies-square-off-mining-vs-wilderness.html

Bookstores will return shopworn books or those damaged in shipping under the category of “hurt books.” The publisher sells these books as used books. Online bookstores may buy them in bulk, sort through them, and resell as “new” the least damaged through Amazon.

Publishers sell books to international wholesalers at large discounts on a non-returnable basis. By contract these books must be sold abroad, but wholesalers could quietly dump these books in the American market through a third-party seller on Amazon, cheating the publisher.

Print-on-demand has created a new unscrupulous enterprise, that of counterfeiting books. These books look perfect; there is no way for the customer to tell they are illegal.

And finally, a number of review copies are sent out free to media outlets. They are not supposed to be sold. Some book sellers apparently have standing arrangements with magazine conglomerates and television networks to bulk purchase all the review copies they receive, which they could presumably then sell on Amazon. While this isn’t strictly illegal, it is unethical — and terribly unfair to authors and publishers.

These third-party sellers may not always be selling “new” books, according to Amazon’s own published definitions on its website, which, in part, read:

“New: A brand-new, unused, unread copy in perfect condition. The dust cover and original protective wrapping, if any, is intact.”

“Used — Like New: Dust cover is intact, with no nicks or tears. Spine has no signs of creasing. Pages are clean and not marred by notes or folds of any kind.”

In many of these sales, the author gets zilch, or close to zilch. And, according to the Independent Book Publishers Association, which has been conducting its own research into the issue by purchasing books on Amazon, the customer is sometimes sold a used book under false pretenses.

Publishers and authors, deprived of income and royalties, have long worried about this gray market. Amazon, to its credit, quickly tightened up its definition of a “new” book, to the one cited above. These definitions make clear that remainders are not regarded as “new” books, and the company insists that it follows a strict policy as to what qualifies.

“Only new books are eligible to be featured in the U.S. Books New Buy Box and be the ‘primary offer’ on a book’s detail page, whether offered from third party sellers or Amazon,” a company spokersperson said. “We move quickly to address any violations. These recent changes mean that our U.S. online bookstore now works like the rest of Amazon.com, where third party sellers compete with Amazon for the sale of new items.”

The Authors Guild has urged publishers to keep better track of remainders, overstocks and excess-discount sales, and some publishers have responded. But the cost of policing the market, marking and tracking books, and suing malefactors has proved daunting. Remainder overstock sales bring some revenue for publishers, but the authors receive little to no royalties.

Amazon, in its drive to take over the book market, has made a change that, at least inadvertently, can mislead its own customers and be hurtful to authors. The Amazon action comes at a time when authors are struggling more than ever to make a living in the harsh economics of the digital marketplace. Amazon’s policy will help undermine authors’ incomes even further if it directs customers to “new” books for which the author receives no royalty.

Comments posted online by buyers of everything from camera equipment to fountain pens suggest that Amazon’s third-party sellers sometimes operate in a broadly gray area, failing to disclose provenance before a sale. Only after buyers try to repair broken items do they learn warranties aren’t honored because the goods are gray.

Amazon does what it can to rein in bad actors but it is at the top of a slippery slope in turning over its main buy button for new books to third-party sellers.

“They say that every girl who is empowered impacts at least 250 people in her community,” Ms. Sinclair said.","Having spent 15 years photographing child marriages around the world, Stephanie Sinclair is uniquely positioned to understand its lasting impact on communities and, especially, on the girls who were forced to wed against their will. “You can’t expect individuals who have been through significant abuse to just act normal as soon as they get out of that situation,” she said. “They need to be nurtured, to be given the time and the tools to heal.”

With this in mind, Ms. Sinclair last year started the Tehani Photo Workshop — named after an 8-year-old Yemeni bride — in partnership with the Samburu Girls Foundation. The Kenyan organization, led by Josephine Kulea, focuses on educating girls rescued from child marriage, female genital mutilation and beading, a tradition where girls adorned with red beads have to serve the needs of an older male relative.

“Research shows that when girls are empowered and have strong connections outside of the family, they have a better chance of protecting themselves and their future,” Ms. Sinclair said. Looking at her own career, she felt that photography could be a vehicle to help these girls. “The independence that comes with a such a career, the knowledge you acquire through meeting other people, and the freedom the camera gives you to express yourself can’t be underplayed,” she said. “Instinctively, I knew that a photo workshop could nurture the girls in a unique way.”

Twice now, a dozen or so 11- to 16-year-olds gathered at the Ngari Hill Eco-Lodge for five days to talk about images and the place of women in society. Ms. Sinclair shares her long-term project, which helps the participants understand that it’s a global issue affecting one girl every two seconds; that it’s the result of women not being valued as they should; and that what they’d been through is not their fault. She also introduces basic photographic concepts using examples of work done by or on strong African women. The goal is to inspire them while also teaching them photo skills before they pair off with another participant and are joined by a student-mentor from the previous workshop to make pictures in the surrounding hills.

“A lot of the photographs they’ve taken speak to the different moments in their lives,” Ms. Sinclair said. “Many, this year, even re-enacted what happened to them. We didn’t tell them to do this.” In one, Jackline holds out her beaded necklace while dressed in her school uniform, an effort to demonstrate how beading interrupts education. In another, Nachaki leans against a branch off the ground. “I was worried they’d fall when I first saw them climbing, but then they told me how, when they fled their marriage and hid in the forest, they’d sleep in trees to protect themselves from the animals in the wild,” Ms. Sinclair recalled.

Others hint at the bonds developing among the girls, like in the picture of Linnet and Eunice laughing in their room, or Susan and Silvana walking arm in arm, as well as in the portraits they’ve made of each other. Only when sitter and photographer are in sync do you get images that capture both vulnerability and strength.

The workshop culminates in a community exhibition and presentation where they speak about what matters most to them. Both times, Ms. Sinclair said, they felt compelled to share what they’d been through, how it affected them, why girls’ lives matter, and why they should have the same opportunities as boys. In short, how “girls can do anything,” a line they often repeated in their remarks. The message resonated powerfully with those in attendance. Not only did it come from those who lived through the ordeal, but also from community members, female relatives, and young women who speak the same language and share the same cultural background.

“They say that every girl who is empowered impacts at least 250 people in her community,” Ms. Sinclair said. “Though we’ve only had 22 students so far, slowly those number add up.”

She hopes to hold more workshops, in Kenya and elsewhere, as long as her not-for-profit “Too Young to Wed” continues receiving the financing and logistical support to do its work without taking any shortcuts.

“You want these workshops to be intimate, because therapy isn’t a mass process,” she said. “It’s not just the act of photography that helps; it’s bringing together girls who have all experienced a similar type of trauma for what really is a retreat, a time to be nurtured, to grow, and to build community.”

Readers who are just starting to solve ask two questions when there is a rebus in a puzzle: They ask if they are supposed to be warned that a rebus exists in the puzzle (No, that’s part of the fun of solving) and they ask how in tarnation they are supposed to put more than one letter in a square if they are solving electronically. I’ll get to that in a minute, but first I’d like to show you what a rebus in a crossword looks like.

A rebus can be a letter, number or symbol that represents a word, but in many crosswords, the rebus will be a word or group of letters that need to be written inside a single square, like this puzzle by Elizabeth Long from December 1, 2011, where the word JACK was the rebus element.

Monarch and Ryanair, along with rivals like easyJet, Eurowings, Jet2 and Wizz Air, brought service to well-trodden destinations like Paris or the beaches of Portugal, as well as far-flung corners of the Continent like Lappeenranta, Finland, or Varna, Bulgaria.

Travelers’ expectations of low prices have pushed the more traditional carriers to offer budget options, under which passengers pay for extras like food and checked luggage that previously would have been included.

“Passengers have had a really good run for a long time with incredibly cheap tickets,” said Andrew Charlton, managing director of Aviation Advocacy, a consultancy. But, he added, “Europe’s got too many airlines.”

The shakeout, along with other issues, has made for some tough travel in Europe.

More than 100,000 passengers were stranded when Monarch collapsed into bankruptcy this month, forcing the British government to charter planes to get its citizens home. It was Britain’s largest repatriation in peace time.

Air Berlin, another low-cost airline, filed for insolvency in August. Alitalia, the Italian flag carrier, filed for bankruptcy in May. Ryanair had to cancel thousands of flights in recent weeks because of staffing problems, including strikes in France that forced Ryanair and other airlines to cancel flights this week. About 75,000 passengers on British Airways were affected by cancellations caused by a technical failure in May.

Damian Karykowski, who had to rebook flights to New York for him and his fiancée after Air Berlin collapsed, said they had been among the fortunate ones.

“For some people it’s a dream to come from Europe to the U.S.,” he said. “We had the possibility to buy new tickets on our own, but I can’t imagine what would happen if someone had their flight canceled when he’s at the airport already or the day before.”

The falling away of poorly performing airlines can be a positive: weeding out weaker, inefficient carriers, and portending much-needed consolidation.

The United States has already been through a similar shake-up through mergers and takeovers. American Airlines purchased T.W.A. in 2001; Delta Air Lines linked with Northwest Airlines in 2008; United Airlines joined with Continental Airlines in 2010; and American and US Airways merged in 2013.

The six largest airline groups in the United States now make up about 80 percent of flights in and out of the country, according to Jonathan Wober, chief financial analyst at CAPA Centre for Aviation, a research company. By contrast, the six largest in Europe have less than 50 percent of seats, he said.

“The stronger, better-run airlines whose business models are better adapted are growing and getting stronger,” said Mr. Wober. “The smaller, weaker ones are disappearing.”

Other long-term challenges stalk the industry, not least Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union. An aviation agreement currently in place allows European airlines to fly between airports in the region. But “Brexit” has put that agreement in doubt, creating an additional layer of uncertainty for carriers.

“Low-cost carriers and network carriers enjoy huge flexibility because of E.U. membership and liberal aviation agreements,” said Andrew Lobbenberg, an analyst at HSBC. “Once the U.K. drops out, the U.K. has no access — that needs to be negotiated. Will that be liberal, illiberal, friendly, unfriendly? We don’t know.”

Although some airlines are dropping out in Europe, consumers are expected to benefit from the competitive market for some time. Rivals could buy up the assets of failed carriers and still run the routes on budget prices.

“The low-cost airlines have got such a big presence in Europe and they stimulated markets that didn’t exist,” Mr. Wober said. “You can’t turn the clock back on that.”

As the consolidation game plays out, a global focus will be important for European players. Carriers could focus on linking up with long-haul routes as they try to tap into faster growing travel markets outside the Continent.

Norwegian Air Shuttle has already started to edge into this market with budget long-haul flights to the United States and to Singapore. Some tickets from New York to Dublin in December, for example, were available at $139. The low-cost Spanish airline Vueling is partnered with other major European airlines like British Airways, Aer Lingus, Iberia through the International Airlines Group.

“Intra-European travel will not be the growth target,” Daniel Röska, an analyst at the research firm Sanford C. Bernstein, said. “Global scale is important.”

Ticket prices, too, will remain crucial.

Ryanair has seen its stock price fall since the cancellations, but kept its profit guidance unchanged and even began offering sale prices, saying that it was confident there would be no further disruptions.

“When they’ve worked this through, next summer they’re going to be offering the cheapest flights around Europe and passengers are going to take those flights,” Mr. Charlton of Aviation Advocacy said. “Passengers will come back to Ryanair if they’ve got cheap flights.”

That will be of little comfort to Ms. Vyhnakova who, thanks to Monarch’s struggles, landed in Birmingham faced with chaos — not the ideal start to the relaxing vacation she had imagined.

“There was no info at the airport, there was no one to ask,” she said. She finally arrived in Gran Canaria with a simple wish: “I hope nothing else gets canceled for me.”",Passengers Suffer as Crowded Field Puts Pressure on Europe’s Airlines,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/business/europe-airlines-delays.html

Intel said its intent “was to convey the performance capabilities of our processors through the visual metaphor of a sprinter,” but acknowledged, “Unfortunately, our execution did not deliver our intended message and in fact proved to be insensitive and insulting.”

Dove, May 2011

In 2011, Dove was criticized for another ad: this one showing three women standing side by side, each with lighter skin than the woman next to her. Behind them were signs reading “before” and “after”; the “before” sign, positioned behind an African-American woman, showed cracked skin, while the “after” sign, behind a white woman, showed smooth skin.

Popchips, May 2012

Popchips drew fire in 2012 for an ad in which Ashton Kutcher played several characters — including a Bollywood producer named Raj, complete with brownface and an Indian accent.

Popchips initially urged viewers to watch the ad in the humorous “spirit it was intended.” Later, its chief executive, Keith Belling, said in a statement: “Our team worked hard to create a lighthearted parody featuring a variety of characters that was meant to provide a few laughs. We did not intend to offend anyone. I take full responsibility and apologize to anyone we offended.”

In a 2016 commercial for the Chinese company Qiaobi’s laundry detergent, an Asian woman shoves a detergent pod into a black man’s mouth and puts him in a washing machine, from which he emerges as a light-skinned Asian.

A spokeswoman for Qiaobi, Xu Chunyan, was unapologetic. “We did this for some sensational effect,” she said at the time. “If we just show laundry like all the other advertisements, ours will not stand out.”

In April, the skin care company Nivea released a deodorant ad that read, “White is purity.” White supremacists on the internet took note, with one 4chan user writing, “Nivea has chosen our side.”

But, like Dove, Nivea had offended before.

The broad debate over President Trump’s fitness for the difficult and demanding office he holds has recently been reframed in a more pointed and urgent way: Does he understand, and can he responsibly manage, the most destructive nuclear arsenal on earth?

The question arises for several reasons. He has threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea. He has reportedly pressed for a massive buildup in the American nuclear arsenal, which already contains too many — 4,000 — warheads. And soon he will decide whether to sustain or set a course to possibly unravel the immensely important Iran nuclear deal.

Doubts about his competency were reinforced this week by Senator Bob Corker, who charged that Mr. Trump was treating his office like “a reality show” with reckless threats that could set the nation “on the path to World War III.” Mr. Corker, a Republican from Tennessee, says he is relying on Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and John Kelly, the White House chief of staff, to help “separate our country from chaos.” That is a searing indictment, and Mr. Corker is no garden-variety legislator; as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he is a respected, and largely responsible, voice on national security issues.

Mr. Trump’s policy pronouncements during the campaign betrayed either profound ignorance or dangerous nonchalance: At one point he wondered why America had nuclear weapons if it didn’t use them; at another he suggested that Japan and South Korea, which have long lived under the American security umbrella, should develop their own nuclear weapons. But nothing he said has been quite as unsettling as his recent tweetstorms about North Korea, his warnings of “fire and fury” and his quip about “the calm before the storm.”",Mr. Trump Alone Can Order a Nuclear Strike.

He has written three pages a day ever since he started writing.
“I write more easily, more comfortably, with less anxiety if I’ve got my various magic bits on the table,” he said.
There is special paper, too: “I started ‘His Dark Materials’ on the sort of paper you could get 30 years ago, A4, narrow-lined, with two holes.","The books are often interpreted by literary critics as one long argument against the destructive power of organized religion. (To Pullman’s delight, his trilogy came in second in a 2008 list issued by the American Library Association of books that people have tried to have banned, primarily, in its case, because of its “religious viewpoint.”) But their ambition is more optimistic. In a lecture called “The Republic of Heaven,” from the forthcoming essay collection “Dæmon Voices,” he spoke of the challenge “to reclaim a vision of heaven from the wreck of religion; to realize that our human nature demands meaning and joy ... to accept that this meaning and joy will involve a passionate love of the physical world.”

C.S. Lewis (“a paranoid bigot,” according to Pullman) provided anti-inspiration. Pullman could never bear the heavy Christian moralizing in “Narnia,” but he objected most of all to Lewis’s censorious judgment of his own characters, such as Susan, the second oldest of the Pevensie children, who is excluded from Narnia after indulging in “nylons and lipstick and invitations.” In Pullman’s world, the children are allowed to grow up. Lyra is the heroine, but she is also a child hitting puberty, falling in love for the first time, discovering her sexual self.

The books have been published in more than 40 languages, sold nearly 18 million copies and spawned a radio play, a two-part National Theater production, a Hollywood movie and a new BBC adaptation. In 2002, they achieved the presumed impossible and outsold Harry Potter in Britain. And now, after 17 years, Lyra is back. “La Belle Sauvage,” the first volume of Pullman’s next trilogy, “The Book of Dust,” will be published on Oct. 19.

The period before publication is a skittish time, particularly when readers’ expectations have had nearly two decades to ferment. When I visited him at his home in September, Pullman said he wasn’t exactly nervous, “but I just don’t know what the reaction will be.” His reputation seems unassailable. Letters can reach him — like the one fixed to his fridge — addressed to “Philip Pullman, Famous Author, Oxford.” He has won shelves of awards, including the 2005 Astrid Lindgren Memorial Prize, the world’s most lucrative prize for children’s literature, worth more than $600,000. “He’s the giant among us all,” the fellow children’s author Michael Morpurgo, author of “War Horse,” told me. “The range and depth of his imagination and of his learning certainly make him the Tolkien of our day, there’s no question about that.” But Pullman can, at times, betray a surprising lack of self-assurance. That morning, he said, he listened to John le Carré talking on the radio and thought, “Gosh, compared to him, I’m just a child.”

The publication date of “La Belle Sauvage” is, by chance, Pullman’s 71st birthday. “I’ve felt 80 or 90 the last few years,” he said, sitting in his preferred love seat in his living room, surrounded by collapsing piles of books and his ukulele collection. “At the moment, I feel, oh, oh ... ” He paused. “I feel 68.” Pullman’s dry, understated tone makes the jokes almost undetectable, but that he’s able to joke at all is progress. Two years ago, when I first visited him in Oxford, he was suffering the effects of complications from a prostate operation. He was in near-constant pain and exhausted — at times only able to sleep in 15-minute bursts — and he wore the gray, spent expression of someone used to enduring something awful in silence. Earlier this year, another operation fixed the problem. Now he looked transformed. His skin had rediscovered color, his hair had turned from pencil gray to brilliant white and stood out from his head as if he’d just been mildly electroshocked. If he had a beard, he would pass for Father Christmas.

There had been another recent transformation: A ponytail that used to lurk around the nape of Pullman’s neck was severed by Judith, his wife of 47 years, minutes after he wrote the last sentence of the second volume of “The Book of Dust.” “It was like Samson,” he said. “I had to not cut my hair while I was writing or else it would have all gone wrong. It was horrible.” He meant the ponytail. And then, eagerly, “Do you want to see it?” He jumped up from his chair and rummaged through stacks of papers on his dinner table. (Pullman’s home — an old farmhouse just outside Oxford — is wallpapered with literature and stuffed with ornaments and pictures, the kind of place where it’s not always easy to see the floor.) Then he pulled out a small plastic bag in which lay the hair, tied with a gold-edged purple ribbon. “It looks a bit like a shaving brush,” he said.

Every day from roughly 10 until 1, Pullman sits at his desk in a monkish study at the top of the house and produces three pages, longhand. He has written three pages a day ever since he started writing. Habit, he is fond of saying, has written far more books than talent. The ritual is sacred. As is the space. “Nobody’s photographed this, and nobody will ever photograph this,” he told me, both fierce and faintly amused by the severity of his own rule. “I’m superstitious about that, very superstitious about that.”

Arranged on the desk are various objects of mystical significance. “I write more easily, more comfortably, with less anxiety if I’ve got my various magic bits on the table,” he said. The magic bits consist of a piece of scientific apparatus used in the search for dark matter, a magnifying glass and his “special pen.” Pullman has three special pens — Montblanc ballpoints — one in his study, one in his bag and one on the table downstairs for letter writing and signing books that people bring to his door (“which sometimes happens”). There is special paper, too: “I started ‘His Dark Materials’ on the sort of paper you could get 30 years ago, A4, narrow-lined, with two holes. Then they started making paper with four holes, and I discovered I couldn’t write on that.” He acknowledged with a brief apologetic glance the lunacy of this statement. “This is what I did that’s even more bonkers. I had to finish ‘The Amber Spyglass,’ and I could only get four-hole paper, so I got some four-hole paper and some of those little white stickers and solemnly put them over the holes.” Eventually, he found a Canadian supplier selling his preferred, two-holed paper. “I’ve got enough for 10,000 years, I think.”

Pullman likes to inhabit such contradictions: a man who doesn’t believe in God but does believe in magic. One of his favorite books is “The Secret Commonwealth,” by a 17th-century Scottish minister, Robert Kirk, that explores life beyond empirical reach. Fairies, witches, ghosts. Does he really believe in these things? “When I’m writing about them, yes,” he said. “It’s not naïve, but the sort of answer it requires is one of the Keats type. The negative-capability type. Both believing and not believing. Skeptical about everything but credulous about everything, too.” He gets the kind of kick out of unreality that could be dismissed as childlike if it hadn’t molded his imagination. “I like the irrational, I like ghosts,” he said. “They help me to write.”",Philip Pullman Returns to His Fantasy World,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/magazine/philip-pullman-returns-to-his-fantasy-world.html

The fact that it included a wide assortment of suggestions in a borough not named Manhattan was impressive enough, compared to the other apps I tested, but the recommendations themselves were also spot on.

Cool Cousin

This app scored points for originality as well as its practicality, and is perfect for travelers who don’t have any cool cousins of their own.

Cool Cousin gives you access to contributors in 40 large cities around the world. Each “cousin” has a profile, with name, age, photo, occupation and a lot more information. The idea is to add those to your network who seem to have similar tastes to your own. After each add, the cousin’s recommendations are added to your map and broken down into eight different categories, such as food, coffee, night life and outdoors.

The app seems geared toward younger travelers — it feels like a cross between Facebook, Tinder and Foursquare — and most of the cousins themselves have an appropriately hipster look. For New York, this leads to a higher concentration of recommendations below 14th Street in Manhattan and several in Brooklyn (very few in Queens), and heavy in the food and night life areas.

But the app itself is easy to figure out, and the map includes the option to download and use offline (for free). No matter where you are, just hit the location arrow to see what’s nearby.

The recommendations themselves are solid and are written casually — think Yelp, minus the negativity. I added 26 of 55 available cousins in New York and was impressed with what was revealed, including free public gardens and lesser-known art galleries, as well as a wide variety of intriguing bars and restaurants.

Your new cousins will even message you through the app to say hello, and you have the option of writing them back to ask for more tips. You will also get a push notification every time you receive a new message, which you can turn off by adjusting your settings. After asking two of my paired cousins, I received additional restaurant recommendations.

The recommendations are detailed yet concise, giving an excellent general overview and a “special tip” for each location. For example, at the Brazilian restaurant Beco in Brooklyn, Kelly advises: “Come early because the restaurant’s seating space is limited. CA$H ONLY.”

Weekslong street protests in Hong Kong known as the Umbrella Movement ended three years ago without the government ceding any ground on expanding residents’ say in local elections.

But that spirit of protest has been revived in the stadium jeers, which appear to have started two years ago. Hong Kong played China in World Cup qualifiers twice in 2015, and those matches took on an added political dimension coming a year after the street protests.

With a population of seven million, Hong Kong is a minnow in the ocean of international soccer. But the city has a long history with the sport and, with the help of some foreign-born players, often punches above its weight.

China has a huge population to draw from and its teams have been successful in several sports. But its men’s soccer teams have routinely struggled in international competition.

In 1985, Hong Kong beat China, 2-1, in Beijing to eliminate the team from qualifying for the following year’s World Cup, setting off a riot. In the 2015 World Cup qualifiers, Hong Kong tied China twice. To add to the insult, the home fans booed the Chinese national anthem before the game in Hong Kong.

The world governing body for soccer, FIFA, fined the Hong Kong Football Association for fans booing during one of the China matches and also during a 2015 World Cup qualifier against Qatar. The city’s football association has called on fans to behave, and stewards make vain attempts to encourage hard-core supporters to keep quiet during the national anthem.

The anthem, “March of the Volunteers,” was a poem set to music in 1935, and it became popular as a call for resistance against Japan. Its lyricist, Tian Han, died in prison during the Cultural Revolution in 1968.

The anthem law went into effect on Oct. 1. But Hong Kong, a former British colony, maintains a semiautonomous existence that allows it to keep its own economic and legal systems. So Hong Kong will need to enact its own version of the law, which it has yet to do.

“We do it spontaneously because we don’t think we are part of the P.R.C.,” said Sanho Chung, 24, who was at Tuesday’s game, using an abbreviation for the People’s Republic of China. “We are different.”

Rights activists and pro-democracy politicians are concerned that the law could be used to suppress free expression.

“I think it will be quite problematic to apply it,” said Dennis Kwok, a member of Hong Kong’s Legislative Council.

He noted that the mainland law allows the police to place violators in administrative detention for 15 days. That method of incarceration, which bypasses the courts, does not exist in Hong Kong.

And the idea of showing reverence will be hard to define, he said. “What does it mean to be respectful of the national anthem?” Mr. Kwok said. “That concept of law is simply unheard-of here, to have to stand in silence. I think we need to be very careful defining what is respectful and what is not.”

Hong Kong officials say the national anthem law is a routine matter that should not prompt concern among residents.

“I just want to reiterate that, rightly so, we are living in a more politicized environment, but we need not adopt this very politicized stance in considering and dealing with any matter,” Carrie Lam, the chief executive of Hong Kong, said in August. “This particular matter of national anthem legislation does not carry any particular scope for politicization.”

In recent months, the authorities have taken several steps to punish people for protesting or for calling for Hong Kong’s independence. Now, even symbolic protests are being suppressed.

Last month, a lawmaker was fined 5,000 Hong Kong dollars, about $640, for turning upside down several small Hong Kong and Chinese flags on desks in the Legislative Council chamber.

And the appearance of posters calling for Hong Kong independence on a wall run by the student union at the Chinese University of Hong Kong set off debate between local and mainland students. School administrators and Hong Kong officials called the signs illegal, but legal scholars said it was questionable whether colonial-era sedition laws could be enforced.

“The introduction of a national anthem law is coming at a time when people who oppose symbols of the Chinese government and symbols of the Chinese Communist Party have reason to fear they could end up behind bars,” said Maya Wang, senior China researcher for Human Rights Watch. “This could have a chilling effect on freedom of expression.”

On Tuesday at the match against Malaysia, Mr. Chung, clad in a red home jersey, stood with fellow fans during halftime. He said the national anthem law would not stop him from booing.

“It does dampen our freedom of speech, forcing us to respect something,” he said. “I worry, but I will still practice my rights. I think this is my right.”","In Hong Kong, It’s the Fans Who Protest During the National Anthem",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/world/asia/hong-kong-china-national-anthem-protest.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

The Yankees now head to Houston, where they will begin the American League Championship Series on Friday against a familiar nemesis: the Astros left-hander Dallas Keuchel, who helped eliminate them in the 2015 wild-card playoff.

The Yankees, though, are unlikely to be cowed after having rallied to knock off the Indians, who had roared their way to an American League-leading 102 victories and had lost only four times between Aug. 23 and the end of the regular season.

“Any time you’re down 2-0, and particularly the way it happened — it was a tough loss — it shows a lot about them,” Hal Steinbrenner, the Yankees’ principal owner, said as he stood outside the jubilant clubhouse. “They’ve been loose the entire time, just lighthearted the entire time, had their backs the entire time.”

The Yankees staved off elimination first with a 1-0 win in Game 3 on Sunday behind Masahiro Tanaka’s dominant performance and Greg Bird’s solo homer. Then they evened the series Monday night with a 7-3 victory in Game 4.

The Yankees got an auspicious start on Wednesday from Gregorius, who had an uneasy transition to the Bronx when he replaced Derek Jeter two years ago. He hit both home runs in the first three innings off the Indians ace Corey Kluber; Gregorius had entered Wednesday with two career hits (in 15 at-bats) off Kluber.

Gregorius speaks four languages fluently: Dutch, Spanish, Papiamento — the tongue of his native Curaçao — and English. But as home runs have flown off his bat and he settled into the middle of the Yankees’ lineup this season, his answer to whether he considered himself a home run hitter was easy to understand in any language: No.

“If I hit a home run, I hit a home run,” Gregorius said. “I’m not going out to try to hit home runs every time.”

If the regular season, when he hit 25 home runs — breaking Jeter’s record for a Yankees shortstop — was not enough to prompt a reconsideration, these playoffs have been. Gregorius also blasted a momentum-swinging home run against the Minnesota Twins in the Yankees’ 8-4 wild-card victory before adding two more on Wednesday night.

“I think back to a couple of years ago when we first got him and everybody in the stands every night was chanting Derek Jeter’s name,” Gardner said. “Nowadays you don’t hear that.”

Gregorius’s first home run, on a 1-2 fastball, stunned the capacity crowd at Progressive Field and put the Yankees ahead by 1-0 in the first inning. The second came in the third, on a 1-1 curveball, and pushed the Yankees’ advantage to 3-0.

“I was on base for the second one and it was a no-doubter, but I told him I went back to tag up because I figured there’s no way he could take him deep twice in the same game,” Gardner said.

That was all the offense the Yankees would need — and all they would get until the ninth. With his team clinging to a 3-2 lead, Gardner hit a two-out single to right field on the 12th pitch of his at-bat against closer Cody Allen. Aaron Hicks raced home from second and, when right fielder Jay Bruce’s throw bounced away from shortstop Francisco Lindor, an alert Todd Frazier dashed home.

That sealed a comeback that was made possible by the Yankees’ pitching staff, which yielded five runs over the final three games. And they mustered enough offense to overcome a grim series from Aaron Judge, who struck out four times on Wednesday and finished the series 1 for 20 with 16 strikeouts, shattering the record for a playoff series of 13 that had been held by four other players: Ryan Howard, Jackson, Brandon Moss and Javier Baez.

The Yankees’ scant offense stood up on Wednesday because of a calm start from C. C. Sabathia and a finishing kick from Robertson and Chapman, who covered the final two innings. Robertson, who threw a career-high 52 pitches in the wild-card game eight days earlier, had not looked the same since, surrendering the game-tying home run to Bruce in Game 2.

But Girardi called on him after the Indians strung together four consecutive one-out singles — from Jackson, Bruce, Roberto Perez and Giovanny Urshela— to narrow the Yankees’ lead to 3-2 in the fifth. It would turn out to be the game’s crucial moment.

With runners at first and second, Lindor — who had a woeful series other than his tide-turning grand slam in Game 2 — hit an 0-1 cutter back up the middle. Robertson reached for it but pulled his glove away at the last instant, which proved to be a wise decision.

“You see a ball coming back at you, your first response is to protect yourself, whether it’s hit hard or not,” Robertson said.

The ball bounced right to Gregorius, who was stationed almost directly behind second base. He stepped on the bag and threw to first for a double play that ended the threat.

It was another moment in this series where the margin of victory was pinstripe thin. If Judge were 6 feet tall instead of 6-foot-7, he might not have been able to leap at the wall to steal what looked to be a two-run homer from Lindor in the Yankees’ 1-0 win in Game 3. And the Yankees took the lead in Game 4 when Frazier’s line drive landed precisely on the line, opening a four-run inning.

But even being in this series felt unlikely when the Yankees arrived in Tampa for spring training. They hoped a night like Wednesday was possible — but few believed it would come this season.

The unloading of many of the Yankees veterans last year — like Alex Rodriguez, Mark Teixeira, Carlos Beltran and Brian McCann — created a great deal of enthusiasm around their raft of young talent. But it was also accompanied by plenty of questions. Two young players who emerged as stars this season, Judge and pitcher Luis Severino, did not solidify their roster spots until the week before opening day.

But the Yankees coalesced quickly. They posted the best exhibition record in baseball and carried that into the regular season, leaping to a 21-9 start through early May. The next several months carried with it some travails — injuries, Judge’s second-half funk and Chapman’s temporary demotion among them – but the Yankees chased the Boston Red Sox for the American League East title until the penultimate day of the season.

As it turned out, it was not a pyrrhic chase. The fight the Yankees showed seemed to help forge a resolve, one they counted on in recent days to cover the distance from devastation to elation.",Didi Gregorius Leads Yankees Past Indians and Into A.L.C.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/sports/baseball/yankees-indians-game-5.html

“Research shows that when girls are empowered and have strong connections outside of the family, they have a better chance of protecting themselves and their future,” Ms. Sinclair said.
Looking at her own career, she felt that photography could be a vehicle to help these girls.
“A lot of the photographs they’ve taken speak to the different moments in their lives,” Ms. Sinclair said.
“They say that every girl who is empowered impacts at least 250 people in her community,” Ms. Sinclair said.","Having spent 15 years photographing child marriages around the world, Stephanie Sinclair is uniquely positioned to understand its lasting impact on communities and, especially, on the girls who were forced to wed against their will. “You can’t expect individuals who have been through significant abuse to just act normal as soon as they get out of that situation,” she said. “They need to be nurtured, to be given the time and the tools to heal.”

With this in mind, Ms. Sinclair last year started the Tehani Photo Workshop — named after an 8-year-old Yemeni bride — in partnership with the Samburu Girls Foundation. The Kenyan organization, led by Josephine Kulea, focuses on educating girls rescued from child marriage, female genital mutilation and beading, a tradition where girls adorned with red beads have to serve the needs of an older male relative.

“Research shows that when girls are empowered and have strong connections outside of the family, they have a better chance of protecting themselves and their future,” Ms. Sinclair said. Looking at her own career, she felt that photography could be a vehicle to help these girls. “The independence that comes with a such a career, the knowledge you acquire through meeting other people, and the freedom the camera gives you to express yourself can’t be underplayed,” she said. “Instinctively, I knew that a photo workshop could nurture the girls in a unique way.”

Twice now, a dozen or so 11- to 16-year-olds gathered at the Ngari Hill Eco-Lodge for five days to talk about images and the place of women in society. Ms. Sinclair shares her long-term project, which helps the participants understand that it’s a global issue affecting one girl every two seconds; that it’s the result of women not being valued as they should; and that what they’d been through is not their fault. She also introduces basic photographic concepts using examples of work done by or on strong African women. The goal is to inspire them while also teaching them photo skills before they pair off with another participant and are joined by a student-mentor from the previous workshop to make pictures in the surrounding hills.

“A lot of the photographs they’ve taken speak to the different moments in their lives,” Ms. Sinclair said. “Many, this year, even re-enacted what happened to them. We didn’t tell them to do this.” In one, Jackline holds out her beaded necklace while dressed in her school uniform, an effort to demonstrate how beading interrupts education. In another, Nachaki leans against a branch off the ground. “I was worried they’d fall when I first saw them climbing, but then they told me how, when they fled their marriage and hid in the forest, they’d sleep in trees to protect themselves from the animals in the wild,” Ms. Sinclair recalled.

Others hint at the bonds developing among the girls, like in the picture of Linnet and Eunice laughing in their room, or Susan and Silvana walking arm in arm, as well as in the portraits they’ve made of each other. Only when sitter and photographer are in sync do you get images that capture both vulnerability and strength.

The workshop culminates in a community exhibition and presentation where they speak about what matters most to them. Both times, Ms. Sinclair said, they felt compelled to share what they’d been through, how it affected them, why girls’ lives matter, and why they should have the same opportunities as boys. In short, how “girls can do anything,” a line they often repeated in their remarks. The message resonated powerfully with those in attendance. Not only did it come from those who lived through the ordeal, but also from community members, female relatives, and young women who speak the same language and share the same cultural background.

“They say that every girl who is empowered impacts at least 250 people in her community,” Ms. Sinclair said. “Though we’ve only had 22 students so far, slowly those number add up.”

She hopes to hold more workshops, in Kenya and elsewhere, as long as her not-for-profit “Too Young to Wed” continues receiving the financing and logistical support to do its work without taking any shortcuts.

“You want these workshops to be intimate, because therapy isn’t a mass process,” she said. “It’s not just the act of photography that helps; it’s bringing together girls who have all experienced a similar type of trauma for what really is a retreat, a time to be nurtured, to grow, and to build community.”

In July, a few hours after being released from prison, he was arrested and sentenced to another month in jail. He is due in court again on Thursday, when he is likely to be offered a choice between a $250 fine he cannot afford and 30 days in jail.

Jailing Mr. Marsh costs the city $1,650 a month.

He is arrested so often, he says, because as soon as he is spotted by employees of Sumter’s businesses — the post office, fast-food restaurants and convenience stores — they call the police.

Police Chief Russell F. Roark III said his officers had little choice but to arrest Mr. Marsh.

“He scares customers, so we have to intervene,” Chief Roark said. “But we attempt to do other things than make arrests,” like issuing tickets.

A lawyer could go beyond Mr. Marsh’s guilt or innocence, by pressing for solutions like treatment instead of jail.

Mr. Marsh, who suffered a head injury as a teenager, has no one else to look out for him. He has long been out of touch with family members and says he has no friends.

His disability payments are disrupted every time he goes to jail, leaving him penniless on release. He is at the mercy of the South Carolina municipal courts, an idiosyncratic system in which police officers serve as prosecutors, judges are not required to have college degrees, and public defenders are often absent.

Tess Borden, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, said 139 of the state’s 212 municipal courts have no public defenders available.

The A.C.L.U. filed a federal class-action lawsuit on Thursday against the city of Beaufort and the town of Bluffton, saying they are violating defendants’ rights. They hope for a ruling that sets a statewide precedent that all jurisdictions must provide lawyers.

Municipal courts, which handle traffic violations and other low-level crimes, are optional for South Carolina cities, which can choose to rely on state courts to hear the cases. They can be lucrative: the state’s 212 municipal courts collect some $20 million a year in fines and fees. Last year there was nearly one municipal case for every nine adult residents.

“Under South Carolina law, municipalities that choose to establish their own courts have a duty to fund public defense,” Ms. Borden said. “Yet the majority of cities and towns flout this obligation, prosecuting poor people without spending a dime on their defense. The result is a grossly unconstitutional system in which lawyers are luxuries available only to those who can afford them.”

It is not clear what entity has the ultimate authority for the state’s municipal courts. Tonnya K. Kohn, administrator for the state Office of Court Administration, said that her office played no role in oversight of municipal courts and that the State Supreme Court was responsible.

But Daniel E. Shearouse, the Supreme Court’s clerk, said Wednesday that the Office of Court Administration — and not the Supreme Court — oversaw municipal court activities. Both Ms. Kohn and Mr. Shearouse declined to comment about defendants not being informed of their Constitutional rights.

In Beaufort, officials did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday, but in an email statement, Debbie Szpanka, a spokeswoman for Bluffton, said: “Bluffton municipal judges inform defendants who appear before the bench that he/she has a right to counsel and if he/she is unable to afford to hire a lawyer that a lawyer will be appointed.”

In the Sumter courtroom where Mr. Marsh has been found guilty dozens of times, judges on a recent day spent minutes on all but a few of the 85 cases involving traffic violations, disturbing the peace, or shoplifting.

With light and shadow, it’s possible not just to accentuate your features — but to reshape them.

Makeup lovers are a flighty species, enthralled by millennial pink one day and grungy black-plum the next. Look more closely, though, and two tidy camps emerge: One consists of peacocks who treat their faces as Technicolor canvases; the other of faux naturalists. But they are united in one respect — both share an obsession with the architecture of the face.

Contouring — using darker shades of concealer or foundation to create dimension and a more defined facial structure — had long been employed by makeup artists, but five years ago, the technique went mainstream, and was soon followed by the rise of the complementary practices of strobing (applying light, often shimmery shades on the higher planes of the face) and baking (applying a thick coat of powder on the cheeks to set makeup and neutralize harsh angles). This isn’t so much the season as it is the era of face architecture. On the runway, it was most recently found at the summer couture shows — at Dior, there was no makeup at all but for the slightest hints of highlighter, while at Margiela, the models wore multiple layers of highlighter, their skin glistening with an otherworldly sheen.

Achieving this sort of chiaroscuro can seem an artful and even artistic pursuit, one that transcends mere vanity. But the real reason contouring has become the essential makeup language for our age is that the process was born for the screen, and what is our current era but one lived through, and on, the screen? Think of Marlene Dietrich, an early beneficiary of contouring as a tuxedo-clad cabaret singer in the 1930 film “Morocco,” her cheekbones announcing themselves beneath the tilted brim of her top hat. Without high definition or color, Hollywood’s early makeup artists didn’t need to worry whether their work might appear clownish offscreen. Even so, Max Factor sold a version of the look to the masses with his full coverage Pan-Cake line and contouring tutorials. (Today’s equivalents include brands like Becca, known for its highlighters, and Anastasia Beverly Hills, whose contour palettes are best sellers at Sephora.)

Contouring fell out of fashion in favor of a more self-consciously “natural” look, but in the ’80s and ’90s, the trend was revived by drag queens, who used professional stage makeup brands like Ben Nye, Kryolan and Mehron to both soften masculine features (strong jaws, pronounced brow bones), and create feminine ones through copious strobing, which can have a plumping effect. Elements of drag culture have since trickled down into the broader culture: Along with false lashes’ popularity and the sequined packaging of star makeup artist Pat McGrath’s line of coveted pigments, the most significant development is how profoundly we’ve succumbed to the promise of transformation. No longer do you have to do the hard work of accepting the face you’ve been given — now you can just reshape it. On her website, the British makeup artist and cosmetics company founder Charlotte Tilbury offers a video tutorial on just that. She recommends applying a pale line of concealer down the center of the face and then patting sculpting powder along either side, describing the effect as “a little bit like virtual surgery.”

Of course, the ability to become someone other than oneself has always been both makeup’s appeal and its threat. Witnessing Asian women use contouring to whittle down their noses, for example, inevitably leads to questions about what was wrong with their noses in the first place. The aim, crushingly, can be to look white. Or not: In June, Kim Kardashian West promoted her new Crème Contour and Highlight Kit with pictures of herself looking especially contoured and extremely tan. Accusations of blackface ensued.

Business leaders have become spooked by the increasing odds of the trade deal’s demise, and on Monday, more than 310 state and local chambers of commerce sent a letter to the administration urging the United States to remain in Nafta. Speaking in Mexico on Tuesday, the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Thomas J. Donohue, said the negotiations had “reached a critical moment. And the chamber has had no choice but ring the alarm bells.”

“Let me be forceful and direct,” he said. “There are several poison pill proposals still on the table that could doom the entire deal.”

The potential demise of the trade deal prompted supportive messages from labor unions, including the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the United Steelworkers, as well as some Democrats.

“Any trade proposal that makes multinational corporations nervous is a good sign that it’s moving in the right direction for workers,” said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio.

If the deal does fall apart, the United States, Canada and Mexico would revert to average tariffs that are relatively low — just a few percent in most cases. But several agricultural products would face much higher duties. American farmers would see a 25 percent tariff on shipments of beef, 45 percent on turkey and some dairy products, and 75 percent on chicken, potatoes and high fructose corn syrup sent to Mexico.

For months, some of the most powerful business leaders in the country, and the lobbies and political figures that represent them, had hoped that the president’s strong wording was more a negotiating tactic than a real threat and that he would ultimately go along with their agenda of modernization. Nafta is nearly a quarter-century old, and people across the political spectrum say it should be updated for the 21st century while preserving the open trading system that has linked the North American economy.

The pact has allowed industries to reorganize their supply chains around the continent to take advantage of the three countries’ differing resources and strengths, lifting the continent’s economies and more than tripling America’s trade with Canada and Mexico since its inception. Economists contend that many workers have benefited from these changes in the form of higher wages and employment, but many workers have lost their jobs as manufacturing plants relocated to Mexico or Canada, making Nafta a target of labor unions, many Democrats and a few industries.

But most business leaders had hoped that the president, whose Nafta criticism has been unrelenting, would be content to oversee tweaks to modernize the agreement, and then call it a political transformation.

It sometimes looked as if that might be the case. The appointment of Robert Lighthizer as United States trade representative, who pledged in his confirmation hearing to “do no harm” to Nafta, reassured many on Capitol Hill, where Mr. Lighthizer had long served in aide roles. And when the administration released its negotiating goals in July for the deal, they echoed many priorities of previous administrations.

But now, eight weeks into trade talks that were originally supposed to conclude by year’s end, the administration continues to push for concessions that the business community warns would essentially undermine the pact, and which few observers believe Canada and Mexico could agree to politically.

“Everyone knows that much of what is being proposed in key areas are, in effect, non-starters, which begs the question as to what, exactly, the administration is trying to achieve,” Michael Camuñez, a former assistant secretary of commerce under President Barack Obama, wrote in an email. It’s not unreasonable to think that by accommodating the president’s most extreme positions, American negotiators are “simply giving Trump cover to do what he really wants: withdraw from the agreement,” he said.

Phil Levy, a trade adviser for the George W. Bush administration, said the president was most likely looking for a pretext to kill Nafta.

“Find me the last trade agreement that U.S. passed with the chamber in opposition,” Mr. Levy said. “You don’t have a chance. It’s hard enough with the U.S. Chamber in favor.”

The most controversial of the administration’s proposals, floated by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, would incorporate a sunset clause in the deal, causing Nafta to automatically expire unless all three countries voted periodically to continue it. That provision has drawn swift condemnation from the chamber and other industry groups like the National Association of Manufacturers, which say that it would instill so much uncertainty in the future of Nafta that it would basically nullify the trade agreement.

Another contentious push by the United States centers on changing Nafta’s rules governing how much of a product needs to be made in North America in order to enjoy tariff-free trade between the countries. The United States is pushing for higher levels, including a requirement to make 85 percent of the value of automobiles and auto parts in North America, up from 62.5 percent currently, and an additional requirement for 50 percent of the value to come from the United States.

That has pitted some of the world’s biggest auto companies against the Trump administration. Industry representatives say such high and complex barriers could deter companies from manufacturing in the United States altogether.

The administration has also proposed limits on the number of federal government contracts that Mexican and Canadian companies can win, as well as significant changes to how disputes are resolved under Nafta.

Business groups say they are firmly opposed to an American push to curtail a provision called investor-state dispute settlement, which allows companies to sue Canada, Mexico and the United States for unfair treatment under Nafta. Meanwhile, Canada has said that it will not consider dispensing with another provision, Nafta’s Chapter 19, which allows countries to challenge each other’s anti-dumping and countervailing duty decisions before an independent panel.

In his remarks Tuesday, Mr. Donohue called the administration’s proposed changes to these provisions “unnecessary and unacceptable.”

Mr. Donohue’s remarks followed a sharp exchange of words between the Chamber of Commerce, the country’s most powerful business lobby, and the Trump administration on Friday.

John Murphy, senior vice president of international policy for the chamber, said the administration’s proposals had “no identifiable constituency backing them” and had sparked “a remarkable degree of unity in their rejection.” He added that business leaders had perhaps never been at odds with an administration over a trade negotiation on so many fronts.

Hours later, the administration fired back.

“The president has been clear that Nafta has been a disaster for many Americans, and achieving his objectives requires substantial change,” said Emily Davis, a spokeswoman for the trade representative. “These changes of course will be opposed by entrenched Washington lobbyists and trade associations. We have always understood that draining the swamp would be controversial in Washington.”

Mr. Trump is known for taking a tough negotiating stance, and analysts said the administration might view its ambitious opening requests as a way to gain more leverage in the Nafta negotiations.

But Mr. Murphy and others in the business community cautioned that such an approach would probably be ill-fated. In both Canada and Mexico, Mr. Trump is unpopular, and caving to his demands could have devastating consequences for local politicians. Mexican government officials have repeatedly said they would not negotiate with a gun to the head.

“There’s an old adage in negotiations, never take a hostage you wouldn’t shoot,” Mr. Murphy said.",Trump’s Tough Talk on Nafta Raises Prospects of Pact’s Demise,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/business/economy/nafta-trump.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

Though he was the first to admit that he didn’t look the part — “I’ve been old and baldheaded and ugly since I’ve been 28,” he reflected long afterward — Tittle became a marquee figure with the Giants and one of their most popular players. The Giants’ radio station played the novelty song “I’m in Love With Y. A. Tittle,” and when Tittle connected on long passes, Yankee Stadium reverberated to chants of “Y. A., Y. A.”

Tittle led the Giants to Eastern Conference titles in 1961, ’62 and ’63, though they were beaten each time in the N.F.L. title game.

He threw for 242 touchdowns and 33,070 yards in his 17 years as a pro, and his 36 touchdown passes in 1963 set a record that stood for 21 years. He was named the league’s most valuable player in 1963 in an Associated Press poll and elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1971.

The end for Tittle as one of football’s best and most resilient quarterbacks essentially came in Pittsburgh on Sept. 20, 1964, in his 17th bruising year in the pros, when a massive lineman slammed him to the ground in a game that Tittle’s Giants lost to the Steelers.

Slowly, Tittle tried to pull himself up off the turf, woozy from a concussion, and Morris Berman, a photographer for The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, was there to snap the picture: Tittle kneeling, his shoulders drooped, his helmet knocked off, his bald pate exposed, his face bloodied.

Perhaps more than the Pro Football Hall of Fame would do later, the image immortalized Tittle in football lore — in the image of the aging warrior who had finally fallen.

Yelberton Abraham Tittle Jr. was born on Oct. 24, 1926, in the East Texas town of Marshall and grew up there, the son of a postal worker. As a youngster, he idolized Texas Christian’s star quarterback Sammy Baugh and threw footballs through hanging tires as he had seen Baugh do in newsreels. His older brother, Jack, who went on to play blocking back in the single wing for Tulane, honed Y. A.’s football skills when he played junior high and high school football.

Tittle became a two-time all-Southeastern Conference quarterback playing for L.S.U. from 1944 to 1947, having been deferred from military service in World War II because of asthma. As a junior, he led the Tigers to the 1947 Cotton Bowl game, a 0-0 tie with Arkansas on a windy, frigid day.

He made his pro debut with the Baltimore Colts of the All-America Football Conference in 1948 and was named rookie of the year. He credited his coach, Cecil Isbell, formerly an outstanding passer for the Green Bay Packers, with fine-tuning his technique and bolstering his confidence.

Tittle joined the 49ers when the Colts disbanded after the 1950 season, their first year in the N.F.L. (A later Baltimore Colts franchise was far more successful.)

He played for two seasons behind Frankie Albert, a 49ers future Hall of Famer, then became the No. 1 quarterback in 1953. He handed off to running backs Joe Perry, Hugh McElhenny and John Henry Johnson in what became known as the Million Dollar Backfield (for brilliance on the field, not for the salaries they earned) and later threw soaring “alley oop” passes to R. C. Owens, who would race downfield and then outjump defenders.

But Tittle’s San Francisco teams never won a conference title. Late in the 1960 season, Coach Red Hickey installed a shotgun formation, which required occasional scrambling that the aging Tittle could not handle. Hickey benched him in favor of the much younger and more agile John Brodie, who went on to have a stellar career of his own.

Shortly before the 1961 season began, Tittle was traded to the Giants for Lou Cordileone, a young guard, in what became one of pro football’s most lopsided deals. “Me for Tittle?” a startled Cordileone remarked. “Just me?”

Tittle replaced the Giants’ longtime star quarterback, 40-year-old Charlie Conerly, as the starter for much of the 1961 season. Teaming up on pass plays with Del Shofner, Kyle Rote and Joe Walton, he took the Giants to the N.F.L. championship game. But they lost, 37-0, to the Packers on a frozen field at Green Bay, and Conerly retired after that.

Tittle tied an N.F.L. single-game record by throwing seven touchdown passes against the Washington Redskins in 1962. He threw 33 touchdown passes for the season, setting a league record, but frigid wind gusts and a strong Green Bay rush in the N.F.L. title game at Yankee Stadium stymied him in the Packers’ 16-7 victory.

Tittle passed for 36 touchdowns in 1963, but he tore a knee ligament in the first half against the Chicago Bears at Wrigley Field in the N.F.L. championship game when he was tackled by Larry Morris. Heavily taped, Tittle returned for the second half but was unable to properly plant his feet and was intercepted four times as the Bears scored a 14-10 victory.

The Giants were an aging team that looked nothing like the Eastern Division defending champions when they regrouped for the 1964 season. The opening game turned into a 38-7 beating at the hands of the Eagles in Philadelphia, and then it was on to Pittsburgh to face the Steelers.

The Giants were leading, 14-0, by the second quarter when Tittle, deep in Giants territory, dropped back to pass. From the right side — Tittle’s throwing side — John Baker, a 6-foot-7, 280-pound defensive end, saw an opening and smashed into Tittle, 6 feet and 190 pounds or so, as he was about to pass. The ball floated loose and into the arms of Steelers tackle Chuck Hinton, who ran it back for an easy touchdown.

As the Steelers celebrated in the end zone, Tittle knelt there, dazed and injured, and Mr. Berman captured the moment.

The Post-Gazette did not run the photo the next day; editors there did not think it was anything special. But Mr. Berman entered it for prize consideration, and it won the National Headliner award for best sports photograph of 1964. It now hangs in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio.

“Baker had crushed the cartilage in my ribs and brutally gashed my forehead,” Tittle recalled in his memoir, “Nothing Comes Easy” (2009), written with Kristine Setting Clark.

“I also suffered a concussion and a cracked sternum. That photo would later become one of the most enduring images in sports history. What a hell of a way to get famous!”

The play was a turning point: Pittsburgh went on to win, 27-24, Tittle played out the season hampered by the rib injuries, and the Giants would finish with only two wins. “After that I knew it was time to quit, especially when I saw our other quarterback, Gary Wood, was wanting to date my daughter,” Tittle told Richard Whittingham, the author of “Giants in Their Own Words” (1992).

Tittle announced his retirement on Jan. 22, 1965, never having played on a championship team in high school, college or the pros. Later that day, the Jets, the Giants’ rival of the American Football League, held an introductory news conference for Joe Namath, their heralded rookie quarterback.

John Baker, the huge Steelers lineman who pummeled Tittle, died in 2007 after serving for 24 years as sheriff of Wake County, N.C., where he was wryly known as Little John. When Baker first ran for the office, his supporters printed posters with the photo of the battered Tittle and the caption “This is what Little John is going to do for crime in Wake County.”

“I didn’t object to that,” Baker told The Post-Gazette in 1979.

“I was just doing my job,” he said of his crushing hit on Tittle. “It’s a tough business.”

Tittle began selling insurance in the off seasons while a 49er. After his playing days, he developed his company, now called Y. A. Tittle Insurance Services and based in San Jose, Calif., into a major insurer for Silicon Valley firms and other businesses along with individuals. He hung his famous image from yesteryear in his office with the words “Nothing Comes Easy” written below.

In his memoir of the same name, Tittle recalled his playing days as a time when “I could be my own boss,” instead of having “some guy in the press box with three or four assistants” calling plays. It was, he wrote, pro football’s “golden era.”

The Mercury News of San Jose, Calif., reported that Tittle, who lived in Atherton, Calif., is survived by his daughter, Dianne de Laet, who wrote of him in the 1995 book “Giants & Heroes”; his sons, John and Patrick; his brother Don; seven grandchildren; and nine great-grandchildren. His wife, Minnette, died in 2012.

In August 1965, when Tittle approached the first autumn since his junior high school days when he would not be throwing a football, he likened himself to a warrior who had seen his last battlefield.

“It will be a strange fall for me,” he told Sports Illustrated. “For 27 years, from September to December, I have put on my armor and gone out to engage in what is, really, a sort of warfare. This fall I'll be attending to my insurance business.

Even if you have no medical background, you can master some simple techniques for stopping a bleed by taking an hourlong class, going online or downloading an app.

Contact with another person’s blood can potentially expose you to blood-borne diseases such as H.I.V. and hepatitis B and C. Use gloves if they are available.

“It’s very simple to do, it’s inexpensive and it doesn’t take a lot of time,” said Dr. Lenworth M. Jacobs, a trauma surgeon and director of the trauma institute at Hartford Hospital in Hartford, Conn., who started an initiative to increase survivability after mass shooting events, motivated by the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings in 2012.

There are several techniques for stopping bleeding. The first step is to expose the skin so you can see where the bleeding is coming from.

Use one or both hands to maintain firm, steady pressure directly on the bleeding site. You can also use your knee, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.

A second option is to use a bandage or commercial dressing designed to stop bleeding, called a hemostatic dressing, if available, or clothing, to apply firm, steady pressure to the site.

If the bleeding persists, place a tourniquet on a limb two to three inches closer to the torso from the bleeding and tighten until the bleeding stops (a tourniquet can be applied over clothing). If the bleeding still does not stop, a second tourniquet can be placed closer to the torso. If the injury is in a joint like the shoulder or the groin, pack the wound with gauze but do not use a tourniquet, said Paul Brooks, program manager for the Stop the Bleed Program run by the Office of Health Affairs at the Department of Homeland Security, which the Obama administration started in 2015.

If the victim is suffering from a gunshot to the head or abdomen, you should also apply pressure to stop bleeding, but the victim is less likely to survive, Dr. Jacobs warned.

Be aware that applying pressure on a wound can be very painful to the injured person, and it is important to talk the victim through the procedure and explain that the pain is necessary, and that help is on the way.

“You need to speak to them with kindness and explain it to them and say, ‘Hold on, we’re going to stop the bleeding; we’re going to get you to care.’ That makes a huge difference,” Dr. Jacobs said.

Though some bystanders may be afraid of touching a bleeding gunshot victim, or of causing further pain by improperly tying an improvised tourniquet, experts say that having the training is empowering and provides the tools to take action. The skills can be applied to bleeding injuries of all kinds, from kitchen accidents involving knives to automobile accidents.

In some public places like airport or shopping malls, specialized bleeding control kits that contain hemostatic bandages and tourniquets might be available, but they are not as ubiquitously stocked as automated external defibrillators, which are used to treat people with heart arrhythmias.

Blood loss is extremely dangerous, causing a cascade of medical events, including a drop in body temperature that affects clotting, exacerbating blood loss even further. Once people lose about 20 percent of their blood volume they go into a condition called irreversible shock, Mr. Brooks said. “It’s a downward spiral we can’t recover from.”

Resources include the Department of Homeland Security’s Stop the Bleed website and the American College of Surgeons site, where you can search for a Bleeding Control Basics class in your geographic region. The classes are an hour long and most are offered at no cost.

Educational programs recommended by the Department of Homeland Security include the First Care Provider Program and Until Help Arrives.

Has never even TRIEDto make Play-Doh from scratch”), the Cab of Guilt taxi recording (“This is your mother, reminding you that if you don’t buckle up I will kill myself”). Equal parts schadenfreude and inadequacy, with a seasoning of guilt and superstitious panic — that’s the world according to Rosalind Chast.

Two years ago, after the success of her graphic memoir “Can’t We Talk About Something More Pleasant?” about caring for her parents in their last years, Ms. Chast allowed herself to rent a studio apartment in the West 70s, which she visits every week or so from her house in — brace yourself — Ridgefield, Conn. It was a homecoming of sorts for Ms. Chast and her husband, Bill Franzen, a humor writer, who were driven from the city in 1990 by the modern equivalent of a Biblical plague, namely the New York real estate market. She still describes the Upper West Side as home, and her move to suburbia as a kind of exile.

“There were questions like, What kind of backsplash do you want?” she said, her voice rising in remembered terror. “And I didn’t know what a backsplash was. It was just horrible. I hate that kind of stuff. And faucets. It was a combination of very boring and very stressful.”

The Upper West Side, by contrast, offered good diners and lousy restaurants, a beguilingly terrible supermarket, zero cool bars or boutiques — nothing, in short, to attract people who do not live there.

“I really, really like that,” she said. “When I go home after being in Midtown or even the Village, the vibe is so much more people going about their business — I need to buy shoelaces, or I need to buy a new wastebasket and some hangers, and then I’m going to go home. It’s not like, Hey, there’s this new hip restaurant on West 83rd street. I don’t think so. I really doubt that.”

Ms. Chast grew up in the Kensington section of Flatbush, the only child of parents who rarely left the neighborhood. Her father, a teacher, never learned to drive. “My mother drove, but she was a very anxious driver,” Ms. Chast said. “So I grew up with a lot of anxiety about cars and driving.

“We’d come into Manhattan to see plays, and we’d turn around and come back. We never stayed. There was always a story where something terrible happened to someone — some restaurant where a lady found a piece of glass in an olive. So you just ate at this one Chinese restaurant near our apartment and sat in the same booth, and you ordered the same food, moo goo gai pan, of course, because that’s safe.”

When she returned to New York after art school, in January 1978, it was to an apartment on West 73rd Street with no stove, just a hot plate, and wiring that regularly blew a fuse. Her parents helped with the rent. Four months later she sold her first cartoon to The New Yorker for $250, or roughly a month’s rent.

“She really opened the doors to a certain kind of idiosyncratic weirdness at The New Yorker,” said Emily Flake, 40, who followed Ms. Chast into the magazine’s pages three decades later. “Part of that has to do with coming from a point of view owned by a woman. She wasn’t the first female cartoonist at The New Yorker, but she’s one of the first female stars. She carved out a space for a more personal brand of weirdness for people who are similarly off the map.”

Richard Gehr, author of “I Only Read It for the Cartoons: The New Yorker’s Most Brilliantly Twisted Artists,” called Ms. Chast the magazine’s “first subversive cartoonist,” who was not appreciated by the older male cartoonists on staff. “She was a feisty, punky young person whose stuff looked completely different,” Mr. Gehr said. “A lot of other cartoonists there found that very challenging: if this is the new wave, what are we? And she’s come to display more range there than almost any other cartoonist in The New Yorker’s history.”

As Ms. Chast has aged, her characters, often loosely autobiographical, have aged with her, growing into middle age with their neuroses intact. “Some worries I’m probably going to carry with me until the point comes when you stop worrying, which is when you’re dead,” she said. “Where do I start? Driving, medical, electricity, basement, boilers.”

In recent years, Ms. Chast has turned her attention to elaborate egg-painting, embroidery, rug-hooking and ukulele, partly as a remedy to chronic insomnia. After the cathartic nakedness of “Can’t We Please Talk About Something More Pleasant?” which literally took on matters of life and death, “Going Into Town,” which began life as a city guide for her daughter, feels genial but slight. At an October speaking engagement at the Museum of the City of New York, where tickets cost $40, she leaned heavily on earlier cartoons.

But she may be saving her energies for her next big project, in which she ventures back into the land where her neuroses began.

“Brooklyn,” she said. “Out there Brooklyn. Places where you take the subway and then you have to take a bus.”

It’s a big topic, especially for someone dreaming of playing Hawaiian heavy metal on the ukulele. But why not? As the character Pigeon Little says in Ms. Chast’s new collection, “The sky is falling, the sky is — oh look! Part of a bagel.”

A 2007 ad for Intel’s new processor showed a white man surrounded by six black sprinters bent over in starting poses. “Multiply computing performance and maximize the power of your employees,” the text read.

Intel said its intent “was to convey the performance capabilities of our processors through the visual metaphor of a sprinter,” but acknowledged, “Unfortunately, our execution did not deliver our intended message and in fact proved to be insensitive and insulting.”

Dove, May 2011

In 2011, Dove was criticized for another ad: this one showing three women standing side by side, each with lighter skin than the woman next to her. Behind them were signs reading “before” and “after”; the “before” sign, positioned behind an African-American woman, showed cracked skin, while the “after” sign, behind a white woman, showed smooth skin.

“Visibly more beautiful skin,” the ad read.

Edelman, the public relations company representing Dove, said in a statement to Gawker: “All three women are intended to demonstrate the ‘after’ product benefit. We do not condone any activity or imagery that intentionally insults any audience.”

The fact that the most recent ad was Dove’s second to cause offense was not lost on social media users.

Popchips, May 2012

Popchips drew fire in 2012 for an ad in which Ashton Kutcher played several characters — including a Bollywood producer named Raj, complete with brownface and an Indian accent.

Popchips initially urged viewers to watch the ad in the humorous “spirit it was intended.” Later, its chief executive, Keith Belling, said in a statement: “Our team worked hard to create a lighthearted parody featuring a variety of characters that was meant to provide a few laughs. We did not intend to offend anyone. I take full responsibility and apologize to anyone we offended.”

Qiaobi, May 2016

In a 2016 commercial for the Chinese company Qiaobi’s laundry detergent, an Asian woman shoves a detergent pod into a black man’s mouth and puts him in a washing machine, from which he emerges as a light-skinned Asian.

A spokeswoman for Qiaobi, Xu Chunyan, was unapologetic. “We did this for some sensational effect,” she said at the time. “If we just show laundry like all the other advertisements, ours will not stand out.”

Nivea, April 2017

In April, the skin care company Nivea released a deodorant ad that read, “White is purity.” White supremacists on the internet took note, with one 4chan user writing, “Nivea has chosen our side.”

A representative of Nivea’s parent company, Beiersdorf, said it had “never intended to hurt anybody or to raise any wrong interpretation.”

But, like Dove, Nivea had offended before.

Six years earlier, after apologizing for an ad that showed a black man preparing to throw away his old Afro-wearing head behind the words “Re-civilize yourself,” it promised to review “current development and approval processes” in order to “avoid any kind of future misleading interpretations.”",Dove Drops an Ad Accused of Racism,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/08/business/dove-ad-racist.html

My grandmother Lea once told me a story about the woman who lived next door to her in Tel Aviv, of her capture by the Nazis in Belgium and of an unfathomable decision she had to take to save herself. I never forgot it, and am pleased to share it with you in this Op-Doc film.

Even as a teenager, I was familiar with stories from the Holocaust. My grandfather had survived the horrors of the camps himself, and his stories formed a large part of our family’s shared narrative.

But this woman’s story felt different. Her pain and horror were woven with love, loss, guilt and redemption — and the epilogue was truly extraordinary. Many years later, once I’d become a documentary filmmaker, I decided to find out whether the woman was still alive.

She was. Klara was 92 years old and still living in the same Tel Aviv apartment. I flew out to see her the following week and asked her to tell me the story I’d heard from my grandmother in her own words.

We sat in her living room, the camera started rolling, and she began. She was sharp, funny and generous, and when looking into the darkness and recalling that difficult time, she did not spare herself one bit. When finished she seemed emptied, for the first time looking as old as her age.

I was moved, even transformed, but told her how sorry I was for having stirred up her feelings and memories like that. I’m not sure she fully absolved me, but she did say she was happy I had come to see her.

Throughout my lifetime the Holocaust has felt like one of the defining narratives of the West. Almost three generations later, the mind still struggles to make sense of what happened in that time. But one commandment, one kernel of a logical response, seems to be expressed by all who have lived through the horror: Never forget. As the Holocaust survivor Primo Levi wrote in his prologue to “If This Is a Man”:

“Consider that this has been:

He determined that a structure within the brainstem called the pons governed cats’ REM sleep.
Research has since confirmed that human beings have brain structures that govern REM sleep similar to those found in cats.
The study detailed a medical condition called REM behavior disorder, in which a sleeping person acts out violently in the throes of a vivid dream.
Dr. Jouvet left Long Beach in 1955 to travel the world, then returned to France, where he earned his doctorate in 1956.","In deep, or slow-wave, sleep, both cats and humans show slight muscle tension and low brain activity. But Dr. Jouvet found that during periods of REM sleep the muscles of cats were completely slack, even though their brain waves suggested physical activity. He called the REM state “paradoxical sleep,” since the brain is active even though the body is virtually still.

“Dreaming became the third state of the brain, as different from sleep as sleep was from waking,” Dr. Jouvet wrote in “The Paradox of Sleep: The Story of Dreaming,” published in France in 1993 and in English six years later.

He determined that a structure within the brainstem called the pons governed cats’ REM sleep. The pons is responsible for basic biological functions, like breathing and sensory perception; by contrast, the cortex, a higher brain region, governs conscious thought and actions.

Many researchers at the time assumed that since dreaming seemed to be a complex intellectual process, it would be centralized in the part of the brain responsible for reasoning. Dr. Jouvet’s discovery suggested that REM sleep could continue without the involvement of higher brain structures and that it had an important biological function even for animals with little capacity for reasoning.

Research has since confirmed that human beings have brain structures that govern REM sleep similar to those found in cats. Most warm-blooded animals, like mammals and birds, have periods of REM sleep. (Dolphins and many species of whales are notable exceptions.)

The question of whether animals dream was asked millenniums ago by Aristotle and has since occurred to virtually anyone who has watched a pet twitching in a deep sleep. Dr. Jouvet, who cautioned that there was no way for people to know for certain whether animals have what we call dreams, made a startling discovery while observing their behavior with his fellow researchers.

When certain minute structures within a cat’s pons were destroyed in experiments, he found, the cat began to move during periods of REM sleep — movements suggestive of walking, stalking prey, grooming or acting aggressively — all without reacting to outside stimuli.

The cat was exhibiting what Dr. Jouvet called “oneiric behavior,” meaning behavior related to dreams, using a word derived from the Greek word for dream, “oneiros.” He theorized that what had been destroyed in the experiments were the cerebral structures that had inhibited the cat’s motion while it was sleeping, and that the cat had been reacting to its dreams physically.

“How can we wake a cat during paradoxical sleep and ask it questions?” Dr. Jouvet wrote. “We cannot, but the discovery and analysis of oneiric behavior would lead us to believe that cats do dream.”

In 1986, many years after Dr. Jouvet’s discovery of oneiric behavior in cats, a study by Carlos Schenck and Mark Mahowald at the Minnesota Regional Sleep Disorders Center in Minneapolis pointed to a similar phenomenon in humans. The study detailed a medical condition called REM behavior disorder, in which a sleeping person acts out violently in the throes of a vivid dream. The disorder can usually be controlled with a low dose of a sedative.

Dr. Jouvet also conducted early research on Modafinil, a stimulant used to successfully treat narcolepsy and other sleep disorders. Modafinil, intended to promote wakefulness with a lower risk of addiction than amphetamines, has become popular as a so-called smart drug.

Michel Jouvet was born in Lons-le-Saunier, in eastern France, on Nov. 16, 1925. His father was a physician. As a young man Mr. Jouvet fought with the French Resistance in World War II.

After the war he studied anthropology and ethnography, but his father eventually persuaded him to enter medical school at the University of Lyon. He became a neurosurgical resident there in 1951, and in 1954 he traveled to Long Beach, Calif., to work with the neurophysiologist H. W. Magoun, who with Giuseppe Moruzzi had identified the brain structure responsible for sleep.

Dr. Jouvet left Long Beach in 1955 to travel the world, then returned to France, where he earned his doctorate in 1956.

He became a research director at the French Institute of Health and Medical Research in 1966 and a professor and the director of the department of experimental medicine at what is now Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1 in 1968.

Survivors include his wife, Anne, and four children.

Over the decades Dr. Jouvet kept meticulous journals of his own dreams, studied writings about sleep and dreaming from antiquity onward, and wrote several books. One, a novel published in 1992, is titled “The Castle of Dreams.”","Michel Jouvet, Who Unlocked REM Sleep’s Secrets, Dies at 91",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/obituaries/michel-jouvet-who-unlocked-rem-sleeps-secrets-dies-at-91.html

Anyone can divine Mark Rothko or Mark Bradford’s greatness; consistently assessing exceptional work before an artist achieves public recognition is the most rigorous test. For five years, Dr. Anderson did just that, presiding over the United States’ most influential survey of contemporary art: the Whitney Biennial. His experience, he said, can be applied to everyday life.

Good design enraptures Dr. Anderson, from his Sorrento cup and saucer, readily available on the internet, to Sarah Sze’s virtuosic sculptures, which have graced the US Pavilion at the Venice Biennale. Both, he explained, display forceful imagination and technical skill. “So many glammed-up espresso cups are too thin-walled and thus chip or break easily, are hot to the touch, and don’t stack,” Dr. Anderson said.

“Americans in particular love hobbies,” he said. “And they can use those same visual impulses to develop an eye for art and design.” For instance, those who take joy in cooking have, most likely, already refined an instinct for quality culinary wares. They may not realize it: their beloved Le Creuset conforms to the same principles of superior craftsmanship as any of Dr. Anderson’s cherished possessions, such as the midcentury tackle box that belonged to his father. A cyclist already brings such rigor to bikes; the philatelist to stamps. The trick is exercising this brain reflex to new stimuli.

Yet what about hiring an interior designer or art adviser? Can you outsource the pursuit of taste and still have a home that reflects an internal quality compass? “As with a ski instructor, you should eventually break free as a student,” Dr. Anderson said, “even if you take a tumble on the slopes once in a while.” He cautions, though, that mistakes will be made. An object’s high price tag is no guarantee of quality.

“If you haven’t developed a good reflex,” he added, “you may make choices that are only indexed to cost, but often don’t have much to do with the work itself.”

Learning to see the quality instinct in other people’s space is also key to developing better judgment. Houses with strong aesthetics may come in every shape and size, but they too hold several teachable lessons. Chief among them: Thou shalt not copy. Parroting a magazine or someone else’s home seldom achieves a result worth much retrospection.

As the mixed media artist Bastienne Schmidt puts it, authenticity is crucial. Live who you are, she says; don’t conform to anybody’s design prescription.

To that end, Ms. Schmidt and her husband, the photographer Philippe Cheng, have an enchantingly modern Bridgehampton studio-cum-home, a prototype of which they drew for their architect, on a napkin, in 1998 — and where they raised their sons, Max, 18 and Julian, 15.",Is Good Taste Teachable?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/04/style/design-good-taste.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Yet Mr. Trump’s longstanding contempt for the nuclear accord — he has labeled it a “disaster” and the “worst deal ever” — has kept it center stage.

Lawmakers in the House and Senate remained largely in the dark on Wednesday as to Mr. Trump’s precise plans, even as congressional leaders prepared for the likelihood that the deal’s fate would end up in their laps by week’s end. Other lawmakers, including some Republicans once critical of the deal, called on Mr. Trump to preserve it himself.

All were operating under the assumption that Mr. Trump is preparing to withhold certification. In so doing, he would make it easier for Congress to reimpose sanctions on Iran’s nuclear program and effectively kill the deal with simple majorities in both chambers.

But senior Republican congressional aides said that outcome appeared unlikely, even if much of their party — and many Democrats — remained critical of the deal. Without explicit evidence of a breach by the Iranians, and given Europe’s support for the deal, there appeared to be little appetite among Republican leaders to pull the plug on Mr. Trump’s behalf.

“As flawed as the deal is, I believe we must now enforce the hell out of it,” Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said on Wednesday. He urged Mr. Trump to provide Congress with clear instructions for what he was trying to do.

“Whatever he decides, it is critical that the president lay out the facts,” Mr. Royce said. “He should explain what his decision means, and what it doesn’t.”

Mr. Royce and others in the House have argued instead for stepped-up enforcement and the enforcement of additional, targeted sanctions against Iran’s missile program and Hezbollah. Lawmakers were also preparing for the possibility that Mr. Trump could simply ask them to amend the law that requires him to recertify the deal every 90 days.

Any legislative outcome is likely to hinge on the Senate, where Democrats are confident they can hold most of their members together to preserve the deal. Of the four Senate Democrats who voted against the deal, two — Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, and Ben Cardin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee — have indicated they would not move to abandon it.

That leaves two other previous Democratic no votes, Robert Menendez of New Jersey and Joe Manchin of West Virginia, undecided. But Republicans could also lose some of their own, like Senators John McCain and Jeff Flake of Arizona, Susan Collins of Maine or Rand Paul of Kentucky.

Looming over all this is the prerogative of Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the Republican chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee who has been bitterly feuding with Mr. Trump. Mr. Corker’s sway over the committee, and the Republican caucus, could prove consequential in advancing legislation.

Some people expressed concern that Mr. Corker could no longer play the role of broker between the White House and Congress — a role that is not easily replaced. The Senate’s other leading Iran expert, Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, is viewed as too hard-line to be an intermediary.

As the White House prepared to roll out the policy, experts were focusing on two unanswered questions: how it would confront Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militant group, and whether it would designate the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization. Such a designation would be significant because the guard corps is the military wing of the Iranian government.

John Kerry, the former secretary of state who negotiated the Iran deal, warned House Democrats that such a move would set a dangerous precedent, according to a person who attended the briefing. Additionally, Ernest Moniz, the former energy secretary who was deeply involved in the negotiations, briefed House Democrats on Wednesday afternoon.

There were other concerns. Democrats argued that whatever the intention of Mr. Trump’s maneuvering, it would be lost on America’s negotiating partners abroad.

Representative Eliot L. Engel, top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee, who was previously critical of the deal, said that decertifying the agreement amounted to “playing with fire.”

Jake Sullivan, who helped negotiate the deal for the Obama administration, said, “This dance around decertification has not been productive for our broader goals. It’s much harder to push our European partners to pressure Iran on missiles and terrorism when they are more focused on the risk Washington poses than they are on the risk Tehran poses.”

But critics of the deal said Mr. Trump’s willingness to walk away from it would give the United States the leverage to improve its terms — first with the Europeans, and later with Iran.

“Decertification reinforces the credibility of Donald Trump’s walkaway, which is terrifying European political leaders that he actually could leave the nuclear deal,” said Mark Dubowitz, the chief executive of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a leading critic of the nuclear accord. “This is already shifting the European positions from ‘keep it’ to ‘keep it, but fix it.’”",Growing Chorus Confronts Trump Against Leaving Nuclear Deal,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/world/middleeast/trump-iran-nuclear-deal.html

All of Japan’s major carmakers — Honda, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Subaru, Suzuki and Toyota — are looking into their use of Kobe Steel materials.
The improperly certified metals had been shipped to about 200 companies, but Kobe Steel declined to reveal their names.","Last week, Nissan Motor said unqualified staff members had carried out inspections at its factories, prompting the carmaker to recall 1.2 million vehicles, though it was not clear if the quality of the vehicles had been affected. Mitsubishi Motors and Suzuki Motor both admitted last year that they had been exaggerating the fuel economy of their vehicles by cheating on tests.

Perhaps the biggest blow to Japan’s reputation for quality has come from Takata, the airbag maker that was at the center of the largest auto safety recall in history, involving tens of millions of vehicles. Its faulty airbags have been blamed for more than a dozen deaths. Takata declared bankruptcy in June.

Toshiaki Oguchi, director of Governance for Owners Japan, a corporate watchdog, said that Japanese companies were generally diligent about quality, but that when cheating occurred — because of competitive pressure or other factors — it could too easily go unchecked. Japanese companies, he said, tend to discourage thorough examination or criticism, either from employees or from independent outsiders.

“When something goes wrong, companies always hire a committee of outsiders to examine what happened,” Mr. Oguchi said. “But why not be proactive? Why not have people reviewing procedures all the time?”

The extent of the problems at Kobe Steel are still unfolding.

Kobe Steel said on Sunday that employees at four of its factories had altered inspection certificates on aluminum and copper products from September 2016 to August this year. The changes, it said, made it look as if the products met manufacturing specifications required by customers — including for vital qualities like tensile strength, a measure of material’s ability to withstand a load without breaking when being stretched — when they did not.

On Wednesday, the company said it was investigating possible data falsification involving another product, powdered steel, which is used mostly to make gears. The company said the powdered steel it was examining had been sold to one customer it did not name.

Kobe Steel added that it was examining other possible episodes of data falsification going back 10 years. The company did not provide significant details on the discrepancies, making it difficult to immediately determine if they posed a safety threat. No deaths or safety incidents have been attributed to Kobe Steel.

The company’s share price dropped sharply on Tuesday, the first day of trading after a holiday, and as of Wednesday morning in Tokyo had lost about one-third of its value since last week.

“The falsification problem has become an issue that could destroy international faith in Japanese manufacturing,” the Japanese financial newspaper Nikkei said in an article on Tuesday.

Even as Japan has given up its lead in technologies like televisions, cellphones and computers, it still excels in highly valued products used behind the scenes, including precision machinery, specialty chemicals, sensors and cameras.

Quality helps Japan preserve its markets overseas despite intense competition. Although China is the world’s largest steel maker, Japan still exports large amounts of iron and steel there.

One of the products at the center of the scandal, rolled aluminum, is widely used in the transportation industry because it is light. The lighter a car, train or airplane, the less fuel required to propel it.

Global manufacturers are now trying to assess their exposure, as they dig through an extensive supply chain.

A big car company like G.M. buys millions of tons of steel a year from a dozen or two dozen producers, in a variety of grades and forms. Steel can be sourced from different mills and shipped to any number of plants worldwide. G.M., for example, has 12 vehicle assembly plants and six stamping plants in the United States alone, all of which take deliveries of steel from many different producers.

All of Japan’s major carmakers — Honda, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Subaru, Suzuki and Toyota — are looking into their use of Kobe Steel materials. Toyota called the data falsification a “grave issue” and said it was looking into the problem and considering how best to respond, a statement echoed by other carmakers. Ford and General Motors are trying to determine whether they have used the company’s products.

Kawasaki Heavy Industries, which makes equipment for Shinkansen high-speed trains in Japan, said it was investigating. JR Tokai, a railway company that operates the busiest Shinkansen route in Japan, between Tokyo and Osaka, said that the data discrepancies “do not present a problem in terms of design standards,” but that it was nonetheless considering whether to replace certain train components.

Mitsubishi Heavy Industries uses aluminum from Kobe Steel in a midsize aircraft it is developing, the Mitsubishi Regional Jet, as well as aircraft components it supplies to Boeing. Mitsubishi Heavy said it was investigating. Boeing said in a statement, “Nothing in our review to date leads us to conclude that this issue presents a safety concern, and we will continue to work diligently with our suppliers to complete our investigation.”

Kobe Steel’s problem points to “a common organization issue,” said Shin Ushijima, a lawyer who serves as president of the Japan Corporate Governance Network. He drew parallels between Kobe Steel and Takata and Mitsubishi, as well as with financial-reporting improprieties at Toshiba, which admitted to overstating profit in 2015.

“Boards aren’t doing their jobs,” he said. “This isn’t an issue that can be solved by the president resigning. There needs to be wholesale change.”

He added, “The Kobe Steel case is a test of whether we’ve learned anything from Toshiba and these other issues.”

Kobe Steel said it had confirmed data falsification affecting roughly 19,300 tons of flat-rolled and extruded aluminum products, 19,400 units of aluminum casting and forgings, and 2,200 tons of copper products. The amount was about 4 percent of the company’s output of those products from September 2016 to August.

The company said that it had received no reports from customers of problems with the affected products, and that the falsification had been discovered during an internal review. The improperly certified metals had been shipped to about 200 companies, but Kobe Steel declined to reveal their names.

It said “tens” of employees and managers had been directly involved in the falsification, although no penalties against the employees were immediately announced.

Then there’s the fact that when Grant moved into the White House, he had a statue of Thomas Jefferson, the slave owner, removed from the north lawn and sent to the Capitol.

Not everything in “Grant” carries this much resonance and weight. Chernow likes extreme research; if a Civil War luminary had hemorrhoids, you can read about them here. This is also at least his second book to take an interest in false teeth. For “Washington,” he actually spent some time at Mount Vernon gazing at his subject’s grizzly choppers. Here he tells a story about Grant’s leaving his teeth in a hotel and having an employee throw them away. It’s not clear what happened after that.

But “Grant” is vast and panoramic in ways that history buffs will love. Books of its caliber by writers of Chernow’s stature are rare, and this one qualifies as a major event. Chernow grapples with an enormous amount of material, while mostly sustaining a tight focus. He manages to put on Grant goggles and deal primarily with this one soldier’s role in the military, this one leader’s role in the Civil War. And then the role of one president — branded a political amateur — in leading a country still coming apart at the seams.

Raised in Ohio and educated at West Point, Grant had the humility to do any kind of labor he could find, and the family to make him want to keep working. His father, Jesse, never stopped exploiting Ulysses, whether making him work in a tannery as a boy (a stomach-turning job for him) or using the Grant presidency as a marketing gimmick for his business. His mother, upon greeting her son, the victorious general, said flatly: “Well, Ulysses, you’ve become a great man, haven’t you?” And then she went back to doing housework.

Grant’s drinking is handled so repetitively that the subject begins to pall. In his early days, he drank heavily enough to be forced out of his job as an Army quartermaster after only five months. Chernow contends that it was once a binge problem — a way for Grant to unwind when he wasn’t leading an army into battle — but that he later learned to control it. The evidence consists of countless stories in which Grant asked that his wine glass be turned upside down at dinner. And both Grant’s wife, Julia (who favored dresses with bows in the back), and a designated watcher tried to monitor his behavior.

The book includes an awful lot of instances when Grant slipped up in his abstinence, but Chernow is deeply in his subject’s camp, always ready to play apologist about the drinking and other troubling behaviors. Grant once issued an order expelling Jews from a Southern military district but Chernow thinks this may have had something to do with Oedipal rage against his father, who once went to Mississippi with three Jewish cotton traders who … does it matter? The book points out that Grant also went to a synagogue dedication and sat through a lot of talk in Hebrew.

That story is well known. But Chernow has found many others from new and obscure sources. He also offers something he has found wanting in previous biographies of Grant: “a systematic account of his relations with the four million slaves, whom he helped to liberate, feed, house, employ, and arm during the war, then shielded from harm when they became American citizens.”

Of course, Grant’s efforts to protect former slaves didn’t keep them from suffering after the war, in the backlash against Reconstruction. And Grant had trouble protecting himself as well, facing severe financial troubles after his presidency. Chernow’s indispensable book, which attempts to see Grant’s life as a triumph, is also steeped in tragedy.","In Ron Chernow’s ‘Grant,’ an American Giant’s Makeover Continues",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/books/review-grant-biography-ron-chernow.html

EAT

Osteria al Casale

Chef Fabio Paolicelli makes some of the best cucina povera in town — his cavatelli with mushrooms and caciocavallo is especially good — as well as pizzas with weird and wonderful toppings (try the mozzarella, sausage and turnip). Everything is served with local aglianico wine — an inky red with a mineral-heavy, peppery punch — in a simple, white-walled space with a terracotta floor. The house dessert, a light-as-air whipped ricotta, fig and hazelnut mousse, is not to be skipped.

Osteria San Francesco

The modern-leaning décor at this via del Corso restaurant — black-and-white Ercol-style chairs, paper moon pendant lights — is restrained, but its chef-patron Nicola Morcinelli, who often emerges to chat with guests, is probably best described as ebullient. In the kitchen, Morcinelli, who grew up in Matera and trained in Versailles and Brussels, keeps the focus on his star ingredients of locally sourced meats and produce.

I Vizi degli Angeli

Husband and wife Leonardo de Angelis and Valeria Vizziello had careers in film and advertising when they took up gelato-making. In 2011, they moved from Rome to Matera, Vizziello’s hometown, and opened their own gelateria in a former carpenter’s workshop. Their seasonal, organic ice creams and sorbets are made fresh each morning, and include inventive flavors like mascarpone-and-marron glacé for autumn and milk-and-lavender for summer, along with year-round staples like creamy hazelnut.

Tens of thousands of people scattered during the firestorm. Some ended up in hospitals. Many more have packed dozens of shelters across Sonoma County and beyond.

Friends and family members have been fanning out to those locations, distributing fliers and issuing pleas for information on social media.

“My heart is being ripped out and I don’t know what else to do,” Rachael Ingram said in a Facebook post on Tuesday.

She was looking for a close friend, Mike Grabow, 40, whose home and truck in Santa Rosa were incinerated.

Reached by phone, Ms. Ingram said she had been searching for him nonstop — by foot, phone and internet.

It wasn’t like him to go silent, she said, “He’s got a huge community of friends.”

Late Wednesday there was still no word.

The skyscraper was born in the United States, but in recent years, it has grown and flourished in Asia. Countries there recognize that to be seen as a player on the global stage, it helps to have tall buildings.

Over a century ago, New York and Chicago demonstrated that the skyscraper is, fundamentally, a solution to an economic problem: how to allow for hundreds, if not thousands, of people and businesses to be at the same place at the same time. Urban clustering, especially in a high-tech world, is more important than ever. By promoting density, skyscrapers confer a competitive advantage and allow a city to become a beacon of commerce.

In April, President Xi Jinping of China announced plans for a new city, Xiongan, not far from Beijing. A kind of Chinese field of dreams, Xiongan is to be built on what is now hundreds of square miles of farmland and towns, house millions of people and be a center for technology jobs. Like the cities it’s being modeled after — Shenzhen, near Hong Kong, and Shanghai, particularly its Pudong neighborhood — it may someday claim the world’s tallest skyscrapers. The Ping An Finance tower in Shenzhen, completed this year, at 115 stories, is the fourth-tallest building in the world, while the Shanghai Tower, completed in 2015, at 128 stories, is the second-tallest skyscraper on the planet.

Since the 1990s, the world’s tallest buildings have been built in the East. The current prize holder — the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (828 meters, or about 2,717 feet, 2010) — will be soon be surpassed by the Jeddah Tower in Saudi Arabia (1,000 meters, or about 3,281 feet, 2020). Nine of the 10 world’s tallest buildings are in Asia. In addition, the continent now has more 150-meter (about 492 feet) or taller buildings than the rest of the continents combined.

“Our reference points to these mysterious words can be found in Hollywood entertainment such as ‘The Sopranos’ or ‘Boardwalk Empire,’” Mr. Blau wrote.","To those among us fortunate enough to have known old-timers who regaled us with tales of tabloid derring-do, New York was once a place of outrageous characters both in front of and behind the camera. Like players in “The Front Page,” hordes of cigar-chomping, fedora-wearing men plied their trade as a contact sport that was not above recreating scenes or putting a prop or two — like a lonesome looking doll — into everyday moments of tragedy.

In this cast of characters, Weegee was the Dante of New York’s nighttime demimonde. His photos, of swells and speakeasies, crime and crowds, or perps and play, are a singular record of New York City in the 1930s and ’40s. And just when you thought you had seen all of his work, a new book, “Extra! Weegee,” features vintage prints — many previously unseen — that captures Weegee’s singular point of view.

Daniel Blau, the book’s editor, admitted that he had “never really liked Weegee.” Obviously, he has since come to his senses, putting together an impressive volume that captures the many sides of New York as it approached World War II. The images were found in the archives of the Newspaper Enterprise Association, a syndicate founded at the turn of the last century by Edward Willis Scripps. The photos — which had been taken for the association’s Acme Newspictures service — passed through the hands of several owners, and were discovered in storage in 2012 by Ryan Adams.

These prints, Mr. Blau wrote in the book, changed his mind, as he saw pictures vastly different from those he had encountered 30 years earlier in some badly reproduced volume. And in a nod to the current daily torrent of images, these photos had an air of mystery, he said, and the mark of a master.

Weegee, born Ascher Fellig in 1899 in what is now Ukraine, lived a spartan existence down by the old New York Police headquarters in Lower Manhattan. That’s not surprising, since his realm was the streets. And the images he shot revealed not just a knowledge of people and places, but an appreciation for the ironic, odd or absurd.

A car dangles off the roadway that encircles Grand Central Terminal, with a “ONE WAY” arrow pointing at it, while two men stand under an awning, not oblivious, but not impressed, either. In another, an overturned vehicle rests on its side, with a sign reading “SLOW DOWN” hovering behind it like an unheeded warning.

Photo

Working crowds, you have images of a sweaty, packed throng in Coney Island and people celebrating the end of World War II. A jubilant sailor is surrounded by four women, flanking a sign he held declaring: “$2,000 In Bank Now I’m Looking for a Wife,” with “18-40” added at the bottom. An image of gawkers at a murder scene is a collage of mostly children’s faces, some goofy, arrayed around one woman whose grief is etched on her face.

He also found the lighter side, showing teenaged bobbysoxers jitterbugging in the aisles of a theater, dogs and cats, and even a gorilla. The book is divided into chapters that all start with “EXTRA!” and are devoted to topics like Crime, Cool, Friends, Characters and more.

Of course, the main character on this sidewalk stage is Weegee himself. Mr. Blau deftly connects the man and his era to how we and Hollywood — to which Weegee decamped in 1947 to try his hand at acting — now perceive it.

“Our reference points to these mysterious words can be found in Hollywood entertainment such as ‘The Sopranos’ or ‘Boardwalk Empire,’” Mr. Blau wrote. “Weegee made these possible. He was a game changer — breaking new ground in both photography and photojournalism. Using a camera to tell a story as others used their pen or speech.”

Mr. Blau concludes that while Weegee may have left to be a movie actor, he had long been on that path.

“By then he had already made all the films he wanted,” he wrote. “All films made of a single frame. All telling a story in one take. Today I love these short films.”

But one of the refugees on Manus, Amir Taghinia, said that there was confusion about what the offer might mean for the men hoping to be granted asylum in the United States. Mr. Taghinia, who fled Iran five years ago, added that many refugees feared that “transferring from one prison to another prison” made their chances of getting to the United States more remote.

He said that he had been interviewed by the American Department of Homeland Security and had started his resettlement application.

Bookstores will return shopworn books or those damaged in shipping under the category of “hurt books.” The publisher sells these books as used books. Online bookstores may buy them in bulk, sort through them, and resell as “new” the least damaged through Amazon.

Publishers sell books to international wholesalers at large discounts on a non-returnable basis. By contract these books must be sold abroad, but wholesalers could quietly dump these books in the American market through a third-party seller on Amazon, cheating the publisher.

Print-on-demand has created a new unscrupulous enterprise, that of counterfeiting books. These books look perfect; there is no way for the customer to tell they are illegal.

And finally, a number of review copies are sent out free to media outlets. They are not supposed to be sold. Some book sellers apparently have standing arrangements with magazine conglomerates and television networks to bulk purchase all the review copies they receive, which they could presumably then sell on Amazon. While this isn’t strictly illegal, it is unethical — and terribly unfair to authors and publishers.

These third-party sellers may not always be selling “new” books, according to Amazon’s own published definitions on its website, which, in part, read:

“New: A brand-new, unused, unread copy in perfect condition. The dust cover and original protective wrapping, if any, is intact.”

“Used — Like New: Dust cover is intact, with no nicks or tears. Spine has no signs of creasing. Pages are clean and not marred by notes or folds of any kind.”

In many of these sales, the author gets zilch, or close to zilch. And, according to the Independent Book Publishers Association, which has been conducting its own research into the issue by purchasing books on Amazon, the customer is sometimes sold a used book under false pretenses.

Publishers and authors, deprived of income and royalties, have long worried about this gray market. Amazon, to its credit, quickly tightened up its definition of a “new” book, to the one cited above. These definitions make clear that remainders are not regarded as “new” books, and the company insists that it follows a strict policy as to what qualifies.

“Only new books are eligible to be featured in the U.S. Books New Buy Box and be the ‘primary offer’ on a book’s detail page, whether offered from third party sellers or Amazon,” a company spokersperson said. “We move quickly to address any violations. These recent changes mean that our U.S. online bookstore now works like the rest of Amazon.com, where third party sellers compete with Amazon for the sale of new items.”

The Authors Guild has urged publishers to keep better track of remainders, overstocks and excess-discount sales, and some publishers have responded. But the cost of policing the market, marking and tracking books, and suing malefactors has proved daunting. Remainder overstock sales bring some revenue for publishers, but the authors receive little to no royalties.

Amazon, in its drive to take over the book market, has made a change that, at least inadvertently, can mislead its own customers and be hurtful to authors. The Amazon action comes at a time when authors are struggling more than ever to make a living in the harsh economics of the digital marketplace. Amazon’s policy will help undermine authors’ incomes even further if it directs customers to “new” books for which the author receives no royalty.

Comments posted online by buyers of everything from camera equipment to fountain pens suggest that Amazon’s third-party sellers sometimes operate in a broadly gray area, failing to disclose provenance before a sale. Only after buyers try to repair broken items do they learn warranties aren’t honored because the goods are gray.

Amazon does what it can to rein in bad actors but it is at the top of a slippery slope in turning over its main buy button for new books to third-party sellers.

Ahmed Yousef, an adviser to the Hamas leader, Ismail Haniya, said the two sides had agreed to joint control over the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, a key lifeline for Gaza’s residents.

Reacting to news reports, citing Fatah officials, that Fatah would take control of the crossing, he said, “We will discuss the possibility of allowing the presidential guard from the West Bank to control it.”

Mr. Yousef said the two sides would convene committees to integrate their ministries into a reconciliation government. One major challenge, he said, would be to reduce the bloated, 200,000-strong Palestinian civil service, which he estimated needs to be cut by as much as 20 per cent.

But, he added, the two sides had not discussed a number of critical questions, including a joint strategy for dealing with Israel, the conduct of any future elections and, crucially, the state of the Hamas military wing.

When leaders from Hamas and Fatah signed a similar deal in 2011, Mr. Abbas said, “We have turned the black page of division forever.” But the deal quickly foundered amid opposition from Israel, which denounced it as a “victory for terrorism.”

This time, a broad Arab coalition is backing the deal, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

“This merger is going to cost a lot of money, and they will help us financially,” said Mr. Yousef, referring to Emirati and Saudi support for the deal. “The Egyptians also clearly got a green light from America. They are obviously trying to cook up something to help end this conflict.”","Hamas and Fatah Sign Unity Deal, Allowing Joint Control of Gaza",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/world/middleeast/palestinians-fatah-hamas-gaza.html

Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com.

‘Give Me a Break, White Cosby’

Most male late-night hosts have not made much of the Harvey Weinstein scandal. But on Wednesday, Samantha Bee led “Full Frontal” with a full-on attack. She started by taking aim at Mr. Weinstein’s response last week to the initial reports that he’d sexually harassed women throughout his career.

“When the scandal broke, Weinstein made an apology-like statement in The New York Post, saying, ‘I have got to change, I’ve got to grow.’ ‘I know a lot of people would like me to go into a facility.’ Oh my God, I’m so behind in the slang. Is a facility what people call hell?” — SAMANTHA BEE

Ms. Bee was also irked by Mr. Weinstein’s statement that “I came of age in the ’60s and ’70s, when all the rules about behavior and workplaces were different.”

“Oh, give me a break, White Cosby. Nobody asked for your ‘all about mea culpa.’ Don’t blame the ’60s and ’70s for your [expletive] decision making. It’s serial sexual harassment, not a Monkees tattoo.” — SAMANTHA BEE

Colbert Wants to Revoke Trump’s Right to Tweet

President Trump suggested on Wednesday that the Federal Communications Commission should consider revoking NBC’s broadcasting license for publishing stories he finds objectionable. Stephen Colbert has another idea.

“Interesting question. I have two follow-ups: When is it appropriate for Twitter to deactivate the account of a president who doesn’t believe in the First Amendment? And, can that be yesterday?” — STEPHEN COLBERT

Jimmy Fallon wondered whether Mr. Trump had forgotten about the First Amendment entirely.

“Trump said it’s disgusting that the press is allowed to write whatever it wants to write. When asked about the First Amendment, he said, ‘Is that the one that says not to talk about Fight Club?’” — JIMMY FALLON

Roger Goodell and How to ‘Solve Racism’

Mr. Colbert also went after the N.F.L. commissioner, Roger Goodell, who appears to be taking steps to prevent players from kneeling in protest during the national anthem.

“Goodell sent a letter to all N.F.L. teams saying that ‘the controversy over the anthem is a barrier to having honest conversations and making real progress on the underlying issues.’ Yeah, come on, guys. That protest you’re doing to get us to talk about racism is keeping us from talking about racism! How are we supposed to fix the problem if you keep reminding us what the problem is?” — STEPHEN COLBERT “Now, standing for the national anthem isn’t official N.F.L. policy yet, but ‘team owners will discuss a plan when they meet next week.’ Well, that’s a relief. If a room full of rich, white men can’t solve racism, nobody can.” — STEPHEN COLBERT, quoting a Washington Post article from Tuesday

The Punchiest Punchlines (Fetal-Position Edition)

“Apparently, over the summer, Donald Trump met with top military officials and said he wanted a nearly tenfold increase in the nuclear arsenal. A tenfold increase? Excuse me while I one-fold into the fetal position.” — STEPHEN COLBERT “A painting of Jesus by the master Leonardo da Vinci has been rediscovered, and experts say it could fetch up to $100 million at auction. Yeah, and this is interesting: Jesus Christ is both the subject of painting and what everyone screamed when they heard how much it was going to cost.” — JAMES CORDEN

Large-group plans are still subject to some requirements of the Affordable Care Act.
The Trump administration is also looking for ways to ease restrictions on short-term health insurance plans that do not meet requirements of the Affordable Care Act.
The introduction of new association plans could take much longer, according to insurers and other experts.
While association health plans can be well run, they “have had a spotty track record,” said Ms. Owen, the actuary.","“By siphoning off healthy individuals, these junk plans could cannibalize the insurance exchanges,” said Topher Spiro, a vice president of the Center for American Progress, a liberal research and advocacy group. “For older, sicker people left behind in plans regulated under the Affordable Care Act, premiums could increase.”

But to business groups, the executive order offers an opportunity to bind their members together and sell large-group insurance policies that are cheap and attractive. Dirk Van Dongen, the president of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, said that he was delighted with Mr. Trump’s initiative and that his group would seriously consider establishing an association health plan.

“Small to midsize businesses have very little leverage in the insurance market,” Mr. Van Dongen said. “Anything that allows them to amalgamate their purchasing power will be helpful.”

Large employer-sponsored health plans are generally subject to fewer federal insurance requirements than small group plans and coverage purchased by individuals and families on their own. They are generally not required to provide “essential health benefits,” such as emergency services, maternity and newborn care, mental health coverage and substance abuse treatment, although many do.

A decision by Obama appointees in 2011 discouraged the use of association health plans as a substitute for Affordable Care Act policies because officials feared they would be used to circumvent the law’s coverage mandates. The Obama administration said that coverage offered to dozens or hundreds of small businesses through a trade or professional association would not be treated as a single large employer health plan for the purpose of insurance regulation.

Instead, the Obama administration said, the government would look at the size of each business participating in the association, so that many small employers would still be subject to stringent federal rules.

The Trump administration, by contrast, wants to make it easier for small businesses to buy less expensive plans that do not comply with some requirements of the 2010 law.

Several states considered bills to treat health plans offered to small employers through a trade association as large-group coverage, exempt from federal rules that apply to small businesses. But the Obama administration blocked those efforts, saying they were pre-empted by the Affordable Care Act. Trump administration officials are reconsidering that interpretation, in view of the president’s vow to increase access to less expensive insurance.

Large-group plans are still subject to some requirements of the Affordable Care Act. They generally must cover children up to age 26 on their parents’ plans, cannot impose lifetime limits on covered benefits and cannot charge co-payments for preventive services like mammograms and colonoscopies.

But they are generally exempt from the requirements to provide a specified package of benefits and to cover a certain percentage of the cost of covered services.

The Trump administration is also looking for ways to ease restrictions on short-term health insurance plans that do not meet requirements of the Affordable Care Act. Under a rule issued last October by the Obama administration, the duration of such short-term plans, purchased by hundreds of thousands of people seeking inexpensive insurance, must be less than three months. The rules previously said “less than 12 months.”

The Obama administration said some insurers were abusing short-term plans and keeping healthier consumers out of the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. People are buying these short-term plans as their “primary form of health coverage,” and some insurers are pitching the products to healthier people, the Obama administration said.

But Trump administration officials say that with insurance premiums soaring in many states, consumers should be able to buy less comprehensive, less expensive coverage as an alternative to conventional plans. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said short-term policies “serve an important purpose for consumers” who are between jobs.

That has some insurance experts worried. The influx of a set of plans exempt from the Affordable Care Act rules will essentially divide the market and make it increasingly unstable, said Rebecca Owen, a health research actuary with the Society of Actuaries.

People who want or need broad coverage could find it increasingly difficult to obtain an affordable policy, experts say. While the administration’s goal may be to give people a broader choice of plans, it could have the opposite effect on people who need or want the robust coverage available under the Affordable Care Act.

“The easier you make it not to buy comprehensive coverage, the harder you make it to buy comprehensive coverage,” said Katherine Hempstead, a health policy expert at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

As they waited for details of the executive order, health insurers still offering coverage in the online marketplaces created by the health care law were apprehensive.

Those insurers are most jittery about the possibility of a surge in short-term plans. Many of the large national insurers, like UnitedHealth Group, already offer these plans, and there would be little difficulty in their introducing more because of the executive order, analysts said.

“They can cobble these things together pretty easily,” said John Graves, a health policy expert at Vanderbilt University.

Individuals may already be attracted to short-term plans because of their low costs. These plans tend to limit benefits or offer policies only to people who do not have expensive medical conditions.

Short-term policies do not satisfy the coverage requirements of the Affordable Care Act, so consumers who buy them may be subject to tax penalties. But with the price of conventional insurance policies rising at double-digit rates, some people say they are willing to pay a penalty so they can buy a cheaper plan.

The introduction of new association plans could take much longer, according to insurers and other experts. The administration would need to work out the regulatory details, and groups would need to construct those plans.

But these plans pose some of the same risks, and industry experts warn that they have a history of leaving consumers with unpaid medical bills if they are not adequately regulated.

While association health plans can be well run, they “have had a spotty track record,” said Ms. Owen, the actuary. In the past, some plans failed because they did not have enough money to pay their customers’ medical bills, while some insurance companies were accused of misleading people about exactly what the plans would cover.","Foiled in Congress, Trump Moves on His Own to Undermine Obamacare",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/us/politics/trump-obamacare-executive-order.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

A ban on the “bump stock” devices that made the Las Vegas attack so deadly would enjoy broad public support, according to a new poll. Yet gun policy experts say a ban would probably have a negligible effect on mass shooting deaths.

In the aftermath of the attack, in which 58 people were killed at a country music festival on Oct. 1, the only gun-related legislation generating any serious political discussion is a ban on bump stocks, devices that enable a semiautomatic weapon to shoot nearly as fast as a machine gun.

A bump stock ban was supported by 72 percent of registered voters in a survey conducted last week for The Upshot by Morning Consult, a polling and media company. The measure even garnered 68 percent support from Republicans; Democrats favored it by 79 percent.

Stephen Paddock, the Las Vegas shooter, had affixed bump stocks to a dozen weapons found in the hotel room where he conducted the shooting, and the pattern of his fire was consistent with their use. His is the first high-profile mass shooting to involve such a device.

But several gun policy experts said it was difficult to assess the safety benefits of making such devices harder to obtain.

“Until now, bump stocks have been a non-issue in firearm homicide (mass or not),” wrote April Zeoli, an associate professor at the Michigan State University School of Criminal Justice, in an email. “But now that the door has been opened for their use, I suspect that future mass shooters may use them.”

Ms. Zeoli was one of a panel of experts we surveyed about an array of gun control ideas last year. On average, the experts we were able to recontact thought that banning bump stocks was likely to have a small effect on mass shooting fatalities. They ranked it similarly to requiring gun owners to complete safety training and requiring technology that stamps each bullet with a mark that can trace it to a particular gun.

Our poll last year showed that the public favors many gun control ideas, including some that our experts thought would be more effective than a bump stock ban: Universal background checks and restrictions on guns sales to people with violent misdemeanor convictions were substantially more popular. Last week Politico and Morning Consult conducted a poll on those very same measures, and public opinion about them hasn’t shifted much since last year.

The future of a bump stock ban is uncertain. Legislation from Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat from California, has received a warm if not enthusiastic reception from several Republicans in Congress. President Trump said the White House would look into the idea, despite promises to use his presidency to expand gun rights. The National Rifle Association, which is generally opposed to any gun restrictions, did not entirely reject the idea, though it indicated that it hoped for regulatory restrictions and not a legislative ban. But the legislation has not progressed and might not.",A Bump Stock Ban Is Popular With the Public.

Fences are going up across New York.

The provocative Chinese artist Ai Weiwei — a “once and future New Yorker” — is unleashing one of the biggest public art projects in his repertoire across the city today.

His exhibition, “Good Fences Make Good Neighbors,” is intended to make us think twice about the simple concept of a fence. The fences — which generally create boundaries or borders — are meant to elicit reflections on pervasive, present-day issues like the exclusion of immigrants, the global refugee crisis, or our dangerous social and political divisiveness.

You can see the centerpieces of Mr. Ai’s project, composed of more than 300 works of art commissioned by the Public Art Fund, along the southeast corner of Central Park, in Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village, and by the Unisphere in Flushing Meadows Corona Park in Queens. (Or use this interactive map to search for other pieces near you.)

Mr. Rajoy said on Wednesday that he would “continue to act with prudence” and put the onus on Mr. Puigdemont to explain himself.
He told lawmakers Mr. Puigdemont had sought to justify independence based on an “illegal and fraudulent referendum.”“What is not legal isn’t democratic,” he said.
Separately, public prosecutors could open criminal proceedings against Mr. Puigdemont and his government.
On Monday, Pablo Casado, the spokesman for Mr. Rajoy’s governing party, warned that Mr. Puigdemont could be imprisoned for insurrection.","Mr. Rajoy, whose remarks came after an emergency cabinet meeting earlier in the day about how to address the situation in Catalonia, addressed the Spanish Parliament later in the day.

While Mr. Puigdemont is facing a fight for his own political survival — hard-line separatists have denounced his failure to deliver a clear message of independence — Mr. Rajoy appears to have consolidated his power base in Madrid, where he has been in charge of a minority government since late 2016.

Spain’s main opposition Socialist party expressed support for Mr. Rajoy as he discussed using Article 155, an idea it has been more reluctant to endorse in the past. Pedro Sánchez, the Socialist leader, said at a news conference that his party also supported Mr. Rajoy in his demands “to clarify and get out of the quagmire in which Mr. Puigdemont has put Catalan politics.”

Mr. Sánchez also said he had reached an agreement with Mr. Rajoy to form a commission on changing the Constitution. “The Spain of 2017 is not the same as that of 1978,” he said, referring to the year the document enshrined Spain’s return to democracy.

The commission is not expected to complete its preliminary report for six months, however, so its work is likely to have little influence on the conflict with the Catalan separatists.

Mr. Rajoy is under intense pressure from his own lawmakers to stop Catalan secessionism in its tracks, but he is also aware that strong reprisals against Mr. Puigdemont could galvanize the independence movement.

Mr. Rajoy’s comments on Wednesday were his first formal response to the events of the previous evening, when Mr. Puigdemont appeared to declare independence from Spain in an address to the Catalan Parliament — then immediately suspended that decision to allow for more “dialogue” with Madrid.

Further muddying the waters, Mr. Puigdemont and separatist lawmakers later signed a declaration of independence, a step set in motion by a highly disputed referendum on Oct. 1 that went ahead despite being suspended by the Spanish Constitutional Court.

During Wednesday’s parliamentary debate, Mr. Rajoy insisted that Spain didn’t need outside help to resolve an issue of national sovereignty — a view that was also backed by the Socialists. Margarita Robles, the parliamentary spokeswoman for the Socialists, said that Spain’s problems should be handled by its own lawmakers. “We don’t need more mediators than ourselves,” she said.

Most Madrid-based newspapers and television talk shows ridiculed Mr. Puigdemont’s speech on Tuesday and described his call for negotiations with Madrid as an act of desperation.

The headline in El Mundo described the night’s events as “farce and blackmail.” Susanna Griso, a news anchor on Antena 3, said the Catalan parliamentary session swung “between tragedy and comedy.”

Spanish legal experts say that if Mr. Puigdemont confirms that the region is declaring independence, Mr. Rajoy will almost certainly intervene forcefully in Catalonia.

Mr. Rajoy, who has stood firm against the separatists, has a battery of potential emergency measures available to him. Along with Article 155, there is also a national emergency law that his government enacted in 2015.

But the prime minister has a long record as a cautious politician who has stayed on the front line of Spanish politics for two decades by steering clear of difficult decisions and letting rivals dig themselves into holes. Mr. Rajoy said on Wednesday that he would “continue to act with prudence” and put the onus on Mr. Puigdemont to explain himself.

Mr. Rajoy also argued that the Catalan separatists had never gotten a majority of votes in an election to justify secession, and so could not claim to be acting in the name of the Catalan people. He told lawmakers Mr. Puigdemont had sought to justify independence based on an “illegal and fraudulent referendum.”

“What is not legal isn’t democratic,” he said.

Invoking Article 155, which requires Senate approval, would allow Mr. Rajoy to suspend the political institutions of Catalonia for as long as he believes necessary, including its regional government and Parliament. His government could also take over the leadership of the region’s autonomous police force and its public broadcaster.

Mr. Rajoy told lawmakers on Wednesday that the separatists should be held responsible for hurting Catalonia’s economy and leading major companies to relocate outside the region because of the legal uncertainty generated by possible secession. He said Barcelona, Spain’s tourism hub, was suffering as foreigners worried about street unrest.

“There have been more travel warnings issued because of the unrest than because of the terrorist attacks,” Mr. Rajoy told Parliament, referring to the attacks that killed 16 people in August, most of them on Barcelona’s most famous promenade.

Separately, public prosecutors could open criminal proceedings against Mr. Puigdemont and his government. On Monday, Pablo Casado, the spokesman for Mr. Rajoy’s governing party, warned that Mr. Puigdemont could be imprisoned for insurrection.

But Ignacio González Vega, a spokesman for an association of Spanish judges, warned on Wednesday that “a political issue cannot be resolved only by applying laws.” He told Antena 3 that Mr. Rajoy “will have to step in with a lot of sensitivity, because these measures are very serious.”",Spain Asks Catalonia: Did You Declare Independence or Not?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/world/europe/catalonia-spain-independence-mariano-rajoy.html

“He should be talking to reporters.”Over the years, Mr. Weinstein spent as much time schmoozing reporters as he did berating them.
They’re the ones who finally brought the real Mr. Weinstein to light.","At a time when the news media is under financial distress, when billionaires with political agendas or personal grudges, like the Silicon Valley investor Peter Thiel, have shown a willingness to fund lawsuits able to run media entities out of business — as Mr. Thiel did to Gawker — legal threats are newly intimidating.

It is far worse for the victims of those in power, who are all too aware that speaking up may lead to stalled careers and ruined reputations. Many women who have fought back against sleazy, powerful men by filing lawsuits against them often end up with the consolation prize of an out-of-court settlement that comes complete with a nondisclosure agreement dictating that they must remain silent on the matter forevermore or face a steep financial penalty.

In this climate, breaking a story that includes tough accusations against those in high places requires more than a scrappy reporter with a notebook. It means having the resources to work the story exclusively for months. It means withstanding any legal challenges that may come. It means coaxing understandably reluctant victims to speak out against those who have the means and motivation to crush them.

In the days since The New York Times first published an article on Mr. Weinstein that named names and included details of at least eight settlements, a number of reporters and editors have spoken of their own missed chances to write the story earlier. For many journalists, Mr. Weinstein was the white whale that got away.

Bruce Headlam, a former editor for the late Times media columnist David Carr, told me that Mr. Carr twice came close to nailing down a story about abuses committed by Mr. Weinstein. In both cases, the accuser “backed out after agreeing to talk.”

There were similar stories of failed attempts involving Kim Masters of The Hollywood Reporter, Ken Auletta of The New Yorker, Benjamin Wallace of New York magazine and Times reporters.

As David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker, told me on Wednesday, a news organization cannot go after a powerful figure or institution if it does not have the resources for lawyers, fact checkers and experienced editors who won’t be intimidated by the protection racket.

“Journalistic institutions like these are rare and the times, the economic and political times, have made them fragile and essential at the same time,” Mr. Remnick said. “The stakes are very high.”

Publishing aggressive stories like the ones about Mr. Weinstein can be costly in other ways. As The Times’s executive editor, Dean Baquet, told me, “Harvey Weinstein is an advertiser – but that never even crossed my mind.”

Mr. Baquet added that he did not know how much the Weinstein Company spent to advertise its movies in The Times, but the newspaper was too large to be influenced by any amount. “That’s the other thing – you have to have the size and the history to not even take that into account.”

It costs serious money to give two reporters the go-ahead to devote months to an article that may or may not pan out, as The Times did in the case of Mr. Weinstein, especially as legal threats loom.

The threats, however, were combined with a personal touch from Mr. Weinstein, which, Mr. Baquet said, he rebuffed. “Harvey Weinstein a few times reached out to me to talk about the story, and I told him I did not think it was appropriate for him to talk to the executive editor about a story,” Mr. Baquet said. “He should be talking to reporters.”

Over the years, Mr. Weinstein spent as much time schmoozing reporters as he did berating them. A.J. Benza, a former gossip columnist at The Daily News – and, for a time, my colleague on the paper’s “Hot Copy” gossip column – described how Mr. Weinstein would provide him with access to the director Quentin Tarantino or the actress Salma Hayek as they were making their way into Hollywood’s stratosphere. He also provided Mr. Benza with invitations to his famous Oscar parties.

“I’ll put it this way: There’s a certain feeling you get when you’re allowed in those parties and other journalists are on the other side of the rope and can’t get through,” Mr. Benza said.

Tina Brown, with whom Mr. Weinstein started Talk magazine in 1999, wrote this week that the mogul kept a number of his journalists on his good side with sweet consultancy or development deals with Miramax.

“Another of his co-opting tactics,” she wrote for the Women in the World Summit she sponsors with The New York Times, “was to offer a juicy negative nugget about one of the movie stars in his films or people in his media circle (fairly often, me) in a trade to quash a dangerous piece about himself.”

Mr. Weinstein’s expertise in media manipulation was evident after the model Ambra Battilana Gutierrez went to the police with her charge that Mr. Weinstein forced himself on her at his TriBeCa offices in 2015. “Role Play: ‘Grope’ gal asked for movie part,” screamed a front-page New York Post headline above a large photo of Ms. Gutierrez a few days later. (A spokesman for The Post did not respond with a comment.)

The tabloid cover served as a warning to anyone else who might have considered challenging Mr. Weinstein and others of his ilk.

But her teenage discovery that her grandmother’s town was once home to thousands of Jews who perished in the Holocaust set her on a different path: a 30-year journey documenting persecuted religious minorities around the world.

Today she no longer considers herself religious “in terms of attending church,” but she appreciates the spiritual passion and ecstasy she documents in religious settings in far-flung countries. “My work can be a kind of prayer,” she said. “With time, I understood that what is interesting to me is not God — but God in people.”

Her research has led her to photograph Sufis in northern Africa, Christians in the Middle East, Tibetan Buddhist monks, Old Believers in Eastern Europe, Voudou practitioners in Haiti and Hasids in Galilee. Photographs from her work since 2001 are now featured in a book, “Where Gods Whisper,” published by Contrasto Books.

She has documented the unspeakable cruelties committed in the name of religion as well as uplifting moments of fellowship among Jews, Christians and Muslims. Her mission, to photograph oppressed religious minorities, she said, is a “kind of moral and ethical necessity.”

As a teenager, she had photographed Russian Orthodox churches where she felt seduced by the mysticism and the smells, colors and sounds that washed over her. At 19, she wandered along the borders of eastern Poland searching for remnants of communities and interviewing Byzantine Christians, Jews and Muslim Tatars. She has continued this work in pilgrimages to holy sites across five continents — teaching herself photography along the way.

Her grandparents’ house in Warka was a veritable shrine. “In one corner stood Our Lady of Perpetual Help, in another Our Lady of Sorrows,” she said and on Good Friday the townsfolk gathered in a Baroque church overlooking the river, where they knelt in prayer.

She was 6 when she learned that this had not always been the case.

“Beyond the bridge there was a sand hill that reared up steep as a mountain to our young eyes,” she wrote in “God’s People: A Travel Into Another Europe,” an earlier book. “In winter, our favourite sport was sledding down it and breaking the ice around the willows on the riverbank. One day around Christmas, my sled hit a rock and when I looked closely, I could see strange signs under the snow. Digging with my hands, I unearthed a sculpted lion. This lion buried in the snow, with arcane signs like hieroglyphics, left me breathless with astonishment. I felt as if I had discovered something fabulous, like those great sea captains and explorers, Ahab, Fridtjof Nansen and Eric the Red, that I had read about in the books my grandfather kept for us on his bookshelf.”

Ms. Bulaj had stumbled upon remains of a vibrant Jewish culture that had once flourished in her grandmother’s town, but had withered under centuries of virulent anti-Semitism and had ultimately been destroyed during the Holocaust. It was the town’s “total silence” about their former neighbors that led Ms. Bulaj to dedicate her life to documenting religious minorities.

Ms. Bulaj’s photographs bring us into the lives of endangered and oppressed communities while revealing the enduring power of spiritual experiences. Her work is a spiritual experience, too.

“I photograph instinctively,” she said. “I am close to them, I am touching them, I am crying for them.”

No one was killed. Injured victims have testified before the jury, describing injuries that have mostly healed. Not so for the Dumpster. Dumpsters never heal.

Outside the jury’s presence, lawyers on both sides have argued over the Dumpster for days. Mr. Rahimi’s legal team said in an Oct. 2 letter to the court that it is irrelevant to the case and it is “unduly prejudicial, and clearly a play for press.”

Judge Richard M. Berman allowed the Dumpster in the room, covered until he made his final ruling. That happened Thursday morning, when he said he would allow the Dumpster to be shown to the jury.

He wanted to know how the heavy Dumpster would be handled. More arguments followed, essentially over stagecraft. “I intend to walk up to the Dumpster, lift the cover off,” explained Shawn G. Crowley, a prosecutor. Then she and others who were “stronger” would push it before the jury.

Defense lawyers were unhappy. “We’re at a complete loss as to why this is necessary,” Matthew Larsen, part of that team, countered. He asked that the thing at least be uncovered before the trial resumed for the day instead of “some big dramatic” unveiling before jurors.

Judge Berman said no: “I get to be the director of the courtroom, and we’re going to do it that way.”

Showtime! Jurors took their seats and a detective on the witness stand identified the Dumpster in a photograph. The moment had arrived. Ms. Crowley grasped the white blanket and pulled.

“Do you recognize this?” she asked.

“Yes,” the detective said. “That’s the Dumpster.”

It rested on a cart. Prosecutors dragged it toward the jury. Judge Berman told jurors they were welcome to stand for a closer look, and they did, craning their necks.

The Dumpster lived up to the hype. It stood waist-high, bent and broken. The explosion had ripped through its center, flaying its sides outward like the petals of a dirty flower.

A sketch artist copied its contours. Jurors peered down as if looking at a car they were considering buying.

It was time for a break, and the jury left. Judge Berman invited reporters to approach the Dumpster if they wished.

Mr. Tsuge said Central Japan Railway would replace the parts when the affected trains underwent regular inspections, something that happens roughly once a year. The company does not plan to take the affected trains out of service.

Kobe Steel said on Sunday that employees had altered inspection certificates on aluminum and copper products to make it look as if they met manufacturing specifications required by customers, when in fact they did not. It said that about 4 percent of the company’s output of those products from September 2016 to August this year had been affected, but that it was examining other possible episodes of data falsification going back 10 years.

On Wednesday, Kobe Steel added two more products to the list of affected materials: powdered steel, which is used to create molded steel products like gears, and “target material,” a specialty mix of several kinds of metal used in the production of DVDs, television screens and other electronics equipment.

Kobe Steel’s admission has reverberated through supply chains and cast a shadow over Japan’s reputation for precision manufacturing. Kobe Steel said initially that it had shipped falsely certified aluminum and copper products to about 200 companies. Its customers include Toyota Motor, General Motors and Ford, as well as aircraft manufacturers like Boeing and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.

Kobe Steel was founded in 1905 and has been a pillar of Japan’s manufacturing sector. Such are its establishment bona fides that Shinzo Abe, the prime minister and scion of a political dynasty, worked at the company from 1979 to 1982 before entering politics.

Mr. Kawasaki, the Kobe Steel president, spoke on Thursday after a meeting with officials from the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, which regulates steel makers. In front of a throng of reporters, Mr. Kawasaki bowed to the officials and apologized for “creating feelings of distrust and worry for many people.”

Kobe Steel’s share price stabilized on Thursday after plunging by more than a third over the previous two days.

“The Puerto Rican parrot is an iconic species of the island,” Marisel López, leader of the The Puerto Rican Parrot Recovery Program, of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, said. “It’s our legacy.”

While there were tens of thousands in pre-Columbian times, the parrot population dwindled to 13 by 1973 because of deforestation, hunting and species competition. Conservation efforts since then have helped rebuild the population, and before Maria, the captive and wild population combined numbered over 500, Ms. López said. At least seven parrots died in captivity because of the stress induced by the hurricane and the high heat in the days after because of the lack of canopy, she said.

Ms. López, whose team is trying to gain access to the western part of El Yunque where the parrots live, said the toll in the wild population was not known.

The tourism industry in Puerto Rico is deeply intertwined with its environment.

About 1.2 million people visit El Yunque every year for its hiking trails, zip-lining, camping and waterfalls. But the rain forest has remained closed since Maria left roads inaccessible and all its recreational facilities received blows, Ms. Wallace, the forest supervisor, said.

“We don’t know how long it is going to take to reopen,” she said.

And on an island, where 58 percent of the acreage is forests, Maria’s ecological damage was widespread.

The population of mountain coquí, one of the 14 species of a small native frog, with a distinctive mating call heard at night across the island, was severely decimated by Hurricane Hugo in 1989, Rafael Joglar, a professor of biology at the University of Puerto Rico, said.

Hurricane Maria could be the final straw for that species, Mr. Joglar said.

For Democrats, the warning shots are coming thick and fast.

“More than half of Americans don’t think Donald Trump is fit to serve as president, yet he has a clear path to winning reelection,” Doug Sosnik, who served as President Bill Clinton’s political director, wrote in the Washington Post last week. “Are Democrats Headed for a McGovern Redux?” Alan Greenblatt asked in Politico on Oct. 9. On the same day, a New York Magazine headline declared: “No One Should Rule Out a Trump Re-election in 2020.”

What can Democrats do?

A Pew Research Center survey released earlier this month documented the growth of the partisan divide: “the median (middle) Republican is now more conservative than 97% of Democrats, and the median Democrat is more liberal than 95% of Republicans.” The two accompanying charts illustrate the heights partisanship has reached.

Much of the current polarization is driven by difference of opinion on issues of race and immigration. Ashley Jardina, a political scientist at Duke who has focused much of her research on the racial attitudes of whites, emailed me to comment:

It’s clear that the Democrats have lost many whites because of whites’ attitudes about race. We can see that over time, whites’ racial attitudes have become increasingly linked to their party identity, with more racially conservative whites identifying more with the Republican Party.

Disrupting this linkage is an uphill battle for Democrats:

Unfortunately, changing hearts and minds when it comes to racial attitudes is no easy task. What is more, there’s growing evidence that some of the previously effective tactics Democrats have used to call out Republican politicians for race-baiting no longer work especially well. If Republican political candidates continue to stoke racial attitudes and anti-immigrant sentiment, there’s reason to think they’ll continue to be politically effective, and it’s not entirely clear what Democrats can do to inoculate themselves against this strategy in the near term.

According to Cornell Belcher, a prominent Democratic pollster who worked for President Barack Obama, attempts to win white working class votes in presidential elections should not be the Democrats’ top priority. He wrote me:

The greatest threat to the next Democratic nominee for President isn’t white working class voters, but in fact our inability to cobble back and hold together the core of Obama’s back to back majority coalitions. The “protest vote” by millennials — HRC’s significant underperformance with younger voters, particularly younger voters of color — is actually where she was most notably off of Obama’s performance in the overall battleground aggregate.

Belcher pointed out that

when you have between 6 to 9 percent of younger voters of color breaking 3rd Party in their ‘protest vote’ that kills the Democrat’s chance to reach Obama’s margins most notably in places like Florida, Michigan and Wisconsin.

In terms of Congressional and state legislative contests, Belcher argues, “we can and should do better among non-college white voters” because they are crucial to the outcome in many districts. But doing so, he argues, will be a tremendous challenge:

When Trump stands up in front of his audience at rallies during the campaign and tells them he’s going to give them their country back, Trump is having a conversation about race. Our response is that we are going to raise the minimum wage — we are having a conversation about economics. We are playing checkers while Trump is playing chess. And he continues to do so as he focuses on things like Black N.F.L. players taking a knee. Until Democrats can inoculate against some of the heightened angst, most prominently found among blue collar whites, about the changing face of America, they will struggle to compete for white non-college voters.

Significantly, Belcher contends, the anxiety about rapid social change is politically salient. Offering economic palliatives will not adequately address that anxiety, he said:

Heightened tribal polarization is the primary hurdle to Democrats’ ability to better compete and win white non-college voters. Avoiding that conversation isn’t going to work. We can’t solve for that angst with a promise to simply help make college more affordable. Until we can better engage these voters in a conversation that lessens their very real angst about the changes that are happening in the country and pivot to a compelling narrative about how we all win the future together or divided we will certainly lose it to our competitors, Democrats will struggle mightily to compete for white non-college voters broadly and particularly in The South.

Arthur Lupia, a political scientist at the University of Michigan who is an expert in elections and party politics, wrote in an email that many voters in 2016 were worried about the rate of changes taking place in the racial and ethnic composition of their communities and in the continuing shift from manufacturing to service industries:

Republican strategists seem to understand the consequences of these changes. You can see this difference when contrasting the slogan “Make America Great Again” with the slogan “I’m with her.” The subject in the Trump tagline is America. The phrase directly addresses growing anxiety about the rate of change. The subject in the Clinton tagline is the candidate herself.

This difference played into a second Democratic liability, according to Lupia:

Many liberal elites, who see right-leaning voters as blindly following the edicts of an unbending dogma on many issues, have little to no awareness of their own blind allegiance to an unbending dogma on many issues. This blind spot, which has only grown in recent years, makes the left exceptionally easy to troll. In other words, the left’s lack of awareness of the excesses of their own evolving dogma makes it increasingly easy for Breitbart, Fox News, and similar-minded others to portray liberals as hypocritical and out of touch with the day-to-day lives of many Americans.

Voters who cast Republican ballots last year experience disproportionately higher levels of both cultural and economic anxiety than Democratic voters, Lupia argued, but “many people on the left mock this uncertainty and those who feel this uncertainty are quite good at knowing when they are being mocked.”

Bruce Cain, a political scientist at Stanford, agrees with Lupia in many respects, but places greater emphasis on economic policy as a coalition building mechanism:

The problem is both substantive and cultural, and hence the Democratic response has to be on two levels. Substantively, the party needs to develop a stronger program regarding the job opportunities and economic prospects of these angry white voters. If all the jobs and money are on the coasts, and the industries that used to support workers are increasingly automated and subject to complex trading across NAFTA countries, then we need to make sure that US workers have the skills to participate in that economy. We made only halfhearted efforts with respect to NAFTA and when they did not work well because workers did not want to move from their communities or because the job skills they got were not adequate, the party moved on.

Cain is critical of the lack of attention Democrats paid to economic issues in 2016:

Hillary taking support behind the blue curtain for granted is symptomatic of the party’s shift to middle and upper middle class professional and creative class workers. The party needs to offer policies that assist them, and it has to be something that moves forward towards engaging the new economy, not retreating to the past a la Trump.

In Cain’s view, the lack of focus on the economic needs of the heartland is of a piece with the sociocultural remoteness of Democratic elites:

The cultural problem is Democrats looking down their noses at blue collar work and flyover country. First, cut that shit out. Second, let’s get back to celebrating the work of those who fix pipes, install wind farms, etc. Many of us in Democrat bubble lands are just too full of ourselves. Also, let’s look at how to upgrade vocational schools and training to make it more prestigious, not places where people are relegated to because they cannot compete in a college prep curriculum.

Paul Begala, a Democratic consultant and adviser to Bill Clinton, also comes back to the cultural breach between upscale Democrats and the white working class and poses this basic question:

If you look at the Democratic platform, or Hillary’s speeches on the economy, Democrats have a raft of good ideas, loads of sound policies that would make life better for the white working class. So why have they rejected us?

White working-class Americans are “dying before their time,” Begala wrote in an email, specifically citing the rise in alcoholism, cirrhosis, drug addiction, overdoses, suicide and poisoning:

If the life expectancy of, say, Somali immigrants in Minnesota suddenly took a dive, Democrats would be falling all over each other trying to ascertain the causes and advocate the cures. We owe white working-class Americans no less.

Begala stresses that Democrats must show respect for the culture of the white working class:

As a straight, white, married, gun-owning, church-going man, many of my hunting buddies feel like Democrats have contempt for them.

Begala’s views are shared by Sosnik, who emailed me along the same lines:

More than any set of issues, the first thing that we Democrats need to do is to deal with the perception that the party is controlled by elites on the coasts who look down on the rest of the country. If we cannot overcome that core disconnect, we will never have a chance at getting their vote. That was part of Bill Clinton’s success as a politician.

Nathaniel Persily, a professor of law and political science at Stanford, makes the point succinctly, focusing on the importance of candidate recruitment: “How can the party nominate someone, or be led by someone, like Bill Clinton, rather than Hillary Clinton?”",Democrats Are Playing Checkers While Trump Is Playing Chess,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/opinion/democrats-are-playing-checkers-while-trump-is-playing-chess.html

People tend to associate O.C.D. with repetitive behaviors, and that’s partly true in Aza’s case: She has a wound on her finger, self-inflicted, that she continually reopens in order to drain and re-sanitize.

But her repetitive, intrusive thoughts are her true torment. She’s obsessed with — and repulsed by — the ecosystem of bacteria that seethes inside her, and the bacteria that live without. She can’t stop worrying about the rumble in her gut, or the breeding microbes therein, or the possibility of contracting an infection involving clostridium difficile, or the prospect of sweating, or not being able to stop sweating, or touching someone who is sweating. She has to fight off the insistent, unignorable urge to put hand sanitizer in her mouth. Sometimes the urge wins.

We spend long stretches inside Aza’s head, listening to these swift and unsteady thoughts. The rational part of her, the one that sees a therapist and fitfully takes medication, tries to talk herself down. But her mind is in the throes of a civil war.

“Please let me go,” Aza tells her unwanted thoughts at a particularly helpless moment. “I’ll do anything. I’ll stand down.”

If Green were writing in his usual register, he’d interrupt Aza’s descents into these cognitive spirals — or “light-swallowing wormholes,” as she once calls them — with a bit of humor. But he seems to have made a decision: If Aza can’t find relief, neither can we.

The first few chapters of “Turtles All the Way Down” are a little crude, a little awkward and a little slow to get off the ground — it’s as if Green needed extra time on the runway to overcome the weight of a success like “The Fault in Our Stars,” which became a touchstone for teenagers everywhere. (It has been rated 2,529,550 times on Goodreads, a number that continues to spin forward even as I type, like the odometer of a spaceship.) The premise: An Indianapolis billionaire has skipped town just before the police come to get him for bribery and fraud. A $100,000 reward is on offer to anyone who’s got the skinny on his whereabouts. Aza’s best friend, Daisy (the tornado), remembers that Aza knows this guy’s son. Wouldn’t he know something? And wouldn’t a hundred grand be grand?

Aza does know his son. She’d met him years ago at “Sad Camp,” a summer program for kids who’d lost one or both of their parents. Aza had lost her father; Davis, the billionaire’s son, lost his mother. Now it seems that both of his parents are gone.

So Aza reluctantly agrees to pay Davis a visit, and the novel — boom — begins in earnest. The two feel an ancient kinship, a bonding of broken souls. He’s terrified that his identity is inseparable from his money; she’s terrified that her identity is inseparable from her thoughts — aren’t people the sum of their thoughts? If they aren’t, what are they? “If you can’t pick what you do or think about,” she explains to him, “then maybe you aren’t really real, you know?”

A sweet, conventional love story begins. But it hits a bittersweet, unconventional dead end. Aza can’t kiss Davis without panicking. All those microbes. “I’m not gonna un-have this,” she miserably explains of her condition.

Still they bond. And Aza and Daisy try to solve the mystery of Davis’s father’s disappearance. At one point, Daisy gives Aza hell — doesn’t she see how her mental illness has made her self-absorbed? — and it’s awful. Then it isn’t. The friendships in Green’s novels are stirring and powerful. They’re one of the reasons we show up to read them.

“You are my favorite person,” Daisy tells Aza after they’ve reconciled. “I want to be buried next to you. We’ll have a shared tombstone.”

But the real question is: How does such a story end for Aza?

If an author has integrity, it should end plausibly. Green has integrity. He also has O.C.D. He’s tweeted about it; he’s discussed it on his famous video blog with his brother, Hank. Watch his entry from July 25 sometime.

We’re quite willing to disparage anyone when, as Marilynne Robinson once put it, “the reward is the pleasure of sharing an attitude one knows is socially approved.” And when we don’t really know a subject well enough, in T. S. Eliot’s words, “we tend always to substitute emotions for thoughts,” and go with whatever idea makes us feel popular.

This is where Alan Jacobs’s absolutely splendid forthcoming book “How to Think” comes in. If Thaler’s work is essential for understanding how the market can go astray, Jacobs’s emphasis on the relational nature of thinking is essential for understanding why there is so much bad thinking in political life right now.

Jacobs makes good use of C. S. Lewis’s concept of the Inner Ring. In every setting — a school, a company or a society — there is an official hierarchy. But there may also be a separate prestige hierarchy, where the cool kids are. They are the Inner Ring.

There are always going to be people who desperately want to get into the Inner Ring and will cut all sorts of intellectual corners to be accepted. As Lewis put it, “The passion for the Inner Ring is most skillful in making a man who is not yet a very bad man do very bad things.”

People will, for example, identify and attack what Jacobs calls the Repugnant Cultural Other — the group that is opposed to the Inner Ring, which must be assaulted to establish membership in it.

Other people will resent the Inner Ring, and they will cut all sorts of intellectual corners in order to show their resentment. These people are quick to use combat metaphors when they talk about thinking (he shot down my argument, your claims are indefensible). These people will adopt shared vague slurs like “cuckservative” or “whitesplaining” that signal to the others in the outsider groups that they are attacking the ring, even though these slurs are usually impediments to thought.

Jacobs notices that when somebody uses “in other words” to summarize another’s argument, what follows is almost invariably a ridiculous caricature of that argument, in order to win favor with the team. David Foster Wallace once called such people Snoots. Their motto is, “We Are the Few, the Proud, the More or Less Constantly Appalled at Everyone Else.”

Jacobs nicely shows how our thinking processes emerge from emotional life and moral character. If your heart and soul are twisted, your response to the world will be, too. He argues that by diagnosing our own ills, we can begin to combat them. And certainly I can think of individual beacons of intellectual honesty today: George Packer, Tyler Cowen, Scott Alexander and Caitlin Flanagan, among many.

But I’d say that if social life can get us into trouble, social life can get us out. After all, think of how you really persuade people. Do you do it by writing thoughtful essays that carefully marshal facts? That works some of the time. But the real way to persuade people is to create an attractive community that people want to join. If you do that, they’ll bend their opinions to yours. If you want people to be reasonable, create groups where it’s cool to be reasonable.

Jacobs mentions that at the Yale Political Union members are admired if they can point to a time when a debate totally changed their mind on something. That means they take evidence seriously; that means they can enter into another’s mind-set. It means they treat debate as a learning exercise and not just as a means to victory.

How many public institutions celebrate these virtues? The U.S. Senate? Most TV talk shows? Even the universities?

Vicki Eastus, a puzzle solver in Brooklyn, put it this way: “The more hectic life is, the more calming I find filling in those little boxes.”

Search the internet for research on the impact of puzzle-solving on the brain, and you’ll find plenty of studies. But the results are mixed, and it’s not clear whether puzzle solving has any purely physiological benefits.

The psychological benefits, though, are not in question.

“When you do a puzzle, the mind becomes completely absorbed in the task at hand,” said Joanne Cohen-Katz, a psychologist in Allentown, Pa. “There is total focus on what is happening in the moment, which is the definition of mindfulness. And we know that mindfulness results in all sorts of positive changes in the brain.”

For one, solving a crossword can be a path to serenity in a world of uncertainty.

“I don’t think I have to sell you on the increased demand for this type of pastime in an increasingly worried world,” wrote Margaret Farrar, the first crossword editor of The Times, in a memo to Lester Markel, the Sunday editor, after the Pearl Harbor attack. “You can’t think of your troubles while solving a crossword.”

In recent interviews, New York Times crossword enthusiasts shared their emotional connections to the pastime and described the value they find in the exercise.

Harry Hassell, of Jackson Heights, Queens, remembered his mother working on crosswords. “Amid the chaos of the household, it allowed her a personal pleasure and a routine all her own,” he said. “It also allowed me to see her not just as a car-pooling, tennis-playing mother, but also as a clever, intelligent, word-loving woman.”

Such intergenerational connections, forged over black-and-white grids, can have long-term implications.

“I first started doing crosswords as a child while visiting my Grandma Pat,” said Neil Padrick Wilson, a claims analyst in Tacoma, Wash. “She would sit at the big dining room table, dipping toast in her coffee. I would dip toast in my hot chocolate and we would work through a puzzle together. It got me to think, it got me to learn and it got me to know her better.”

Puzzles became so important to Mr. Wilson that he began to create them, and a crossword he made recently ran in The Times.

While not all enthusiasts go on to construct puzzles, it’s not uncommon for an early habit to persist.

“Rituals are often key in bonding with others, particularly family rituals,” said Ray Bepko, a clinical psychologist in Clinton, N.Y. “Pastimes and hobbies are very much a part of this and impact our adult relationships.”

That seems to be at least one reason people continue or develop a solving habit in adulthood, Dr. Bepko said. “Accessing this deep emotional connection is a source of comfort and reassurance anytime, particularly in difficult moments.”

Of course, puzzles are games, and they’re meant to be fun — especially in the addictive “aha!” moments that many solvers describe.

Plath’s letters have been collected for the first time, edited by Peter K. Steinberg, an archivist specializing in Plath, and Karen V. Kukil, the editor of Plath’s journals and curator of the Plath collection at Smith College. The first volume — attractive, immense and done up in trendy millennial pink — is just out.

The era has passed in which those who held Ted Hughes responsible for Plath’s suicide would chisel her married name from her headstone. But the years have passed more slowly, you suspect, for the family and the Plath estate. Frieda Hughes, the couple’s daughter and only surviving child (their son, Nicholas, killed himself in 2009), begins the book of letters with a spectacularly defensive foreword — a tribute less to Plath than to Hughes:

“The reason my mother should be of interest to readers at all is due to my father, because, irrespective of the way their marriage ended, he honored my mother’s work and her memory by publishing ‘Ariel,’ ” she writes. “It seems to me that, as a result of their profound belief in each other’s literary abilities, my parents are as married in death as they once were in life.” There is the effect, slightly comic and horrifying, of the daughter presiding over the vow renewal ceremony for the ghosts of her parents.

But it does set the stage for the strangeness of these letters, first glimpsed when Plath’s mother, Aurelia, published a selection of them in “Letters Home” (1975). Her intention was to humanize Plath, to reveal her as a healthy all-American girl. Alas, it went very much the other way — the “psychic osmosis” between mother and daughter, of which Aurelia was so proud, was perceived to be pathological, and perhaps even the root cause of Plath’s depression.

Photo

Whatever the diagnosis, to speak of Plath’s letters is to speak of her relationship with Aurelia, to whom she wrote twice a day at times — long letters that swarmed to fill every inch of space on the page and trailed onto the envelopes.

This was, no doubt, lovely for her mother (and her biographers), but it can be rough going for even the committed Plathophile. We spend a small eternity at a summer camp where young Sylvia assuaged Aurelia’s anxieties with daily briefs on her diet and hygiene. In one moment of high drama, she longed for a toenail clipper.

As she grew up the reports to Aurelia continued but now included lists of her admirers and awards, invitations to the Yale junior prom, compliments from professors.

The journals, published unabridged in 2000, were, of course, a darker place. There her violent imagination could bloom. Her pet insult was “smiler” — for the false and appeasing; her own inclination as well, we learn in the letters. She would admit, in passing, to her loneliness in college before screwing on a smile: “My room is lovely.” “The campus is utterly lovely.” “The freshmen are dears.” “Lisa is very sweet.” Even a suicide attempt is glossed over. “My escapade,” she called it in a letter to a friend.

Her intense ambition was on full display, however. She even poked fun at it: “I’m chock-full of ideas for new poems. I can’t wait to get time to write them down. I can’t let Shakespeare get too far ahead of me, you know.”

The other great, governing hunger in her life was for a leading man, a colossus, which she found in Hughes, the hulking Heathcliff of her dreams. She met him in England, where she was on a Fulbright scholarship. She bit his cheek, he ripped off her earrings, they married four months later. In her letters to him, the determined peppiness finally fell away and the Plathian imagery — and nastiness — emerged. On a professor of hers: “I have a morbid desire to cut open her fat white flesh each time I see her and see if its onion juice or what that keeps her going.”

But these early letters reveal something the journals don’t: a flicker of uncertainty about Hughes that now seems prophetic. He “has done a kind of uncaring rip through every woman he’s ever met,” she wrote to her brother. To her mother: “He is a breaker of things and people.”

But she won’t be cowed. She’s conquered him, she reported two weeks later. “I have passed through the husk, the mask of cruelty, ruthlessness, callousness, in Ted.” She preened: “Every thing I do with and for Ted has a celestial radiance, be it only ironing or cooking.” She documented their days, their productivity with joy. She hoped for seven children.

It’s not Plath’s death necessarily, or even the dissolution of her marriage, but her doubleness that’s been the abiding mystery. In his foreword to her journals, Hughes wrote: “I never saw her show her real self to anybody — except, perhaps, in the last three months of her life.” It’s a line picked up by critics from Elizabeth Hardwick to Janet Malcolm, this belief in the authentic Plath, the aggressive genius lurking behind the polite banalities, that finally flowered in the final poems — the “blood jet,” she called them.

The achievement of this avalanche of letters — 1,300 pages and counting — is that it disabuses everyone of the notion that Plath wasn’t aware of her contradictions or in (some) control of them. She referenced her two selves every time she went from blonde to brunette (“I’m rather sure that my brown-haired personality will win out this year,” she wrote to a boyfriend. “Gone is the frivolous giddy gilded creature who careened around corners at the wheel of a yellow convertible.”) Her honors thesis was, in part, on Dostoevsky’s “The Double,” after all, in which a self splits, and one kills the other.

THURSDAY PUZZLE — Once again, we have a lesson in paying attention and reading clues or any notes associated with the puzzle carefully. There’s got to be a reason the Across clues are so ... terse.

You did see the note, right? It says “The one-word Across clues all have an unusual relationship with their answers.” No kidding. That unusual relationship is for you to deduce, and when you do, prepare for a fun “Aha!” moment.

It took me a while to get the hang of this one, but once I did, the rest of the puzzle fell quickly.

The Across clues in Mr. Eaton-Salners’s puzzle are all homophones, one of two or more words pronounced alike but different in meaning or derivation or spelling. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to figure out which homophone of the Across clue (if there is more than one) is really the clue to be solved, and then you solve it.

The deposits are near or under lakes and rivers that stream directly into the Boundary Waters.
The jobs may be seasonal or not pay as well as mining jobs; on the other hand, they are not as backbreaking and they foster a local creative class.","Now, mining supporters, among them Representative Rick Nolan, a Democrat who represents Ely’s district in Congress, are trying to undo the moratorium. The battle is being fought on both moral and economic grounds. Mining advocates stress the hundreds of tangible construction and mining jobs this copper-nickel operation could create in the coming decades. Boundary Waters activists argue that the very presence of mining — its disruption of this area’s natural character, not to mention the specter of pollution — could hamper the region’s “amenity-based” development in a multitude of tangible and intangible ways, from destroying property values to stripping away jobs that feed off this area’s natural beauty.

In the land of iron and water, opposition to copper-nickel mining is more than just a protect-the-wilderness stance; it also reflects a deeper desire to change the area’s character, from hardscrabble mining region to tourist destination that prioritizes protecting the wilderness over creating more mining jobs. Central to the debate between the two camps is a philosophical question: What is the right kind of economy for a place like the Boundary Waters?

For as far back as he can trace it, Dan Forsman’s family has lived here, where iron meets water. His great-great-grandfather migrated from Finland in the 1890s and homesteaded on a 474-acre lake. His great-grandfather, Emil Forsman, worked in the mines before opening a longtime Ely watering hole, Forsman’s Tavern. Emil’s son worked as a maintenance foreman in the crusher at an Ely mine. In 1947, Emil’s eldest grandchild was born above Forsman’s Tavern. That boy, Mike, grew up in Ely, worked for a canoe outfitter for $1.25 an hour, volunteered to join the Marines in the 1960s and worked in the mines for 34 years. His youngest son was Dan. Dan grew up in awe of the giant machines that his mechanic father worked to fix. When he turned 20, after training at a two-year community college to become a heavy-equipment mechanic, he got a job at the same mine as his father.

At 4:40 a.m. on a chilly late-spring morning, I pulled up to Dan Forsman’s house to drive with him to work. The diesel engine of his 2002 Chevy Silverado pickup was already growling. He had gotten up 12 minutes earlier, thrown on torn jeans, a T-shirt and a camouflage hunting jacket and packed a lunch: turkey and American cheese on white bread, a banana and a Little Debbie Cosmic Brownie. The 29-year-old tugged down on a cap that advertised the brand of nitrous oxide he uses to soup up car engines. A block away, he steered past his father’s house and the garage where he learned to tinker. His prized car is a 1979 Chevy Camaro; he can get it up to nearly 150 miles per hour on a nearby drag strip.

Forsman drove up the hill of Ely’s business district. Some people call this a mining town, others a tourist town, but East Sheridan Street shows it to be both. There’s the grilled-cheese shop frequented by tourists and the grocery store that stocks the hot smoked bologna local residents swear by. There are liquor stores that boycotted a local brewery after the brewery publicly sided with clean-water advocates, but down the street is a stylish new wine bar serving that same beer. More than a dozen local canoe outfitters that organize trips into the Boundary Waters are based here. Neighboring storefronts display yard signs: “We support mining. Mining supports us.”

“There are two Elys, two different realities, different visions,” Tom Coombe, the editor of The Ely Echo and a fourth-generation Elyite, told me.

As Forsman’s truck rumbled to the top of the hill, we passed a two-story building that used to be Forsman’s Tavern. Now it’s occupied by Piragis Northwoods Company, a successful canoe outfitter and outdoor store. Steve Piragis has run this shop a decade longer than Dan Forsman has been alive, but Forsman’s family still considers Piragis an outsider — a “packsacker,” the local term for people who moved here for wilderness instead of mining.

Past the city limits and into the heart of Minnesota’s Iron Range, fog lifted over white pine trees. A ring-necked pheasant strutted alongside Wolf Creek Pass. As Forsman parked in the same lot his father used to park in — 52 minutes door to door — steam poured from four chimneys.

Forsman is proud of his part in this 360-employee mining enterprise. He’s proud that his labor makes something tangible: Huge chunks of rock become tiny bits of rock, which are ground and baked into half-inch pellets containing 67.5 percent iron, which leave this processing plant on the rails at a rate of 8,500 tons a day. The pellets are loaded onto ships in Duluth, where they float along Lake Superior to the other Great Lakes. At the bottom tip of Lake Michigan, just east of Chicago, tons of these pellets are fed into the largest blast furnace in the Western Hemisphere and smelted into steel, eventually becoming cars or trucks or household appliances or plate steel for ships and armored vehicles.

Up a flight of metal stairs, Forsman entered the locker room, put on his blue coveralls and laced up his steel-toed boots. Everything in his workplace seems improbably enormous. The mining trucks, with their 12-foot-tall tires, can haul 240 tons of rock from the open-pit mines into the processing facility. Miles away, off a gravel road as wide as a six-lane highway, 280,000 pounds of explosives had been loaded into 132 16-inch-diameter holes in a mining pit — it was blast day. The explosions would shake the earth, breaking up rock for the processing facility. The pit looked like a gray moonscape.

“To make money, you have to make something that wasn’t there,” Forsman told me. “You dig it up or you grow it. Without those things, you’re just making nothing. Without the basic minerals to make a phone, you can’t make an app for the phone. Because there’s nothing there.”

Forsman says he loves and wants to protect the Boundary Waters. He also believes copper mining and clean water can coexist. Then again, the mine that Forsman works in is a taconite mine, not the type of copper-nickel mine that environmentalists decry as a threat to this watershed. But what matters most to Forsman is the need for jobs in this hollowed-out region. Ely’s population has shrunk 30 percent since 1980; school enrollment is a third of what it was in the late 1960s. “If they stop this new mine, what’s the draw to be up here if there’s no jobs?” Also, he notes, those who oppose new mining jobs — “elitists” and “hypocrites,” Forsman calls them — benefit from the same metals that blue-collar workers like him produce. “People don’t understand where things come from anymore,” he said.

When Forsman refers to these “people,” he’s often referring to one person in particular. Her name is Becky Rom, and she is the head of the Campaign to Save the Boundary Waters. What makes him most angry is Rom’s condescension, her moral certainty: “The way she comes off, her attitude and way of doing this, it’s part of the problem.”

“Danny Forsman drives to the mine in his truck, comes home and watches TV, and he doesn’t know this world exists,” says Becky Rom, a 68-year-old lawyer who returned to her childhood home after retirement and now leads the environmental campaign. One afternoon this spring, I stood on a dock with Rom and her husband, Reid Carron, as they lowered a canoe into the South Kawishiwi River. Rom dangled her feet over the water, which was a couple miles of portages, rivers and rapids from the southwestern border of the Boundary Waters. Chokecherry and juneberry trees were in bloom. Sometimes Rom sees moose, otters, timber wolves or black bears. Today a blue jay hopped along the shore near where a beaver had built a lodge of alder limbs. Rom guessed newborn beavers were inside.

Rom has an energy that can be difficult to keep up with, whether she’s channeling it into hourlong soliloquies about the history of the Boundary Waters or a breakneck march into the wilderness. Rom slid into the canoe, her husband in back and me in the middle. The water beneath us was nearly black, tannin-stained, jarringly cold. A few years ago, an environmental group cited the South Kawishiwi as one of America’s 10 most endangered rivers because of the possibility that Twin Metals would begin mining for copper-nickel nearby.

Rom has become the most prominent foe of copper-nickel mining near the Boundary Waters. She makes frequent lobbying visits to St. Paul and Washington to drum up support from administrative and elected officials. Her group commissions studies and opinion polls; she takes part in public debates. But even the miners who hate her most wouldn’t dare call her a packsacker. Rom’s family has lived in Ely as long as the Forsmans. Her grandfather, Caspar Rom, emigrated from Slovenia in the 1890s. In December 1917, three weeks after his ninth child was born, Caspar Rom was leaning over an ore car when a cave-in crushed his head. That newborn son was Bill Rom, Becky’s father. He hunted and fished with his brothers to help his mother put food on the table. In 1946, he opened Canoe Country Outfitters, soon one of the most successful outfitters around. Three years later, Becky was born.

Her father became a leader in the fight for the federal Wilderness Act, whose passage in 1964 helped create federally designated wilderness areas. During the battles over the tightening of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness regulations in the 1970s, Bill Rom became a symbol among local residents, who for generations had enjoyed this land with few restrictions, of environmentalism run amok. Under new rules, airplanes were banned, which meant no more flying seaplanes into remote lakes. Resorts were torn down. Motorboat use was limited. Resentful local residents harassed Rom. In 1975, logging trucks blockaded his business on two of the busiest weekends of the year. Snowmobiles buzzed around his house at night to keep the Roms from sleeping. Becky’s brother camped inside the family business with their dog and a gun. Eventually, Rom sold his business rather than endure protests from people he grew up with.

But his cause left a lasting imprint on his daughter. After Rom and her husband, Reid Carron, retired from the largest law firm in the Twin Cities — she was a commercial real estate lawyer, he a management labor lawyer — they moved north in 2012 to a modern log cabin they had built on land her father bought decades before on Burntside Lake. Today a copy of the 1964 Wilderness Act signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson hangs on Rom’s bedroom wall.

Rom maneuvered the canoe toward the other side of the river. Docks jutted into the water, evidence of homes hidden in the trees. She lifted her paddle and gestured toward some white pines: “This would be all mines,” she said. “The noise, the lights, the dust, it would be everywhere.” A woodpecker pounded its beak into a tree. A smallmouth bass hunting mayflies broke the river’s surface.

The edge of the Boundary Waters is several miles from three mineral deposits that Twin Metals hopes to develop and just a half-mile from a fourth one. The deposits are near or under lakes and rivers that stream directly into the Boundary Waters. Acid mine drainage could potentially flow past 30 resorts, outfitters and campgrounds, as well as hundreds of homes, before reaching the Boundary Waters at Fall Lake. From there, water enters Basswood Lake, a popular fishery that straddles the Canadian border, then Canada’s Quetico Provincial Park and then Voyageurs National Park and Rainy Lake. All told, polluted water could theoretically affect up to 2.3 million acres of American and Canadian public lands, according to a peer-reviewed study published in the Journal of Hydrology. Pollution could harm fish, wild rice and property values. (This sounds alarmist to those who support underground copper-nickel mining near Ely; the multiyear process of planning the mine and clearing it with regulators would, they believe, set up ample safeguards against pollution.)

Rom and her husband climbed out of the canoe. Back in town, they pointed out thriving enterprises. One family company makes outerwear, which nicely complements the family’s other business, a lodge that runs winter dogsledding trips. An outfit called Crapola makes cranberry-apple granola. An art gallery displayed prints from a nature photographer. A fancy new restaurant, a spa, a gift shop that also sells saunas, a renovated historic theater looking for a tenant — Rom regards all these small businesses as evidence that the future here will not replicate the mining past. The jobs may be seasonal or not pay as well as mining jobs; on the other hand, they are not as backbreaking and they foster a local creative class. Last year, National Geographic Adventure ranked Ely as one of the world’s nine best outdoor towns, citing its proximity to vast public lands. Only one other American community — Moab, Utah, near Arches and Canyonlands national parks — made the list.","In Northern Minnesota, Two Economies Square Off: Mining vs. Wilderness",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/magazine/in-northern-minnesota-two-economies-square-off-mining-vs-wilderness.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

The result is a heady, autumnal record, blending Mr. Plant’s early influences (the folk musicians Bert Jansch and John Fahey), blues-fueled riffs, Berber sounds and Bristol trip-hop sonics. Many of the songs, including the title track, are love ballads tinged with fables.

The sole cover, of an old rockabilly tune called “Bluebirds Over the Mountain,” gets new energy from a fractured electronic beat and the twinned vocals of Mr. Plant and the Pretenders’ Chrissie Hynde.

Mr. Plant is delighted that there’s still an audience for his music and a major record label, Nonesuch, invested in releasing it into the world. But that’s about as much thought as he puts into who might be out there listening. He emphatically does not delve into Spotify data to learn more. “No, I don’t give a hoot,” he says. “I couldn’t even think about it. I don’t think I write to suit anybody — I just write to suit my mood.”

As for his old band, Mr. Plant said he sees Mr. Page and the bassist John Paul Jones “from time to time, and it’s very civil.” The three were thrown back together in 2016 during a high-profile copyright lawsuit over the song “Stairway to Heaven,” which the band won, but Mr. Plant doesn’t seem eager to relive that: “We’re enthusiastic toward each other, and each of us does our own things, and that’s how it is.”

When Led Zeppelin ended in 1980, Mr. Plant set out to live a more human-scale life. To the public annoyance of his old bandmates, he’s been emphatic about not reviving the band for a full-scale tour, and when asked about it he tends to make an artistic argument about wanting to resist nostalgia. (Fans of “Raising Sand” have more reason to hope: “Alison and I talk about it all the time.”) But there might be another, simpler, reason — maybe there just isn’t any payday, no matter how vast, worth more than his carefully cultivated life?

“Yeah, that’s true,” he said. “I know where it’s at for me. I’m in an incredibly good place. For a guy like me, who was a singer in band, who played no instrument — but just being eager to learn and experience more and more music? I’ve just been incredibly fortunate.

In economic projections released after the meeting, 12 of the 16 officials on the Federal Open Market Committee predicted a third rate hike. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed’s chairwoman, reinforced that expectation in a speech in Cleveland a week later.

Ms. Yellen reviewed the reasons to worry about low inflation but concluded that the weight of evidence did not warrant a shift in the Fed’s plans. “Given that monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation with a substantial lag, it would be imprudent to keep monetary policy on hold until inflation is back to 2 percent,” she said.

But the minutes of the September meeting said that “a few” Fed officials opposed another 2017 rate move, and that “several others” remained on the fence.

Charles Evans, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, is among the skeptics. “There’s room for a very honest discussion later this year as to whether or not it’s the right time to raise rates,” Mr. Evans told Bloomberg News on Wednesday.

The divisions are not about the economic outlook. The account noted that all participants agreed that economic activity during the summer months was in line with the Fed’s expectations “and that the incoming data had not materially altered the medium-term economic outlook.”

The Fed expects the recent hurricanes to bring down the figures for third-quarter growth, but it anticipates a rebound in the fourth quarter and little impact from the storms going forward.

The issue is the behavior of inflation. The Fed aims to keep inflation at an annual pace of about 2 percent, but it has undershot that goal consistently since the financial crisis, and the Fed says it expects to miss the target again this year.

A majority of Fed officials, led by Ms. Yellen, continue to subscribe to the view that inflation is just around the corner.

“Many participants continued to believe that the cyclical pressures associated with a tightening labor market or an economy operating above its potential were likely to show through to higher inflation over the medium term,” the account said.

Those officials want to raise interest rates so long as the economy keeps growing.

“The Fed’s models tell them that an economy at full employment eventually produces more inflation down the road and they want the Fed funds rate to be back to normal levels before that happens,” said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group.

Some also want to raise rates because they are concerned that markets are not responding to the Fed’s pressure. The Fed raises its benchmark rate to tighten financial conditions, including borrowing costs, but conditions have eased so far this year.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury has fallen almost 5 percent this year; the decline was even deeper before it began to bounce back last month.

William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has highlighted the market’s equanimity as a reason to keep raising interest rates, noting in a speech this month that financial conditions have eased since last December even as the Fed has raised its benchmark rate by three-quarters of a percentage point, a substantial increase.

The dissidents are less unified in their critiques. Some argue that employment has room to grow. The share of prime-age adults with jobs remains below the level before the recession. The account also pointed to the “absence of broad-based upward wage pressures.”

Some officials also see evidence that other factors may be weighing on inflation. The account noted that inflation is low in other advanced economies, and there has been some erosion in market expectations of future inflation, which can become a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Those worries have occupied a larger portion of the official minutes with each passing meeting this year, reflecting the growing puzzlement and concern among officials. “Many participants expressed concern that the low inflation readings this year might reflect not only transitory factors but also the influence of developments that could prove more persistent,” it said.","Fed Still Puzzled by Inflation, but Rate Increase Is on Track",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/business/economy/federal-reserve-minutes.html

NBC recommended hitting the pause button on the story — partly because Mr. Farrow’s contract with the network was about to expire — but Mr. Farrow wanted to continue.
Mr. Farrow went ahead with the interview — and hired his own camera crew to conduct it.
Mr. Farrow shared his materials with him and the person who would ultimately be his story editor, Deirdre Foley Mendelssohn.","Mr. Farrow’s 8,000-word article concerned 13 women, several of whom went on the record to accuse Mr. Weinstein of sexual harassment, assault and rape. The story, published on Tuesday, went online days after the publication of the first of two investigative articles by The New York Times on Mr. Weinstein, who was fired from the Weinstein Company on Sunday.

Mr. Farrow, 29, is a son of Mia Farrow and Woody Allen, and a graduate of Yale Law School who hosted a short-lived show on MSNBC that was canceled because of low ratings. Since then, he has filed pieces for “Today” — Mr. Oppenheim’s last stop before his promotion in February — as part of a series called “Undercover With Ronan Farrow.”

So, why did Mr. Farrow, who had worked for NBC News since 2013, take it to a rival organization?

“I walked into the door at The New Yorker with an explosively reportable piece that should have been public earlier,” Mr. Farrow told Ms. Maddow on Tuesday. “And immediately, obviously, The New Yorker recognized that, and it’s not accurate to say that it was not reportable. In fact, there were multiple determinations that it was reportable at NBC.”

When Ms. Maddow pressed him to explain what had happened with NBC, he said, “Look, you would have to ask NBC and NBC executives about the details of that story.”

At the annual town hall meeting, Mr. Oppenheim said NBC had determined over the summer that Mr. Farrow’s reporting lacked some elements it needed for publication, but that he had since filled the gaps.

“Ronan very understandably wanted to keep forging ahead,” Mr. Oppenheim said, according to a transcript of his remarks provided by the network. “So we didn’t want to stand in his way, and he took it to The New Yorker and did a ton more extraordinary work. He greatly expanded the scope of his reporting. Suffice to say, the stunning story, the incredible story that we all read yesterday, was not the story that we were looking at when we made our judgment several months ago.”

Mr. Oppenheim said NBC News “couldn’t be prouder” of Mr. Farrow, who is no longer under contract with the network.

“I think all you need to know about our feeling about the importance of the story is that we have been putting him on our air throughout the day yesterday, and this morning, ever since,” he said.

The report, which Mr. Farrow worked on for several months with Rich McHugh, a producer in the investigative unit at NBC News, went through rounds of vetting within NBC — including with Kimberley Harris, NBC Universal’s general counsel, according to two people familiar with his reporting who were not authorized to speak publicly. By the time Mr. Farrow had given up on the idea that the story would air on NBC, he had on-camera interviews — with the subjects’ faces rendered in shadow — with employees at the Weinstein Company as well as other victims of harassment and assault, the people said.

In addition, Mr. Farrow had in his possession an audio recording made as part of a New York Police Department sting operation, in which Mr. Weinstein admitted groping a model named Ambra Battilana Gutierrez in 2015. Mr. Farrow had also collected LinkedIn messages from a concerned Weinstein Company executive that would ultimately make its way into his New Yorker article.

As of late July, Mr. Farrow also had an interview with one accuser who appeared on camera with her identity revealed. But that person wavered months after giving the interview, fearing legal action from Mr. Weinstein.

Once the interview with the woman was removed, NBC had concerns that the resulting piece would no longer include any on-camera interviews with people who revealed their identity, according to two people familiar with the news division’s thinking.

NBC recommended hitting the pause button on the story — partly because Mr. Farrow’s contract with the network was about to expire — but Mr. Farrow wanted to continue.

A new accuser had agreed to appear on camera — in shadow — and she had a serious sexual assault claim to make. After some back and forth between Mr. Farrow and the network, NBC said he was free to proceed but without help from the news division. Officials at the network wanted it postponed.

Mr. Farrow went ahead with the interview — and hired his own camera crew to conduct it.

During the course of his reporting, Mr. Farrow also interviewed, in the role of an expert talking head, the longtime New Yorker staff writer Ken Auletta, who had written a lengthy profile of Mr. Weinstein for the magazine in 2002. Given Mr. Farrow’s material, Mr. Auletta said on camera that it would be a “scandal” if NBC refused to air it, according to a person familiar with the interview.

By mid-August, Mr. Auletta had arranged for Mr. Farrow to meet with David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker. Mr. Farrow shared his materials with him and the person who would ultimately be his story editor, Deirdre Foley Mendelssohn. The New Yorker editors were of the opinion that Mr. Farrow had the groundwork of a major scoop, a story that many news organizations had been chasing for years.

“The building blocks were there,” Mr. Remnick said.

The publication of Mr. Farrow’s New Yorker story roughly coincided with the one-year anniversary of NBC’s losing a scoop when it hesitated to publish a story on the “‘Access Hollywood’ tape” — the recording of Mr. Trump, then a presidential candidate, boasting of having forced himself on women.

NBCUniversal is the owner of the syndicated “Access Hollywood” and had the recording in its archives. It lost the story, however, as its lawyers put the tape through a three-day vetting process. Complicating matters was the fact that Billy Bush, the “Access Hollywood” correspondent who played the eager and willing interlocutor to Mr. Trump in the 2005 tape, was by then a host of “Today.”

On Oct. 7, 2016, The Washington Post published the audio recording and an accompanying story about it under the headline “Trump recorded having extremely lewd conversation about women in 2005” just hours after it received a copy of the tape.

Mr. Trump at first defended his comments as “locker room banter,” before issuing a video apology in which he said, “Anyone who knows me knows these words don’t reflect who I am. I said it, I was wrong, and I apologize.”

At the meeting of NBC News staff members on Wednesday, Mr. Oppenheim seemed adamant that NBC News would not shy away in the future.

“So, what I would say is that we are going to keep digging, we are going to keep pursuing these stories,” he said. “We are not always going to be the ones that get it to the finish line, but I think, more often than not, we will be.”

Mr. Farrow did not reply to interview requests for this story, but when asked by Jake Tapper on CNN’s “The Lead” to clear up the back-and-forth, he said, “I truly do think we should stay focused on the women here.”",How Did NBC Miss Out on a Harvey Weinstein Exposé?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/business/media/nbc-news-harvey-weinstein.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Mayer to whom Mr. Weinstein has often been nostalgically compared. In histories, these old-studio chiefs are genteelly referred to as womanizers, a polite metaphor for conduct that ranges from time on the casting couch, another odious euphemism, to what sounds a lot like prostitution. According to the historian Scott Eyman, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer — the studio that bore Mayer’s name and boasted that it had more stars than there are in heaven — had a supply “of what were known as ‘six-month-option girls’ to be passed around the executive offices.”

If this seems, well, normal it is because this tawdry glimpse into the industry — with its powerful men and passed-around girls — is deeply embedded in its history, its lore and its very identity. It’s the old yet evergreen story of the dewy young woman who comes to Hollywood, does a screen test and maybe signs a contract. The company dyes her hair blonde, feeds her pills and puts her on a diet or under a plastic surgeon’s knife. The lucky ones become Marilyn Monroe (or the It Girl du jour); the luckier ones get out alive. Others remain passed-around girls. The old studio system is gone, but the attitude that exploitation is part of the price for being in the business — hey, it’s Hollywood — endures.

One paradox of Mr. Weinstein’s career is that while he emerged in the independent film world in the 1980s — positioning his earlier company, Miramax Films, as the David to the mainstream’s Goliath — he helped build a media giant that came to resemble an old-fashioned Hollywood studio. In an age of drab bean counters, Miramax had moxie and mystique. Importantly, it had a stable of publicity-ready female stars like Ms. Paltrow and rock-star male auteurs, most notably a favorite of critics, Quentin Tarantino. Sure, Mr. Weinstein might sometimes swing at someone, literally, but in Harveywood misdeeds were soon overshadowed by box-office tallies and savvy public relations.

Peter Biskind, a former editor at the film magazine Premiere, tried to investigate Mr. Weinstein back in 1991, but writes that Miramax threatened to pull its advertising, adding, “the next thing I knew, Harvey was writing columns for Premiere and I was his editor.” Over the years, Mr. Weinstein’s grip on soft-bellied entertainment news media remained firm partly because it was mutually advantageous. And, as he rose, he supported women who supported him. In 2007, he presented a Crystal Award — given by Women in Film — to Renée Zellweger, a star of Miramax titles like “Chicago.”

Given the revelations about Mr. Weinstein, it may seem surprising that his companies also offered actual opportunities for women, including directors like Jane Campion (“The Piano”) and older actresses like Judi Dench (“Shakespeare in Love”). This wasn’t progressive; it was evidence of a shrewd embrace of old-studio-style product diversification. In some ways, it is because Mr. Weinstein and his brother, Bob Weinstein, released different kinds of movies and didn’t pour all their resources only into formulas — and male-driven superhero movies — that they gave women opportunities.

Jenni Konner, the co-showrunner for the HBO series “Girls,” has said that the revelations about Mr. Weinstein are a tipping point: “This is the moment we look back on and say, ‘That’s when it all started to change.’” I hope she’s right. One problem is that the entertainment industry is extraordinarily forgiving of those who have made it a lot of money, as Mel Gibson can tell you. It might glance at the fallen comrade on the floor, but only so it can step over the body en route to the next meeting. And if that comrade somehow gets on his feet again, the industry will ask if he has a new project. This forgiveness is often ascribed to the familiar line that the only thing the business cares about is money.

Money often serves as a rationale for some of the industry’s noxiousness, including its sexism and racism: We can’t hire women, blacks, etc., because they don’t sell. Outsiders tend to see the industry as liberal, and while insiders do promote progressive causes, the business hews to a fundamental conservatism. This conservatism shapes its story recycling, its exploitation of women (and men) and its preservation of a male-dominated, racially homogeneous system. Despite pressure, including from the likes of Ava DuVernay and Lena Dunham, the industry resists change. Those in power don’t see an upside in ceding it.

Although the allegations against Mr. Weinstein may not prove to be the necessary tipping point, they are part of growing feminist pressure to change the industry. Activists inside and outside the entertainment bubble are calling out its biases — and showing how those biases affect employment, which in turn affects representations and audiences. (According to The Los Angeles Times, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission — spurred to action by the American Civil Liberties Union — began contacting female film and TV directors in 2015 to see what issues they’re facing.)

I hope real change comes soon, especially for the women working in the industry who each day are forced to fight sexism just so that they can do their jobs. I hope change comes because the movies need new and different voices and visions, something other than deadening, damaging stereotypes and storybook clichés. And I hope change comes for those of us who love movies. I’ve spent a lifetime navigating the contradictions of that love, grappling with the pleasures movies offer with the misogyny that too often has informed what happened behind the camera and what is onscreen. The movies can break your heart, but this isn’t the time only for tears. It is also the time for rage.",Harvey Weinstein Is Gone.

“Planning a traditional wedding takes a great deal of time and energy,” Ms. Friedrichsen said. “So many people are overwhelmed just dealing with the pressures of day-to-day life; they simply don’t want the added stress of orchestrating a large event. Decision fatigue is real; a tiny wedding helps to alleviate some of that.”

“Microweddings afford a lot more flexibility and they’re easier on the budget,” Tatiana Brenizer, a Brooklyn-based wedding photographer, said. She and her husband, Ryan Brenizer, shoot about a dozen microweddings a year. They even celebrated their own microwedding in Prospect Park on June 9, 2015.

But the small size of microweddings doesn’t mean they’re headache-free. Here’s what you should know if you’re thinking about having one.

Prepare for Pushback

Not everyone might be thrilled you’re having an intimate wedding. Feelings might be hurt when you limit the guest list so severely, as it might go against expectations that friends and family members had that they would be invited to celebrate.

Approaching the subject with confidence is key.

“The more secure and confident a couple is when they drop this bomb on their family,” Ms. Tongg said, “the easier that they’ll take it.” She suggests sharing beautiful pictures of your wedding on social media to take the sting out of it for people who couldn’t attend. Once they see how private the ceremony was, she reasoned, people are more likely to understand why they weren’t invited.

Every couple’s must-haves are different, but for a smaller wedding with a teensy budget, you should narrow down the essentials. Because I have a sweet tooth, my only must-have for my wedding was a custom cake from my favorite bakery. Mike’s only requirement was having a nonreligious ceremony, as I’m Jewish and he’s Catholic and he didn’t want to give the appearance of favoring one family’s traditions over another.

For other couples, their must-have can be a particular location that holds sentimental value, like the couple’s first date or first kiss.

“Consider a place that’s meaningful,” Ms. Brenizer said. She suggests scouting the location at the time of day you’re planning on getting married to see what the crowds are like.

Yes, You Should Still Create a Registry

“No matter what size or type of wedding you’re having, it’s always a good idea to register,” said Kathy McTigue, Bloomingdale’s director of The Registry. “Many couples that have microweddings organize less formal get-togethers and celebrations leading up to the wedding date, and their friends and family members may want to throw them parties as well. Many people will want to get gifts for these events.”

Ms. McTigue also recommended registering for enough gifts to allow those who attend to have a nice selection to choose from across a variety of price points.

Not everyone agrees that having a registry is a necessity, but for us, it came in quite handy. We were surprised when co-workers, long-distance friends and relatives who weren’t invited to the wedding still wanted to buy us gifts. By assembling a reasonable registry, we not only helped guide them, but we also received items we could actually use.

If You Can Get Married in It, It’s a Wedding Outfit

Maggie Winters Gaudaen, co-founder of Washington’s Pop! Wed Co. and author of “Fun Size Weddings: The Simple Guide to Planning a Tiny Wedding You’ll Love,” says that when it comes to microwedding attire, there are no rules.

“There are nudist weddings out there. There are weddings where people spend $15,000 on a beautiful dress. There are weddings where people get married dressed up like their favorite character from a movie,” Ms. Gaudaen said. “You can get married in anything as long as that is the outfit you feel amazing in.”

Small Receptions Offer Lots of Freedom

In the same way attire and location are open to customization, receptions for microweddings can be tailored to reflect the interests and needs of the couple. Aside from being cheaper to facilitate, smaller receptions allow the wedded couple to spend quality time with each guest, something brides and grooms aren’t usually able to do when entertaining larger wedding parties.

As an elopement planner, Ms. Gaudaen helps organize a variety of small wedding receptions. She’s seen couples celebrate their union with a picnic in the park or renting out space at a bar or restaurant. One couple even had a group sleepover at a campground.

Sometimes newlyweds forgo a reception altogether, instead opting to hit the road and celebrate with their far-flung relatives. “Some of our couples will have multiple parties,” Ms. Gaudaen said. “One couple had a party for their D.C.-area family and then had a party for the Minnesota-area family a couple of months later.”

It’s Still a Wedding and Vendors Will Charge Accordingly

Even though I was unusually low key about my wedding, vendors still charged wedding prices. My beloved bakery charged us wedding prices even though our cake was for a smaller number of people than they would usually prepare an order for.

“You can get Ubers for 12 guests in ways that you probably can’t for 100,” Mr. Brenizer said. “But you still have all of those same considerations: weather, transportation, flowers, your music, your photography. Every time that you hire a vendor, you still have to consider contracts and payment and all of that stuff just the same.”

Appoint a Coordinator

It was stressful fielding text messages and coordinating transportation while simultaneously applying mascara and squirming into my Spanx before the main event. If I had to do my wedding over again, I would appoint a coordinator — perhaps a relative or trusted friend — for the day of the wedding to be a contact for those last-minute details.

“I would suggest because everyone’s all embedded together for the whole day, getting ready, driving to the ceremony, the ceremony, and going out to dinner, I think you could use maybe a day-of coordinator,” Ms. Tongg said. “You need to enjoy and not be trying to keep people organized or keep looking at the watch.”

It can be especially tough when you’re bringing two families together and everyone’s sense of time and urgency is different. For that reason, “you need somebody to be the buffer,” she recommends.

Embrace Flexibility

Andy Mills and his wife, Geri Cole, had their microwedding on Sept. 14, 2014, on Fire Island with about a dozen of their immediate family in attendance.

“We decided to have a small wedding because we realized how expensive weddings are and it wasn’t an expense we thought we wanted to spend,” Ms. Cole said.

For their ceremony, Ms. Cole maintained some traditions and ditched others. She didn’t wear a white dress and didn’t get married in a church, but she still jumped the broom. “When you choose to detach yourself from all cultural customs of what a wedding is supposed to be, it’s actually really liberating,” Ms. Cole said.

Her advice to others considering a microwedding: “Allow yourself to create the wedding. Do whatever you want to do.”",What to Know About Having a Microwedding,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/smarter-living/what-to-know-about-having-a-microwedding.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Fences are going up across New York.

The provocative Chinese artist Ai Weiwei — a “once and future New Yorker” — is unleashing one of the biggest public art projects in his repertoire across the city today.

His exhibition, “Good Fences Make Good Neighbors,” is intended to make us think twice about the simple concept of a fence. The fences — which generally create boundaries or borders — are meant to elicit reflections on pervasive, present-day issues like the exclusion of immigrants, the global refugee crisis, or our dangerous social and political divisiveness.

You can see the centerpieces of Mr. Ai’s project, composed of more than 300 works of art commissioned by the Public Art Fund, along the southeast corner of Central Park, in Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village, and by the Unisphere in Flushing Meadows Corona Park in Queens.

Return of the ’80s! Synth-Pop Bands Stage a Middle-Aged Comeback

Image Clockwise from top left, videos from Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark; Erasure; Depeche Mode; and Alphaville. Credit

“Dynasty” is back on television. “Blade Runner” is in theaters. And all your favorite synth pop bands from the 1980s, including Depeche Mode and New Order, have new albums.

As Generation X moves into wistful middle age, the new-wave hit makers of the MTV V.J. era are back and touring. Here are some new long-playing discs (also available for streaming!) that recall a time when all it took was an angular haircut and a Yamaha DX7 to rule the world.

Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark

New release: “The Punishment of Luxury,” released Sept. 1, is the band’s 13th album (and its third since reforming in 2006). The 12-track album remains true to the band’s signature robo-pop sound and offers a rumination and indictment on have-it-all consumerism.

Synth Classics : “ Enola Gay ” (1980); “So In Love” (1985)

Liner notes: With their knack for infectious hooks, the founding members Andy McCluskey and Paul Humphreys have been called “the Lennon-McCartney of synth pop.” The hit single “ If You Leave ” is forever burned into Gen X consciousness, thanks to John Hughes’s Brat Pack film “Pretty in Pink.”

’80s fashion faux pas : Kraftwerk for the masses (skinny ties and black turtlenecks).

Reviews: “As returns to form go, this is like Roger Federer winning this year’s Wimbledon. No, forget that — it’s like John McEnroe or Bjorn Borg winning this year’s Wimbledon.” — God Is in the TV , a music fanzine based in Britain.

New Order

New release : Following its highly regarded 2015 album , “Music Complete,” the band released a live album in May, “NOMC15” on vinyl, CD and for download , featuring new tracks and ’80s classics. It comes after a bitter breakup with the original bassist, Peter Hook .

Synth classics : “Blue Monday” (1983), “Bizarre Love Triangle” (1986).

Liner notes: Formed by the surviving members of the seminal post-punk band Joy Division after the lead singer Ian Curtis’s suicide, this Manchester quartet fused angsty guitar rock, electronica and a little bit of disco to become one of the most influential bands of the last three decades.

’80s fashion faux pas: Schoolboy gone to seed (messy haircuts, rumpled button-down shirts).

Reviews: “Not the best way to experience New Order, but it nevertheless doesn’t take anything away from their timeless studio albums or their memorable live shows face to face.” — Under the Radar , an indie music magazine based in Virginia.

Depeche Mode

New release : Like other ’80s bands trying to navigate the Brexit and Trump era, Depeche Mode has gotten ever more woke. The band’s 14th studio album, “ Spirit ,” has fiery anthems like “Where’s the Revolution” and “ Going Backwards .”

Synth classics: “Just Can’t Get Enough” (1981), “Personal Jesus” (1989)



Liner notes : Depeche Mode turned synth pop into stadium rock with its 1988 show at the Rose Bowl that drew 65,000 people. It has been in a nonstop comeback in the three decades since. Currently packing arenas on a world tour, Depeche Mode sold out two shows at Madison Square Garden last month.

’80s fashion faux pas : Transylvania Leather Bar (goatees, slicked-back hair, black leather).

Reviews : “The music moves away from the club dance floor; it moves in six beats rather than four. And the lyrics are as bluntly political as old Depeche Mode songs like ‘New Dress,’ openly confronting a new propaganda regime.” — The New York Times .

Erasure

New release : “ World Be Gone,” the band’s 17th, was released in May and offers a more brooding Erasure, trading the disco frothiness for weighty social commentary on topics like political disenfranchisement on tracks like “Oh What a World.”

Synth classics: “Chains of Love ,” “A Little Respect” (1988)

Liner notes: After helping start Depeche Mode and Yaz, Vince Clarke put an ad in Melody Maker in 1985 for a singer. That led him to Andy Bell; the two spawned dozens of hits that became dance club staples and went on to sell more than 25 million albums .

’80s fashion faux pas: Glam goes electronic ( gold lamé , thigh-high boots ).

Reviews: “Whether you like Erasure’s 17th studio album will depend on how you feel about facing the world, in its current state, in the mirror. Musically it is not their strongest, but this is one such occasion where the lyrics overpower almost everything.” — musicOMH , a Britain-based indie music site.

Alphaville

New Release : Strange Attractor , the band’s first in seven years (and only its second in 20 years) was released in April, and goes beyond the band’s synthpop DNA to dabble in funk, industrial, and rockabilly. Marian Gold’s voice still sounds ethereal on haunting songs like “A Handful of Darkness.”

Synth classics: “Big in Japan ,” “Forever Young” (1984).

Liner notes : Along with Nena and Falco , this German outfit brought a Teutonic moodiness to the Day-Glo MTV era. Alphaville crossed over, however unintentionally, to a new generation when Jay-Z reinvented one of its biggest hits as “Young Forever” on his 2009 album, “The Blueprint 3.”

’80s fashion faux pas : Star Trek: Die Nächste Generation (military-style jumpsuits channeling the 23rd century).

Reviews : “Ultimately, ‘Strange Attractor’ is a take-it-or-leave-it Gold moment. After all, for an artist who has been operating with an array of sonispheric colors and hues for thirty-five years now, there is really nothing more to defy. Gold is simply making music the way he feels like it.” — Cryptic Rock , apparently your go-to site for music and horror coverage.

Diane Cook and Len Jenshel present some answers in their new book, “Wise Trees,” which will be published by Abrams in October.
They were in Japan documenting a nighttime cherry tree ritual when Ms. Cook learned that her father was dying.
“Taking that strength from the trees, we had this idea of looking at wise trees around the world,” said Ms. Cook.
I need to go back to that tree,’” Ms. Cook recalled.","Trees can live without us, but we cannot live without trees.

With a history dating back to the dinosaurs, trees are the planet’s documentarians, watching us cycle through life while providing oxygen, shade and shelter. Trees, the oldest of which, according to Peter Wohlleben’s “The Hidden Life of Trees,” has 9,500 years, are a critical part of the human experience. We rely on them, from their deep roots to fluttering leaves.

But — at least when we’re not cutting them down — how do we influence trees? Diane Cook and Len Jenshel present some answers in their new book, “Wise Trees,” which will be published by Abrams in October. Traveling to more than 70 locations, they found trees that represent “landscapes of complexity where nature and humanity converge.” In other words, trees with stories, like the young sycamore that witnessed the Civil War, or the elm that survived the Oklahoma City bombing. These photos show how events have shaped trees, their energy, and sometimes, literally, the shape of their limbs.

“Forty-million trees are being lost every day,” said Mr. Jenshel. “We love the environment and wanted to do something that would make people think differently about trees.”

Though Mr. Jenshel and Ms. Cook — who are married, collaborate on all their projects and frequently finish each other’s sentences — have a long history of photographing trees, a much more personal seed for their project was planted in the spring of 2012. They were in Japan documenting a nighttime cherry tree ritual when Ms. Cook learned that her father was dying. Struggling to process the information, she found herself watching the fragile petals of the cherry blossoms slowly drift to the ground, one by one.

“We did what the Japanese have been doing for centuries,” said Ms. Cook. “To take in that beauty, appreciate its ephemeral nature, and know that life does go on.”

Her father died soon after, but a new project was born, influenced by the cherry blossoms and a National Geographic magazine commission. “Taking that strength from the trees, we had this idea of looking at wise trees around the world,” said Ms. Cook. “And the importance trees have had throughout history in so many cultures.”

After the Sept. 11 attacks, search and rescue workers were looking for human remains among the rubble, when they found part of a Callery pear tree, which traditionally is the first tree to bloom in spring and the last to change leaves in autumn. Though its trunk was scorched and many branches missing, the tree had survived the attacks. Now a symbol of strength and survival, the pear tree was nursed back to health at a Bronx nursery and, nearly a decade later, replanted at the World Trade Center memorial.

Other trees have been a part of unspeakable cruelties. From 1846 to 1870, in Goliad, Tex., an oak known as “The Hanging Tree,” provided shade for court sessions and branches for lynching.

“It’s not always a happy story,” said Ms. Cook.

One of the rain or monkeypod trees in Cambodia (imported from South or Central America), was isolated from the others as “The Killing Tree.” In 1975 when Pol Pot’s murderous rule started, the tree was used to bash children’s heads while their mothers were forced to watch.

“It took us days to recover from that experience of photographing that tree,” said Ms. Cook. “That left the deepest scar on us.”

Other trees seem to travel, and quite far. It is not clear how the adansonia gregorii (or boab) tree got to Western Australia. Perhaps it was the result of seeds dropped from the fruits by early migrants. It was a good thing, though, for the local aboriginals who used the tree as a spiritual home and lifeline, since it can hold up to 26 gallons of water.

In India, from the ancient tree deities to current bodhis of enlightenment, most trees are seen as sacred. In a Varanasi sweet shop, they found a neem tree, said to cure all ailments. Long after they shot the photo, Ms. Cook noticed her spouse’s anxiety.

“Len kept saying, ‘I don’t think we got the picture. I need to go back to that tree,’” Ms. Cook recalled. “I totally knew it was about the sweets.”

But for Mr. Nikolaou, the project, called “…Balkaniotheque” and sponsored by the Onassis Foundation, became more than a multifaceted look at the region. It has been a search for his very identity.

“I am a Greek,” said Mr. Nikolaou, who calls both Athens and Chalkis home. “And I have multiple identities. I belong in the East, in the West, but I also belong in the Balkans. This was forgotten for Greeks. None define themselves as Balkan. I had to find myself.”

Early on, Mr. Nikolaou said the project felt like psychoanalysis, a dive into his soul and the way he learned how to feel. He became fixated on the notion of a shared, repressed Balkan identity, one that he could unearth and restore to the collective memory.

Photo

“I wish to describe the Balkan soul,” he said. “Which seems to be dark and intractable, but it becomes simple, warm and human when it flames up.”

Mr. Nikolaou said he allowed the places to which he journeyed to choose him, not the other way around. In his travels, he’s been to nearly a dozen countries, exploring bustling capital cities as well as Roma ghettos and mountain villages.

“I made more than 20 trips trying not just to take photos, but to feel the Balkan reality,” he said. “To see those deep characteristics of the Balkan people that I believe are common all over the peninsula.”

The Balkan people were very hospitable, Mr. Nikolaou said, though he preferred to stay in the remote, rural areas. “There I met the most important people,” he said. “People totally free from the stress of our civilization. People with pain in their eyes but firstly, with big, big heart.”

He bore witness to funerals, celebrated at weddings and made intimate connections with those who opened their homes and lives to him. That vulnerability fostered a sense of human unity that Mr. Nikolaou hopes to showcase.

“The Balkans are a place where people look so different, but they are so alike in the way they face life,” he said. “And that must be what will lead us in the future. It may seem utopian, but deep inside me I believe that all people can live without borders. Even in the war-crushed Balkans, we can. It is enough to look at what it is that unites us. And what unites us is more important than what keeps us divided.”

His law firm, Boies, Schiller & Flexner, has represented the Weinstein Company and its predecessor, Miramax, in a variety of legal matters.
In 2015, settlements were struck with Ms. Battilana and Lauren O’Connor, an employee of the Weinstein Company who submitted a searing memo in November that year alleging persistent sexual harassment by Mr. Weinstein.
He said he assumed they involved consensual affairs because Mr. Weinstein had insinuated that he was a philanderer.
Last Friday, the four who remained — Bob Weinstein, Mr. Ben Ammar, Mr. Koenigsberg and Mr. Maerov — announced that Harvey Weinstein would take a leave of absence while an outside lawyer investigated the complaints.","David Boies, a lawyer who represented Mr. Weinstein when his contract was up for renewal in 2015, said in an interview that the board and the company were made aware at the time of three or four confidential settlements with women.

And in the waning hours of last week, as he struggled to retain control of the business in the wake of allegations first reported by The New York Times, Harvey Weinstein fired off an email to his brother and other board members asserting that they knew about the payoffs, according to people who spoke on the condition of anonymity about the confidential communication.

Lance Maerov, the board member who handled the contract negotiations, acknowledged in an interview that he had been told of settlements, but said that he had assumed they were used to cover up consensual affairs. Mr. Maerov said that his chief concern had been whether Mr. Weinstein’s behavior posed a legal liability for the business, and that after receiving assurances that no company money was used and that no complaints against Mr. Weinstein were pending, he had approved the contract.

The Weinstein Investigation

Mr. Glasser declined to comment, as did Bob Weinstein. The board members Tarak Ben Ammar and Richard Koenigsberg did not respond to messages.

The contract came up for renewal just as Ambra Battilana, an Italian model, reported to the police that Harvey Weinstein had groped her during a work meeting at his Manhattan office. (Working with the police, she captured Mr. Weinstein speaking about the encounter in audio that was published along with an article in The New Yorker on Tuesday.)

The district attorney’s office declined to press charges, and Mr. Weinstein insisted that it was a setup, but some board members and top executives worried that Mr. Weinstein had engaged in a pattern of behavior that could jeopardize the company.

After the episode, Mr. Maerov said, Mr. Weinstein refused to let the board review his personnel file directly. Instead, it was examined by an outside lawyer, H. Rodgin Cohen, who assured the board in a September 2015 letter that it was legally safe to retain Mr. Weinstein because there were no unresolved complaints or threats of litigation against him, according to two people who saw the letter and spoke on the condition of anonymity.

In the file, Mr. Cohen came across a single sexual harassment allegation, from 2014, involving a former temporary employee, Emily Nestor, according to a person familiar with his review.

Ms. Nestor was new to the job at the company’s Los Angeles office when Mr. Weinstein invited her to breakfast at the Peninsula Beverly Hills and made her an offer: If she accepted his sexual advances, he would boost her career, according to accounts, viewed by The Times, that she provided to colleagues who passed them along to executives. She declined the offer and never intended to complain to human resources personnel, internal records show.

It is unclear whether the board was told of her allegation — by the executives or by Mr. Cohen, who declined to comment for this article. Mr. Maerov said, “Her name came up in 2015, but I don’t remember who brought it up.”

Mr. Cohen’s letter to the board did not describe the contents of Mr. Weinstein’s file, nor did it address whether Mr. Weinstein had entered into private settlements with women who complained of misconduct.

Photo

Mr. Boies said that at the time of the contract negotiations, he was aware of three or four settlements with women. He would not specify which ones, and would not say who within the company or the board was told of them or how the information was communicated.

His law firm, Boies, Schiller & Flexner, has represented the Weinstein Company and its predecessor, Miramax, in a variety of legal matters. He has also worked directly for Mr. Weinstein, as was the case during the contract negotiations. Mr. Boies said there was one settlement to which he “gave advice at or about the time it was being entered into” but declined to say which one.

The Times reported last week that Mr. Weinstein had entered into private settlements with at least eight women who complained of misconduct while he was at the Weinstein Company or Miramax. The Times was able to identify five of them. In the 1990s, payments were made to two female Miramax employees and the actress Rose McGowan. In 2015, settlements were struck with Ms. Battilana and Lauren O’Connor, an employee of the Weinstein Company who submitted a searing memo in November that year alleging persistent sexual harassment by Mr. Weinstein.

Mr. Maerov said that he had been prepared to investigate Ms. O’Connor’s allegations but that Mr. Weinstein’s lawyers told him she had withdrawn her complaint as part of a settlement. He said they also told him that Ms. O’Connor had submitted a letter of appreciation to the company and continued to work there for a period of time.

He recalled being told of the existence of other settlements, but never their details. He said he assumed they involved consensual affairs because Mr. Weinstein had insinuated that he was a philanderer. He said he was never told of a settlement with Ms. Battilana or any other payments made to women who alleged misconduct.

To address any lingering concern about Mr. Weinstein’s behavior, Mr. Maerov said he successfully pushed a new code of conduct at the company that included a detailed description of sexual harassment. The contracts for Mr. Weinstein and other top executives also came with a new clause: They would face costly fines if the company ever had to pay a settlement for their misconduct.

“I don’t know what else I could have done,” Mr. Maerov said.

Over the last week, four members seen as friendly with Mr. Weinstein have left the board. Last Friday, the four who remained — Bob Weinstein, Mr. Ben Ammar, Mr. Koenigsberg and Mr. Maerov — announced that Harvey Weinstein would take a leave of absence while an outside lawyer investigated the complaints. Two days later, they fired him, and began discussing changing the company’s name and removing him from the credits of upcoming projects.

The effort to separate him from the company is complicated by the fact that he and his brother own 42 percent of the business, its largest share.

In their statement on Tuesday, the four board members said they would assist with any investigations “while pursuing justice for the victims and a full and independent investigation of our own.”",Weinstein Company Was Aware of Payoffs in 2015,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/business/weinstein-company.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

tl;dr: Mondays are the easiest and they get harder as the week goes on.

This is probably a beginning solver’s most common mistake.

You know what it’s like: You have some downtime on a Saturday and you look around for something to pass the time. Your officemate keeps bragging about his ability to finish The New York Times Crossword. You hate your officemate.

So, not to be outdone, you pick up the paper or download our app and turn to the Saturday puzzle. How hard could it be?

Fun Fact: The Saturday crossword is actually the hardest puzzle of the week. Contrary to popular belief, the Sunday puzzles are midweek difficulty, not the hardest. Mondays have the most straightforward clues and Saturday clues are the most vague or involve the most wordplay. Some later-week puzzle clues may require specialized knowledge.

Just to drive the point home, let’s take a look at the difference between a Monday clue and a late-week clue for a popular crossword entry. OREO cookies (answers in puzzles are generally written in all capital letters) are such a popular entry in crosswords that they have been dubbed by some as the “official” cookie of the crossword. A typical Monday clue for OREO will be very straightforward and drive you almost directly to the answer.

“Nabisco cookie”

“Cookie with creme filling”

“‘Twist, Lick, Dunk’ cookie”

And here are some late-week clues, which might require more specialized knowledge about these delicious treats:

“Snack since 1912”

“It has 12 flowers on each side”

“Sandwich often given a twist”

We weren’t kidding you. There is a big difference between a Monday puzzle and a Saturday puzzle.

That doesn’t mean that you can’t work your way toward solving a late-week puzzle – and we recommend that you do, because they’re fun – but it takes experience and patience.

If you’re just getting started, though, make your life easy and solve as many Monday puzzles as you can. Eventually, you’ll be ready for more of a challenge, and that’s when you move on to Tuesday puzzles.

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — Today we get to watch a face-off between the good guys and the bad guys, courtesy of David J. Kahn.

Today’s Theme

The GUNFIGHT AT / THE O.K. CORRAL (28D and 62A) took place in October 1881, and was a 30-second shootout between the lawmen of Tombstone, Ariz., and a group of outlaws called the Cowboys (in those days, it was considered an insult to call a law-abiding cattleman a “cowboy”). Mr. Kahn was able to get only one law man (DOC HOLLIDAY) and one bad guy (IKE CLANTON) into his grid for space reasons.

In addition, we have four entries forming a circular “corral” of sorts (31A, 37D, 52A and 35D). All of them are synonyms for the word “O.K.,” but all are clued as something different, neatly hiding the connection to the theme in plain sight. That’s a pretty nice bonus.

Tricky Clues

1A: I had MACAU and MACAW (wrong, Deb! That’s a bird) before MACAO.

49A: Do you get tripped up by clues where the first word is actually a proper name? “Banks of Chicago” sounds as if it refers to places in Chicago where you can keep your money, but we’ve got only a five-letter slot. The constructor and editors have sneakily used the capital-letter-at-the-beginning-of-a-sentence rule against you. “Banks” refers to the baseball player ERNIE Banks.

Constructor Notes

I guess I can say with a smile that this is just an O.K. puzzle. This worked only because I was able to find 4 four-letter synonyms for O.K. that could be clued otherwise, which is why “so-so,” at first an obvious synonym, wasn’t included. I also wanted to include a gunfighter on each side. Fun fact: Kirk Douglas, who played Doc Holliday in the 1957 movie, celebrated his centennial last year.

All of these are part of Toyota’s marketing campaign for its new Camry. But which commercial you get to see may depend, in part, on what ethnicity you are.

Toyota

African-American This commercial of a black man driving is centered on the theme “strut,” and features an image of a peacock and the entrance music of the wrestler John Cena. Hispanic A Latino man enjoys his driving experience so much that he dares to decline a call from his mother, a move that the target audience is meant to see as rebellious. Asian-American A father picks up his daughter from baseball practice, a casting decision made to suggest that the Camry brings out the affectionate side of Asian-American fathers. ‘Transcultural Mainstream’ A schoolboy, a young woman and a bespectacled man are each waiting for someone. Their counterparts are joyful and unworried as they drive with Queen playing.

The company recently unveiled the numerous ads it had made for the car, several designed to resonate specifically with African-American, Hispanic or Asian-American audiences.

People may see different commercials based on whether they are watching “Scandal” on ABC, which tends to have a high number of African-American viewers, or a show on the Spanish-language network NBC Universo, according to the company’s ad agencies. Some of the ads that are meant to appeal specifically to minorities will also run on programming that appeals to a general audience, like “Sunday Night Football.”

Viewed together, the ads — and their different story lines, music and actors — offer a glimpse into how race and culture figure into American advertising today, showing how an ad for one product can evolve depending on who is making it and whom it is marketed to.

“People like to see people of all ethnicities in what they’re seeing because that’s the life they’re living in most of the U.S. today,” said Jack Hollis, group vice president and general manager of the Toyota brand.

Toyota

At the same time, added Mr. Hollis, who is white, “if a person of any group is looking for communication that is like them, that looks like them specifically, the good news is because of the breadth of something like a Camry campaign, they can find it.”

Companies have developed commercial campaigns aimed at minority groups for years, often in conjunction with specialized ad agencies. But Toyota’s efforts show how major companies are adjusting their marketing tactics as the nation’s demographics shift.

Some wonder, though, if these kind of specialized ads are even needed when the country’s population is getting more diverse.

“You see a real blending and a more progressive acknowledgment that there is significant diversity” in mainstream advertising, said Shalini Shankar, a professor at Northwestern University and the author of the book “Advertising Diversity.” Still, she said, “it doesn’t hurt to have more stuff that acknowledges that race is real.”

The advertising industry does not have a great track record when it comes to race, whether it’s the ads themselves or the lack of women and minorities at many agencies that make them. Just days ago, Dove was pilloried for a Facebook ad in which a black woman removed her brown shirt to reveal a white woman in a light-colored shirt.

The Camry campaign was developed jointly by a group of four ad agencies — one general agency and three that specialize in each ethnic group. The agencies — Saatchi & Saatchi, Burrell Communications, Conill and interTrend — each aimed their ads at Americans 25 to 49 years old and built them around the theme “Sensations.”

Four of the eight commercials are below, along with explanations from each agency about what it was trying to accomplish in its marketing.

We want to hear from you. Does a targeted approach reinforce stereotypes, or help represent a wider range of communities? Are there any past ads, bad or good, that have stood out to you?

African-American consumers The ad from Burrell, an agency that has specialized in African-American consumers since the 1970s and has worked with the likes of McDonald’s and Comcast, is titled “Strut.” It features an African-American man who orders a pizza from a restaurant that offers free delivery. “No, no, pickup,” he says, enjoying his drive as the hip-hop song, “The Time Is Now,” by the professional wrestler John Cena, plays in the background. The image of a peacock flashes after he opens the garage to reveal a red Camry, emphasizing the idea of showing off. Toyota He then drives past a movie theater whose marquee reads “Now Showing Out,” and he earns an admiring look from an African-American woman. “What we found with African-Americans is style really comes to the forefront in how we look at vehicles,” said Lewis Williams, Burrell's chief creative officer. “We see automobiles as extensions of ourselves, so style is really important.” Vicki Bolton, a group account director, added that the agency’s research had led it to the idea of strutting, because “we wanted people to take notice of us.” The actor was cast to portray “someone who felt athletic, who had this space that he could feel like a guy’s guy but could be a great father, someone who maybe moved to the suburbs and hadn’t lost his edge totally because now he has a car,” Mr. Williams said. “It gave him his strut back.” The music was also chosen to signal confidence and athleticism, and to give the ad a contemporary feel. Mr. Williams and Ms. Bolton, who are both African-American, said the agency relied on research, personal knowledge and a philosophy called “positive realism” to avoid stereotyping. “We always make sure we portray African-Americans in a positive light when we do any kind of media, as well as be very authentic to the stories we tell,” Mr. Williams said. “People want to see themselves in messaging,” Ms. Bolton said. She added that millennials may have broader social circles, but that “when they come home at the end of the day, they still want to see messaging with people that are reflective of them.”

Asian-American consumers In the commercial titled “Captivating,” a Chinese-American father picks his daughter up from baseball practice in a red Camry. She is focused on her tablet in the backseat until he turns Pandora on. As the music kicks up and the engine revs, both of their faces light up. The ad is from interTrend, a Long Beach, Calif., agency that specializes in marketing to Asian-Americans. It is the only Camry broadcast spot to focus on a father and daughter. The father was specifically cast to “highlight a not-often-seen behavior,” said Julia Huang, interTrend’s chief executive, who is Taiwanese-American. “Traditionally, Asian fathers show less emotion and affection toward their kids,” Ms. Huang said. “We wanted to show that driving the Camry brought out a different side of an Asian dad and how he wanted to share the experience with his daughter.” Toyota When asked about the potential pitfalls of perpetuating stereotypes through race-targeted ads, Ms. Huang said the word “has a stigma” attached to it. From a research perspective, she said, it is not stereotyping to say Asian-Americans view family and education as particularly important. “I’d like to say there is some value for value attributes that we pick up, and we highlight that,” she said, “so it’s not really a stereotype — it really is a core value that is embraced.” Baseball was chosen, Ms. Huang said, because it “is a universally popular sport among all Asian segments.” Others, like cricket, were dismissed as being “too obvious.”

Hispanic consumers The ad, called ""Rebellious,” shows a young man in a red Camry zooming down a highway when he sees his mother is calling his phone. He hesitates before deciding to decline the call, breaking into a smile and focusing on the joy of the drive. This commercial, which is in Spanish, is one of two from Conill, which markets to a Hispanic audience. Conill, which creates ads in both English and Spanish, approaches its work by considering how “acculturated” its target consumers are, said Jennifer Dellapina, group strategic planning director at Conill. It uses a model that “takes into account how long a person was in the United States, if they were born here, which language they speak, which culture they tend to feel more connected to,” she said. When Toyota’s agencies gathered, they concluded that potential Camry buyers were broadly ready for change, though the Hispanic consumer sought “some guardrails” with that effort, Ms. Dellapina, who is white, said. That came from a sense of responsibility, particularly to family, she said, adding that “internally, we called it ‘soaring with sense.’” That insight is reflected in the ad when the man declines the call, which Ms. Dellapina called an “edgy move.” “It’s a Hispanic thing — you’re going to talk to your mom once a week,” she said. Still, ignoring the call isn’t too radical of a move. “He’s not jumping off a cliff or burning down his house — he’s just not answering the call from his mom, and it’s sort of implied in my mind that he’s going to call her back later,” Ms. Dellapina said. In the agency’s other ad, titled “Striking,” a woman with a perfect manicure is driving a red Camry in what appear to be red heels, carefully applied makeup and jewelry. Toyota She applies red lipstick before strolling out of her red Camry to her final destination: a supermarket. The idea is to bring style wherever you go, Ms. Dellapina said. All of the characters in Conill’s commercials “are everyday people who portray different situations based on strong Hispanic insights, like the Latino woman who always wants to look and feel attractive — even when she is just doing the everyday tasks,” the firm said in an email.","Different Ads, Different Ethnicities, Same Car",https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/12/business/media/toyota-camry-ads-different-ethnicities.html

What we should probably be saying is ‘secure spouse.’”There’s yet another problem with calling your husband or wife your best friend.
Dr. Pearson said there’s a critical difference between a best friend and a spouse.
“He’s lots of things that my best friend isn’t, but my best friend is lots of things he’s not.”And that may be the point: Calling the person you’re married to your best friend may be shorthand for saying that you actually like your spouse and that you have shared history, shared lives and shared dreams.
After all, if your spouse is your best friend, then whom do you complain to your spouse about?","There is some research into this question. John Helliwell is a professor at the Vancouver School of Economics and the editor of the World Happiness Report. As he researched social connections a few years ago, he found that everyone derives benefits from online friends and real-life friends, but the only friends that boost our life satisfaction are real friends.

“But while the effects of real friends on your well-being is important for everybody,” he said, “they are less so for married people than for singles. That’s how we got to the idea that marriage is a kind of ‘super-friendship.’”

Dr. Helliwell and a colleague discovered that a long-running study in Britain had data that may illuminate this question. Between 1991 and 2009, the British Household Panel Survey asked 30,000 people to quantify their life satisfaction. In general, married people expressed higher satisfaction, he said, and were better able to manage the dip in well-being that most people experience in middle age, as they face work stress, caring for aging parents and other pressures.

Photo

But an entirely separate part of the study asked people to name their best friend. Those who listed their spouse were twice as likely to have higher life satisfaction. Slightly more men than women made that choice, he said, “which makes sense, because men tend to have fewer friends.”

Is feeling this way about your spouse necessary for a good marriage? I asked.

“Absolutely not,” Dr. Helliwell said. “The benefits of marriage are strong even for those who are littered with outside friends. It’s just bigger for those who consider their spouse their closest friend. It’s a bonus.”

Others are not so sure.

Amir Levine is a psychiatrist and neuroscientist at Columbia University, and the co-author of “Attached.” A student of social relations, Dr. Levine explained that everyone has what he calls a hierarchy of attachment, meaning if something bad happens to us, we have a ranking of the people we call. In our early decades, those on the highest rungs are usually our parents or other family members.

“The problem as you grow older is, how do you let somebody close who’s basically a total stranger?” he said. “Nature came up with a trick: It’s called attraction. Sexual attraction brings down all the barriers, lets you get close to a new person in a physical way that you don’t get close to your family.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Over time, of course, this physical connection wanes. While many bemoan this loss of titillation, Dr. Levine celebrates it. “It’s smart,” he said. “If you’re going to be crazy about the other person all the time, how are you going to raise kids? How are you going to be able to work?”

Instead of complaining, we should view this new phase as an achievement: “O.K., now I have this person I’m attached to. I have the feeling of security. That’s what allows me to be an individual again and self-actualize.”

It’s this feeling of security, Dr. Levine says, that leads us to describe our spouses as “friends.” But that language is not quite right, he says. First, couples still need what he calls “maintenance sex,” because it re-establishes physical closeness and renews attachment.

Second, the term “friendship” is “an underwhelming representation of what’s going on,” he said. “What people basically mean is, ‘I’m in a secure relationship. Being close to my partner is very rewarding. I trust them. They’re there for me in such a profound way that it allows me to have courage to create, to explore, to imagine.’”

Dr. Levine summarizes this feeling with the (somewhat awkward) acronym Carrp; your partner is consistent, available, responsive, reliable and predictable. But don’t we already have a word, “spouse,” that fits this description? I said. Why are we suddenly using the expression “best friend,” when that doesn’t seem to fit at all?

“Because not every spouse provides that,” he said, “and we’re indicating we don’t take it for granted. What we should probably be saying is ‘secure spouse.’”

There’s yet another problem with calling your husband or wife your best friend. The words mean totally different things.

Peter Pearson and Ellyn Bader are founders of the Couples Institute in Menlo Park, Calif., and the authors of “Tell Me No Lies.” They’ve also been married for more than 30 years. Dr. Pearson said there’s a critical difference between a best friend and a spouse. “One of the criteria for a best friend is you feel unconditionally accepted,” he said. “Do I care if my buddy Mark is messy in the kitchen, leaves his bathroom a shambles and doesn’t pay his income taxes?”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

But with a spouse, he said, you can’t avoid these topics.

Dr. Bader said that when couples are just getting to know each other, they often say they’re companions, and she’s fine with that. When couples have been together 30, 40 or 50 years, they use similar language, and that can be the mark of a healthy relationship.

“It’s the in-between ones, when they use the language of friendship, my stomach turns,” Dr. Bader said. “It’s a red flag for a lot of conflict avoidance and intensity avoidance. It often means they’ve given up on the complexity of being with somebody. Instead of saying, ‘Oh, well, that’s who they are,’ it’s better if they try to work things out.”

Dr. Bader said that she wished popular magazines would challenge the notion that you shouldn’t get married to change someone. “I think that’s what marriage is about,” she said. “It’s where some of the juices come from, and it’s also how you get the best out of the person you marry.”

A good marriage, she said, is when people “push each other, challenge each other, encourage each other and, yes, change each other.”

Asked if they were best friends, they laughed. “We’re good friends,” Dr. Pearson said.

“Really good friends,” Dr. Bader said. “He’s lots of things that my best friend isn’t, but my best friend is lots of things he’s not.”

And that may be the point: Calling the person you’re married to your best friend may be shorthand for saying that you actually like your spouse and that you have shared history, shared lives and shared dreams. But in the end, the expression doesn’t do justice to the full meaning of marriage or to the full meaning of friendship.

Some wondered if they were an adaptation to pollution — like the peppered moths of Britain’s Industrial Age. But Mr. DuBay and Carl Fuldner, a graduate student in art history at the University of Chicago and a co-author, used a special microscope to look closely at the feathers. They were just dirty — dusted in the same tiny particles of black carbon that were there a hundred years ago.

The team realized this dirty mess was a beautiful opportunity. Birds molt every year, so grimy feathers contained no more than a year’s worth of black carbon. With enough samples, they could place these birds back in their historical context.

They quantified the sootiness by taking pictures of the chests of sparrows, woodpeckers, larks and towhees and measuring how well they reflected light. Black carbon isn’t very reflective — which is why it’s been a problem in the environment. It absorbs sunlight and generates heat, leading to alterations in cloud cover and precipitation or acceleration of the melting of snow and ice.

The team found that dirty feathers corresponded to historical reports and other atmospheric measurements — and they were more localized in time and space. They hope that scientists and policy makers can use the data to inform climate models and environmental policy. And the birds, once dead and void of context in museum drawers, now play a part in environmental history.

The Yankees now head to Houston, where they will begin the American League Championship Series on Friday against a familiar nemesis: the Astros left-hander Dallas Keuchel, who helped eliminate them in the 2015 wild-card playoff.

The Yankees, though, are unlikely to be cowed after having rallied to knock off the Indians, who had roared their way to an American League-leading 102 victories and had lost only four times between Aug. 23 and the end of the regular season.

“Any time you’re down 2-0, and particularly the way it happened — it was a tough loss — it shows a lot about them,” Hal Steinbrenner, the Yankees’ principal owner, said as he stood outside the jubilant clubhouse. “They’ve been loose the entire time, just lighthearted the entire time, had their backs the entire time.”

The Yankees staved off elimination first with a 1-0 win in Game 3 on Sunday behind Masahiro Tanaka’s dominant performance and Greg Bird’s solo homer. Then they evened the series Monday night with a 7-3 victory in Game 4.

The Yankees got an auspicious start on Wednesday from Gregorius, who had an uneasy transition to the Bronx when he replaced Derek Jeter two years ago. He hit both home runs in the first three innings off the Indians ace Corey Kluber; Gregorius had entered Wednesday with two career hits (in 15 at-bats) off Kluber.

Gregorius speaks four languages fluently: Dutch, Spanish, Papiamento — the tongue of his native Curaçao — and English. But as home runs have flown off his bat and he settled into the middle of the Yankees’ lineup this season, his answer to whether he considered himself a home run hitter was easy to understand in any language: No.

“If I hit a home run, I hit a home run,” Gregorius said. “I’m not going out to try to hit home runs every time.”

If the regular season, when he hit 25 home runs — breaking Jeter’s record for a Yankees shortstop — was not enough to prompt a reconsideration, these playoffs have been. Gregorius also blasted a momentum-swinging home run against the Minnesota Twins in the Yankees’ 8-4 wild-card victory before adding two more on Wednesday night.

“I think back to a couple of years ago when we first got him and everybody in the stands every night was chanting Derek Jeter’s name,” Gardner said. “Nowadays you don’t hear that.”

Gregorius’s first home run, on a 1-2 fastball, stunned the capacity crowd at Progressive Field and put the Yankees ahead by 1-0 in the first inning. The second came in the third, on a 1-1 curveball, and pushed the Yankees’ advantage to 3-0.

“I was on base for the second one and it was a no-doubter, but I told him I went back to tag up because I figured there’s no way he could take him deep twice in the same game,” Gardner said.

That was all the offense the Yankees would need — and all they would get until the ninth. With his team clinging to a 3-2 lead, Gardner hit a two-out single to right field on the 12th pitch of his at-bat against closer Cody Allen. Aaron Hicks raced home from second and, when right fielder Jay Bruce’s throw bounced away from shortstop Francisco Lindor, an alert Todd Frazier dashed home.

That sealed a comeback that was made possible by the Yankees’ pitching staff, which yielded five runs over the final three games. And they mustered enough offense to overcome a grim series from Aaron Judge, who struck out four times on Wednesday and finished the series 1 for 20 with 16 strikeouts, shattering the record for a playoff series of 13 that had been held by four other players: Ryan Howard, Jackson, Brandon Moss and Javier Baez.

The Yankees’ scant offense stood up on Wednesday because of a calm start from C. C. Sabathia and a finishing kick from Robertson and Chapman, who covered the final two innings. Robertson, who threw a career-high 52 pitches in the wild-card game eight days earlier, had not looked the same since, surrendering the game-tying home run to Bruce in Game 2.

But Girardi called on him after the Indians strung together four consecutive one-out singles — from Jackson, Bruce, Roberto Perez and Giovanny Urshela— to narrow the Yankees’ lead to 3-2 in the fifth. It would turn out to be the game’s crucial moment.

With runners at first and second, Lindor — who had a woeful series other than his tide-turning grand slam in Game 2 — hit an 0-1 cutter back up the middle. Robertson reached for it but pulled his glove away at the last instant, which proved to be a wise decision.

“You see a ball coming back at you, your first response is to protect yourself, whether it’s hit hard or not,” Robertson said.

The ball bounced right to Gregorius, who was stationed almost directly behind second base. He stepped on the bag and threw to first for a double play that ended the threat.

It was another moment in this series where the margin of victory was pinstripe thin. If Judge were 6 feet tall instead of 6-foot-7, he might not have been able to leap at the wall to steal what looked to be a two-run homer from Lindor in the Yankees’ 1-0 win in Game 3. And the Yankees took the lead in Game 4 when Frazier’s line drive landed precisely on the line, opening a four-run inning.

But even being in this series felt unlikely when the Yankees arrived in Tampa for spring training. They hoped a night like Wednesday was possible — but few believed it would come this season.

The unloading of many of the Yankees veterans last year — like Alex Rodriguez, Mark Teixeira, Carlos Beltran and Brian McCann — created a great deal of enthusiasm around their raft of young talent. But it was also accompanied by plenty of questions. Two young players who emerged as stars this season, Judge and pitcher Luis Severino, did not solidify their roster spots until the week before opening day.

But the Yankees coalesced quickly. They posted the best exhibition record in baseball and carried that into the regular season, leaping to a 21-9 start through early May. The next several months carried with it some travails — injuries, Judge’s second-half funk and Chapman’s temporary demotion among them – but the Yankees chased the Boston Red Sox for the American League East title until the penultimate day of the season.

As it turned out, it was not a pyrrhic chase.

What did you most connect with in the Marston story?

There was this incredible love story at the origin of what Wonder Woman would come to be. The Marstons were psychologists, and they really thought that if you could change hearts and minds, you could change the world. Marston called Wonder Woman “psychological propaganda” to try to get young boys and men to respect powerful women and find their power attractive. And he had this notion that if women ran the world, the world would be a better place.

The Wonder Woman aspect of the story seems an easy sell. But the kink and the three-way relationship less so. Did you think you would have trouble getting this made?

I spent many a night arguing with myself, being like, “Why are you even bothering to work on this because it will never see the light of day.” But I became obsessed with telling it, whether or not it would come to fruition, because I became enchanted with the characters and the process of writing it. I really wanted to tell a very organic love story without any editorializing or winking. I didn’t want to otherize the experience of what they were doing. I made the decision, very overtly, to tell the story using the conventions of a classic prestige biopic. I thought the content in and of itself was so potentially controversial that I wanted to just treat their lives the way you would treat anybody else’s life. I feel that kink is often portrayed in the movies as scandalous and dark or transgressive. But in their case, I didn’t think it was. In the film, it’s linked to this notion of fantasy versus reality. In this fantastical world, which ultimately leads to Wonder Woman, they can be their truest version of themselves.

Frequently female filmmakers will make one independent film and not make another for years, if at all, while men may make an indie and then be given a franchise. As a black lesbian director, you made the short film “D.E.B.S,” got studio money to make a feature of it, then got to helm a movie in Disney’s “Herbie” franchise the next year. How did you defy the odds?

Nina Jacobson was running Disney, and she was an amazing mentor to me, and I don’t know if I would have gotten that job if Nina wasn’t running the studio at that point. But she loved “D.E.B.S.” and was a really big supporter of mine and gave me the job.

“Professor Marston and the Wonder Women” is your first feature since “Herbie” in 2005, although you frequently work in television. Did you find it hard to get another movie off the ground in that time?

It was less like I feel like I can’t get my movie made. It was more the stories I wanted to tell. After “Herbie,” I tried to set up a bunch of projects, and they always had strong female protagonists. I would sell them to studios, but I realized they were never going to make them. I think the actual executives wanted to, but the machinery of the industry was like, these kinds of movies with female leads flop.

But I had worked as a writer of the first season of “The L Word” and [the series creator] Ilene Chaiken said, “Why don’t you come and direct a few episodes?” It was just fantastic because there were all these strong female roles in cable. It was just when the wind really started hitting the sails of this kind of cable television revolution. And I feel like I was, if not on the ground floor, on the second floor of that.

How did you decide you wanted to make movies?

I originally wanted to be a theater director. But I remember a long time ago I was marching in the gay pride parade in Manhattan. And around the same time the “Friends” episode with the lesbian moms had aired. I remember thinking how many people am I reaching walking down Fifth Avenue? Thirty million people saw a positive portrayal of lesbian moms through their friend Ross. And how much does that move the dial? So I became very interested in how pop culture can really move forward political progress.",Wonder Woman’s Surprising Back Story Has a Film of Its Own,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/movies/wonder-woman-professor-marston-angela-robinson.html

With the Louvre’s magnificent interior architecture enhancing the composition of his shots, Mr. Guilbert chose to use the same light that illuminates the masterworks, to strong effect.
Then she stamped the backs of the canvases with a Louvre seal, added her own signature and escorted them from the museum.
“The Metro is like the subway in New York,” Mr. Guilbert said.","Andre Martin and Renaud Wald made off with the paintings from the Louvre without triggering the dreaded “red procedure.” That’s the high-tech system that automatically seals exits and locks doors throughout the vast museum within two minutes of a security breach. The duo then carried the artworks to a nearby Metro station and casually boarded a train.

Just two cool customers who just pulled off the most brazen daylight art heist ever captured on film?

Non. The two are Louvre copyists, upholders of what Ivan Guilbert, a Parisian photojournalist, calls “a beautiful tradition” that dates to the French Revolution. In November 1793, one month after Marie Antoinette was beheaded, the revolutionary national assembly declared the Louvre Palace, Louis XIV’s former residence on the Right Bank of the Seine, open to the public. All citizens were welcomed to enjoy the national art treasures stored there, previously for the pleasure of the golden carriage set only.

Called the Central Museum of the Arts of the Republic, the people’s musée took the democratic ideal a step further. Any professional, amateur or aspiring painter was invited to enter the museum, set up an easel — provided free of charge to this day — and have a go at copying a masterpiece.

Thousands have since followed suit. Among them are such art history boldfaced names as Paul Cézanne, Edgar Degas, Marc Chagall, Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dalí. The goal for them, and the present-day copyists whom Mr. Guilbert photographed for Le Parisien Magazine, is to learn the secrets of color, technique and composition by copying the works of some of the greatest artists of all time. “It’s like a free school,” says Mr. Guilbert.

Photo

“You have to copy and recopy the masters,” Degas once said, “and it’s only after having proved oneself as a good copyist that you can reasonably try to do a still life of a radish.”

The ambitions of the copyists Mr. Guilbert photographed went well beyond fruits and vegetables. Marius Allier, a 26-year-old graduate of the School of Fine Arts in Paris, drew crowds as he tackled Eugène Delacroix’s “Women of Algiers (in their Apartment).” The 1834 painting presents challenges that have made it long popular among copyists, including Picasso, who later painted his own variations in the 1950s.

Catherine Balpe, an amateur painter, copied Theodore Chasseriau’s 1843 portrait, “The Two Sisters,” as a gift for her husband. Sam Rachamin journeyed from his home in Israel to render his copy of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres’s 1808 painting, “The Bather.”

Mr. Martin, 58, is a professional painter — but of houses, not canvases. A self-taught artist who paints using an easel and much smaller brushes when he’s not climbing ladders, copied “View of Pirna from the Sonnenstein Castle” by the Italian artist Bernardo Bellotto.

Though the Louvre, unlike other leading museums, does not charge copyists for the privilege, applicants can wait up to two years for one of the 250 permits the museum issues annually. Valid for three months, it allows them to work in the museum’s galleries from 9:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. most days, except Sundays and holidays, from September through June.

Photo

Tourists and other museum visitors can bring cameras into the Louvre and take pictures. But because Mr. Guilbert planned to shoot for publication, he applied for, and received permission to spend three days in the galleries with the copyists. “For me, the assignment was like a romantic experience,” he says.

With the Louvre’s magnificent interior architecture enhancing the composition of his shots, Mr. Guilbert chose to use the same light that illuminates the masterworks, to strong effect. “I never used a flash,” he says. “It’s most interesting to work with what you’re given.”

Finished with their copies, Mssrs. Martin and Wald, a photographer who copied Agnolo Bronzino’s “Portrait of a Man Holding a Statuette,” met with Isabelle Vieilleville, director of the Louvre’s copy office. To guard against forgeries, she checked that the two copyists had used canvases that were one-fifth smaller or larger than the original, and that the original artists’ signatures were not reproduced on the copies. Then she stamped the backs of the canvases with a Louvre seal, added her own signature and escorted them from the museum.

On the train, masterworks in hand, they drew little more than a double take or two. “The Metro is like the subway in New York,” Mr. Guilbert said. “There was not really much reaction from the other passengers. They have seen it all.”

At my first meal I was nonplused by the shrimp cocktail: The shrimp were warm but served on ice, and the cocktail sauce was a bizarre and acidic collision of peaches and horseradish. The last time I went, these hot-and-cold shrimp weren’t on the menu. I hope they are using their time away to think about the choices they’ve made.

Nothing else was so misconceived. But spicy avocado dip punched the lights out of a delicately flaky Chinese scallion pancake with basil in place of scallions. Nondescript cheese, bland mushrooms and a pointless egg dragged down a pizza with a very good, light crust. And Manhattan clam chowder, repurposed as a sauce for a fine, clean-tasting hunk of pan-seared salmon, was the answer to a question nobody asked.

The only reason I can think of for hijacking red chowder like this is to make a connection with New York. But with a few exceptions, Public Kitchen doesn’t explore the city’s food in a coherent or illuminating way. And it doesn’t come close to hitting, as the website puts it, “all of the cultures that make up the eclectic mix and melting pot that is New York City.” Thai flavors animate one side dish, roasted carrots in red curry paste and coconut milk. But the main cuisines brought into play are Italian and Chinese, as if it were still 1970.

A good menu doesn’t need a theme to hang together, of course. The pastry chef, Eric Kalaboke, found a through line in slightly old-fashioned favorites like a fruit cobbler capped with sweet sticks of puff pastry, an extremely endearing chocolate layer cake with blackberry sorbet and peanut butter ice cream, and a quietly spectacular tartufo resting in sour-cherry syrup. As for the wine list, it does a great job of presenting reasonably priced bottles from all over, made by some of the leading producers in their regions. This is a nice surprise in a hotel that seems to have been built as a backdrop for the cocktail lifestyle.

And if your big idea is New York City, you’re probably better off underplaying it than going all out like the Grill, where they all but park a Checker cab next to your table. There are no lectures at Public Kitchen, blessedly, no footnotes or history lessons. The closest I got to an elucidation of the menu was when a server said, “Everything is individually portioned and meant to be shared with the table” — a Zen koan for our time.

Still, it’s a sign of trouble that what Public Kitchen is trying to pull off doesn’t come across clearly.

Yet Mr. Trump’s longstanding contempt for the nuclear accord — he has labeled it a “disaster” and the “worst deal ever” — has kept it center stage.

Lawmakers in the House and Senate remained largely in the dark on Wednesday as to Mr. Trump’s precise plans, even as congressional leaders prepared for the likelihood that the deal’s fate would end up in their laps by week’s end. Other lawmakers, including some Republicans once critical of the deal, called on Mr. Trump to preserve it himself.

All were operating under the assumption that Mr. Trump is preparing to withhold certification. In so doing, he would make it easier for Congress to reimpose sanctions on Iran’s nuclear program and effectively kill the deal with simple majorities in both chambers.

But senior Republican congressional aides said that outcome appeared unlikely, even if much of their party — and many Democrats — remained critical of the deal. Without explicit evidence of a breach by the Iranians, and given Europe’s support for the deal, there appeared to be little appetite among Republican leaders to pull the plug on Mr. Trump’s behalf.

“As flawed as the deal is, I believe we must now enforce the hell out of it,” Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said on Wednesday. He urged Mr. Trump to provide Congress with clear instructions for what he was trying to do.

“Whatever he decides, it is critical that the president lay out the facts,” Mr. Royce said. “He should explain what his decision means, and what it doesn’t.”

Mr. Royce and others in the House have argued instead for stepped-up enforcement and the enforcement of additional, targeted sanctions against Iran’s missile program and Hezbollah. Lawmakers were also preparing for the possibility that Mr. Trump could simply ask them to amend the law that requires him to recertify the deal every 90 days.

Any legislative outcome is likely to hinge on the Senate, where Democrats are confident they can hold most of their members together to preserve the deal. Of the four Senate Democrats who voted against the deal, two — Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, and Ben Cardin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee — have indicated they would not move to abandon it.

That leaves two other previous Democratic no votes, Robert Menendez of New Jersey and Joe Manchin of West Virginia, undecided. But Republicans could also lose some of their own, like Senators John McCain and Jeff Flake of Arizona, Susan Collins of Maine or Rand Paul of Kentucky.

Looming over all this is the prerogative of Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the Republican chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee who has been bitterly feuding with Mr. Trump. Mr. Corker’s sway over the committee, and the Republican caucus, could prove consequential in advancing legislation.

Photo

Some people expressed concern that Mr. Corker could no longer play the role of broker between the White House and Congress — a role that is not easily replaced. The Senate’s other leading Iran expert, Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, is viewed as too hard-line to be an intermediary.

As the White House prepared to roll out the policy, experts were focusing on two unanswered questions: how it would confront Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militant group, and whether it would designate the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization. Such a designation would be significant because the guard corps is the military wing of the Iranian government.

John Kerry, the former secretary of state who negotiated the Iran deal, warned House Democrats that such a move would set a dangerous precedent, according to a person who attended the briefing. Additionally, Ernest Moniz, the former energy secretary who was deeply involved in the negotiations, briefed House Democrats on Wednesday afternoon.

There were other concerns. Democrats argued that whatever the intention of Mr. Trump’s maneuvering, it would be lost on America’s negotiating partners abroad.

Representative Eliot L. Engel, top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee, who was previously critical of the deal, said that decertifying the agreement amounted to “playing with fire.”

Jake Sullivan, who helped negotiate the deal for the Obama administration, said, “This dance around decertification has not been productive for our broader goals. It’s much harder to push our European partners to pressure Iran on missiles and terrorism when they are more focused on the risk Washington poses than they are on the risk Tehran poses.”

SATURDAY PUZZLE — I’m going to do something a bit different today. I’ve spilled a few clues, but I want you to get through the puzzle yourself, mostly so you will appreciate the rest of the column. I’ve been looking for an opportunity to develop my Lewis Black impression, and this is it.

Sometimes, when I’m feeling like I haven’t yet had enough pain and humiliation in my life, I take a Zumba class. No, don’t write me letters about how I’m doing it wrong and if I would just relax I’d learn to enjoy it. No one on the entire planet has ever convinced another human being to do anything that way, especially when it comes to tripping over their own two feet. I’ve accepted my fate when it comes to Zumba.

At other times, I solve puzzles by Byron Walden. It has largely the same effect as the Zumba, minus the muscle pain. Mr. Walden, who is one of the nicest people you would ever want to meet, quietly takes his aggressions out by writing the kind of clues that make many solvers, myself included, feel a lot like this dog:

That’s called misdirection. Misdirection is when you look at a clue like 20D’s “One who tries to avoid being touched” and your brain starts to run through the names of disorders where people don’t like being touched because that’s got to be what the constructor is thinking, right, and then the answer winds up being an odd word like EPEEIST. (A “touch” is when your fencing opponent scores against you.)

It’s when you see a clue like “Fabulous speaker?” and think O.K., maybe it’s AESOP, because you’ve been trained, I mean trained, to think AESOP’s fables whenever you see the word “fabulous” in a clue, but the answer turns out to be LIAR. And he’s not wrong. Someone who tells tales is a LIAR.

WASHINGTON — President Trump suggested again on Thursday that Puerto Rico bore some of the blame for its current crisis following twin hurricanes, and that there were limits to how long he would keep troops and federal emergency workers on the island to help.

Mr. Trump, who has been criticized for a slow and not always empathetic response to the storms that ravaged the United States territory, sounded off in a series of early-morning tweets. Angry about the criticism, he has sought to refocus blame to where he believes it belongs — the leadership of the island itself, which in his view mismanaged its affairs long before the winds blew apart its infrastructure.

“‘Puerto Rico survived the Hurricanes, now a financial crisis looms largely of their own making.’ says Sharyl Attkisson,” he wrote, citing the host of a public affairs show on Sinclair Broadcast Group television stations. “A total lack of accountability say the Governor. Electric and all infrastructure was disaster before hurricanes. Congress to decide how much to spend. We cannot keep FEMA, the Military & the First Responders, who have been amazing (under the most difficult circumstances) in P.R. forever!”

Puerto Rico was already facing deep financial troubles before Hurricanes Irma and Maria swept across the island, knocking out many basic services. As of earlier this week, nearly three weeks after Maria hit, 84 percent of the island remained without electricity, two-thirds of cellphone towers were down, only 392 miles of the 5,073 miles of roads were open and about 6,000 people were still in shelters.

WASHINGTON — Leaders of the House Intelligence Committee said on Wednesday that they planned to make public the thousands of Facebook ads linked to Russia that appeared during the 2016 presidential election campaign, the first indication that the ads would be released.

The lawmakers told reporters about their plans after an afternoon meeting with Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer. They said the 3,000 ads would probably be released after a Nov. 1 hearing on the role of social media platforms in Russia’s interference in the election. That hearing, and a similar one that the Senate Intelligence Committee plans to hold with Facebook, Google and Twitter, will place Silicon Valley’s top companies under a harsh spotlight as the public perception of the giants shifts in Washington.

Ms. Sandberg sat down with Representative K. Michael Conaway of Texas, the Republican leader of the House investigation, and Representative Adam B. Schiff of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the committee, at the start of two full days of meetings with federal officials. The meetings are a part of the company’s lobbying and public relations push to contain fallout from disclosures that a group linked to Russia bought more than $100,000 in ads on divisive issues on Facebook.

4) 10 A.M. Coffee Talk

In a brick building on a pretty cobblestone courtyard, Great Coffee lives up to its name. Run by the award-winning barista Soren Stiller Markussen, this warehouselike coffee shop focuses on the craft of coffee brewing, with a micro-roastery, brew-ratio charts on the wall, a menu of espresso options and five different filter methods. Feeling overwhelmed? Then slip inside RS28, a laid-back coffee shop where the reception is friendly, the lattes are frothy, and the knowledgeable baristas are happy to chat about the flavors of the daily brew.

5) 11 A.M. Library of the Future

Anyone who doubts the value of a physical library in the digital age ought to visit Dokk1, the new home of the city’s public library. Situated on the waterfront, this neo-futuristic heptagonal structure with walls of glass was designed by the Danish architecture firm Schmidt Hammer Lassen. Take a tour of the building — there are also spaces for cultural events, exhibitions, performances, offices, lounges and dining — before checking out the outdoor art installations, exploring the series of playgrounds on the terrace, perusing media in the library and admiring the views across the water and once-industrial harbor.

6) 12:30 P.M. Smorrebrod Supreme

When Wassim Hallal, one of the city’s top Michelin-starred chefs, turned his attention to smorrebrod, the classic Danish open-faced sandwich, Aarhusians took notice. In a prime riverside location, F-Hoj is an upscale deli serving Mr. Hallal’s refined twists on traditional smorrebrod alongside tempting cakes and chocolate confections. At lunch, snag a table in the small seating nook to try the half-dozen varieties on Danish rye, which recently included chicken salad with apples in a creamy mustard sauce topped with strips of fried chicken skin (65 kroner), and the sublime “burning love” smorrebrod with mashed potatoes, crisp bacon bits, caramelized onions and baby greens (65 kroner).

7) 2 P.M. Danish Designs

Danish design has dictated furniture trends for decades, from midcentury functionalists like Wegner and Jacobsen to the modern-day trendsetters Muuto and Hay. A visit to the Copenhagen-based furniture house Paustian, in a rambling 19th-century former railway station near the waterfront, will reveal an aspirational cross-section of Danish and international design pieces, with classics alongside soon-to-be-classics. Shop for a masterpiece, like Poul Henningsen’s artichoke lamp, or pick up packable collectibles, like a dollhouse-size Eames chair or Kay Bojesen’s hanging wooden monkey, a mainstay in Danish children’s rooms for over half a century.

8) 4:30 P.M. Culture Center

Living up to its capital-of-culture title, Aarhus has repurposed an old freight yard as Godsbanen, a center for cultural production where artists, writers, performers and creative types of every stripe are invited to use the studios, galleries, stages and workshops. Come for the packed calendar of events: street fairs, food and beer festivals, artisan and flea markets, and music performances ranging from jazz to glitter raves. On the rare occasion that nothing’s scheduled, stroll around the neighboring Institut for (X), a colorful shantytown of former railroad buildings and makeshift shipping containers housing dozens of studios and workshops for alternative and entrepreneurial projects — a graffiti supply shop, woodworking studios, a reggae grill — as well as playgrounds, a plant market, pop-up shops and a vegetarian cafe.

9) 8 P.M. Hygge Heaven

Embrace hygge, the Danish concept of convivial coziness, over a meal at Vesterlauget Madbodega, a homey restaurant with flea-market furnishings and candles atop wooden tables meant for sharing. During the day, the space serves hearty English breakfasts and smorrebrod lunches, but in the evening, crowds come for dinner when the menu consists of one main course — perhaps porchetta with barley, peas and fennel, or Danish farm chicken with lentils, herbs and parsnips (85 kroner) – and one dessert, like a rhubarb-mascarpone-hazelnut tart (45 kroner), which change daily. Add to that an excellent selection of local beers and spirits, and your hyggelig evening is complete.

10) 11 P.M. Creative Cups

Curious about cocktails served in miniature bathtubs? Then reserve a table at Gedulgt, a lively speakeasy-inspired cocktail bar that opened in January with a discreet backyard entrance and a menu of creative libations. Inspired by the movie “American Beauty,” the frothy bathtub cocktail of tea-infused gin, double cream, lime, lemon, egg white and acacia honey is a showstopper strewn with crimson rose petals (130 kroner). For a more demure drink, try the Can Can (Pimm’s, sloe gin, lime and ginger beer; 85 kroner) served with mint in a tin can.","36 Hours in Aarhus, Denmark",https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/12/travel/what-to-do-36-hours-in-aarhus-denmark.html

The vocal melodies are also all Mr. Plant, delivered in a haunting, otherworldly mode. “I tried with this record to make melodies really, really important,” he said. “And to use celestial backing vocals to create a different R.P.”

The result is a heady, autumnal record, blending Mr. Plant’s early influences (the folk musicians Bert Jansch and John Fahey), blues-fueled riffs, Berber sounds and Bristol trip-hop sonics. Many of the songs, including the title track, are love ballads tinged with fables. In contrast, “Carving Up the World Again … A Wall Not a Fence” is a Sun Records-ish stomper spiked with a curling, Middle Eastern guitar solo that delves into post-“Brexit” and President Trump discourse. Taking part of its title from a quote by Mr. Trump, Mr. Plant takes aim at jingoism and the refugee crisis. “There’s progress in many areas of humanity, but it’s juxtaposed with doors slamming and pain,” he said.

The sole cover, of an old rockabilly tune called “Bluebirds Over the Mountain,” gets new energy from a fractured electronic beat and the twinned vocals of Mr. Plant and the Pretenders’ Chrissie Hynde.

Mr. Plant is delighted that there’s still an audience for his music and a major record label, Nonesuch, invested in releasing it into the world. But that’s about as much thought as he puts into who might be out there listening. He emphatically does not delve into Spotify data to learn more. “No, I don’t give a hoot,” he says. “I couldn’t even think about it. I don’t think I write to suit anybody — I just write to suit my mood.”

As for his old band, Mr. Plant said he sees Mr. Page and the bassist John Paul Jones “from time to time, and it’s very civil.” The three were thrown back together in 2016 during a high-profile copyright lawsuit over the song “Stairway to Heaven,” which the band won, but Mr. Plant doesn’t seem eager to relive that: “We’re enthusiastic toward each other, and each of us does our own things, and that’s how it is.”

When Led Zeppelin ended in 1980, Mr. Plant set out to live a more human-scale life. To the public annoyance of his old bandmates, he’s been emphatic about not reviving the band for a full-scale tour, and when asked about it he tends to make an artistic argument about wanting to resist nostalgia. (Fans of “Raising Sand” have more reason to hope: “Alison and I talk about it all the time.”) But there might be another, simpler, reason — maybe there just isn’t any payday, no matter how vast, worth more than his carefully cultivated life?

“Yeah, that’s true,” he said. “I know where it’s at for me. I’m in an incredibly good place. For a guy like me, who was a singer in band, who played no instrument — but just being eager to learn and experience more and more music? I’ve just been incredibly fortunate. I’m in the middle of my own joy. I don’t need anything else.”","Robert Plant, Party of One. (With Friends, Too.)",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/arts/music/robert-plant-carry-fire.html

On Sunday, after a third of the all-male board of his namesake production company resigned, Mr. Weinstein was fired.

But anger has continued to spread as new accusations emerge and some of the women affected, such as the American actress Rose McGowan, have slammed the industry for being slow to condemn him and accused his peers of keeping what had long been an open secret.

Members of Britain’s Parliament

On Wednesday, Chi Onwurah, a Labour Party member of the British Parliament, and other politicians signed an open letter demanding that Prime Minister Theresa May revoke Mr. Weinstein’s 2004 title, Commander of the Order of the British Empire.

The status, ranked beneath a knighthood, recognizes achievement in the arts and sciences.

“His continued membership runs the risk of bringing the honors system into disrepute and, moreover, sending the deeply troubling signal that our government does not take women’s voices or allegations of sexual harassment seriously,” the letter said.

It is unclear whether the title will be revisited. A spokeswoman for Britain’s Cabinet Office, which awards the honors, said it did not comment on whether a person’s title was being reconsidered unless it was revoked in a process called “forfeiture.”

A title may be revoked, according to the Cabinet Office, if its holder is “sentenced to prison for at least three months for a criminal offense” or “censured or struck off by a professional or regulatory body for something directly relevant to their honor.”

A Bafta Rebuke

The British Academy of Film and Television Arts, which hosts the prestigious annual EE British Academy Film Awards, or Baftas, in London, said Mr. Weinstein’s suspension was effective immediately.

The group said in a statement that it had “previously been a beneficiary of Mr. Weinstein’s support for its charitable work,” including scholarships to support emerging artists, but “considers the reported alleged behavior completely unacceptable and incompatible with BAFTA’s values.”

“We hope this announcement sends a clear message that such behavior has absolutely no place in our industry,” the group said.

The Cannes Film Festival released a statement, signed by the festival’s presidents, Pierre Lescure and Thierry Frémaux, that said they were “dismayed to learn of the accusations of harassment and sexual violence recently leveled against Harvey Weinstein.”

“These actions point to a pattern of behavior that merits only the clearest and most unequivocal condemnations,” the statement said. “Our thoughts go to the victims.”

More Accusations

Since the original Times investigation was published, more women have accused Mr. Weinstein of inappropriate behavior, including the actresses Angelina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow.

On Wednesday, the British model and actress Cara Delevingne posted a written account of her experience with Mr. Weinstein. She said that early in her career, she met the producer in his hotel room, where she found him with another woman.

“He asked us to kiss,” Ms. Delevingne wrote, adding that she had quickly got up and tried to leave. “He walked me to the door and stood in front of it and tried to kiss me on the lips,” she said, describing feelings of guilt because she later secured a part in one of his films.

The French actress Léa Seydoux, who won a Palme d’Or at Cannes for “Blue Is the Warmest Color,” said Mr. Weinstein invited her to the Hôtel Plaza Athénée around 2012 for a drink and to talk about her career, but she had to fight him off.

“We were talking on the sofa when he suddenly jumped on me and tried to kiss me,” she wrote in The Guardian. “I had to defend myself. He’s big and fat, so I had to be forceful to resist him. I left his room, thoroughly disgusted.”

On Tuesday, the British actress Romola Garai told The Guardian that Mr. Weinstein had sexually harassed her in his room at The Savoy in London when she was 18. She said she had gone for a meeting and found him wearing only a bathrobe.

“I felt violated by it; it has stayed very clearly in my memory,” she said.

Ms. Argento, the Italian actress and director, told The New Yorker that Mr. Weinstein had forcibly performed oral sex on her in 1997 in a room at the Hôtel du Cap-Eden-Roc when she was 21. “It wouldn’t stop,” she said. “It was a nightmare.”

Ms. Godrèche, the French actress, told The Times that Mr. Weinstein abused her at the same hotel in 1996, when she was 24. “I was so naïve and unprepared,” she said.

Ms. Gutierrez told The New Yorker that Mr. Weinstein groped her breasts when he met with her in 2015, and that she went to the police. A sting operation captured audio of Mr. Weinstein repeatedly telling her to go with him into his hotel room.

Mr. Weinstein’s spokeswoman, Sallie Hofmeister, said in a statement on Tuesday that “any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein.”

“Mr. Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances,” Ms. Hofmeister added. “He will not be available for further comments, as he is taking the time to focus on his family, on getting counseling and rebuilding his life.”

Some actors have spoken out in support of the women. Colin Firth, the British star of “The King’s Speech,” a Weinstein film, said in a statement that Mr. Weinstein “was a powerful and frightening man to stand up to,” and Mr. Firth said he applauded the women’s courage.

Benedict Cumberbatch, the British actor whose film “The Current War” was produced by the Weinstein Company, said in a statement that he was “utterly disgusted by the continuing revelations of Harvey Weinstein’s horrifying and unforgivable actions.” Addressing the women, Mr. Cumberbatch said: “We hear you and believe you.”

In our April white paper, “Information Operations and Facebook,” we described the activity that we detected from a sophisticated threat actor that was spreading stolen information about specific political targets in the run-up to the U.S. election and using it to feed press stories that they could then amplify. We took steps to disrupt this activity and reported details to the relevant authorities.

In this white paper, we noted the challenge of attributing threat activity to foreign actors ourselves, but we specifically referenced the assessment of the U.S. government that this actor was tied to Russia’s intelligence services. This was an accurate statement of what we knew about this particular actor at the time, and it appropriately relied on the U.S. intelligence community’s public analysis.

We have been forthcoming at every opportunity about what we know about these information operations. In addition to our white paper, last month we disclosed advertising activity on our platform that we believe is linked to the Internet Research Agency, a different group from the one we described in April. We undertook this research on our own, and we named the group based on our best assessment because we weren’t aware of a comparable public report from the government.

2. Related to the above question: In July 2016, WikiLeaks complained that Facebook was censoring links to a page on its website that hosted the hacked D.N.C. emails. Your chief security officer, Alex Stamos, replied to WikiLeaks (in a tweet that has since been deleted) saying that the issue had “been fixed.” Links to WikiLeaks were subsequently restored. Did Facebook’s security team manually override a tool that flagged these fake accounts as suspicious? If so, who was responsible for the decision to restore access to WikiLeaks, despite having detected a suspicious campaign to promote its stolen documents? Did you notify law enforcement that your security team had intercepted a coordinated influence campaign?

Mr. Stamos: The temporary block of some WikiLeaks links by our automated spam-fighting systems had nothing to do with information operations. It was caused by WikiLeaks posting thousands of raw emails — several of which contained links to malicious phishing and spam sites found in industrywide block lists. We removed the block after we determined that the WikiLeaks links themselves were not harmful.

3. You recently announced you were adding 1,000 human moderators to the team that reviews Facebook ads. How many human ad reviewers did Facebook employ in November 2016? And what percentage of political ads that ran on Facebook during the 2016 election cycle did they review?

Joe Osborne, Facebook spokesman: We don’t usually share the sizes of specific teams at Facebook. Our teams review millions of ads around the world each week, and we use a mix of automated and manual processes. We’re not sharing an exact break-out of the number of manually reviewed political ads.

4. Of the 1,000 human moderators you’re hiring, how many will be based in the United States? Will you be hiring moderators to review ads in non-English languages? What kinds of pre-hire screening will you do to make sure that these moderators are not affiliated with foreign governments, extremist groups, or others looking to influence the American political process?

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Mr. Osborne: We are still working through where the moderators will be based, but likely across regions including the U.S., Europe and Asia.

5. You recently told advertisers that new ad campaigns that involved “politics, religion, ethnicity or social issues” would be reviewed by humans before being approved. What guidelines will reviewers be given about which ads to allow and which to reject? Will these guidelines be made public?

6. Your advertising policies allow advertisers to opt out of appearing next to content that involves “debatable social issues.” Which social issues do you define as “debatable,” and how did you make that call? Is your definition of “debatable social issues” globally consistent, or does it vary by region?

7. In countries with regressive social policies, such as criminalizing homosexuality, do you allow the local authorities to determine which issues are considered debatable?

Mr. Osborne: No.

8. Last year, ProPublica found that Facebook advertisers could exclude certain ethnic groups from seeing advertisements about housing, employment and credit, in violation of federal anti-discrimination laws. In response, Facebook announced it would no longer allow ethnic group targeting for those ad categories. Did you consider extending the ban on ethnic group targeting to all ads, including political ads? Did you consider that political campaigns might use ethnic group targeting to suppress voter participation among certain ethnic groups? (Trump campaign officials claim to have used targeted Facebook ads to suppress African-American voters in the weeks leading up to the election.)

9. Did you, at any point leading up to the 2016 election, consider adding disclosures to political ads that made clear who was paying for those ads? If so, why did you decide not to include that feature?

10. You have said you are committed to protecting election integrity and supporting democratic ideals. However, there have been reports that you have built tools to censor speech in certain authoritarian countries, such as China, where you hope to be allowed to operate. How will you choose which elections and democratic processes to protect? When promoting democratic ideals conflicts with your corporate goals, which will you prioritize?

11. Mr. Trump’s digital campaign director, Brad Parscale, has said that Facebook sent “embeds” to work inside the Trump campaign offices and help them use Facebook more efficiently. (You have responded that these offers are standard for political campaigns, and that you “offered identical support to both the Trump and Clinton campaigns.”) What kinds of work did your employees do on behalf of the Trump campaign? Were they involved in writing or editing any of the campaign’s Facebook posts? Were they given page roles or posting rights on any Trump campaign Facebook pages? Were they authorized to report any illegal or suspicious activity they found in the course of their work? If so, did they make any such reports?

Jailing Mr. Marsh costs the city $1,650 a month.

He is arrested so often, he says, because as soon as he is spotted by employees of Sumter’s businesses — the post office, fast-food restaurants and convenience stores — they call the police.

Police Chief Russell F. Roark III said his officers had little choice but to arrest Mr. Marsh.

“He scares customers, so we have to intervene,” Chief Roark said. “But we attempt to do other things than make arrests,” like issuing tickets.

A lawyer could go beyond Mr. Marsh’s guilt or innocence, by pressing for solutions like treatment instead of jail.

Mr. Marsh, who suffered a head injury as a teenager, has no one else to look out for him. He has long been out of touch with family members and says he has no friends.

His disability payments are disrupted every time he goes to jail, leaving him penniless on release. He is at the mercy of the South Carolina municipal courts, an idiosyncratic system in which police officers serve as prosecutors, judges are not required to have college degrees, and public defenders are often absent.

Tess Borden, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, said 139 of the state’s 212 municipal courts have no public defenders available.

The A.C.L.U. filed a federal class-action lawsuit on Thursday against the city of Beaufort and the town of Bluffton, saying they are violating defendants’ rights. They hope for a ruling that sets a statewide precedent that all jurisdictions must provide lawyers.

Municipal courts, which handle traffic violations and other low-level crimes, are optional for South Carolina cities, which can choose to rely on state courts to hear the cases. They can be lucrative: the state’s 212 municipal courts collect some $20 million a year in fines and fees. Last year there was nearly one municipal case for every nine adult residents.

“Under South Carolina law, municipalities that choose to establish their own courts have a duty to fund public defense,” Ms. Borden said. “Yet the majority of cities and towns flout this obligation, prosecuting poor people without spending a dime on their defense. The result is a grossly unconstitutional system in which lawyers are luxuries available only to those who can afford them.”

It is not clear what entity has the ultimate authority for the state’s municipal courts. Tonnya K. Kohn, administrator for the state Office of Court Administration, said that her office played no role in oversight of municipal courts and that the State Supreme Court was responsible.

But Daniel E. Shearouse, the Supreme Court’s clerk, said Wednesday that the Office of Court Administration — and not the Supreme Court — oversaw municipal court activities. Both Ms. Kohn and Mr. Shearouse declined to comment about defendants not being informed of their Constitutional rights.

In Beaufort, officials did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday, but in an email statement, Debbie Szpanka, a spokeswoman for Bluffton, said: “Bluffton municipal judges inform defendants who appear before the bench that he/she has a right to counsel and if he/she is unable to afford to hire a lawyer that a lawyer will be appointed.”

In the Sumter courtroom where Mr. Marsh has been found guilty dozens of times, judges on a recent day spent minutes on all but a few of the 85 cases involving traffic violations, disturbing the peace, or shoplifting.

The key to the app’s convenience is also its downside: A person who is a friend of yours on Facebook can add you to a GroupMe chat without your consent.

Last November, news of the “Mud Men” chat spread like wildfire.

Students started noticing the racist chat on the morning of Nov. 11 when freshmen who were targeted posted screenshots of the threats on Twitter, Facebook and Snapchat, forcing students inside the Penn bubble — and plenty outside of it — to pay attention. Black organizations sent a barrage of emails and texts to their constituencies about the situation and began to plan for an emergency town hall. By the afternoon, the news had been picked up by national civil rights activists, including Shaun King and DeRay Mckesson. The news was trending on Twitter for hours before the school issued an official response.

There was a palpable uncertainty in the air that day. Was the chat to be taken as a serious threat to the well-being of Penn’s black freshmen and in turn, Penn’s black community? Or was it a joke that got too serious to take back? The motive is still unclear, but the incident certainly made students fearful.

The university was clear in its condemnation of hate and hate speech on Penn’s campus, but the official response came after news had spread to local law enforcement and the media, and after students of color had already met to debrief and discuss the situation.

That problem is not exclusive to the University of Pennsylvania: Many schools are unable to keep up with how quickly the world moves in this digital era.

Don’t get me wrong: Some of the key supporters of black student groups were faculty members who were instrumental in making sure that everyone felt safe and supported and that proper resources were being applied to figuring out who was responsible for the chat’s existence. I just wish that the university had taken steps publicly to support its black students much sooner than it did.

Maybe it sounds unreasonable to expect a college administration to keep up with the speed of internet discourse. But when several campus groups organized walkouts, demonstrations, rallies and marches to signal solidarity with black students, it took the Penn administration several days to publicly join and support the actions.

Black and brown students need more than official statements of concern to feel safe and welcome in college. The GroupMe incident provides a pretty good example of how amorphous online threats can still be powerfully targeted at us in terrifyingly specific ways.

The racist chat appeared to have been created in Oklahoma, but for the creator to have known so many members of the black freshman class, he or she would have to have been at Penn. So black students immediately assumed it was coming from somewhere on campus. There were multiple individuals who were taunting students on this chat, and all were anonymized by pseudonyms. So the big questions were: How many people were involved? Would they act on their covert threats? How much of the population of the school did they speak for? The chats also included a racial taunt that invoked the fraternity Sigma Alpha Epsilon, some chapters of which have been shut down at other campuses for racist behavior. (The Penn S.A.E. chapter immediately denounced the online attacks.)

Working with the F.B.I., the administration was able to identify the creator of the GroupMe chat within a few weeks — a student at the University of Oklahoma who had been accepted to Penn but chose not to attend. The student was suspended, and both the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Oklahoma issued condemnations of his actions. Ultimately, the investigation found that no Penn students were involved in the chat. But these kinds of incidents make black and brown students increasingly wary.

GroupMe is an important method of communication among hall mates, study group partners, band members, fraternity brothers and sometimes entire classes. It’s not as if we can just stop using the app to avoid racism.

An anonymous attack on GroupMe doesn’t feel that different from racist propaganda in “real life.” Just a few months ago, someone put up neo-Nazi recruitment fliers around campus. They were promptly removed, but the incident had an important thing in common with the GroupMe disaster: anonymity.

The creator of the GroupMe and the people who hung the fliers hid their names and faces, putting the students they were targeting in the precarious position of questioning who to trust.

In particular, they were interested in the roles that dehydration and muscle soreness might play in runners’ finishing times.

By contacting registered runners, the scientists recruited 11 experienced runners preparing for the marathon distance and another 11, similar in age, weight and racing experience, enrolled in the half. All were following training programs provided by the race organizers, with the marathoners completing more weekly mileage.

The day before the race, the scientists had the runners visit the lab, where they drew blood and checked for baseline indications of dehydration and biochemical markers of muscle damage.

The scientists also asked each runner to perform several standing vertical leaps. This test indicates how much force the leg muscles can generate. When muscles are tired, people cannot jump as high. The scientists noted the maximum height each runner could achieve.

The next morning, just before the race start, the runners reported to a medical tent where they were weighed and fitted with patches to measure perspiration rates.

Then, they ran. All finished their race, whether it was the half or full marathon. Afterward, they returned to the tent to be reweighed, provide more blood, answer a few questions about how they felt and repeat the vertical leaps.

Finally, the researchers compared data.

The half-marathon runners, not surprisingly, proved to have had an easier time. They had lost body weight from sweating but were not seriously dehydrated. They also had elevated levels of blood markers related to muscle damage, compared to the day before. But their levels were much lower than in the blood of the racers completing the full 26.2 miles. The half-marathon runners also could jump higher after the race than the marathon racers. Their legs, by all indications, were still relatively fresh.

Perhaps most interesting, the half-marathon runners had managed to maintain a steady pace throughout their race. In fact, most had sped up slightly near the end. Their average pace for the final five kilometers tended to be a few seconds faster than for their opening five kilometers.

The marathon runners, on the other hand, had slowed. Most had run at a steady pace for the first 13.1 miles, but then began to brake progressively, so that their final five kilometers were significantly slower than the same distance at the start. Those runners with the highest subsequent blood markers of muscle damage had the greatest decline in pace. They also reported much more soreness in their legs after the race than the half-marathon runners.

These findings, on their face, may seem predictable. Most of us might expect that running a full marathon should be more tiring than striding half as far, and that the more your muscles hurt, the slower you will be.

But, says Juan del Corso, a professor of physiology at Camilo José Cela University in Madrid, who led the study, there were surprises in the data. For one thing, none of the volunteers in either race became clinically dehydrated. So dehydration had not made the marathoning difficult.

More fundamentally, the marathon racers, on paper, should have been prepared for the rigors of the distance, he says. They had run more mileage during training than the half-marathoners. Despite the rigorous runs, however, their legs were not fully prepared for the marathon, he says. Their muscles became slightly damaged and grew sore, particularly in the second half of the race, and their pace slowed.

The implication of these results, he says, is that “just running long distances is not enough to prepare the leg muscles for the great demands of an endurance event like the marathon.” Instead, he says, targeted strength training of the lower body might be needed to inoculate the muscles against the slight tearing and other damage that otherwise occurs during the hours of pounding in a marathon.

Of course, this study was small, short-term and examined only a few aspects of distance running. But its underlying message seems applicable to all of us training for a distance race.

“Gym training,” including the use of machines and free weights to develop strength and power in the muscles of your legs, “can very much help to prepare muscles for the stress imposed by these long races,” Dr. del Corso says.

WASHINGTON — The Trump administration announced on Thursday that it would withdraw from Unesco, the United Nations cultural organization, after years of America distancing itself because of what it called the group’s “anti-Israel bias.”

“This decision was not taken lightly,” according to a State Department statement on Thursday. Along with the anti-Israel bias, the department also cited “the need for fundamental reform” and “mounting arrears” at the organization.

While the United States withdrew from the group, the Trump administration said it wanted to continue to be engaged with Unesco to provide American perspective and expertise, but as a nonmember observer. The United States withdrawal goes into effect at the end of 2018.

Unesco, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization known for its designation of world heritage sites, is a global development agency with missions that include promoting sex education, literacy, clean water and equality for women.

The Obama administration cut off funding to Unesco in 2011 because the group admitted Palestinians as full members, which the United States saw as undercutting its influence in countries around the world. America lost its vote in the organization in 2013 because it ended its financial contributions.

We are talking, in other words, about the American workplace. The administration might have saved itself a bunch of keystrokes by simply writing “anyone.” For the “moral” objectors, the universe described is slightly smaller, but only for the time being. Publicly traded companies are omitted from this privileged list for now, but the administration reserves the right to include them later and seems inclined to do so.

It’s hard to overstate the radical nature of what has just happened. Just three years ago, in the Hobby Lobby case, the Supreme Court ruled that the Obama administration could not impose the mandate on a closely held for-profit business owned by a family with religious objections to birth control.

But the decision did not end there. In his majority opinion, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. emphasized that the administration was already offering a workaround accommodation for religious nonprofit organizations that gave them a hands-free way to have birth control coverage available for their employees. All that these organizations had to do was notify the Department of Health and Human Services or their insurance administrators of their objection and the coverage would automatically flow to the female employees without any further involvement by the employer. The administration should do the same thing for Hobby Lobby and similar companies, the court said, emphasizing that the intended beneficiaries would suffer no loss of coverage: “The effect of the HHS-created accommodation on the women employed by Hobby Lobby and the other companies involved in these cases would be precisely zero. Under that accommodation, these women would still be entitled to all FDA-approved contraceptives without cost sharing.”

Now the Trump administration has played the Supreme Court justices for chumps. The accommodation, carefully worked out and fought over, is a thing of the past. In its place is a flat-out exemption, with no requirement that women be offered any alternative route to coverage. “There are multiple federal, state, and local programs that provide free or subsidized contraceptives for low-income women,” the administration explained airily, noting that “many forms of contraception are available for around $50 per month.” Further, “As the government is under no constitutional obligation to fund contraception, even more so may the government refrain from requiring private citizens to cover contraception for other citizens in violation of their religious beliefs.”

These statements call to mind a particularly callous old Supreme Court case, United States v. Kras, in which a man with an income of a few hundred dollars a month and unpaid bills of $6,000 tried to file for bankruptcy but ran up against the $50 filing fee. He challenged the constitutionality of the fee and lost. “There is no constitutional right to obtain a discharge of one’s debts in bankruptcy,” Justice Harry A. Blackmun wrote for the 5-to-4 majority, observing that the fee could be paid over time for about $2 a month — less, he pointed out, than the price of a movie. (This was 1973.) Justice Thurgood Marshall wrote a stinging dissent that accused the majority of having no understanding of how poor people actually live. “The desperately poor almost never go to see a movie, which the majority seems to believe is an almost weekly activity,” he wrote.

The administration says the average price of a year’s birth control is $584. That’s probably low (an IUD can cost $1,000 up front, but the administration amortizes that cost over the five-year life of the product) but that’s not really the point. Others have called attention to the administration’s truly astonishing effort to show that birth control really isn’t all that important and may even be counterproductive. Statements like the one on page 46 of the religious exemption document, “Contraception’s association with positive health effects might also be partially offset by an association with negative health effects,” are hogwash, the result of careful cherry-picking of the literature, some of it quite dubious. One cited article from the Ave Maria Law Review by Michael J. New, a well-known anti-abortion activist, insists that there is “little evidence that increasing the use of contraception reduces the unintended pregnancy rate.”

The real point is that the Trump administration has outsourced a crucially important building block of national health care policy, enabling a fanatical fringe of the Republican base to exercise raw political power, clothed in religiosity under cover of the grandiloquently named Religious Freedom Restoration Act. That 1993 law, passed by overwhelming bipartisan majorities and signed by President Bill Clinton, is the object of growing buyer’s remorse on the part of liberal and moderate Americans — and should be.

To fully appreciate what happened last week, it’s important to understand what happened in the years following the Hobby Lobby decision. The Obama administration did as the Supreme Court said and offered the accommodation as Justice Alito described it. But a group of religiously affiliated nonprofits, mainly but not exclusively Catholic-run schools, colleges, nursing homes and other social service organizations, refused to accept it. Not good enough, they said, claiming that they would still be complicit in the sin of contraception, even if the employees’ receipt of the benefit required no action on the employer’s part beyond notifying the government that it was opting out. Only the complete exemption offered to actual churches would suffice. (It’s hard to understand how these employers justify giving their employees a paycheck that might be used to buy birth control, but I guess that’s a private matter.) The nonprofits took the Obama administration to court and lost almost everywhere.

When seven cases reached the Supreme Court last year, consolidated under the name Zubik v. Burwell, the justices asked both sides whether they would accept an arrangement in which no opt-out notification was necessary. Yes, both said, resulting in the court’s decision to send the cases back to the lower courts to work out the details. But that was not to be. The administration insisted that no matter how the opt-out was handled, women must still be able to get “seamless” contraception coverage, that is, without having to apply for a separate plan and search for a doctor willing to accept the coverage. The nonprofits held fast and would not agree. The impasse lasted until the end of the Obama administration.

The Trump administration’s rescission of the government’s birth control mandate, not only for these organizations but also for others that never even got around to asking for it, is thus a reward for intransigence matched only by the Senate’s blockade of the Supreme Court vacancy intended for Merrick Garland that it eventually handed to Neil Gorsuch.

A half dozen lawsuits have already been filed against the federal government, and at least partial success in freezing or overturning the new rules is not out of the question. Putting the new policy into immediate effect without the usual “notice and comment” rule-making places the administration’s action on shaky procedural ground. Extending the rescission to employers with “moral” objections has no statutory basis. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act at least requires a claim that has something to do, however implausibly, with religion. It doesn’t, yet, license those who, like Melville’s Bartleby the Scrivener, “would prefer not to.”

I used to think — in fact, I wrote last year — that the resistance to the contraception mandate was fueled by cultural conservatives’ determination not to let federal policy normalize birth control. But now I think it’s deeper than that. Conservatives, even the publicly pious ones, don’t seem to have a problem with limiting the size of their families. (Vice President Mike Pence has two children, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions has three. Need I say more?) The problem they have is with what birth control signifies: empowering women — in school, on the job, in the home — to determine their life course. That’s what they don’t want to normalize. It comes as no surprise which side Donald Trump is on; his administration’s action last week makes perfect sense. Or none at all.","On Contraception, It’s Church Over State",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/opinion/contraception-religious-exemption.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

That “Curry Hill” puns on “Murray Hill,” the district just above it, speaks to Kips Bay’s identity issues. Two years ago, the news website DNAinfo asked residents of Kips Bay and Murray Hill to map their neighborhoods’ boundaries. What it received were two smears that overlapped, especially in the blocks between East 34th and 40th Streets, and faded west to Fifth Avenue.

Even the president of the Kips Bay Neighborhood Alliance, Molly Hollister, lives on Second Avenue and 35th Street, in what is mostly agreed to be Murray Hill. She said she sees no contradiction, because the now-filled-in East River inlet that gave Kips Bay its name extended up to East 37th Street.

Do these nit-picking definitions matter? Not to residents who are happy to trade anonymity for the chance to live near more stylish and expensive districts like Gramercy and NoMad. Or those who simply like the convenience of being close to the heart of Manhattan.

In 1971, Walter Bernard, 80, a publication designer, moved to Kips Bay, where he was working as the art director of the new New York magazine. The offices were in a former Tammany Hall clubhouse at 207 East 32nd Street, partly owned by a founder of the publication, Milton Glaser. A dinner party at the home of the photographer Pete Turner and his wife, Reine, introduced Mr. Bernard to Kips Bay Towers just a block away.

“It wasn’t a Park Avenue apartment,” he recalled of the Turners’ place, but it was spacious, had fine views and was reasonably priced.

Mr. Bernard rented a two-bedroom unit for $425 a month. After the towers were converted to condos in the mid-1980s, he and his wife, Bina, bought a three-bedroom apartment on the 15th floor, for about $150,000. He has been living there and working nearby ever since. Mr. Glaser works on the floor below.

Though increasingly affluent, Kips Bay lacks the magnetism of other neighborhoods, Mr. Bernard said. It is loaded with fast-food restaurants and convenience stores, but not so many “hangout places.” The Kips Bay Towers complex, currently being renovated, includes a three-acre park that closed to the public in the 1980s when the area experienced a rise in vagrancy and drugs. Though improved, residents say, Kips Bay still has a dearth of green space as well as some rough edges stemming in part from a men’s homeless shelter on East 30th Street.

Maia Szalavitz, 52, a writer who lives in the disputed territory of East 36th Street between Second and Third Avenues, near the Midtown Tunnel, described Kips Bay as the “least fashionable neighborhood in Manhattan.”

She wasn’t being entirely dismissive. Kips Bay is “one of the few middle-class neighborhoods here anymore,” she said. “It has immigrants, older people and families.” And yes, she conceded, “lots of bros.”

What You’ll Find

Lackluster high-rises partly define the area, but Kips Bay also has brick rowhouses and former tenement buildings with fire escapes zigzagging across the front. Setting a dramatic new tone just over the northeastern border is the American Copper Buildings, an angular, kissing pair of luxury towers with market-rate rents that start at $3,300 a month for a studio.

And while Kips Bay is rife with retail chains, it has quirky old businesses, too. Like La Delice, an 82-year-old pastry shop at 372 Third Avenue with a life-size statue of a rotund baker near the threshold. (People magazine reported that it supplied the sheet cake Tina Fey recently consumed in one sitting on “Saturday Night Live.”) Or like the 87-year-old Marchi’s restaurant, at 251 East 31st Street, which has been serving the same five-course Italian meal since at least 1965, when Craig Claiborne reviewed it for The New York Times. (“When you leave the premises, there is the feeling that you have dined well in a responsible establishment,” he wrote.)

But you don’t have to be old to be offbeat in Kips Bay. This is where Carmel Place, a 55-unit building with apartments of 360 square feet or less, introduced a pioneer project last year in tiny-home living. (A branch of Proof Coffee Roasters recently moved into the building’s base.) In May, Tipsy Scoop, a brand of liquor-infused ice cream opened its first shop at 217 East 26th Street; seasonal flavors include candy corn vodka martini and salted caramel apple brandy.

More conventional businesses are found on a retail strip on Second Avenue between East 30th and East 32nd Streets. They include the 15-screen AMC Loews Kips Bay movie theater that is something of a neighborhood landmark, and a five-year-old Fairway supermarket.

What You’ll Pay

Because of low interest rates spurring home sales, the Kips Bay rental market is stagnant, with many landlords offering incentives like free months and reduced security fees.

Some also seek to attract tenants rooming in bunches. A large sign on the exterior of Kips Bay Court, at 490 Second Avenue, where a three-bedroom, 953-square-foot apartment is currently listed for $5,455 a month, announced, “Great for Sharing.”

“The supply is obviously up, and there’s a ton of new development,” said Brad Fazzone, a salesman at Buchbinder & Warren, which manages a residential building at 155 East 34th Street.

Dan Bamberger, a broker in Murray Hill, noted that the bar to ownership in Kips Bay is much lower than in the neighborhoods to the south and west. Greenwich Village homes, for example, cost “twice the price,” he said, though the area and its amenities are less than a mile away.

According to the real estate website Trulia, between May 24 and Aug. 23, the median sales price in Kips Bay (with the neighborhood’s western boundary defined as Park Avenue) was $999,999, based on 17 transactions. This figure represented a 23 percent year-on-year decrease. The median monthly rent in that same period was $3,072.

As of Oct. 9, 60 Kips Bay homes drawn from multiple sources were advertised on the StreetEasy website. They ranged from a one-bedroom coop at 137 East 28th Street, priced at $649,500, to a pair of adjacent brick townhouses at 138-40 East 30th Street, priced at $6.9 million.

The Vibe

Construction noise, congestion, aggressive cyclists — Kips Bay pays a price for urban convenience, but it also nurtures spots of repose. One place to unwind is the Alexandria Center for Life Science at First Avenue and East 29th Street. There, the Tom Colicchio restaurant Riverpark, with its cafe and beer garden, offer therapeutic East River views.

The Schools

P.S. 116 Mary Lindley Murray enrolls about 640 students in prekindergarten through sixth grade. On 2015-16 state tests, 66 percent met standards in English, versus 39 percent citywide; 58 percent met standards in math, versus 40 percent citywide.

J.H.S. 104 Simon Baruch enrolls more than 1,100 students in sixth through eighth grades. On 2015-16 state tests, 61 percent met standards in English, versus 37 percent citywide; 64 percent met standards in math, versus 32 percent citywide.

Baruch College Campus High School, just west of Kips Bay, enrolls about 450 students in ninth through 12th grade. On SAT exams in 2016, students scored an average of 530 in reading, 587 in math and 521 in writing, compared with 446, 466 and 440 citywide.

The private United Nations International School enrolls about 1,450 students, from prekindergarten through 12th grade, at its campus on F.D.R. drive. Annual tuition starts at $35,720.

The Commute

Kips Bay is served by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s IRT Lexington Avenue 6 train at 23rd Street, 28th Street and 33rd Street. NYC Ferry service to Wall Street and several points in Queens and Brooklyn is available at the East 34th Street/Midtown Ferry Terminal.

The History

In 1794, a manor house near present-day East 26th Street, on farmland originally owned by Jacobus Kip, the namesake of Kips Bay, was leased as a quarantined facility for people with yellow fever.

“It feels like a brutal reminder of another time,” said Jonathan Marc Sherman, a playwright and friend. “It’s going to be a long time for a lot of us to wrap our minds around this one.”

Best known for the 2010 Broadway musical “Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson,” Mr. Friedman leaves behind several uncompleted shows, including a musical adaptation of “All the President’s Men” — a project he had excitedly presented in June to the book’s receptive authors, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein.

Now his friends and family are struggling to rewind the events of the summer, asking what they, or Mr. Friedman, could have done in response to signs of trouble.

“I wish I could have done more,” said the director Michael Greif (“Dear Evan Hansen,” “Rent”). “I wish I had known more. I wish I could have interceded more. I wish that I could have found a way to let Michael let me be a better friend to him, and I regret that I wasn’t able to do that.”

Oskar Eustis, the artistic director of the Public Theater, where Mr. Friedman worked off and on for 20 years, called his death “a real warning shot across the bow for anybody who thinks this disease isn’t deadly any more.”

“It just killed one of the most brilliant and promising people in the American theater,” he said.

‘Things Were Getting Better’

Mr. Friedman had a new job this year, one seemingly perfect for a musical-theater obsessive. He was the artistic director of Encores! Off-Center, an annual New York City Center summer program that presents short-run concert revivals of Off Broadway shows.

“The guy was an encyclopedia,” said Anne Kauffman, who met Mr. Friedman in 1999 at the Williamstown Theater Festival, and who he chose to direct his first Encores! production, “Assassins.”

“He wanted his pals there — it felt like, we had been children together, and now he’d got a grown-up job, and he was like, ‘Hey, do this with me’,” she said.

Tall, gangly and gay, he was an outsized presence — exuberant and emotional, witty and irreverent, opinionated and self-doubting. “When he was at City Center, you knew he was in the halls,” said Arlene Shuler, the performing arts center’s president and chief executive.

But it was also obvious to his collaborators that he was not well. Always thin, he now seemed gaunt. He complained of recurrent gastrointestinal trouble.

Most disturbing, there were purple splotches on his face. Several people who saw him early this summer said they thought the spots looked like the lesions associated with Kaposi’s sarcoma, but then dismissed that thought.

“Of course the first thing you think of is KS, because of all those images from the ’80s, but then the other part of you is, ‘It’s 2017, so of course that’s not what it is; he has some other issue’,” said Trip Cullman, a director and close friend. “I was very concerned, and would try to bring it up as much as I could, but I also knew how much he valued privacy, and didn’t want to be pushy. I obviously very much regret that now.”

In mid-July, Mr. Friedman made it to the first two performances of “Assassins,” but with obvious difficulty.

“The day of the opening, we walked up five stairs, and got to the top, and Michael was completely winded,” said Sam Pinkleton, a choreographer and the associate artistic director of Encores! Off-Center. “Then he pulled me and others aside and told us that he was diagnosed positive. My gut response was, I know a lot of people who are H.I.V. positive, and this is not what they’re like — this is somebody whose body is in the process of being cannibalized.”

On July 14, Mr. Friedman showed up for a meet-and-greet with the cast of a second show, “The Bubbly Black Girl Sheds Her Chameleon Skin,” and then went straight to the hospital.

“He said he had H.I.V., he was going to the emergency room, and could I bring him a phone charger,” recalled Daniel Goldstein, a director and writer who also befriended him at Williamstown. “They had caught it at a rather advanced stage, but the drugs were working, and we all thought things were getting better.”

Mr. Friedman, who had health insurance as an employee of the Public Theater, where he was an artist-in-residence and director of an audience engagement program, had known he was H.I.V. positive only since early July, when he was tested by his primary care physician, according to his sister, Marion Friedman Young. He began taking antiretroviral medications that month.

His first hospital stay lasted 10 days, before he was sent home to recuperate. His immune system had been compromised, but his friends and family were hopeful that over time he would make a recovery. By text, he kept friends updated on his progress. By email, he was outlining plans for next summer.

“Every part of me expected him to break through the door of City Center, with an IV hooked up to his arm, shouting something, and the fact that he didn’t frightened me, a lot,” Mr. Pinkleton said. “This was somebody I’d watched be an aircraft carrier for 10 years, and he turned into a baby bird.”

On Aug. 19, he was readmitted to NYU Langone Medical Center with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He spent the rest of his life in the intensive care unit, intubated and periodically sedated. Family was with him daily; friends visited as much as possible.

When he was awake, he would converse by writing down his thoughts and showing them to visitors. But there were moments of stillness as well. “Often we were just being silent,” Mr. Goldstein said, “holding hands and watching the U.S. Open.”

In early September, his doctors detected another infection, and his body was not strong enough to fight it off. The consensus among his friends is that Mr. Friedman had waited too long to seek medical attention.

“As near as I can tell, he hadn’t actually been to a doctor or gotten tested for a couple of years, and only in July did he find out that he was H.I.V. positive,” Mr. Eustis said “That’s just staggering — staggeringly wrong of Michael, staggeringly upsetting.”

Upsetting, and poignant too. Mr. Friedman and several close collaborators were hoping to pursue a sequel to “A Chorus Line.” The original musical, about a group of auditioning dancers, was set in 1975; the sequel would have been set a decade later, as that same generation of dreamers was laid waste by AIDS.

‘Make This Piece for Him’

The cast of “The Abominables,” tricked out in hockey uniforms, was in-line skating around the stage at the Children’s Theater Company in Minneapolis, a few hours before opening. One of them was costumed as a Yeti.

It was Friday, Sept. 15, six days after Mr. Friedman died, and the week had been wildly emotional. On Sunday, the theater’s artistic director, Peter C. Brosius, had informed the cast that Mr. Friedman, the show’s composer and lyricist, had died the day before. He chose his words carefully, because many of the actors were children and had never met Mr. Friedman.

“The American theater has lost an original voice,” he recalled saying. “We’ve been given a great honor and responsibility to make this piece for him.”

Then on Tuesday, the show’s director and book writer, Steven Cosson, had set aside his own grief — he was Mr. Friedman’s most frequent collaborator and a close friend — to urge the cast to have fun with the show. “I didn’t want anyone to feel bad about enjoying this play,” Mr. Cosson said. “That’s why we made it, and that’s what he would want to happen.”

So now it was time to open, and it was hard to untangle the excitement from the sadness. “It’s on us to give it the life it deserves,” said Reed Sigmund, one of the adult performers.

“The Abominables,” as a musical for family audiences, was a new venture for Mr. Friedman, whose astonishing output had already included musicalizations of Shakespeare’s comedy “Love’s Labour’s Lost” and Jonathan Lethem’s novel “The Fortress of Solitude.”

He was a founding associate artist with The Civilians, a downtown documentary theater troupe, and with them he had honed his gift for making music out of everyday speech, writing songs for shows about evangelicals, gentrification and the pornography industry, among other subjects.

The Minneapolis theater — one of the nation’s leading children’s theaters — had commissioned the Civilians six years ago to produce a work with local flavor.

Informed by interviews with Minnesotans, “The Abominables” is a clever, zany and silly show about an adolescent hockey player whose ambitions are thwarted when a talented Yeti comes to town. It is also about the culture of success, and learning to accept defeat.

A few hours before the opening, his collaborators honored Mr. Friedman with teary speeches over a dinner (Minnesota-themed, with a Tater Tot hotdish). “He feels very present,” Mr. Cosson said. “I’m talking with him in my mind.”

The show’s New York-based costume designer, Jessica Pabst, was wistful as she sat in the theater’s 746-seat auditorium. “You don’t think of your contemporaries dying,” she said. “You think of people getting sick, and then they’ll get better. And I couldn’t wait to show him pictures of the Yeti.”

But Ms. Pabst said she took heart watching children respond to the show. “These are the next generation of Michael Friedman superfans,” she said. “These children will go home singing these songs, and that feels like an unbelievable legacy and gift.”

Unfinished

Mr. Friedman had much more he wanted to say.

“There is a mountain of stuff — notebooks and sheet music and ideas, an extraordinary archive of finished and half-finished works, and the kernels of ideas,” Mr. Cullman said.

Fully drafted are “The King of Kong,” a musical adaptation of the video game documentary, with Alex Timbers directing and Robert Askins writing, and “American Pop,” a cultural history written with Mr. Cullman on commission from the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. “All the President’s Men,” which Mr. Friedman was developing with the producers Ira Pittelman and Tom Hulce, was still in its early stages.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

And then there were the still-under-discussion ideas: the “Chorus Line” sequel, with Mr. Cosson and Mr. Pinkleton, as well as a modern adaptation of “The Magic Flute,” for the Public Theater and the Metropolitan Opera.

“There is this grief at the work that won’t be finished — all the things he was talking about that I wanted to watch him work through,” said Will Frears, a director and writer and one of Mr. Friedman’s closest friends. “He wrote about difficult things in difficult ways, and my great wish is that the completed work moves forward and remains risky — that it doesn’t get turned into some nice warm thing, but remains an exhilarating and difficult look at the world.”

Now there will be memorials — the Public is planning one this month for friends and colleagues — and revivals; Mr. Eustis vows “to do everything I can to push his work to the forefront.” Kurt Deutsch of Sh-K-Boom/Ghostlight Records is working with Mr. Cosson to preserve unreleased songs; Ms. Kauffman is collecting audio recordings of Mr. Friedman teaching songs and giving advice to actors and directors.

One week after his death, on Sept. 16, several hundred of Mr. Friedman’s family and friends — theater world dignitaries, of course, but also his prom date, and a third grade classmate, and the high school choir teacher — gathered in the austere meetinghouse at Germantown Friends School, a private school in Philadelphia where Mr. Friedman had been educated from kindergarten through 12th grade.

He was remembered with stories, songs and reminiscences: he played a pig in a school musical; he started a madrigals club; he loved “My Spirit Sang All Day,” a composition by Gerald Finzi adapted from poetry by Robert Bridges. At one point, a playwright, Eisa Davis, posed a question: “I just wonder if Michael loved himself as much as we loved him?”

It was a Quaker meeting, full of silences between the speakers.

“I think, weirdly, silence is the thing Michael was most afraid of,” Mr. Goldstein said. “If there was space, he would fill it.”","‘Brilliant,’ 41 and Lost to AIDS: The Theater World Asks Why",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/theater/michael-friedman-aids-death-theater.html

Gross domestic product, or G.D.P., measures the nation’s total output, which largely determines its standard of living. And the decline in output during the Depression was clearly much worse than in recent years, as you can see from the gray line. But the economy eventually bounced back, first with rapid growth in the mid-1930s and then during the war mobilization of the early 1940s.

This time, the country never suffered 25 percent unemployment or nearly the same amount of misery — thank goodness — but it has endured years of weak growth following the crisis. You can see this weakness in the relatively flat yellow line.

That is why, in 1582, Pope Gregory XIII ordered that everyone stop messing around and use one calendar. Even then, the later a country switched over, the more days had to be dropped in order to stay in sync with the vernal equinox and the winter solstice. This resulted in a lot of confusion for a while, including the month of September 1752 in North America, which looked like this and which children across the continent still whisper about as “The Best Start to the School Year Ever.”

This app scored points for originality as well as its practicality, and is perfect for travelers who don’t have any cool cousins of their own.

Cool Cousin gives you access to contributors in 40 large cities around the world. Each “cousin” has a profile, with name, age, photo, occupation and a lot more information. The idea is to add those to your network who seem to have similar tastes to your own. After each add, the cousin’s recommendations are added to your map and broken down into eight different categories, such as food, coffee, night life and outdoors.

The app seems geared toward younger travelers — it feels like a cross between Facebook, Tinder and Foursquare — and most of the cousins themselves have an appropriately hipster look. For New York, this leads to a higher concentration of recommendations below 14th Street in Manhattan and several in Brooklyn (very few in Queens), and heavy in the food and night life areas.

But the app itself is easy to figure out, and the map includes the option to download and use offline (for free). No matter where you are, just hit the location arrow to see what’s nearby.

The recommendations themselves are solid and are written casually — think Yelp, minus the negativity. I added 26 of 55 available cousins in New York and was impressed with what was revealed, including free public gardens and lesser-known art galleries, as well as a wide variety of intriguing bars and restaurants.

Your new cousins will even message you through the app to say hello, and you have the option of writing them back to ask for more tips. You will also get a push notification every time you receive a new message, which you can turn off by adjusting your settings. After asking two of my paired cousins, I received additional restaurant recommendations.

Like a Local

Well-designed and easy to navigate, Like a Local has fewer contributors than the other apps (28, providing 197 tips for New York at the time of writing) but it is in more cities than the others (over 300) and best functions as a complementary tool.

The recommendations are detailed yet concise, giving an excellent general overview and a “special tip” for each location. For example, at the Brazilian restaurant Beco in Brooklyn, Kelly advises: “Come early because the restaurant’s seating space is limited. CA$H ONLY.”

You don’t have to sign up to use the app, so you can dig right in and explore — though if you want to use the app offline, you have to pay $1.99 per city.

There’s also an option to “ask locals,” which works like a message board. I asked for Upper East Side restaurant recommendations (it is a neighborhood not represented well on any of the apps) and after a week had yet to get a response.

The recommendations included mainstream spots like St. Patrick’s Cathedral and the Central Park more often than the other apps did.

This is where Alan Jacobs’s absolutely splendid forthcoming book “How to Think” comes in. If Thaler’s work is essential for understanding how the market can go astray, Jacobs’s emphasis on the relational nature of thinking is essential for understanding why there is so much bad thinking in political life right now.

Jacobs makes good use of C. S. Lewis’s concept of the Inner Ring. In every setting — a school, a company or a society — there is an official hierarchy. But there may also be a separate prestige hierarchy, where the cool kids are. They are the Inner Ring.

There are always going to be people who desperately want to get into the Inner Ring and will cut all sorts of intellectual corners to be accepted. As Lewis put it, “The passion for the Inner Ring is most skillful in making a man who is not yet a very bad man do very bad things.”

People will, for example, identify and attack what Jacobs calls the Repugnant Cultural Other — the group that is opposed to the Inner Ring, which must be assaulted to establish membership in it.

Other people will resent the Inner Ring, and they will cut all sorts of intellectual corners in order to show their resentment. These people are quick to use combat metaphors when they talk about thinking (he shot down my argument, your claims are indefensible). These people will adopt shared vague slurs like “cuckservative” or “whitesplaining” that signal to the others in the outsider groups that they are attacking the ring, even though these slurs are usually impediments to thought.

Jacobs notices that when somebody uses “in other words” to summarize another’s argument, what follows is almost invariably a ridiculous caricature of that argument, in order to win favor with the team. David Foster Wallace once called such people Snoots. Their motto is, “We Are the Few, the Proud, the More or Less Constantly Appalled at Everyone Else.”

Jacobs nicely shows how our thinking processes emerge from emotional life and moral character. If your heart and soul are twisted, your response to the world will be, too. He argues that by diagnosing our own ills, we can begin to combat them. And certainly I can think of individual beacons of intellectual honesty today: George Packer, Tyler Cowen, Scott Alexander and Caitlin Flanagan, among many.

But I’d say that if social life can get us into trouble, social life can get us out. After all, think of how you really persuade people. Do you do it by writing thoughtful essays that carefully marshal facts? That works some of the time. But the real way to persuade people is to create an attractive community that people want to join. If you do that, they’ll bend their opinions to yours. If you want people to be reasonable, create groups where it’s cool to be reasonable.

Jacobs mentions that at the Yale Political Union members are admired if they can point to a time when a debate totally changed their mind on something. That means they take evidence seriously; that means they can enter into another’s mind-set. It means they treat debate as a learning exercise and not just as a means to victory.

How many public institutions celebrate these virtues? The U.S. Senate? Most TV talk shows? Even the universities?

But disability rights lawyers and advocates said the concerns were misplaced.
“There has to be somebody who is trying to access the website,” said Ms. Hill, who is now a disability rights lawyer.
Imagine if you were trying to apply to school, and every college you went to check out refused to tell you how.”","“As more and more students are aware of their rights, and as websites have become so much of what universities now focus on, in their marketing materials for example, it’s not surprising to me that there will be an increase in these types of lawsuits,” said Arlene Kanter, director of the Disability Law and Policy Program at Syracuse University’s law school.

Whether the plaintiffs will prevail is unclear. The Americans With Disabilities Act, written in 1990, makes no mention of the internet. The Department of Justice, which enforces the act, has issued guidelines about web accessibility but no formal regulations on how to achieve it — and they seem unlikely to materialize soon, after the federal government in July placed web regulations on its list of “inactive” agenda items.

The question has largely been left to judges, who have ruled both for and against disabled plaintiffs. In March, for example, a California judge dismissed a blind man’s suit against Domino’s Pizza, because the chain offered an option to order by telephone. But in June, a Florida judge ruled that the grocery store Winn-Dixie had to offer the same accommodations on its website as it did in stores, and in July, a judge in Brooklyn ruled that the website for Blick Art Materials had to be readily accessible to a blind man.

The result of these conflicting rulings is a legal gray area ripe for, depending on your viewpoint, either significant civil rights advances or exploitation by lawyers looking to make a quick buck through settlements, said Tom Stebbins, executive director of the Lawsuit Reform Alliance of New York.

Absent clarity from the federal government, Mr. Stebbins said, some lawyers have filed identical lawsuits against multiple businesses or universities in the hopes of reaching a settlement with one or more of them.

“These are cut-and-paste lawsuits,” he said. “You just have these lawyers taking advantage of a good-intentioned law to make money.”

The lawsuits filed in New York on behalf of Mr. Delacruz are “all similar,” his lawyer, Dana Gottlieb, wrote in an email. They state that Mr. Delacruz tried to find information, such as tuition costs, school location and academic calendars, but was unable gain access because the websites were not readable by his screen-reading software.

Ms. Gottlieb, of the Gottlieb & Associates law firm, declined to comment further or to say anything more about her client, including his age and what he hoped to study. But Jeffrey M. Gottlieb, the founder of the firm, wrote in an email that private lawyers had to step in to promote web accessibility, given the lack of government action.

“When ‘lawsuit-reform’ organizations protest about the nature of these lawsuits, they are only advancing the interests of wealthy corporate interests that fund them,” he wrote. “If they were truly reform oriented, they would advocate for more government intervention to protect the rights of those who most need protection.”

Most of the colleges did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for Iona College said that it “takes all matters of discrimination seriously and strives to ensure that everyone is treated fairly and appropriately. The college will continue to ensure everyone has equitable access to its facilities including its website.”

Some disability rights advocates, acknowledging the charges that some lawyers are just looking to cash in, have distanced themselves from the suits.

“We do not condone just filing a blizzard of lawsuits in order to get settlements. That’s not solving the underlying problem,” said Chris Danielson, public relations director for the National Federation of the Blind. His organization has pushed instead for clearer federal guidelines on web accessibility.

Critics have also pointed to the Berkeley case as evidence that the strategy can go awry. After the Department of Justice found the university to be in violation of the disabilities act, Berkeley responded by taking down more than 20,000 publicly accessible videos and audio files, a move administrators had called “unenviable” but unavoidable given the “extremely expensive” cost of compliance.

But disability rights lawyers and advocates said the concerns were misplaced.

“There will always be lawyers who are eager to find business,” Ms. Kanter, the Syracuse professor, said. “But if the university is vulnerable, and if they have violated the law by not providing accessibility, that’s what the role of lawyers should be, which is to monitor such complaints.”

Eve Hill, a former deputy assistant attorney general in the civil rights division of the Department of Justice, said lawyers could not manufacture plaintiffs out of thin air. Ultimately, she said, lawyers represent people who — regardless of their lawyers’ motivations — are being barred from accessing public services.

“There has to be somebody who is trying to access the website,” said Ms. Hill, who is now a disability rights lawyer. “Imagine if you were that person.

More recently, Mr. Wang’s fortunes have symbolized China’s new skepticism over its global makers. In June, a senior banking regulator warned that some of the country’s biggest companies could pose a systemic risk to state banks, reflecting Beijing’s anxiety that mounting debt levels could destabilize the Chinese economy.

That month, Mr. Wang divested much of its theme park and hotel holdings. He also delisted one of his companies from Hong Kong, where shares have risen 19 percent in the past year. “Had he not delisted from Hong Kong, he wouldn’t be in the position that he would be now,” Mr. Hoogewerf said.

Hurun said he and his family’s net worth fell 28 percent to $23 billion in the last year. Wanda declined to comment.

Wanda is considered one of China’s gray rhinos, so named because they represent large but ignored potential threats to the country’s economy. Among the leaders of the other gray rhinos, Guo Guangchang, the chairman of the financial conglomerate Fosun, saw his wealth rise 40 percent to $9.3 billion, according to Hurun. Chen Feng, the co-founder and co-chairman of HNA Group, was a new addition to the survey, with a net worth of about $2.3 billion.

China’s tech tycoons — Pony Ma of Tencent and Jack Ma of Alibaba — were the second- and third-richest in the survey. Hurun valued Pony Ma’s fortune at $37 billion. As No. 2 on the Chinese wealth list, he succeeds Jack Ma, whose net worth fell 2 percent to $30 billion because he sold down his stake in his firm’s financial affiliate, Ant Financial.

The survey reflects a surge of money going into companies like Tencent and Ant Financial — the internet giants that run WeChat and Alipay — as investors bet on more users going cashless.

Alibaba and Ant Financial have 43 shareholders who made the list. Alibaba’s market cap is now $473 billion, while Tencent’s is at $428 billion. In contrast, Exxon Mobil is valued around $350 billion.

Some names on the rich list belong to some of China’s most powerful bodies. Three of the entrepreneurs on the list — Li Denghai, a corn tycoon; Wu Shaoxun, an alcohol magnate; and Pan Gang, who made his fortune in milk — will be delegates to the 19th Communist Party Congress, a once-in-five-years political meeting that will convene later this month to pick a new slate of Chinese leaders.

In March, Hurun said the combined fortune of the wealthiest members of the country’s Parliament and its advisory body amounts to $500 billion, just below the annual economic output of Sweden.

“My fascination for fashion photography emerged because of my complete disbelief at how widely ignored the genre was in academia,” said Ms. Shinkle, a reader in photography at the University of Westminster, London.
Photo“The history of fashion photography is the history of a growing confidence in its ability to comment explicitly on the wider world,” Ms. Shinkle noted.

“Fashion photography is a most fantastic barometer of the time,” Ms. Shinkle said.","With so many exhibits and monographs devoted to fashion photography and its leading practitioners, it’s hard to imagine that it wasn’t that long ago that the genre was seldom the focus of highbrow studies. Yet, that’s what Eugénie Shinkle discovered when she began researching it almost a decade ago.

“My fascination for fashion photography emerged because of my complete disbelief at how widely ignored the genre was in academia,” said Ms. Shinkle, a reader in photography at the University of Westminster, London. “Apart from a handful of exceptions, there was a real reluctance amongst scholars to engage with it in a serious way,” she said. “Unapologetically commercial, it had been reduced to ‘only advertising.’ And, until recently — that is until it started appearing in galleries — it was considered to be ephemeral. Because it wasn’t meant to last and because it wasn’t created with any kind of critical or artistic intent, people didn’t believe its history should be approached in that way.”

After publishing “Fashion as Photograph: Viewing and Reviewing Images of Fashion” in 2008, which examined why the genre deserves intellectual scrutiny, she’s now releasing “Fashion Photography: The Story in 180 Pictures,” a compendium of important figures who help chart the genre’s evolution. From Camille Silvy, a diplomat turned studio photographer in the 1850s, to the contemporary creative couple of Maurice Scheltens and Liesbeth Abbenes, who specialize in abstract still lives, the volume published by Aperture chronicles various movements and turning points.

“The history of fashion photography is the history of a growing confidence in its ability to comment explicitly on the wider world,” Ms. Shinkle noted. “Initially, it was reluctant to engage explicitly with politics, but since the end of the ’60s it has become more openly, overtly and unabashedly political.”

After World War II, photographers like Henry Clarke subtly alluded to the changing role of women in society by portraying them as “independent and in control,” writes Ms. Shinkle. Artists like William Klein parodied fashion conventions and encouraged his peers to engage in self-criticism. Even Richard Avedon proved to be a revelation: “I learned to appreciate his depth and talent by seeing how he was able to reinvent himself halfway through his career and noticing how ardently he campaigned for the use of models of color. Creatively, and politically, he’s one of the most important fashion photographers of the 20th century.”

By the ’90s, thanks in no small part to the nonconformist British magazine “The Face,” the grunge movement — which challenged gender norms, capitalism and the ideals of social respectability — appeared in mainstream publications and paved the way for today’s more cerebral work. Collier Schorr’s images, for example, question gender fluidity, notions of desire and how identity is constructed, while Chen Man speaks up creatively about China’s complexities.

Looking at the people in the volume, it also become more apparent how conservative the industry has been. Most photographers listed are Western-educated white men. This is due in part to the author’s and publisher’s decision to keep close reins on what was considered a primer. “We focused on the West because that’s where the major fashion houses and publications have historically been located,” Ms. Shinkle said. “I had to make that decision early on. Did I want to include more vernacular practices like that of Cameroonian photographer Samuel Fosso, who has been doing amazing fashion-inspired work since the ’70s? Or, did I want to restrict it to so-called pure fashion photography?”

In doing so, she revealed how difficult it has been for traditionally marginalized groups to be taken seriously. Case in point: Women, in the early 20th century, were rarely behind the camera. Yva, Madame D’Ora and Toni Frissell were trailblazers working “at a time when that was not what a well-bred women did, because photography was seen as a technical job.” To showcase them and highlight their technical prowess and unique perspectives is to revise history, which too often ignored them. Similarly, the inclusion of the Harlem Renaissance photographer James Van Der Zee, well known in the African-American community, but virtually unknown at the time outside of it, “points out how exclusive and white-centric the industry was in those years.”

While there’s now a more diverse roster, there’s still a long way to go. “Fashion photography is a most fantastic barometer of the time,” Ms. Shinkle said. “It’s representative and it popularizes certain tendencies in ways that no other type of photography can because it’s so ubiquitous.”

Correction: Sept. 27 2017:

An earlier version of this article misstated the academic title held by Ms. Shinkle. She is a reader in photography, not a professor of Photographic Theory and Criticism.

The Trump administration is also looking for ways to ease restrictions on short-term health insurance plans that do not meet requirements of the Affordable Care Act.
The introduction of new association plans could take much longer, according to insurers and other experts.
While association health plans can be well run, they “have had a spotty track record,” said Ms. Owen, the actuary.","“By siphoning off healthy individuals, these junk plans could cannibalize the insurance exchanges,” said Topher Spiro, a vice president of the Center for American Progress, a liberal research and advocacy group. “For older, sicker people left behind in plans regulated under the Affordable Care Act, premiums could increase.”

But to business groups, the executive order offers an opportunity to bind their members together and sell large-group insurance policies that are cheap and attractive. Dirk Van Dongen, the president of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, said that he was delighted with Mr. Trump’s initiative and that his group would seriously consider establishing an association health plan.

“Small to midsize businesses have very little leverage in the insurance market,” Mr. Van Dongen said. “Anything that allows them to amalgamate their purchasing power will be helpful.”

Large employer-sponsored health plans are generally subject to fewer federal insurance requirements than small group plans and coverage purchased by individuals and families on their own. They are generally not required to provide “essential health benefits,” such as emergency services, maternity and newborn care, mental health coverage and substance abuse treatment, although many do.

A decision by Obama appointees in 2011 discouraged the use of association health plans as a substitute for Affordable Care Act policies because officials feared they would be used to circumvent the law’s coverage mandates. The Obama administration said that coverage offered to dozens or hundreds of small businesses through a trade or professional association would not be treated as a single large employer health plan for the purpose of insurance regulation.

Instead, the Obama administration said, the government would look at the size of each business participating in the association, so that many small employers would still be subject to stringent federal rules.

The Trump administration, by contrast, wants to make it easier for small businesses to buy less expensive plans that do not comply with some requirements of the 2010 law.

Several states considered bills to treat health plans offered to small employers through a trade association as large-group coverage, exempt from federal rules that apply to small businesses. But the Obama administration blocked those efforts, saying they were pre-empted by the Affordable Care Act. Trump administration officials are reconsidering that interpretation, in view of the president’s vow to increase access to less expensive insurance.

Large-group plans are still subject to some requirements of the Affordable Care Act. They generally must cover children up to age 26 on their parents’ plans, cannot impose lifetime limits on covered benefits and cannot charge co-payments for preventive services like mammograms and colonoscopies.

But they are generally exempt from the requirements to provide a specified package of benefits and to cover a certain percentage of the cost of covered services.

The Trump administration is also looking for ways to ease restrictions on short-term health insurance plans that do not meet requirements of the Affordable Care Act. Under a rule issued last October by the Obama administration, the duration of such short-term plans, purchased by hundreds of thousands of people seeking inexpensive insurance, must be less than three months. The rules previously said “less than 12 months.”

The Obama administration said some insurers were abusing short-term plans and keeping healthier consumers out of the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. People are buying these short-term plans as their “primary form of health coverage,” and some insurers are pitching the products to healthier people, the Obama administration said.

But Trump administration officials say that with insurance premiums soaring in many states, consumers should be able to buy less comprehensive, less expensive coverage as an alternative to conventional plans. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said short-term policies “serve an important purpose for consumers” who are between jobs.

That has some insurance experts worried. The influx of a set of plans exempt from the Affordable Care Act rules will essentially divide the market and make it increasingly unstable, said Rebecca Owen, a health research actuary with the Society of Actuaries.

People who want or need broad coverage could find it increasingly difficult to obtain an affordable policy, experts say. While the administration’s goal may be to give people a broader choice of plans, it could have the opposite effect on people who need or want the robust coverage available under the Affordable Care Act.

“The easier you make it not to buy comprehensive coverage, the harder you make it to buy comprehensive coverage,” said Katherine Hempstead, a health policy expert at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

As they waited for details of the executive order, health insurers still offering coverage in the online marketplaces created by the health care law were apprehensive.

Those insurers are most jittery about the possibility of a surge in short-term plans. Many of the large national insurers, like UnitedHealth Group, already offer these plans, and there would be little difficulty in their introducing more because of the executive order, analysts said.

“They can cobble these things together pretty easily,” said John Graves, a health policy expert at Vanderbilt University.

Individuals may already be attracted to short-term plans because of their low costs. These plans tend to limit benefits or offer policies only to people who do not have expensive medical conditions.

Short-term policies do not satisfy the coverage requirements of the Affordable Care Act, so consumers who buy them may be subject to tax penalties. But with the price of conventional insurance policies rising at double-digit rates, some people say they are willing to pay a penalty so they can buy a cheaper plan.

The introduction of new association plans could take much longer, according to insurers and other experts. The administration would need to work out the regulatory details, and groups would need to construct those plans.

But these plans pose some of the same risks, and industry experts warn that they have a history of leaving consumers with unpaid medical bills if they are not adequately regulated.

While association health plans can be well run, they “have had a spotty track record,” said Ms. Owen, the actuary. In the past, some plans failed because they did not have enough money to pay their customers’ medical bills, while some insurance companies were accused of misleading people about exactly what the plans would cover.","Foiled in Congress, Trump Moves on His Own to Undermine Obamacare",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/us/politics/trump-obamacare-executive-order.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

“There were questions like, What kind of backsplash do you want?” she said, her voice rising in remembered terror. “And I didn’t know what a backsplash was. It was just horrible. I hate that kind of stuff. And faucets. It was a combination of very boring and very stressful.”

The Upper West Side, by contrast, offered good diners and lousy restaurants, a beguilingly terrible supermarket, zero cool bars or boutiques — nothing, in short, to attract people who do not live there.

“I really, really like that,” she said. “When I go home after being in Midtown or even the Village, the vibe is so much more people going about their business — I need to buy shoelaces, or I need to buy a new wastebasket and some hangers, and then I’m going to go home. It’s not like, Hey, there’s this new hip restaurant on West 83rd street. I don’t think so. I really doubt that.”

Ms. Chast grew up in the Kensington section of Flatbush, the only child of parents who rarely left the neighborhood. Her father, a teacher, never learned to drive. “My mother drove, but she was a very anxious driver,” Ms. Chast said. “So I grew up with a lot of anxiety about cars and driving.

“We’d come into Manhattan to see plays, and we’d turn around and come back. We never stayed. There was always a story where something terrible happened to someone — some restaurant where a lady found a piece of glass in an olive. So you just ate at this one Chinese restaurant near our apartment and sat in the same booth, and you ordered the same food, moo goo gai pan, of course, because that’s safe.”

When she returned to New York after art school, in January 1978, it was to an apartment on West 73rd Street with no stove, just a hot plate, and wiring that regularly blew a fuse. Her parents helped with the rent. Four months later she sold her first cartoon to The New Yorker for $250, or roughly a month’s rent.

“She really opened the doors to a certain kind of idiosyncratic weirdness at The New Yorker,” said Emily Flake, 40, who followed Ms. Chast into the magazine’s pages three decades later. “Part of that has to do with coming from a point of view owned by a woman. She wasn’t the first female cartoonist at The New Yorker, but she’s one of the first female stars. She carved out a space for a more personal brand of weirdness for people who are similarly off the map.”

Richard Gehr, author of “I Only Read It for the Cartoons: The New Yorker’s Most Brilliantly Twisted Artists,” called Ms. Chast the magazine’s “first subversive cartoonist,” who was not appreciated by the older male cartoonists on staff. “She was a feisty, punky young person whose stuff looked completely different,” Mr. Gehr said. “A lot of other cartoonists there found that very challenging: if this is the new wave, what are we? And she’s come to display more range there than almost any other cartoonist in The New Yorker’s history.”

As Ms. Chast has aged, her characters, often loosely autobiographical, have aged with her, growing into middle age with their neuroses intact. “Some worries I’m probably going to carry with me until the point comes when you stop worrying, which is when you’re dead,” she said. “Where do I start? Driving, medical, electricity, basement, boilers.”

In recent years, Ms. Chast has turned her attention to elaborate egg-painting, embroidery, rug-hooking and ukulele, partly as a remedy to chronic insomnia. After the cathartic nakedness of “Can’t We Please Talk About Something More Pleasant?” which literally took on matters of life and death, “Going Into Town,” which began life as a city guide for her daughter, feels genial but slight. At an October speaking engagement at the Museum of the City of New York, where tickets cost $40, she leaned heavily on earlier cartoons.

But she may be saving her energies for her next big project, in which she ventures back into the land where her neuroses began.

“Brooklyn,” she said. “Out there Brooklyn. Places where you take the subway and then you have to take a bus.”

It’s a big topic, especially for someone dreaming of playing Hawaiian heavy metal on the ukulele. But why not? As the character Pigeon Little says in Ms. Chast’s new collection, “The sky is falling, the sky is — oh look! Part of a bagel.”

Tricky Clues

37A: This is one of those clues that was probably a no-brainer for some of you, but I went down the catwalk looking for an answer to “Prep for the runway, maybe.” We’re dealing with airliners, not fashion lines, and the answer is a crossword stalwart, DEICE.

51A: Religious references always bounce off my unschooled mind, but I find Pope Francis’ personality fascinating and when I saw this quote — “when one goes against one’s conscience” — I assumed that he meant guilt, which didn’t fit. This was also probably not a universally difficult clue, but it was a thought-provoking one for me. He’s referring to SIN, something I’ve always thought of as an absolute, objective rather than subjective or personal.

72A: “Cause of insomnia, maybe” just had to be guilt. Why did I fixate on this particular sensation while doing this puzzle? Worry, stress, self-doubt, a strong urge to begin a move to Scandinavia at 3 a.m. — there are many things that can keep one up at night. Including, I guess, a DRIP — be it a slow leak or someone who just won’t stop talking.

138A: An example of how precise cluing can be, “We should avoid doing that” led me to snap in BAD IDEA when I was first circling the grid. I realized my mistake soon thereafter — it’s LETS NOT — but I probably could’ve avoided the error by reading more closely. Also, what word was I thinking of at 112D to end in B? Not using my noggin.

46D: This term for a “ratcheting wheel mechanism,” PAWL, was a completely new word to me. It wasn’t a blocker for anything so I just let it fill itself in with crosses at the end of solving. This used to happen to me all the time when I started doing puzzles 350 years ago, but these days it’s a novelty to discover a common word like this. It’s also used in the puzzle, though rarely.

This is the sweetgum tree, which you might encounter daily if you’re in between New York City and Florida on the East Coast. I took my dog to the emergency room twice in one month thinking she had broken her ankle when in fact a prickly little sweetgum ball had gotten lodged in between her pawpads. Just like Androcles and the lion, just more neurotic and less swashbuckling.

But for Mr. Nikolaou, the project, called “…Balkaniotheque” and sponsored by the Onassis Foundation, became more than a multifaceted look at the region. It has been a search for his very identity.

“I am a Greek,” said Mr. Nikolaou, who calls both Athens and Chalkis home. “And I have multiple identities. I belong in the East, in the West, but I also belong in the Balkans. This was forgotten for Greeks. None define themselves as Balkan. I had to find myself.”

Early on, Mr. Nikolaou said the project felt like psychoanalysis, a dive into his soul and the way he learned how to feel. He became fixated on the notion of a shared, repressed Balkan identity, one that he could unearth and restore to the collective memory.

“I wish to describe the Balkan soul,” he said. “Which seems to be dark and intractable, but it becomes simple, warm and human when it flames up.”

Mr. Nikolaou said he allowed the places to which he journeyed to choose him, not the other way around. In his travels, he’s been to nearly a dozen countries, exploring bustling capital cities as well as Roma ghettos and mountain villages.

“I made more than 20 trips trying not just to take photos, but to feel the Balkan reality,” he said. “To see those deep characteristics of the Balkan people that I believe are common all over the peninsula.”

The Balkan people were very hospitable, Mr. Nikolaou said, though he preferred to stay in the remote, rural areas. “There I met the most important people,” he said. “People totally free from the stress of our civilization. People with pain in their eyes but firstly, with big, big heart.”

He bore witness to funerals, celebrated at weddings and made intimate connections with those who opened their homes and lives to him. That vulnerability fostered a sense of human unity that Mr. Nikolaou hopes to showcase.

“The Balkans are a place where people look so different, but they are so alike in the way they face life,” he said. “And that must be what will lead us in the future. It may seem utopian, but deep inside me I believe that all people can live without borders. Even in the war-crushed Balkans, we can. It is enough to look at what it is that unites us. And what unites us is more important than what keeps us divided.”

“There’s a multiplicity of voices that came together to shape the perception of Canada that The New York Times then shared with its readers,” she said.","“We worry when you look hard at us, but we are also touchy about being overlooked,” then-Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson of Canada told a group of American students in 1963. The quote, reprinted in the June 10th issue of The New York Times of that year, still rings true today, especially as a Canadian like myself goes through thousands of images of Canada from the newspaper’s archives.

Earlier this year, the Ryerson Image Center in Toronto received a donation of 24,804 images from a collector, Chris Bratty, who had purchased the collection with the intention of donating it. Selected by a team led by two gallerists, Steven Kasher and Stephen Bulger, the pictures range from World War I to the late 1990s, from hockey players to lumberjacks. A selection is currently on view in an exhibition at the center and in a book, both entitled “The Faraway Nearby.”

“When I heard of the collection, I immediately wanted to acquire it,” said Paul Roth, an American who is the center’s director. “For all the strengths of our holdings — including the Black Star and the Berenice Abbott archives — we don’t have a tremendous amount of Canadian photojournalism. This helps us fill that gap. And, since it comes from a major U.S. newspaper, it brings up the question of how one country covers another, which fits within our mandate of interrogating different aspects of the medium.”

The expected tropes are there: Canada as a winter wonderland; as a safe, polite neighbor who reveres hockey. But there are also images that challenge them: Canada the diplomat having lighthearted meetings with America’s foes. In one photo, Nikita S. Khrushchev laughs at a joke told by Mr. Pearson — the opposite of the famous “Kitchen Debate” moment by Elliott Erwitt, in which then-Vice President Richard Nixon castigates the Soviet leader. In another, Fidel Castro holds Prime Minister Pierre-Elliott Trudeau’s youngest son, Michel Charles-Émile, during a four-day state visit. Or, Canada the troubled young nation deploying the Army to confront Quebec’s sometimes-violent calls for independence.

“The type of coverage we see speaks of a dual fascination between how familiar Canada feels, and yet how unfamiliar it sometimes appears,” Mr. Roth surmised. “I suspect that The New York Times had to ponder how to cover a country that was so close. Should they concentrate on the differences or highlight the similarities? When stories involved people or goods crossing the border, which was often the case, were they to be considered national or international news?”

Besides snow and hockey, evidence of Canada’s subordination to the British monarchy seemed of particular interest. The New York Times dedicated space daily to Princess Elizabeth’s first tour of Canada in 1951 (Slide 9) and continued to chronicle the royal family’s subsequent visits.

Mr. Trudeau also drew a lot of attention, more than any of his predecessors and successors, that is, until his son Justin ran for the same office and won in 2015. A reproduction of a spread published during the 1972 election is revealing. Within “The World” section, the article isn’t under a rubric with the country’s name, as is customary, but simply “Trudeau,” and a headline declaring “A Swinger Shows His Sober Side.” A full column is dedicated to a collage of images showing the candidate dancing, riding a motorcycle, playing hockey and pedaling a unicycle before concluding with a somber close-up portrait.

Mounting the exhibition, Denise Birkhofer — an American who recently settled in Toronto and co-curated the show with Gerald McMaster, an Indigenous Canadian of Plains Cree and Blackfoot descent — pondered how The New York Times’s fondness for certain subjects and visual archetypes might have shaped a national identity. That’s hard to answer, partly because of the variety of photographers who contributed to the paper’s Canadian coverage.

“There’s a multiplicity of voices that came together to shape the perception of Canada that The New York Times then shared with its readers,” she said. “Not all were Americans. Sometimes staff photographers were sent to cover a story, but other times it came from local publications or freelancers. There were also images made by Canadian agencies or corporations, such as the National Film Board and the Canadian Pacific Railway.”

Most surprisingly, during World War I, the images the paper used to showcase Canada’s participation in the war effort were supplied by Canadian entities, whose work had to be vetted by the nation’s official censors. Its goal was to avoid criticism of military endeavors by showing the conflict in a romanticized light. In other words, said Gaëlle Morel, the Ryerson Image Center exhibitions curator, “The New York Times — a private commercial enterprise — obeyed the censorship requirements of a foreign country.” In other words, the country’s image, as seen in The Times, reflected an official, sanitized perspective.

Mr. Roth said the collection has greater meaning given Canada’s sesquicentennial this year. “More than a time for celebration and patriotism, it is an occasion to think about complicated questions relating to the identity of the nation,” he said. “All countries should be interested in how they’re viewed by other states. We should strive to get past the mythologies that are created to promote tourism or to reinforce patriotic values, especially nowadays. Doing so requires unpacking widely held cultural assumptions. And that’s exactly what we can do thanks to this archive. While it doesn’t tell a single story, it does help us understand what the Canadian mythologies are.”

“The Puerto Rican parrot is an iconic species of the island,” Marisel López, leader of the The Puerto Rican Parrot Recovery Program, of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, said. “It’s our legacy.”

While there were tens of thousands in pre-Columbian times, the parrot population dwindled to 13 by 1973 because of deforestation, hunting and species competition. Conservation efforts since then have helped rebuild the population, and before Maria, the captive and wild population combined numbered over 500, Ms. López said. At least seven parrots died in captivity because of the stress induced by the hurricane and the high heat in the days after because of the lack of canopy, she said.

Ms. López, whose team is trying to gain access to the western part of El Yunque where the parrots live, said the toll in the wild population was not known.

The tourism industry in Puerto Rico is deeply intertwined with its environment.

About 1.2 million people visit El Yunque every year for its hiking trails, zip-lining, camping and waterfalls. But the rain forest has remained closed since Maria left roads inaccessible and all its recreational facilities received blows, Ms. Wallace, the forest supervisor, said.

“We don’t know how long it is going to take to reopen,” she said.

And on an island, where 58 percent of the acreage is forests, Maria’s ecological damage was widespread.

The population of mountain coquí, one of the 14 species of a small native frog, with a distinctive mating call heard at night across the island, was severely decimated by Hurricane Hugo in 1989, Rafael Joglar, a professor of biology at the University of Puerto Rico, said.

Hurricane Maria could be the final straw for that species, Mr. Joglar said.

“It worries us that it’ll be the next species to disappear in Puerto Rico,” Mr. Joglar, a herpetologist, said. “The worst would be if we get a dry season — that would be the mortal blow other than the hurricane.”",Another Victim of Hurricane Maria: Puerto Rico’s Treasured Rainforest,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/us/another-victim-of-hurricane-maria-puerto-ricos-treasured-rainforest.html

Egypt’s State Information Service issued an unsigned statement saying the two rivals had “agreed on procedures” for a reconciliation government that would take effect on Dec. 1. But the statement also acknowledged continuing “divisions,” and said that Egypt would host another meeting on Nov. 21.

Ahmed Yousef, an adviser to the Hamas leader, Ismail Haniya, said the two sides had agreed to joint control over the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, a key lifeline for Gaza’s residents.

Reacting to news reports, citing Fatah officials, that Fatah would take control of the crossing, he said, “We will discuss the possibility of allowing the presidential guard from the West Bank to control it.”

Mr. Yousef said the two sides would convene committees to integrate their ministries into a reconciliation government. One major challenge, he said, would be to reduce the bloated, 200,000-strong Palestinian civil service, which he estimated needs to be cut by as much as 20 per cent.

But, he added, the two sides had not discussed a number of critical questions, including a joint strategy for dealing with Israel, the conduct of any future elections and, crucially, the state of the Hamas military wing.

When leaders from Hamas and Fatah signed a similar deal in 2011, Mr. Abbas said, “We have turned the black page of division forever.” But the deal quickly foundered amid opposition from Israel, which denounced it as a “victory for terrorism.”

This time, a broad Arab coalition is backing the deal, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

“This merger is going to cost a lot of money, and they will help us financially,” said Mr. Yousef, referring to Emirati and Saudi support for the deal. “The Egyptians also clearly got a green light from America.

“We expected that there might be processes happening over thousands of years preceding the eruption,” said Christy Till, a geologist at Arizona State, and Ms. Shamloo’s dissertation adviser. Instead, the outer rims of the crystals revealed a clear uptick in temperature and a change in composition that occurred on a rapid time scale.

The time scale is the blink of an eye, geologically speaking. It’s even shorter than a previous study that found that another ancient supervolcano beneath California’s Long Valley caldera awoke hundreds of years before its eruption. As such, scientists are just now starting to realize that the conditions that lead to supereruptions might emerge within a human lifetime.

“It’s shocking how little time is required to take a volcanic system from being quiet and sitting there to the edge of an eruption,” said Ms. Shamloo, though she warned that there’s more work to do before scientists can verify a precise time scale.

Kari Cooper, a geochemist at the University of California, Davis who was not involved in the research, said Ms. Shamloo and Dr. Till’s research offered more insights into the time frames of supereruptions, although she is not yet convinced that scientists can pin down the precise trigger of the last Yellowstone event. Geologists must now figure out what kick-starts the rapid movements leading up to supereruptions.

“It’s one thing to think about this slow gradual buildup — it’s another thing to think about how you mobilize 1,000 cubic kilometers of magma in a decade,” she said.

As the research advances, scientists hope they will be able to spot future supereruptions in the making. The odds of Yellowstone, or any other supervolcano, erupting anytime soon are small.

But success came only just in time: If Ms. Gough hadn’t gotten the part, she was going to quit acting altogether. She’d had a year without any work, and was broke.

Over a recent lunch in a West London brasserie where she makes a joke of ostentatiously ordering lobster pasta, she’s able to laugh at how far she’s come. “I can’t believe it,” she said. “It’s completely nuts.”

Ms. Gough (it rhymes with cough), who’s lived in London since she was a teenager, is great company, her chat as quick and flashing as those very blue eyes. She clearly doesn’t suffer fools, and enjoys pricking actorly pretensions. (“I like to shout ‘Macbeth’ a lot.”) Yet beneath the expletive-riddled sarcasm dwells a spiritual belief that the universe is unfolding as it should; she rejected Catholicism, but retains some “faith in a higher power — something very personal to me.”

So when it came to Emma, she had a sense that it was meant to be. “People will laugh, but I feel like the characters find me,” she said. “The ones I’m supposed to play, I’m going to play.”

She still busted a gut to get it, however, even snorting a line of icing sugar when auditioning. “It was one of those mythic auditions,” recalled Mr. Macmillan, whose adaptation of “1984” just closed on Broadway. “This play needs a talent, someone very charismatic. Denise came in and grabbed it by the throat and wrestled it to the floor.”

Why does she think “People, Places & Things” connected so profoundly with audiences? “Do you know someone in your life that has addiction issues?” she threw the question back at me. “So does every single person in this room, yet it’s so shrouded in shame. Duncan tapped into our need to connect with each other about that stuff.”

Jeremy Herrin, the play’s director, acknowledged that “American culture is much more conversant in addiction narratives, with more purchase on self-help and the therapeutic conversation than us repressed Brits,” but contended that the subject is universal. And Ms. Gough’s performance is key. “Denise is so attuned to the subject matter,” Mr. Herrin continued. “She gets it. She’s very brave, very courageous.”

In rehearsals, where tears flow and vocal cords surely shred, it’s striking how Ms. Gough also frequently refers to time the company spent with addicts in a recovery center in South London.

“To me, it’s incredibly brave for an addict to get clean,” she said. “The most avant-garde thing you can do in the world today is live sober, because if there was ever a time you’d want to switch off all the feelings it’s now, right?”

Audience members would pour their hearts out to her after shows; she still wears a pendant necklace that a recovering addict sent her in gratitude. “It’s more than a play for me,” she explained. And she’s not about to jeopardize it by succumbing to excess herself.

“No, I’ve done it all — I don’t need to,’’ she said. “I am actually such a safe bet now, because my work is really important to me and I don’t want to be [expletive] that up.”

Ms. Gough is becoming a more regular screen presence, recently appearing in “Guerrilla,” John Ridley’s Showtime mini-series about the British black power movement. Next year she plays Keira Knightley’s lover in “Colette,” a film about the French novelist; Ms. Gough is Mathilde de Morny, who dressed in suits and was “one of the first women to identify as a man.”

Her heart belongs to the theater, however. Her first taste was playing Miss Hannigan in a school production of “Annie.” “I made the audience laugh,” she recalled, “and I remember thinking: ‘Yep, that feels nice, I’ll have more of that.’ ”

She grew up in Ennis, Ireland; her father was a head of fisheries, her mother a marriage counselor. She was the seventh of 11 children — which explains her love of applause.

“It is obviously psychological,” she said, “now, what I do for a living, is get attention. But I wasn’t brought up with the thought that acting was a possibility.” Stubbornly determined to prove her parents wrong, she moved to London at just 15, and after a precarious few years living in squats, won a scholarship to the Academy of Live and Recorded Arts.

Her experience has made her an outspoken supporter of immigration as well as government support for those out of work or on low incomes — a fraught subject in Britain.

“I am an immigrant, but the difference between me and the immigrants dying in the sea is that I’m white and English-speaking, and that to me is deeply troubling,” she said. “England saved my life, really. I took advantage of everything this country has to offer, and now I’m giving back.”

She is troubled by contemporary politics in her adopted home country, particularly Britain’s decision to leave the European Union. That, followed by the election of President Donald Trump, left her reeling. Yet “People, Places & Things” has also provided her with a framework for understanding the current turbulent state of the world.

”An addict has to hit rock bottom before they change their lives,’’ she said. ”Maybe the world is hitting rock bottom, and there’s going to be a glorious spiritual awakening where we all start looking after each other.”

Is she optimistic, ultimately? “I have to be otherwise I would top myself,” she answered. “I can’t lose hope. I refuse.”

On the heels of the four-week New York run of “People, Places & Things,” Ms. Gough will reprise the role she played this summer — another addict, the Valium-hooked Harper in Tony Kushner’s “Angels in America.”

But audiences can expect an unusually punchy Harper, not a hazy victim.

“Someone said to me, she’s really angry,” Ms. Gough explained. “Well, wouldn’t you be? Harper has to save herself. That’s why the speech at the end is pure joy. It’s got to be: ‘It’s going to be really hard, but I’m going to be free.’ Free from addiction, free from a husband that doesn’t love me, free to leave.”

Anyone can divine Mark Rothko or Mark Bradford’s greatness; consistently assessing exceptional work before an artist achieves public recognition is the most rigorous test. For five years, Dr. Anderson did just that, presiding over the United States’ most influential survey of contemporary art: the Whitney Biennial. His experience, he said, can be applied to everyday life.

Good design enraptures Dr. Anderson, from his Sorrento cup and saucer, readily available on the internet, to Sarah Sze’s virtuosic sculptures, which have graced the US Pavilion at the Venice Biennale. Both, he explained, display forceful imagination and technical skill. “So many glammed-up espresso cups are too thin-walled and thus chip or break easily, are hot to the touch, and don’t stack,” Dr. Anderson said.

“Americans in particular love hobbies,” he said. “And they can use those same visual impulses to develop an eye for art and design.” For instance, those who take joy in cooking have, most likely, already refined an instinct for quality culinary wares. They may not realize it: their beloved Le Creuset conforms to the same principles of superior craftsmanship as any of Dr. Anderson’s cherished possessions, such as the midcentury tackle box that belonged to his father. A cyclist already brings such rigor to bikes; the philatelist to stamps. The trick is exercising this brain reflex to new stimuli.

Yet what about hiring an interior designer or art adviser? Can you outsource the pursuit of taste and still have a home that reflects an internal quality compass? “As with a ski instructor, you should eventually break free as a student,” Dr. Anderson said, “even if you take a tumble on the slopes once in a while.” He cautions, though, that mistakes will be made. An object’s high price tag is no guarantee of quality.

“If you haven’t developed a good reflex,” he added, “you may make choices that are only indexed to cost, but often don’t have much to do with the work itself.”

Learning to see the quality instinct in other people’s space is also key to developing better judgment. Houses with strong aesthetics may come in every shape and size, but they too hold several teachable lessons. Chief among them: Thou shalt not copy. Parroting a magazine or someone else’s home seldom achieves a result worth much retrospection.

As the mixed media artist Bastienne Schmidt puts it, authenticity is crucial. Live who you are, she says; don’t conform to anybody’s design prescription.

To that end, Ms. Schmidt and her husband, the photographer Philippe Cheng, have an enchantingly modern Bridgehampton studio-cum-home, a prototype of which they drew for their architect, on a napkin, in 1998 — and where they raised their sons, Max, 18 and Julian, 15.",Is Good Taste Teachable?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/04/style/design-good-taste.html

The Orbital Reflector presented an opportunity to ‘‘get messy .","The Orbital Reflector, as Paglen calls it, seems at first glance almost romantic, even deliberately naïve. It has no scientific purpose; it doesn’t even carry a camera. But under closer scrutiny, it can be seen as an elaboration of the artist’s ongoing thesis about art, technology and the impossibility of separating either from a specific moment in time. ‘‘It began as a thought experiment in which we imagined that spaceflight was the opposite of what it actually is,’’ he explains over lunch at Soho House, at a table overlooking the Berlin TV tower, with its iconic dome evoking Sputnik, Earth’s first satellite. In the American mind, space is a frontier: ‘‘We imagine going to the moon and planting a flag, going to an asteroid and mining, going to Mars and setting up a colony,’’ he says. ‘‘And I think that expansionist mentality is very self-destructive, especially given the kind of precarious relationship we now have to the ecosystem here on Earth, because it allows us to imagine that Earth is disposable.’’ Billionaire entrepreneurs may dream of colonizing Mars, but in fact, space is not going to save us. Aliens are not going to grant us absolution. ‘‘People expect this kind of profound cosmic altruism, which is very religious in a way. Space is completely wrapped up with this kind of stuff, which is what makes it interesting.’’

The Orbital Reflector draws a clear parallel between contemporary art and space exploration: the ideal of a purely visionary gesture, and the less starry reality. While the satellite — a small, five-kilogram box called a CubeSat, from which a 100-foot-long inflatable structure will deploy — has no commercial or military purpose, its success depends on the very systems of power Paglen has spent more than a decade critiquing. Built by an aerospace contractor called Global Western, it, likely along with a governmental reconnaissance satellite, will launch from California’s Vandenberg Air Force Base on a Space X rocket into low orbit. The project illustrates how unfeasible it would be to execute any other way: For all the talk of civilian spaceflight, it remains a thoroughly militarized domain.

Managing the project is Zia Oboodiyat, a retired engineer who ran large communications satellite programs for the San Francisco-based Space Systems/Loral. He first met Paglen in 2011 while the artist was working on the time capsule; Oboodiyat oversaw the construction of the satellite the disc was attached to and advocated for the project. When Paglen approached him about the Orbital Reflector, Oboodiyat immediately recognized its potential lyricism. ‘‘You don’t have to be rich to see it; you don’t have to be tall to see it,’’ he says. ‘‘You don’t have to be American. Anybody anywhere on Earth has equal opportunity to see something that gives humanity hope.’’

Paglen’s partner in the project, the Reno-based Center for Art + Environment at the Nevada Museum of Art, is fund-raising to cover the $1.3 million cost. The center’s collection includes extensive material from the giants of land art, including Walter de Maria and Michael Heizer. The Orbital Reflector places Paglen (for the moment, anyway) in this tradition — an artist defying the laws of nature and practicality in order to create a work larger than himself. ‘‘It is a high-risk proposition — rockets do explode; CubeSats sometimes fail to open,’’ says David Walker, the museum’s executive director. ‘‘But it’s exciting, too, because we see outer space as the ultimate mirror for human aspiration.’’ The Orbital Reflector is like the inevitable conclusion to the land art movement; Paglen’s work, like Heizer’s, may start in the desert, but will eventually leave the Earth entirely.

Paglen moved to Berlin partly for financial reasons — ‘‘I wanted to hire people, not spend $10,000 a month on a studio in Sunset Park’’ — but seems to have found a home amid the city’s young expat artists and WikiLeaks types. At a Vietnamese restaurant, he bumps into a hacktivist friend who looks all of 17. ‘‘These guys have guts,’’ Paglen notes, after saying hello. ‘‘He was way up the butthole of the F.B.I. I probably shouldn’t talk about it.’’

Paglen doesn’t describe himself as a dissident — ‘‘I’m as American as it gets, a product of these contradictions’’ — but it’s impossible not to connect the themes in his work to a childhood spent on military bases. His father was an Air Force ophthalmologist; his mother, one of the first female Episcopalian priests. In third grade, in the San Francisco Bay Area, Paglen got in trouble for skipping school to sneak into lectures on dinosaurs at Berkeley — the same lecture halls in which he’d later be working toward his doctorate. The family moved to Wiesbaden, Germany, when he was 12, and he spent two years in a German school in a nearby village, where, as a foreign student, he was ostracized. ‘‘When you’re not the beneficiary of privilege, suddenly you see it for what it is,’’ he says.

An ongoing theme in Paglen’s more satirical work is the puerile machismo of military culture’s symbology and nomenclature, ‘‘the collective unconscious of this world of secrecy and violence,’’ as he puts it. One afternoon, Hanna Mattes, who oversees Paglen’s studio and helps manage its external production, is consulting with the artist on one of the sculptures he’s making for the fall show: an enormous dragon inspired by the small trophy in his studio. The trophy, Paglen explains, is presented to members of the 315th Network Warfare Squadron upon retirement. Paglen’s version will be a 12-foot sculpture inscribed in fetishistic detail, like medieval armor for the cyber age. The best way to preserve the details, they conclude, will be to 3D-print the mold in four sections, lightly polishing them to remove any marks. Another concern is the weight: The finished dragon, cast in bronze, will weigh two tons. Paglen mentions a crane. Mattes looks at him. ‘‘Maybe we should just paint the form for the exhibition.’’

The dragon will be included in the 2018 Smithsonian exhibit. This year’s Metro Pictures exhibit will showcase Paglen’s ongoing work with different kinds of artificial intelligence technologies, taking viewers down a rabbit hole of imagery, from the now quaint-seeming pictures first made by humans in the early 1990s to train military facial recognition software, to the kind of ‘‘invisible images’’ computers hallucinate for themselves — say, when we post an image on Facebook — in order to make sense of the external world. ‘‘This is how an A.I. brain sees a shark,’’ Paglen says back in his studio, looking at a weirdly beautiful Abstract Expressionist-like swath of blues and grays that results from a computer creating a visual amalgam of thousands of images of the animal in water. The exhibit invites critical questions about the extent to which artificial intelligence algorithms, with their potential for programmed-in bias, are governing our reality. It’s also aesthetically provocative: ‘‘Man,’’ a distillation of figurative imagery, vaguely recalls a Francis Bacon portrait; ‘‘Rainbow’’ — a blend of cosmic-like rainbows — a Dali-esque dreamscape. ‘‘It’s like I’m relearning art history,’’ Paglen says.

So how does an artist who has devoted his career to empirical scrutiny of those things that will shape our future, from artificial intelligence to the annexation of space, respond rationally to a time in which reason itself — when it comes to political discourse, at least — seems to be increasingly endangered? ‘‘Those are foundational questions for me,’’ Paglen says. ‘‘Nothing that you make in the world exists in isolation from the social and political and ecological dimensions of it.’’ He hasn’t given up on art’s ability to spark the imagination — and to make us see the things we might prefer not to. The Orbital Reflector presented an opportunity to ‘‘get messy . . . to make something that’s beautiful, but also self-contradictory, and tries to challenge common sense.’’ It’s Carl Sagan meets Dada for a new millennium’s inhumanity.

As we talk, the sky darkens in Berlin, and the first blinking glimmerings appear. ‘‘For me, there’s something very romantic about going and looking at the stars and trying to photograph spy satellites,’’ Paglen says. ‘‘Ultimately, what it comes down to is looking at the sky and trying to understand something about one’s place in history. People have been doing this for tens of thousands of years. This is kind of a variation on that.

“The current Trump administration’s aggressive remarks about how he can totally destroy my country make it unthinkable that we can start any dialogue,” said Ri Yong-pil, a senior Foreign Ministry official.

My visit left me thinking that Trump’s entire strategy rests on a series of fundamental and dangerous misconceptions.

The first misconception is that sanctions and talk of war will lead North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. Every North Korean official we spoke to insisted that this was impossible, and the U.S. intelligence community likewise believes that this just won’t happen, for (as I mentioned in my last column) North Korea sees nuclear warheads as crucial to its survival.

We did see signs that sanctions are biting, for businessmen complained about China cracking down on trade; gas prices have doubled; and electricity is rationed. Power outages are routine even in the capital.

Yet solar panels are becoming more common, and Kim has moved to liberalize the economy in ways that generate growth despite sanctions. Collective farms are allowing greater use of private plots, factory managers enjoy more responsibility to turn profits and street markets are more tolerated than before.

The bite of sanctions on elites is also dulled by a Kim initiative to inject a bit of fun into life in the capital (special permission is needed for North Koreans to visit Pyongyang, let alone live there). This is still the most totalitarian country in the world, but it does have an amusement park, a water park, a ski area and a dolphin show — North Korea’s version of SeaWorld. (I genuinely enjoyed the dolphin show, until it ended with wide-screen images of missiles.)

The second American misconception is that China can transform North Korean behavior. We’ve always exaggerated Chinese influence on North Korea. Kim has gone out of his way to humiliate President Xi Jinping, and Chinese officials fear that this will happen again this month with a missile launch or nuclear test during China’s 19th Communist Party Congress.

North Korea has refused even to allow a visit by the Chinese point man for North Korean affairs, Kong Xuanyou. “We know what Kong would say, so he doesn’t need to say it here,” one North Korean official told me scornfully.

The third American misconception is the assumption that the North Korean regime is near collapse, and that huffing and puffing will accelerate this. In the early 1990s my wife and I chose to be Tokyo correspondents for The Times partly because that would enable us to cover North Korea — and its impending collapse. We’re still waiting.

Yes, at some point it’ll happen, but don’t count on it tomorrow. And the economic reforms, however modest, may give the regime a bit more life.

Trump has genuinely increased the economic pressure on North Korea through United Nations sanctions, and the pinch may increase. But one of the worst mistakes in international relations, plaguing us from Vietnam to Iraq, is to operate on wishful thinking rather than reality, and I fear that’s what’s happening here in a perilous way. To be blunt, Trump’s strategy frightens me.

In speech and through Twitter, he is escalating a conflict and trumpeting military options as he insists on a goal of denuclearization that is unachievable, a tactic of Chinese pressure that is unrealistic and a premise of regime fragility that is wishful thinking.

With light and shadow, it’s possible not just to accentuate your features — but to reshape them.

Makeup lovers are a flighty species, enthralled by millennial pink one day and grungy black-plum the next. Look more closely, though, and two tidy camps emerge: One consists of peacocks who treat their faces as Technicolor canvases; the other of faux naturalists. But they are united in one respect — both share an obsession with the architecture of the face.

Contouring — using darker shades of concealer or foundation to create dimension and a more defined facial structure — had long been employed by makeup artists, but five years ago, the technique went mainstream, and was soon followed by the rise of the complementary practices of strobing (applying light, often shimmery shades on the higher planes of the face) and baking (applying a thick coat of powder on the cheeks to set makeup and neutralize harsh angles). This isn’t so much the season as it is the era of face architecture. On the runway, it was most recently found at the summer couture shows — at Dior, there was no makeup at all but for the slightest hints of highlighter, while at Margiela, the models wore multiple layers of highlighter, their skin glistening with an otherworldly sheen.

Achieving this sort of chiaroscuro can seem an artful and even artistic pursuit, one that transcends mere vanity. But the real reason contouring has become the essential makeup language for our age is that the process was born for the screen, and what is our current era but one lived through, and on, the screen? Think of Marlene Dietrich, an early beneficiary of contouring as a tuxedo-clad cabaret singer in the 1930 film “Morocco,” her cheekbones announcing themselves beneath the tilted brim of her top hat. Without high definition or color, Hollywood’s early makeup artists didn’t need to worry whether their work might appear clownish offscreen. Even so, Max Factor sold a version of the look to the masses with his full coverage Pan-Cake line and contouring tutorials. (Today’s equivalents include brands like Becca, known for its highlighters, and Anastasia Beverly Hills, whose contour palettes are best sellers at Sephora.)

Contouring fell out of fashion in favor of a more self-consciously “natural” look, but in the ’80s and ’90s, the trend was revived by drag queens, who used professional stage makeup brands like Ben Nye, Kryolan and Mehron to both soften masculine features (strong jaws, pronounced brow bones), and create feminine ones through copious strobing, which can have a plumping effect. Elements of drag culture have since trickled down into the broader culture: Along with false lashes’ popularity and the sequined packaging of star makeup artist Pat McGrath’s line of coveted pigments, the most significant development is how profoundly we’ve succumbed to the promise of transformation. No longer do you have to do the hard work of accepting the face you’ve been given — now you can just reshape it. On her website, the British makeup artist and cosmetics company founder Charlotte Tilbury offers a video tutorial on just that. She recommends applying a pale line of concealer down the center of the face and then patting sculpting powder along either side, describing the effect as “a little bit like virtual surgery.”

Of course, the ability to become someone other than oneself has always been both makeup’s appeal and its threat. Witnessing Asian women use contouring to whittle down their noses, for example, inevitably leads to questions about what was wrong with their noses in the first place. The aim, crushingly, can be to look white. Or not: In June, Kim Kardashian West promoted her new Crème Contour and Highlight Kit with pictures of herself looking especially contoured and extremely tan. Accusations of blackface ensued. Among other things, the case was a reminder that with architecture comes architectural integrity — however skilled the renovator, the bones of the structure must be respected.",We’re Living in the Golden Age of Contouring,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/t-magazine/contouring-trend-makeup.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Your advertiser website lists “success stories” of political campaigns that have used Facebook advertising to increase turnout and win elections.","Alex Stamos, chief security officer, Facebook:

In our April white paper, “Information Operations and Facebook,” we described the activity that we detected from a sophisticated threat actor that was spreading stolen information about specific political targets in the run-up to the U.S. election and using it to feed press stories that they could then amplify. We took steps to disrupt this activity and reported details to the relevant authorities.

In this white paper, we noted the challenge of attributing threat activity to foreign actors ourselves, but we specifically referenced the assessment of the U.S. government that this actor was tied to Russia’s intelligence services. This was an accurate statement of what we knew about this particular actor at the time, and it appropriately relied on the U.S. intelligence community’s public analysis.

We have been forthcoming at every opportunity about what we know about these information operations. In addition to our white paper, last month we disclosed advertising activity on our platform that we believe is linked to the Internet Research Agency, a different group from the one we described in April. We undertook this research on our own, and we named the group based on our best assessment because we weren’t aware of a comparable public report from the government.

2. Related to the above question: In July 2016, WikiLeaks complained that Facebook was censoring links to a page on its website that hosted the hacked D.N.C. emails. Your chief security officer, Alex Stamos, replied to WikiLeaks (in a tweet that has since been deleted) saying that the issue had “been fixed.” Links to WikiLeaks were subsequently restored. Did Facebook’s security team manually override a tool that flagged these fake accounts as suspicious? If so, who was responsible for the decision to restore access to WikiLeaks, despite having detected a suspicious campaign to promote its stolen documents? Did you notify law enforcement that your security team had intercepted a coordinated influence campaign?

Mr. Stamos: The temporary block of some WikiLeaks links by our automated spam-fighting systems had nothing to do with information operations. It was caused by WikiLeaks posting thousands of raw emails — several of which contained links to malicious phishing and spam sites found in industrywide block lists. We removed the block after we determined that the WikiLeaks links themselves were not harmful.

Is your definition of “debatable social issues” globally consistent, or does it vary by region?

7. In countries with regressive social policies, such as criminalizing homosexuality, do you allow the local authorities to determine which issues are considered debatable?

Mr. Osborne: No.

8. Last year, ProPublica found that Facebook advertisers could exclude certain ethnic groups from seeing advertisements about housing, employment and credit, in violation of federal anti-discrimination laws. In response, Facebook announced it would no longer allow ethnic group targeting for those ad categories. Did you consider extending the ban on ethnic group targeting to all ads, including political ads? Did you consider that political campaigns might use ethnic group targeting to suppress voter participation among certain ethnic groups? (Trump campaign officials claim to have used targeted Facebook ads to suppress African-American voters in the weeks leading up to the election.)

9. Did you, at any point leading up to the 2016 election, consider adding disclosures to political ads that made clear who was paying for those ads? If so, why did you decide not to include that feature?

10. You have said you are committed to protecting election integrity and supporting democratic ideals. However, there have been reports that you have built tools to censor speech in certain authoritarian countries, such as China, where you hope to be allowed to operate.

11. Mr. Trump’s digital campaign director, Brad Parscale, has said that Facebook sent “embeds” to work inside the Trump campaign offices and help them use Facebook more efficiently. (You have responded that these offers are standard for political campaigns, and that you “offered identical support to both the Trump and Clinton campaigns.”) What kinds of work did your employees do on behalf of the Trump campaign?

Were they authorized to report any illegal or suspicious activity they found in the course of their work? If so, did they make any such reports?

12. Your advertiser website lists “success stories” of political campaigns that have used Facebook advertising to increase turnout and win elections.

When I was living in Bangkok, a Thai friend told me she had worked in the kitchen of a Thai restaurant in Austria. I asked her whether it was difficult to cook for farangs, the term Thais use to describe Europeans and Americans.

“It’s easy,” she said. “You pretend you are cooking for children.”

Thai food is not the only cuisine to have been transformed in the journey across oceans. But I’ve made it my mission to track down good Thai cooking in the Bay Area, where I am now the Times bureau chief. I quiz every Thai person I meet, trade tips with diplomats and scour the streets for high-end and hole-in-the-wall restaurants that hold promise.

What I’ve found has been encouraging. A number of restaurants here serve dishes that respect the complexity of Thai food and its balance of sweet, sour, salt and spice. They’re part of a sea change that in recent years has produced ambitious and acclaimed Thai restaurants around the country, particularly in West Coast cities like Los Angeles and Portland, Ore.

“It’s a golden age for Thai food,” said James Syhabout, a Thailand-born chef and cookbook author who owns Hawker Fare, a San Francisco restaurant that specializes in dishes from that country’s Isaan region. “Restaurants serving good Thai food, as they do now, didn’t exist two decades ago because there wasn’t the community to support it, besides our own community.”

“Now diversity is more celebrated. And we are more brave, more proud of showcasing our ethnicity,” said Mr. Syhabout, who also owns Commis, an Oakland restaurant that has two Michelin stars.

When his parents opened their first Thai restaurant in the late 1980s, they made their dishes milder and sweeter to attract diners unfamiliar with the cuisine. “The last thing any chef wants is to get the food sent back.” he said. “You want to play on the safer side.”

Photo

In California, the change has come in part because the Thai population has reached a critical mass: The Thai Consulate in Los Angeles estimates that there are more than 200,000 Thais in the state, enough to have restaurants that cater only to them.

San Francisco’s Tenderloin district, the epicenter of the down-and-out in a city that has become largely unaffordable to all but the very wealthy, is also home to some of the city’s best Thai food.

There I met Narupon Silargorn, who came to this city as an art student and in 2008 opened Lers Ros Thai, where most of the early customers were Asian.

“I didn’t care whether farangs liked it,” he said. He also didn’t care that many customers couldn’t properly pronounce the name (layre rote tie), which means “excellent taste.” Now he has three branches, and two-thirds of his customers are not Thai. The image of farangs with unsophisticated palates is out of date, Mr. Narupon said.

For years, Thai chefs in America pointed out that fresh ingredients were not available; they were forced to buy Thai vegetables frozen or out of a can. That has changed with the intertwining of immigrant groups in California.

Thai chefs today describe an informal partnership with ethnic Hmong refugees from Laos who came to America after the Vietnam War. Many settled as farmers in California’s Central Valley.

Photo

It’s a classic American and Californian story: The Hmong farmers grow herbs and plants essential to Southeast Asian cooking, and the Thai chefs rejoice over access to freshly plucked Kaffir lime leaves; calamansi, a small citrus fruit akin to a kumquat; unripened papayas ready to be shredded into som tam, and the chickpea-size Thai eggplant found in dishes like green curry.

The Hmong grow cilantro, for decades a staple of California cuisine; they know not to slice off the roots, which are used in Thai soups, chili pastes and meat marinades.

Michael Yang, a Hmong immigrant who works for a University of California agricultural program in Fresno, has helped organize small-scale Hmong farmers to sell Asian vegetables and herbs to restaurants, grocery stores and farmers’ markets in the Bay Area. “We took a full busload of farmers to meet with restaurant owners,” Mr. Yang said, describing a trip three years ago. “We wanted them to make connections.”

View all New York Times newsletters.

When he began working with the farmers 24 years ago, they were growing about 50 varieties of Asian vegetables and herbs. Now they grow more than 200. “The list just goes on,” Mr. Yang said. “I’m still discovering new crops that are coming in.”

One avid customer for Hmong produce is Pim Techamuanvivit, the Bangkok-born owner of Kin Khao (Let’s Eat), a Thai restaurant wedged between the Tenderloin and Union Square.

Kin Khao breaks the mold of Thai restaurants in a number of ways. The staff is a mix of Thai and non-Thai. There are no wooden elephants and pictures of Thai landmarks; in an otherwise sparse wood-and-white dining room, Ms. Pim has chosen a Thai accent mark, mai toh, as the restaurant’s icon.

My favorite dish there so far is a yam som-o, which is normally made from pomelo, a citrus fruit the size of a cantaloupe that grows in the tropics. This version is a medley of citrus fruits — pomelo, grapefruit, blood orange — mixed with small fried shrimp, cilantro, peanuts, shallots, mint and toasted coconut.

Sometimes an item on the menu is followed by this: “Warning: This is not Thai food for beginners.”

Ms. Pim described one such dish, namprik long rua, an intensely spicy sauce. “It’s got shrimp paste, it’s got a lot of garlic, it’s served with raw vegetables, some of them quite bitter,” she said. “It’s supposed to hurt you, probably for a couple of days.” (Another convention that Kin Khao breaks is price. A solo dinner a few months ago cost me more than $100. My crab meat and betel leaf curry was delicious, but set me back $55.)

A 10-minute walk away is Zen Yai, where the check for two people came to $35. Zen Yai is a meeting spot for the Thai community, and most of the conversations I heard at nearby tables were in Thai.

Still, there is a lot of mediocre Thai food in the Bay Area, and beyond. Leela Punyaratabandhu, a Thai-American cookbook author who shuttles between Chicago and Bangkok, says she has been to restaurants where it was clear that the chefs and waiters would not eat what they serve. This is especially true of pad thai, a dish that has become the defining Thai dish in America. It’s probably eaten more widely here than in Thailand.

The worst pad thai Ms. Leela had in America was in a restaurant in Detroit. The Thai waitress warned her not to eat it, but Ms. Leela says she wanted to experiment. “It was really, really bad,” she recalled. “The server was looking at me with a puppy face that said, ‘Sorry’ and ‘I told you so.’”

How to find flavorful dishes in Thai restaurants that tailor their food for American tastes? I usually speak Thai in the hope that servers will take me seriously. Ms. Leela asks the staff what they would serve if their parents came to the restaurant.

Sometimes, authenticity can be painful. When I beseeched a waitress at Daughter Thai Kitchen, in the Montclair neighborhood of Oakland, not to hold back on the spice, she asked me to estimate my heat tolerance on a scale from one to 10.

I told her nine. And I nearly cried my way through a three-alarm southern curry.

Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com.

‘Give Me a Break, White Cosby’

Most male late-night hosts have not made much of the Harvey Weinstein scandal. But on Wednesday, Samantha Bee led “Full Frontal” with a full-on attack. She started by taking aim at Mr. Weinstein’s response last week to the initial reports that he’d sexually harassed women throughout his career.

“When the scandal broke, Weinstein made an apology-like statement in The New York Post, saying, ‘I have got to change, I’ve got to grow.’ ‘I know a lot of people would like me to go into a facility.’ Oh my God, I’m so behind in the slang. Is a facility what people call hell?” — SAMANTHA BEE

Ms. Bee was also irked by Mr. Weinstein’s statement that “I came of age in the ’60s and ’70s, when all the rules about behavior and workplaces were different.”

“Oh, give me a break, White Cosby. Nobody asked for your ‘all about mea culpa.’ Don’t blame the ’60s and ’70s for your [expletive] decision making. It’s serial sexual harassment, not a Monkees tattoo.” — SAMANTHA BEE

Colbert Wants to Revoke Trump’s Right to Tweet

President Trump suggested on Wednesday that the Federal Communications Commission should consider revoking NBC’s broadcasting license for publishing stories he finds objectionable. Stephen Colbert has another idea.

“Interesting question. I have two follow-ups: When is it appropriate for Twitter to deactivate the account of a president who doesn’t believe in the First Amendment? And, can that be yesterday?” — STEPHEN COLBERT

Jimmy Fallon wondered whether Mr. Trump had forgotten about the First Amendment entirely.

“Trump said it’s disgusting that the press is allowed to write whatever it wants to write. When asked about the First Amendment, he said, ‘Is that the one that says not to talk about Fight Club?’” — JIMMY FALLON

Roger Goodell and How to ‘Solve Racism’

Mr. Colbert also went after the N.F.L. commissioner, Roger Goodell, who appears to be taking steps to prevent players from kneeling in protest during the national anthem.

“Goodell sent a letter to all N.F.L. teams saying that ‘the controversy over the anthem is a barrier to having honest conversations and making real progress on the underlying issues.’ Yeah, come on, guys. That protest you’re doing to get us to talk about racism is keeping us from talking about racism! How are we supposed to fix the problem if you keep reminding us what the problem is?” — STEPHEN COLBERT “Now, standing for the national anthem isn’t official N.F.L. policy yet, but ‘team owners will discuss a plan when they meet next week.’ Well, that’s a relief. If a room full of rich, white men can’t solve racism, nobody can.” — STEPHEN COLBERT, quoting a Washington Post article from Tuesday

The Punchiest Punchlines (Fetal-Position Edition)

“Apparently, over the summer, Donald Trump met with top military officials and said he wanted a nearly tenfold increase in the nuclear arsenal. A tenfold increase? Excuse me while I one-fold into the fetal position.” — STEPHEN COLBERT “A painting of Jesus by the master Leonardo da Vinci has been rediscovered, and experts say it could fetch up to $100 million at auction. Yeah, and this is interesting: Jesus Christ is both the subject of painting and what everyone screamed when they heard how much it was going to cost.” — JAMES CORDEN

The Bits Worth Watching

Amy Hoggart of “Full Frontal” looked into how Finland fought against Russian purveyors of fake news.

How about some mustard by hand? “No, I’m good, dude.”

What We’re Excited About on Thursday Night

Bill Murray will talk to Mr. Colbert on Thursday night. A known man of mystery, Mr. Murray this week gave a performance of dramatic readings accompanied by classical virtuosos at Symphony Center in Chicago. What will he cook up on “The Late Show”?

WASHINGTON — An American woman and her family who have been held hostage by militants in Afghanistan for five years have been freed, ending a case that has long frustrated diplomats and F.B.I. agents involved in trying to secure their release, according to people familiar with the situation.

The family was in Pakistan early Thursday, and the White House was preparing to release a statement once they are safely in American hands, according to people who described their status on condition of anonymity because the details have not yet been made public.

Media in the region reported that the Pakistani military had initially taken custody of the family.

The family was freed with the help of another country, the person said, but it was not clear what if any concessions were made to the Haqqani network, the Taliban faction that had seized Caitlan Coleman, 31, and her Canadian husband, Josh Boyle, 34.

He has struck out 22 and given up only two unearned runs in 14 innings this postseason.

Ever since Strasburg was labeled the next great pitching prodigy as the top pick in the 2009 draft, outsized expectations have followed. He has met some, but not all, of them, being named to three All-Star teams. He has had to deal with Tommy John surgery, a perception early in his career that he wilted when errors occurred behind him in the field and the sense that he was extremely particular, almost fussy, about his preparation for games.

And then came the uproar that arose on Tuesday when Dusty Baker said that Strasburg would miss Game 4 because he was “under the weather.”

In the end, however sick he still may have felt, he pitched superbly and earned the gratitude of his teammates. “For him to be able to cowboy up tonight and do his job and go out there — it shows how much of a great teammate he is and a warrior,” Nationals right fielder Bryce Harper said.

For much of Game 4, Strasburg protected a 1-0 lead, with the run scoring on a two-out fielding error by Cubs shortstop Addison Russell in the top of the third. Jake Arrieta started for the Cubs, but Jon Lester came on to pitch several innings as Manager Joe Maddon tried to keep it a one-run game.

But Maddon then took out Lester with a runner on and two outs in the top of the eighth, and turned to Carl Edwards Jr. to get the last out of the inning. Things went awry when Edwards walked the next two batters so out went Edwards and in came the Cubs’ closer, Wade Davis, to pitch to center fielder Michael Taylor.

But Davis, too, was off. His second offering was a fastball down the middle that Taylor used his strength to power into the basket over the ivy in right field for a grand slam. It was only the second grand slam — and the first since 2013 — that Davis has allowed in his nine-year career, including the postseason.

“I was kind of numb just running around the bases,” Taylor said. “Honestly, I didn’t think it was going to get out the way the wind was blowing in.”

That, in effect, decided the game, and left the Nationals headed toward their third Game 5 in a first-round playoff series in the last six years. They lost the previous two — to the St. Louis Cardinals in 2012 and the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2016.

Indeed, the city of Washington has not had a World Series champion since 1924, when its team was the Senators, not the Nationals. And since baseball returned to Washington in 2005, the Nationals have yet to advance past the first round in the postseason. That could change on Thursday.

Regardless they can put behind them the self-inflicted distraction they created over Strasburg’s condition on Tuesday. When Game 4 was rained out that day, it appeared to be a godsend for the Nationals, who could skip the originally scheduled starter, Tanner Roark, and use Strasburg, on regular rest.

Then came Baker’s announcement that Strasburg was ill. But it turned out that Strasburg played catch at Wrigley on Tuesday, raising questions about how sick he really was.

On it went, with General Manager Mike Rizzo then telling reporters hours before the first pitch on Wednesday that Strasburg would start after all. Strasburg, it turned out, had called pitching coach Mike Maddux to say he felt better and to give the team a message: “Just give me the ball.”

“Woke up this morning and I wouldn’t say I felt like great but I felt like I was better than what I was the day before,” Strasburg said. “And so games like this, you have to go out there and give it everything you have, whatever it is.”

And it turned out to be a series-saving performance.","Strasburg Stifles Cubs, and Controversy, as Nationals Even Series",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/sports/baseball/stephen-strasburg-nationals-cubs-game-4.html

Women with high blood pressure in their 40s are at increased risk for dementia in later years, researchers report. But the finding does not hold for men.

Beginning in 1964, investigators collected health and lifestyle information on 5,646 men and women when they were 30 to 35 years old, and again when they were in their 40s. From 1996 to 2015, 532 of them were found to have Alzheimer’s or other forms of dementia. The study is in Neurology.

Hypertension in women in their 30s was not associated with dementia. But women who were hypertensive at an average age of 44 had a 68 percent higher risk for dementia than those who had normal blood pressure at that age, even after adjusting for B.M.I., smoking and other risk factors.

Pearson of Canada told a group of American students in 1963. The quote, reprinted in the June 10th issue of The New York Times of that year, still rings true today, especially as a Canadian like myself goes through thousands of images of Canada from the newspaper’s archives.

Earlier this year, the Ryerson Image Center in Toronto received a donation of 24,804 images from a collector, Chris Bratty, who had purchased the collection with the intention of donating it. Selected by a team led by two gallerists, Steven Kasher and Stephen Bulger, the pictures range from World War I to the late 1990s, from hockey players to lumberjacks. A selection is currently on view in an exhibition at the center and in a book, both entitled “The Faraway Nearby.”

“When I heard of the collection, I immediately wanted to acquire it,” said Paul Roth, an American who is the center’s director. “For all the strengths of our holdings — including the Black Star and the Berenice Abbott archives — we don’t have a tremendous amount of Canadian photojournalism. This helps us fill that gap. And, since it comes from a major U.S. newspaper, it brings up the question of how one country covers another, which fits within our mandate of interrogating different aspects of the medium.”

The expected tropes are there: Canada as a winter wonderland; as a safe, polite neighbor who reveres hockey. But there are also images that challenge them: Canada the diplomat having lighthearted meetings with America’s foes. In one photo, Nikita S. Khrushchev laughs at a joke told by Mr. Pearson — the opposite of the famous “Kitchen Debate” moment by Elliott Erwitt, in which then-Vice President Richard Nixon castigates the Soviet leader. In another, Fidel Castro holds Prime Minister Pierre-Elliott Trudeau’s youngest son, Michel Charles-Émile, during a four-day state visit. Or, Canada the troubled young nation deploying the Army to confront Quebec’s sometimes-violent calls for independence.

“The type of coverage we see speaks of a dual fascination between how familiar Canada feels, and yet how unfamiliar it sometimes appears,” Mr. Roth surmised. “I suspect that The New York Times had to ponder how to cover a country that was so close. Should they concentrate on the differences or highlight the similarities? When stories involved people or goods crossing the border, which was often the case, were they to be considered national or international news?”

Besides snow and hockey, evidence of Canada’s subordination to the British monarchy seemed of particular interest. The New York Times dedicated space daily to Princess Elizabeth’s first tour of Canada in 1951 (Slide 9) and continued to chronicle the royal family’s subsequent visits.

Mr. Trudeau also drew a lot of attention, more than any of his predecessors and successors, that is, until his son Justin ran for the same office and won in 2015. A reproduction of a spread published during the 1972 election is revealing. Within “The World” section, the article isn’t under a rubric with the country’s name, as is customary, but simply “Trudeau,” and a headline declaring “A Swinger Shows His Sober Side.” A full column is dedicated to a collage of images showing the candidate dancing, riding a motorcycle, playing hockey and pedaling a unicycle before concluding with a somber close-up portrait.

Mounting the exhibition, Denise Birkhofer — an American who recently settled in Toronto and co-curated the show with Gerald McMaster, an Indigenous Canadian of Plains Cree and Blackfoot descent — pondered how The New York Times’s fondness for certain subjects and visual archetypes might have shaped a national identity. That’s hard to answer, partly because of the variety of photographers who contributed to the paper’s Canadian coverage.

“There’s a multiplicity of voices that came together to shape the perception of Canada that The New York Times then shared with its readers,” she said. “Not all were Americans. Sometimes staff photographers were sent to cover a story, but other times it came from local publications or freelancers. There were also images made by Canadian agencies or corporations, such as the National Film Board and the Canadian Pacific Railway.”

Photo

Most surprisingly, during World War I, the images the paper used to showcase Canada’s participation in the war effort were supplied by Canadian entities, whose work had to be vetted by the nation’s official censors. Its goal was to avoid criticism of military endeavors by showing the conflict in a romanticized light. In other words, said Gaëlle Morel, the Ryerson Image Center exhibitions curator, “The New York Times — a private commercial enterprise — obeyed the censorship requirements of a foreign country.” In other words, the country’s image, as seen in The Times, reflected an official, sanitized perspective.

Mr. Roth said the collection has greater meaning given Canada’s sesquicentennial this year. “More than a time for celebration and patriotism, it is an occasion to think about complicated questions relating to the identity of the nation,” he said. “All countries should be interested in how they’re viewed by other states. We should strive to get past the mythologies that are created to promote tourism or to reinforce patriotic values, especially nowadays. Doing so requires unpacking widely held cultural assumptions. And that’s exactly what we can do thanks to this archive. While it doesn’t tell a single story, it does help us understand what the Canadian mythologies are.”

Over the next three years covering the war, she built an exceptional body of work: surviving and documenting a capture by the North Vietnamese Army, parachuting in combat operations with the 173rd Airborne, and being published on the covers of major magazines, including Life and Paris Match.

She was also the only female photojournalist then working in Vietnam, after the death of Dickey Chapelle, who was killed by a grenade in 1965.

Ms. Leroy wrote over 100 letters home during her three years in Vietnam, one almost every 10 days, and they show how she was processing her experiences and navigating professional challenges. They are candid and revealing, attesting to her resiliency, exposing insecurities, and showing her in moments of triumph, despair, optimism or courage.

Despite her many strong images, Ms. Leroy had remained relatively unknown, partly because she wasn’t a self-promoter, and partly because women photographers have often been excluded from the medium’s history, especially war photography. Now a selection of those letters are featured on a new website, accompanied by some of her archive and details from her life. It will be followed by the documentary “Cathy at War” by the writer and filmmaker Jacques Menasche.

Most of the letters are to her mother, Denise, focusing at first on topics that read like holiday postcards – gifts she hoped to send home, people she met, her tan. To her father, Jean, she wrote mostly about business — publications that bought her work, logistics and future plans. She frequently reassures them, noting in one letter to her mother that “if anything happens to me, you’ll be informed within 24 hours. So don’t worry if I sometimes leave you without any news.”

Her tone changed over time. In the early letters, she was unsure whether she should stay or go home, even as she felt less insecure about her technical skills. She spoke of the relationships she was forming with the military and about daily life. On Sept. 4, 1966, a few months after her initial arrival, she wrote to her mother:

I celebrated my 22nd birthday at the Da Nang press office in the company of lots of Marines. I had left Saigon a few days earlier with an AP reporter for an operation near the DMZ. On this occasion he opened a bottle of French champagne when we got back. I only got back last night, Saturday, very tired…I’m getting an iron reputation with the marines. I’m very proud of it. I’m leaving tomorrow, Tuesday, morning for the Delta. Subject: a village a few days from the election. The war seems to be calming down, as always happens just before political events. The Delta is the key region. I’ll stay there two or three days. After that, I don’t know. I’m preparing a few photos of me taken in various locations and will send them to you. I haven’t forgotten your wig, I’ll take care of it too. Don’t be angry with me. I’m always away: back in Saigon for two days, get something cleaned, tidy up, wash, everything is dirty.

As her confidence grew, she wrote about her professional successes. But the letters also showed low moments, like being unable to get the pictures she wanted in the field or leaving an envelope of her best prints in a taxi after fending off a robbery attempt from the driver.

The letters testify to the challenges women encountered in the field. While there were female journalists in Vietnam, Ms. Leroy was the only woman photographer after Chapelle’s death, and faced resistance from the military and male journalists. Robert Pledge, president of the board of the Catherine Leroy Fund, a not-for-profit organization in Paris dedicated to her work, said many prominent photojournalists questioned why a young woman wanted to cover war.

She wrote about how people were nice when they first thought she was an unintimidating, five-foot-tall, pigtailed girl. But when they realized she was a serious photographer, their opinions changed. “Many were very, very negative and very nasty with her,” said Mr. Pledge, who is also co-founder and director of Contact Press Images.

Writing to her father on May 13, 1967, after noting her successes in being published in leading magazines, she marveled how “I’m getting telegrams from people who I didn’t know existed for years, while at the same time I’m hated more than ever by known and unknown enemies in Saigon, American civilians, as well as servicemen in Saigon.”

One photographer told Mr. Pledge that the male photographers “were really nasty chauvinistic pigs.” That same photographer, who now is a filmmaker, called her late in life to apologize.

Still, she found the opportunities available to her in Vietnam surpassed anything back home in France. Like parachuting with the 173rd Airborne Brigade — the 85th jump she had taken in her life, after receiving her parachuting license as a teenager.

“I am the first woman to jump in Vietnam during this first operational jump by American parachutists since the war began,” she wrote to her father on Feb. 23, 1967. “I’m very proud to have jumped with the Americans here, it’s a big professional success in every way. I now know that I will be able to work in the United Sates one day without too much problem.” She wrote how she planned to submit her work to major competitions. “I’ve always thought I should succeed because I never gave in,” she continued.

Many consider Ms. Leroy as the most daring of all photographers in Vietnam, and she most likely spent the most time in combat because she needed the money. Being broke meant traveling with soldiers, sharing rations and sleeping in the countryside.

As Mr. Pledge noted, “If Robert Capa was saying that it’s not good enough because it’s not close enough — she was very close.”

And it could have far-reaching political effects, including the Mexican general election in July 2018 and Mr. Trump’s own re-election campaign.

Business leaders have become spooked by the increasing odds of the trade deal’s demise, and on Monday, more than 310 state and local chambers of commerce sent a letter to the administration urging the United States to remain in Nafta. Speaking in Mexico on Tuesday, the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Thomas J. Donohue, said the negotiations had “reached a critical moment. And the chamber has had no choice but ring the alarm bells.”

“Let me be forceful and direct,” he said. “There are several poison pill proposals still on the table that could doom the entire deal.”

The potential demise of the trade deal prompted supportive messages from labor unions, including the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the United Steelworkers, as well as some Democrats.

“Any trade proposal that makes multinational corporations nervous is a good sign that it’s moving in the right direction for workers,” said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio.

If the deal does fall apart, the United States, Canada and Mexico would revert to average tariffs that are relatively low — just a few percent in most cases. But several agricultural products would face much higher duties. American farmers would see a 25 percent tariff on shipments of beef, 45 percent on turkey and some dairy products, and 75 percent on chicken, potatoes and high fructose corn syrup sent to Mexico.

For months, some of the most powerful business leaders in the country, and the lobbies and political figures that represent them, had hoped that the president’s strong wording was more a negotiating tactic than a real threat and that he would ultimately go along with their agenda of modernization. Nafta is nearly a quarter-century old, and people across the political spectrum say it should be updated for the 21st century while preserving the open trading system that has linked the North American economy.

The pact has allowed industries to reorganize their supply chains around the continent to take advantage of the three countries’ differing resources and strengths, lifting the continent’s economies and more than tripling America’s trade with Canada and Mexico since its inception. Economists contend that many workers have benefited from these changes in the form of higher wages and employment, but many workers have lost their jobs as manufacturing plants relocated to Mexico or Canada, making Nafta a target of labor unions, many Democrats and a few industries.

But most business leaders had hoped that the president, whose Nafta criticism has been unrelenting, would be content to oversee tweaks to modernize the agreement, and then call it a political transformation.

It sometimes looked as if that might be the case. The appointment of Robert Lighthizer as United States trade representative, who pledged in his confirmation hearing to “do no harm” to Nafta, reassured many on Capitol Hill, where Mr. Lighthizer had long served in aide roles. And when the administration released its negotiating goals in July for the deal, they echoed many priorities of previous administrations.

But now, eight weeks into trade talks that were originally supposed to conclude by year’s end, the administration continues to push for concessions that the business community warns would essentially undermine the pact, and which few observers believe Canada and Mexico could agree to politically.

“Everyone knows that much of what is being proposed in key areas are, in effect, non-starters, which begs the question as to what, exactly, the administration is trying to achieve,” Michael Camuñez, a former assistant secretary of commerce under President Barack Obama, wrote in an email. It’s not unreasonable to think that by accommodating the president’s most extreme positions, American negotiators are “simply giving Trump cover to do what he really wants: withdraw from the agreement,” he said.

Phil Levy, a trade adviser for the George W. Bush administration, said the president was most likely looking for a pretext to kill Nafta.

“Find me the last trade agreement that U.S. passed with the chamber in opposition,” Mr. Levy said. “You don’t have a chance. It’s hard enough with the U.S. Chamber in favor.”

The most controversial of the administration’s proposals, floated by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, would incorporate a sunset clause in the deal, causing Nafta to automatically expire unless all three countries voted periodically to continue it. That provision has drawn swift condemnation from the chamber and other industry groups like the National Association of Manufacturers, which say that it would instill so much uncertainty in the future of Nafta that it would basically nullify the trade agreement.

Another contentious push by the United States centers on changing Nafta’s rules governing how much of a product needs to be made in North America in order to enjoy tariff-free trade between the countries. The United States is pushing for higher levels, including a requirement to make 85 percent of the value of automobiles and auto parts in North America, up from 62.5 percent currently, and an additional requirement for 50 percent of the value to come from the United States.

That has pitted some of the world’s biggest auto companies against the Trump administration. Industry representatives say such high and complex barriers could deter companies from manufacturing in the United States altogether.

The administration has also proposed limits on the number of federal government contracts that Mexican and Canadian companies can win, as well as significant changes to how disputes are resolved under Nafta.

Business groups say they are firmly opposed to an American push to curtail a provision called investor-state dispute settlement, which allows companies to sue Canada, Mexico and the United States for unfair treatment under Nafta. Meanwhile, Canada has said that it will not consider dispensing with another provision, Nafta’s Chapter 19, which allows countries to challenge each other’s anti-dumping and countervailing duty decisions before an independent panel.

In his remarks Tuesday, Mr. Donohue called the administration’s proposed changes to these provisions “unnecessary and unacceptable.”

Mr. Donohue’s remarks followed a sharp exchange of words between the Chamber of Commerce, the country’s most powerful business lobby, and the Trump administration on Friday.

John Murphy, senior vice president of international policy for the chamber, said the administration’s proposals had “no identifiable constituency backing them” and had sparked “a remarkable degree of unity in their rejection.” He added that business leaders had perhaps never been at odds with an administration over a trade negotiation on so many fronts.

Hours later, the administration fired back.

“The president has been clear that Nafta has been a disaster for many Americans, and achieving his objectives requires substantial change,” said Emily Davis, a spokeswoman for the trade representative. “These changes of course will be opposed by entrenched Washington lobbyists and trade associations. We have always understood that draining the swamp would be controversial in Washington.”

Mr. Trump is known for taking a tough negotiating stance, and analysts said the administration might view its ambitious opening requests as a way to gain more leverage in the Nafta negotiations.

But Mr. Murphy and others in the business community cautioned that such an approach would probably be ill-fated. In both Canada and Mexico, Mr. Trump is unpopular, and caving to his demands could have devastating consequences for local politicians. Mexican government officials have repeatedly said they would not negotiate with a gun to the head.

“There’s an old adage in negotiations, never take a hostage you wouldn’t shoot,” Mr. Murphy said.",Trump’s Tough Talk on Nafta Raises Prospects of Pact’s Demise,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/business/economy/nafta-trump.html

The introduction of new association plans could take much longer, according to insurers and other experts.
While association health plans can be well run, they “have had a spotty track record,” said Ms. Owen, the actuary.","“By siphoning off healthy individuals, these junk plans could cannibalize the insurance exchanges,” said Topher Spiro, a vice president of the Center for American Progress, a liberal research and advocacy group. “For older, sicker people left behind in plans regulated under the Affordable Care Act, premiums could increase.”

But to business groups, the executive order offers an opportunity to bind their members together and sell large-group insurance policies that are cheap and attractive. Dirk Van Dongen, the president of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, said that he was delighted with Mr. Trump’s initiative and that his group would seriously consider establishing an association health plan.

“Small to midsize businesses have very little leverage in the insurance market,” Mr. Van Dongen said. “Anything that allows them to amalgamate their purchasing power will be helpful.”

Large employer-sponsored health plans are generally subject to fewer federal insurance requirements than small group plans and coverage purchased by individuals and families on their own. They are generally not required to provide “essential health benefits,” such as emergency services, maternity and newborn care, mental health coverage and substance abuse treatment, although many do.

A decision by Obama appointees in 2011 discouraged the use of association health plans as a substitute for Affordable Care Act policies because officials feared they would be used to circumvent the law’s coverage mandates. The Obama administration said that coverage offered to dozens or hundreds of small businesses through a trade or professional association would not be treated as a single large employer health plan for the purpose of insurance regulation.

Instead, the Obama administration said, the government would look at the size of each business participating in the association, so that many small employers would still be subject to stringent federal rules.

The Trump administration, by contrast, wants to make it easier for small businesses to buy less expensive plans that do not comply with some requirements of the 2010 law.

Several states considered bills to treat health plans offered to small employers through a trade association as large-group coverage, exempt from federal rules that apply to small businesses. But the Obama administration blocked those efforts, saying they were pre-empted by the Affordable Care Act. Trump administration officials are reconsidering that interpretation, in view of the president’s vow to increase access to less expensive insurance.

Large-group plans are still subject to some requirements of the Affordable Care Act. They generally must cover children up to age 26 on their parents’ plans, cannot impose lifetime limits on covered benefits and cannot charge co-payments for preventive services like mammograms and colonoscopies.

But they are generally exempt from the requirements to provide a specified package of benefits and to cover a certain percentage of the cost of covered services.

The Trump administration is also looking for ways to ease restrictions on short-term health insurance plans that do not meet requirements of the Affordable Care Act. Under a rule issued last October by the Obama administration, the duration of such short-term plans, purchased by hundreds of thousands of people seeking inexpensive insurance, must be less than three months. The rules previously said “less than 12 months.”

The Obama administration said some insurers were abusing short-term plans and keeping healthier consumers out of the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. People are buying these short-term plans as their “primary form of health coverage,” and some insurers are pitching the products to healthier people, the Obama administration said.

But Trump administration officials say that with insurance premiums soaring in many states, consumers should be able to buy less comprehensive, less expensive coverage as an alternative to conventional plans. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said short-term policies “serve an important purpose for consumers” who are between jobs.

That has some insurance experts worried. The influx of a set of plans exempt from the Affordable Care Act rules will essentially divide the market and make it increasingly unstable, said Rebecca Owen, a health research actuary with the Society of Actuaries.

People who want or need broad coverage could find it increasingly difficult to obtain an affordable policy, experts say. While the administration’s goal may be to give people a broader choice of plans, it could have the opposite effect on people who need or want the robust coverage available under the Affordable Care Act.

“The easier you make it not to buy comprehensive coverage, the harder you make it to buy comprehensive coverage,” said Katherine Hempstead, a health policy expert at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

As they waited for details of the executive order, health insurers still offering coverage in the online marketplaces created by the health care law were apprehensive.

Those insurers are most jittery about the possibility of a surge in short-term plans. Many of the large national insurers, like UnitedHealth Group, already offer these plans, and there would be little difficulty in their introducing more because of the executive order, analysts said.

“They can cobble these things together pretty easily,” said John Graves, a health policy expert at Vanderbilt University.

Individuals may already be attracted to short-term plans because of their low costs. These plans tend to limit benefits or offer policies only to people who do not have expensive medical conditions.

Short-term policies do not satisfy the coverage requirements of the Affordable Care Act, so consumers who buy them may be subject to tax penalties. But with the price of conventional insurance policies rising at double-digit rates, some people say they are willing to pay a penalty so they can buy a cheaper plan.

The introduction of new association plans could take much longer, according to insurers and other experts. The administration would need to work out the regulatory details, and groups would need to construct those plans.

But these plans pose some of the same risks, and industry experts warn that they have a history of leaving consumers with unpaid medical bills if they are not adequately regulated.

While association health plans can be well run, they “have had a spotty track record,” said Ms. Owen, the actuary. In the past, some plans failed because they did not have enough money to pay their customers’ medical bills, while some insurance companies were accused of misleading people about exactly what the plans would cover.","Foiled in Congress, Trump Moves on His Own to Undermine Obamacare",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/us/politics/trump-obamacare-executive-order.html

Some wondered if they were an adaptation to pollution — like the peppered moths of Britain’s Industrial Age. But Mr. DuBay and Carl Fuldner, a graduate student in art history at the University of Chicago and a co-author, used a special microscope to look closely at the feathers. They were just dirty — dusted in the same tiny particles of black carbon that were there a hundred years ago.

The team realized this dirty mess was a beautiful opportunity. Birds molt every year, so grimy feathers contained no more than a year’s worth of black carbon. With enough samples, they could place these birds back in their historical context.

They quantified the sootiness by taking pictures of the chests of sparrows, woodpeckers, larks and towhees and measuring how well they reflected light. Black carbon isn’t very reflective — which is why it’s been a problem in the environment. It absorbs sunlight and generates heat, leading to alterations in cloud cover and precipitation or acceleration of the melting of snow and ice.

The team found that dirty feathers corresponded to historical reports and other atmospheric measurements — and they were more localized in time and space. They hope that scientists and policy makers can use the data to inform climate models and environmental policy. And the birds, once dead and void of context in museum drawers, now play a part in environmental history.

Mr. DuBay and Mr. Fuldner have more questions: Did soot affect the health of birds and other wildlife, as it has in humans? Did the dirt alter their reproductive strategies? And could birds in other industrialized nations of the past and present like England or China, also reveal hidden measures of air pollution?

“These collections are hidden treasures, and who knows what other questions we’ll be able to ask by getting into these museums and exploring,” Mr. DuBay said.",The Dirty Secrets Saved in Dead Birds’ Feathers,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/science/birds-air-pollution.html

The broad debate over President Trump’s fitness for the difficult and demanding office he holds has recently been reframed in a more pointed and urgent way: Does he understand, and can he responsibly manage, the most destructive nuclear arsenal on earth?

The question arises for several reasons. He has threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea. He has reportedly pressed for a massive buildup in the American nuclear arsenal, which already contains too many — 4,000 — warheads. And soon he will decide whether to sustain or set a course to possibly unravel the immensely important Iran nuclear deal.

Doubts about his competency were reinforced this week by Senator Bob Corker, who charged that Mr. Trump was treating his office like “a reality show” with reckless threats that could set the nation “on the path to World War III.” Mr. Corker, a Republican from Tennessee, says he is relying on Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and John Kelly, the White House chief of staff, to help “separate our country from chaos.” That is a searing indictment, and Mr. Corker is no garden-variety legislator; as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he is a respected, and largely responsible, voice on national security issues.

Mr. Trump’s policy pronouncements during the campaign betrayed either profound ignorance or dangerous nonchalance: At one point he wondered why America had nuclear weapons if it didn’t use them; at another he suggested that Japan and South Korea, which have long lived under the American security umbrella, should develop their own nuclear weapons.

THURSDAY PUZZLE — Do you ever feel your jaw immediately hit the ground the moment you look at a grid for the first time? Well, that was certainly the case for me today. Joe Krozel has been known to create some inventive puzzles in the past, and this one was no exception.

There’s a black square pattern resembling an animal in the grid’s center, and yet, the triple-stacked, nine-letter answers in the top-left corner make it appear to be themeless. And those orphaned five letters at 35A? What exactly is going on?

Today’s Theme

Turns out that Mr. Krozel wants us to put on our blindfolds to understand this theme. The revealer, 44D, indicates that the figure in the center is a PIÑATA. This also explains the black squares that connect to it; they represent the piñata’s thread.

Yet how are we supposed to nail 35A without any crossings to check? Take a look at the notepad accompanying the puzzle:

“Two letters of the alphabet are missing from the main, connected portion of the completed grid. What are they? The answer goes, appropriately, at 35-Across.”

A thorough scan of the grid conveys that every letter of the alphabet has been used at least once except for C and Y. Hold up. C. AND. Y. CANDY!

Yet, that’s what Eugénie Shinkle discovered when she began researching it almost a decade ago.

“My fascination for fashion photography emerged because of my complete disbelief at how widely ignored the genre was in academia,” said Ms. Shinkle, a reader in photography at the University of Westminster, London. “Apart from a handful of exceptions, there was a real reluctance amongst scholars to engage with it in a serious way,” she said. “Unapologetically commercial, it had been reduced to ‘only advertising.’ And, until recently — that is until it started appearing in galleries — it was considered to be ephemeral. Because it wasn’t meant to last and because it wasn’t created with any kind of critical or artistic intent, people didn’t believe its history should be approached in that way.”

After publishing “Fashion as Photograph: Viewing and Reviewing Images of Fashion” in 2008, which examined why the genre deserves intellectual scrutiny, she’s now releasing “Fashion Photography: The Story in 180 Pictures,” a compendium of important figures who help chart the genre’s evolution. From Camille Silvy, a diplomat turned studio photographer in the 1850s, to the contemporary creative couple of Maurice Scheltens and Liesbeth Abbenes, who specialize in abstract still lives, the volume published by Aperture chronicles various movements and turning points.

“The history of fashion photography is the history of a growing confidence in its ability to comment explicitly on the wider world,” Ms. Shinkle noted. “Initially, it was reluctant to engage explicitly with politics, but since the end of the ’60s it has become more openly, overtly and unabashedly political.”

After World War II, photographers like Henry Clarke subtly alluded to the changing role of women in society by portraying them as “independent and in control,” writes Ms. Shinkle. Artists like William Klein parodied fashion conventions and encouraged his peers to engage in self-criticism. Even Richard Avedon proved to be a revelation: “I learned to appreciate his depth and talent by seeing how he was able to reinvent himself halfway through his career and noticing how ardently he campaigned for the use of models of color. Creatively, and politically, he’s one of the most important fashion photographers of the 20th century.”

By the ’90s, thanks in no small part to the nonconformist British magazine “The Face,” the grunge movement — which challenged gender norms, capitalism and the ideals of social respectability — appeared in mainstream publications and paved the way for today’s more cerebral work. Collier Schorr’s images, for example, question gender fluidity, notions of desire and how identity is constructed, while Chen Man speaks up creatively about China’s complexities.

Looking at the people in the volume, it also become more apparent how conservative the industry has been. Most photographers listed are Western-educated white men. This is due in part to the author’s and publisher’s decision to keep close reins on what was considered a primer. “We focused on the West because that’s where the major fashion houses and publications have historically been located,” Ms. Shinkle said. “I had to make that decision early on. Did I want to include more vernacular practices like that of Cameroonian photographer Samuel Fosso, who has been doing amazing fashion-inspired work since the ’70s? Or, did I want to restrict it to so-called pure fashion photography?”

In doing so, she revealed how difficult it has been for traditionally marginalized groups to be taken seriously. Case in point: Women, in the early 20th century, were rarely behind the camera. Yva, Madame D’Ora and Toni Frissell were trailblazers working “at a time when that was not what a well-bred women did, because photography was seen as a technical job.” To showcase them and highlight their technical prowess and unique perspectives is to revise history, which too often ignored them. Similarly, the inclusion of the Harlem Renaissance photographer James Van Der Zee, well known in the African-American community, but virtually unknown at the time outside of it, “points out how exclusive and white-centric the industry was in those years.”

While there’s now a more diverse roster, there’s still a long way to go. “Fashion photography is a most fantastic barometer of the time,” Ms. Shinkle said. “It’s representative and it popularizes certain tendencies in ways that no other type of photography can because it’s so ubiquitous.”

An earlier version of this article misstated the academic title held by Ms. Shinkle. She is a reader in photography, not a professor of Photographic Theory and Criticism.

“I still think it’s the best thing on the table right now,” she said of the stopgap plan.","In Des Moines on Tuesday, Gov. Kim Reynolds told reporters that her team was in constant contact with the White House and C.M.S. about the plan, including a call with Ms. Verma this week, trying “to get to yes.” She said the administration has been “very receptive” to the plan as a solution to the “unaffordable,” “unworkable” health law until it can be repealed.

Iowa calls its request a stopgap plan that would allow the state to opt out of the federal health insurance marketplace, HealthCare.gov, for 2018 and create a state-run system that its insurance commissioner says would lower premiums for the 72,000 Iowans who currently have Obamacare health plans, including 28,000 who earn too much to get subsidies to help with the cost.

But the cheaper premiums would come with a big trade-off: higher out-of-pocket costs. The only option for customers would be a plan with deductibles of $7,350 for a single person and $14,700 for a family. The proposal would also reallocate millions of federal dollars that the health law dedicates to lowering costs for people with modest incomes and use the money for premium assistance to those with higher incomes, no matter how much money they make.

The individual insurance market is particularly fragile in Iowa, partly because the state has allowed tens of thousands of people to keep old plans that do not meet the health law’s standards. Aetna and Wellmark Blue Cross & Blue Shield, the state’s most popular insurer, are both withdrawing at the end of the year. The only insurer planning to remain, Medica, is seeking premium increases that average 56 percent, blaming Mr. Trump’s ongoing threats to stop paying subsidies known as cost-sharing reductions that lower many people’s deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs. Wellmark has said it will stay if the stopgap plan is approved.

“What we are trying to address is a really large number of people being priced out,” said Doug Ommen, the state’s Republican insurance commissioner.

Two other states, Alaska and Minnesota, have already won permission to shore up their Obamacare markets with waivers allowed under the law; they will use federal money to help insurers cover the claims of their most expensive customers next year. But Oklahoma abruptly withdrew a similar request in late September — one that state officials said would have reduced premiums by an average of 30 percent — saying that the Trump administration had reneged on a promise to approve it by Sept. 25 and they were out of time. (A C.M.S. spokeswoman said, “At no time was an approval package or an approval date ever agreed upon.”)

Iowa’s waiver request is more far-reaching, providing what Timothy S. Jost, an emeritus professor of health law at Washington and Lee University, has called a “watershed moment” for Obamacare.

“It’s a decision to abandon a number of key principles of the Affordable Care Act,” he said.

Under the law, people who don’t get insurance through work can buy it through the online marketplace. They get federal subsidies to help with the cost if their income is below 400 percent of the poverty level, or about $65,000 a year for a couple. Those whose incomes are below 250 percent of the poverty level — $40,600 a year for a couple — also get cost-sharing reductions.

Iowa’s plan would reallocate much of that federal assistance, using it to provide premium subsidies based on age and income for even the wealthiest individual market customers. It would also be used to create a “reinsurance” program, like Alaska’s and Minnesota’s, to help insurers cover their sickest customers. The law’s essential health benefits and protections for people with pre-existing conditions would remain in place, but every individual market customer would get the same standardized high-deductible plan.

Mr. Jost and other supporters of the law say Iowa’s proposal does not meet the requirements for so-called innovation waivers, including that the coverage they provide must be at least as comprehensive and affordable as Obamacare plans, because poorer people would face higher deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs. That, they say, leaves the plan open to almost-certain legal challenges.

Seemingly acknowledging that problem, Mr. Ommen has tweaked Iowa’s proposal — including with a supplemental filing to the Trump administration on Thursday — to preserve subsidies that reduce out-of-pocket costs for roughly 21,000 low-income Iowans.

But those at slightly higher income levels would lose cost-sharing assistance completely, facing the $7,350 deductible and other out-of-pocket expenses.

“You still have some real problems from the perspective of making sure low-income people can afford coverage,” said Joel Ario, a managing director at Manatt Health who worked on the Affordable Care Act at the Department of Health and Human Services during the Obama administration.

But for the roughly 28,000 Iowans who have Obamacare coverage but earn too much to get subsidies, the need for a shake-up is urgent. And with open enrollment starting in about three weeks, time is of the essence.

Dozens of them, including many farmers, submitted comments to Mr. Ommen or testified at public hearings in favor of the stopgap plan, with many saying they would be forced to drop their insurance next year if it were not approved.

“Fortunately both my husband and I have already prepaid our funeral expenses,” write a woman identified as Nancy K., of Bellevue, who said she could no longer afford her coverage. “Every single item, even our cemetery marker, is paid for or covered for my death in the event that we cannot afford insurance to pay for any so-called catastrophic health care.”

Landi Livingston, whose family raises beef cattle in rural southern Iowa, said she was paying almost $500 a month for a Wellmark plan and dreaded having to switch to Medica next year, with what she assumed would be significantly higher prices.

If the Trump administration approves the state’s request, Ms. Livingston’s premium would likely drop to around $350 a month, according to estimates from the state, saving her $1,800 next year. But her $3,000 deductible would more than double, meaning that if she had high medical expenses she could end up paying more toward those bills.

“I still think it’s the best thing on the table right now,” she said of the stopgap plan. “It’s high time the people in power get this figured out.”

For Tony Ross, a retired paralegal in Des Moines who has a subsidized marketplace plan from Aetna, the stopgap plan would lower his premiums to about $85 a month, from $220, according to the state estimates. But his deductible – currently $750 because his low income qualifies him for cost-sharing reductions – would balloon by almost tenfold. That would mean paying thousands more each year for his expensive blood pressure medication, he said.

“Obviously I need a way lower deductible than $7,350,” said Mr. Ross, 63. “This doesn’t seem like a fair way of fixing things.”","In New Test for Obamacare, Iowa Seeks to Abandon Marketplace",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/health/obamacare-iowa-premiums.html

This kind of intimidation is not new in Northern Ireland, nor does it appear to be on the rise. Around 30 people have declared themselves homeless for similar reasons each year for the past half-decade, according to statistics provided by the Northern Irish government, and this year’s figure of 33 is no departure from that trend.

But the recent episodes at Cantrell Close have made headlines in Northern Ireland because they occurred in a place that was intended to be a foundation stone for a post-sectarian society. It has also raised concerns about certain politicians’ commitment to the process of integration, and about the ability of the Northern Irish police to curb the influence of sectarian paramilitary groups.

“This is a very good illustration of a much deeper problem,” said Stephen Farry, a lawmaker from the Alliance Party, which tries to bridge the divides between the province’s Unionists and nationalist communities. “Northern Ireland is not yet a peaceful society. We have ongoing coercive control by paramilitary structures at a local level across many communities.”

A recent stroll down Cantrell Close, a tiny T-shaped cul-de-sac, did not make this instantly obvious. At first sight, it was a picture of prim, docile suburbia: 41 two-story homes, each with a tidy lawn and a garden fence, lined a quiet road with a shiny bike rack at one end and a speed bump at the other. The tensions became apparent only when you looked toward the sky.

Flying from some of the lampposts were the flags of the Ulster Volunteer Force, or U.V.F., a banned terrorist group that killed more than 400 people during the Northern Irish Troubles, mostly targeting Catholics and Irish nationalists, or those opposed to Northern Ireland remaining part of the United Kingdom.

No faction has claimed responsibility, but the police believe that the threats came from people purporting to be part of the U.V.F. Two men have been questioned in connection to the crime, on suspicion of membership in the group.

The East Belfast Community Initiative, which says it mediates on behalf of former U.V.F. combatants, said the U.V.F. was not involved. Cantrell Close, meanwhile, is just one of many streets in East Belfast lined with the group’s flags.

On Cantrell Close itself, there appears to be an informal omertà in place. Of those who answered their doors on a recent afternoon, none would discuss the threats to their former neighbors.

One man even claimed he knew nothing at all about the situation, his mouth curling into a faint smile.

Some outside the neighborhood have been more outspoken, however, about a culture of impunity that they believe encouraged whoever made the threats.

Before moving in, residents of Cantrell Close signed pledges against the display of controversial flags. The government also says it is illegal to fly the flags of terrorist groups.

Yet when the U.V.F. flags suddenly appeared in June, no action was taken either to find the perpetrators or to remove them, creating the impression that sectarianism would be tolerated even at such a symbolic housing development.

“The police, who you’d expect to lead, didn’t,” said Mairtin O Muilleoir, a lawmaker from Sinn Fein, an Irish nationalist party. “And the gangs were emboldened.”

Local unionist politicians were also perceived to take too weak a stance back in June.

“I’ll always be cautious about causation and correlation,” said Cillian McGrattan, a politics professor at Ulster University. But the reaction of politicians from the Democratic Unionist Party, or D.U.P., to sectarian episodes during the summer, including the Cantrell Close issue, “really left a lot to be desired,” he added.

Asked for comment, Emma Little-Pengelly, one of the party lawmakers facing criticism, said she had been clear in June about her opposition to paramilitary flags. She and a D.U.P. colleague also issued an immediate condemnation of last month’s threats to Catholic residents.

Belfast’s top policeman meanwhile suggested that the flags had not been deemed problematic enough to justify their removal back in June.

“The reality is that while we understand the public’s frustration in this matter, police will only act to remove flags if there are substantial risks to public safety,” Chief Superintendent Chris Noble said in an emailed statement.

(The flags were taken down only several days after the threats were made.)

For the young cook and his fiancée, these explanations mean little. They feel frustrated at the authorities for doing nothing in the first place to remove the flags, which they said were clearly intimidating. They feel abandoned by the police for failing, once the threats were made, to provide a permanent presence on the street.

And they fault the housing authorities for failing to quickly find them alternative accommodations — and for assuring them that the street was safe to move to.

The cook’s fiancée, a 20-year-old waitress, said officials should have recognized her vulnerability as a young mother with a newborn in tow before encouraging her to move in.

Politicians like Mr. O Muilleoir hope the episodes at Cantrell Close will not derail plans for more integrated housing projects. “In Europe in 2017, we either let an armed gang dictate policy,” he said, “or we step things up.”

But for the targeted families themselves, the integration dream is over.

The winds, known as Diablo winds in Northern California and Santa Ana winds further south, have their origin in the high desert of the Great Basin of Nevada and parts of Utah. High-pressure air that builds over that region flows toward lower-pressure air over California and the coast.

Along the way the air descends to lower elevations, which causes it to compress and become hotter and drier. The air picks up speed as it descends and funnels through canyons or across peaks that are lower than their neighbors.

“The wind is seeking the path of least resistance to lower pressure,” Dr. Hall said. “That tends to be where there are gaps in the topography.”

The result is hot, dry winds with speeds that can exceed 70 miles per hour. In the wildfires that have devastated parts of Northern California’s wine country since Sunday night, the highest gusts were recorded in Sonoma County, at 79 m.p.h.

The state got some respite from the winds on Tuesday, but they were expected to pick up again Wednesday and Thursday. Scientists said such variation is typical, as there is natural variability to large-scale climate patterns like high-pressure systems. If the high pressure over the Great Basin moves eastward, for example, the air will be less likely to flow westward, and that may allow cooler, gentler winds to move into California from offshore.",California Winds Are Fueling Fires.

It will also build an unspecified number of fast chargers along roadways, each of which will have several charge units.
ChargePoint, the largest installer of vehicle charging stations in the United States, plans to install 400-kilowatt sites in the coming months.
According to ChargePoint, 80 percent of vehicle charging is currently done at home, and industry executives argue that it’s wrong to think about charging electric cars in the way they envision filling up a gasoline or diesel vehicle.
“Electric vehicles are more like horses than gasoline cars,” said Mr. Romano of ChargePoint.","Two levels of charging are typically available in residential settings. Level 1 is a standard AC outlet that provides between 1 and 1.5 kilowatts of electricity. It takes a Level 1 charger about 30 hours to fully charge the electric version of the Ford Focus, which has a range of 115 miles. Level 2 uses a professionally installed charger connected to a 240-volt AC outlet — the kind used by some large appliances — and delivers between 7 and 9 kilowatts, lowering the charge time to about 5.5 hours.

Some commercial charging locations offer more advanced technology, employing so-called fast chargers. These offer about 50 kilowatts of DC power, enabling the same Ford Focus to reach 90 miles of range in 30 minutes (battery chemistry causes charging to go more slowly after a battery is 80 percent full). The electric carmaker Tesla has a proprietary “supercharger” for its vehicles that provides 120 kilowatts of power, adding 300 miles of range in 75 minutes.

A new generation of charging points, the first of which are being installed in Europe this year, offer 350 kilowatts of power. Such a jump would slash charging times to 10 to 15 minutes, depending on the vehicle’s range, according to Charlie Yankitis, director of business development for the German manufacturer Bosch’s electric vehicle unit. Elon Musk, Tesla’s founder, has hinted that charging at even faster rates was being studied.

Several companies are making big bets on the technology.

Electrify America, the Volkswagen subsidiary, is planning on installing such high-capacity chargers along highway corridors throughout the United States. It is investing $2 billion in electric vehicle charging infrastructure and education nationwide, $800 million of which is earmarked for California alone.

By the end of 2020, Electrify America plans to have built 350 Level 2 charging sites in urban areas in California, like workplaces and apartment buildings. It will also build an unspecified number of fast chargers along roadways, each of which will have several charge units. A further 540 are to be built elsewhere in the country in that time.

ChargePoint, the largest installer of vehicle charging stations in the United States, plans to install 400-kilowatt sites in the coming months. But its chief executive, Pasquale Romano, did not specify how many.

Similar pushes are being made elsewhere. In Europe, the German automotive giants BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen have joined with Ford in a joint venture to install 350-kilowatt chargers across the Continent. They will start installing them this year, initially planning to get 400 fast-charging sites up and running, with “thousands” in place by 2020.

“We’re looking for similar solutions across the globe,” said Mike Tinskey, Ford’s global director of electrification and infrastructure.

There are, however, hurdles that need to be overcome.

For one, standards differ across manufacturers and regions. Today’s commercial chargers use three different kinds of plugs that are not entirely compatible. In practice, a Chevrolet, Nissan or Volkswagen cannot be charged at a Tesla charger. A Tesla, however, can use an adapter plug to charge at standard commercial stations, and Electrify America says its charging stations will be compatible with a variety of plugs.

Another issue: No vehicle on the road today is able to use the 350-kilowatt fast-charging stations. It is not a simple upgrade: High-speed charging requires thicker cables that won’t get too hot.

No automakers have indicated when they will sell cars equipped to accept such fast charges. Porsche’s Mission E electric vehicle is expected to be available by 2020, and will be able to charge to a 250-mile range in 15 minutes, according to the carmaker. Electrify America and ChargePoint say they expect vehicles capable of accepting 350-killowatt chargers to be available by 2019.

Utilities will also have to upgrade their infrastructure, a change for which California is already preparing.

Under the state’s zero emission regulations, every manufacturer must sell a certain number of emission-free vehicles, calculated as a proportion of overall sales. Consequently, California has become the hub for the mass installation of fast charging points. One of the state’s utility companies, Southern California Edison, estimates that 25 percent of its network must be upgraded to support new chargers.

“We hope we’ll be ready for fast charging when Electrify America is ready to install it,” said Caroline Choi, the utility’s senior vice president of regulatory affairs.

For now, the number of charging stations remains relatively low. According to the Department of Energy, there are just over 16,000 public electric vehicle charging points in the United States, offering about 44,000 individual outlets of varying charging speeds. By comparison, there are 120,000 gas stations nationwide, many of which have 10 or more pumps.

So customers will have to stick to charging an electric vehicle whenever it’s not being used, much as they already do with smartphones and tablets.

According to ChargePoint, 80 percent of vehicle charging is currently done at home, and industry executives argue that it’s wrong to think about charging electric cars in the way they envision filling up a gasoline or diesel vehicle.

“He should be talking to reporters.”Over the years, Mr. Weinstein spent as much time schmoozing reporters as he did berating them.
They’re the ones who finally brought the real Mr. Weinstein to light.","At a time when the news media is under financial distress, when billionaires with political agendas or personal grudges, like the Silicon Valley investor Peter Thiel, have shown a willingness to fund lawsuits able to run media entities out of business — as Mr. Thiel did to Gawker — legal threats are newly intimidating.

It is far worse for the victims of those in power, who are all too aware that speaking up may lead to stalled careers and ruined reputations. Many women who have fought back against sleazy, powerful men by filing lawsuits against them often end up with the consolation prize of an out-of-court settlement that comes complete with a nondisclosure agreement dictating that they must remain silent on the matter forevermore or face a steep financial penalty.

In this climate, breaking a story that includes tough accusations against those in high places requires more than a scrappy reporter with a notebook. It means having the resources to work the story exclusively for months. It means withstanding any legal challenges that may come. It means coaxing understandably reluctant victims to speak out against those who have the means and motivation to crush them.

In the days since The New York Times first published an article on Mr. Weinstein that named names and included details of at least eight settlements, a number of reporters and editors have spoken of their own missed chances to write the story earlier. For many journalists, Mr. Weinstein was the white whale that got away.

Bruce Headlam, a former editor for the late Times media columnist David Carr, told me that Mr. Carr twice came close to nailing down a story about abuses committed by Mr. Weinstein. In both cases, the accuser “backed out after agreeing to talk.”

There were similar stories of failed attempts involving Kim Masters of The Hollywood Reporter, Ken Auletta of The New Yorker, Benjamin Wallace of New York magazine and Times reporters.

As David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker, told me on Wednesday, a news organization cannot go after a powerful figure or institution if it does not have the resources for lawyers, fact checkers and experienced editors who won’t be intimidated by the protection racket.

“Journalistic institutions like these are rare and the times, the economic and political times, have made them fragile and essential at the same time,” Mr. Remnick said. “The stakes are very high.”

Publishing aggressive stories like the ones about Mr. Weinstein can be costly in other ways. As The Times’s executive editor, Dean Baquet, told me, “Harvey Weinstein is an advertiser – but that never even crossed my mind.”

Mr. Baquet added that he did not know how much the Weinstein Company spent to advertise its movies in The Times, but the newspaper was too large to be influenced by any amount. “That’s the other thing – you have to have the size and the history to not even take that into account.”

It costs serious money to give two reporters the go-ahead to devote months to an article that may or may not pan out, as The Times did in the case of Mr. Weinstein, especially as legal threats loom.

The threats, however, were combined with a personal touch from Mr. Weinstein, which, Mr. Baquet said, he rebuffed. “Harvey Weinstein a few times reached out to me to talk about the story, and I told him I did not think it was appropriate for him to talk to the executive editor about a story,” Mr. Baquet said. “He should be talking to reporters.”

Over the years, Mr. Weinstein spent as much time schmoozing reporters as he did berating them. A.J. Benza, a former gossip columnist at The Daily News – and, for a time, my colleague on the paper’s “Hot Copy” gossip column – described how Mr. Weinstein would provide him with access to the director Quentin Tarantino or the actress Salma Hayek as they were making their way into Hollywood’s stratosphere. He also provided Mr. Benza with invitations to his famous Oscar parties.

“I’ll put it this way: There’s a certain feeling you get when you’re allowed in those parties and other journalists are on the other side of the rope and can’t get through,” Mr. Benza said.

Tina Brown, with whom Mr. Weinstein started Talk magazine in 1999, wrote this week that the mogul kept a number of his journalists on his good side with sweet consultancy or development deals with Miramax.

“Another of his co-opting tactics,” she wrote for the Women in the World Summit she sponsors with The New York Times, “was to offer a juicy negative nugget about one of the movie stars in his films or people in his media circle (fairly often, me) in a trade to quash a dangerous piece about himself.”

Mr. Weinstein’s expertise in media manipulation was evident after the model Ambra Battilana Gutierrez went to the police with her charge that Mr. Weinstein forced himself on her at his TriBeCa offices in 2015. “Role Play: ‘Grope’ gal asked for movie part,” screamed a front-page New York Post headline above a large photo of Ms. Gutierrez a few days later. (A spokesman for The Post did not respond with a comment.)

DURHAM, N.C. — Forty years ago, when I was living in exile with my family in Amsterdam, my thoughts would often turn to the boys and girls back home in Chile, my small nieces and nephews so far away from us. I would worry how they might be coping with the dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet.

One afternoon those concerns came into sharp relief. Nathalie, the 6-year-old sister of my wife, Angelica, had come from London to visit our small apartment a mile or so away from where Anne Frank had once dreamed of freedom in a Netherlands occupied by the Nazis. Frank’s diary does not mention if she ever played a game that children everywhere indulge in and that Nathalie was enthralled by: She liked to make believe she was the mommy and demanded that our son Rodrigo, who was her nephew, though four years older, be the daddy. The two kids hid inside their “house” (a sheet covering a table that served both as my desk and for our meals), pretending they were adults, and candidly repeated words they had overheard adults uttering.

Such innocence filled me with tenderness and yet also evoked a bizarre sense of dread because I could not help wondering about children like them entertaining themselves in a similar manner in our distant and dangerous Santiago. How would that game be twisted and corrupted if it was enacted by the sons and daughters of parents who were part of the resistance movement, hiding from General Pinochet’s secret police? What secret sorrows and dread would those youngsters express? What had they heard their father and mother discussing in the night when they thought their offspring were asleep, the words that hovered in the air while the children eavesdropped on a potential violent outcome to their existence? What to do if the men who had power over life and death came knocking at the door one dawn? How can they tell who is an enemy and who is a friend?

Those corrosive questions led me to write a story that explored how children might react when thrust into a situation of mortal peril that they can only vaguely understand as they play “waiting for the enemy.” The story was constructed from the perspective of a Chilean boy around Rodrigo’s age who, as he realizes the perils threatening him and his vulnerable family, is obliged to grow up much too fast. When Chile returned to democracy in 1990 and children could return to play the games that others of their age engage in elsewhere without a second thought, I felt relieved that I would never again have to write a story fraught with such daunting events.

53A: Since this puzzle was solving fairly straight, I wasn’t at sufficient goofball level to see how “become lightheaded” could mean GO BLONDE. I figured it out after a few crosses but I think this is also a total gem of a clue.

58A: The first challenge for some of us when encountering “Dress-up at a comic con” might be figuring out the ol’ comic con part. Is this term widely known at this point? New York’s goes back to 2006 and it looks like the San Diego Comic Convention started in 1971. The art of dressing as featured characters is COSPLAY, a term coined in Japan in the ’80s. I would say something about nothing new under the sun, as we’ve been playing masquerade as a species for millenniums, but these costumes are really something else. New York’s con is in less than a week, guys! Come to think of it, maybe Sam has sequestered himself in his sewing room.

23D: Like the above example, this clue, “Secondary personas in role-playing game lingo” called for some knowledge of the way the kids talk. I knew this had to be “avis,” in this case pronounced with a short a, cute and short for “avatars,” and I was wrong. This grid calls for ALTS, and uses a new clue for a chestnut entry.

37D: Who’s been on the cover of British Vogue more than anyone else? One of their brand new contributing editors, natch, and Naomi Campbell didn’t fit. KATE MOSS did.

39D: I couldn’t really wrap my head around the grammar and meaning of “Track prize” for the longest time. At first I was looking for a verb, something like following one’s dream. Then I switched to a trophy or some such award, and it took forever to realize that in this case track was a racetrack, and we were talking about horse races, which get run as STAKES. This seems to be a grande olde worde from when betting folks in the Middle Ages stuck their wager, maybe a fat chicken or cute child, onto a stick and tried their luck.

Constructor Notes

From Crack Teammate #1, M.L.G.:

My seed entry for this themeless was the RIJKSMUSEUM, a place I hope to see in person someday. It was inspired by my visit to a special exhibit at the Dayton Art Institute, Rembrandt and the Golden Age of Dutch Art: Treasures from the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam. My first themeless grid with this seed entry was submitted in July of 2016. I received a rejection in August noting that Will really liked some of the grid fill including this seed entry, but there was too much crosswordese. I asked Jeff for his assistance in reworking the grid. He pointed out I had too many three letter entries. He noted it was best not to go above 12 for a themeless grid. After numerous back and forths using a grid of Jeff’s design we submitted a revised grid a few weeks later. We received an email in November accepting the revised grid. Jeff worked the NYT debut words COSPLAY, MAMA BIRD, BEER BRAT and GO BLONDE into the grid and my contribution in addition to RIJKSMUSEUM, was OBAMA ERA. I was surprised to see the clue we had for TOMY, “Big name in toys headquartered in Japan”, was replaced by the partial TO MY. I did like the edited change of clues for EARS and DJS to “Reception figures” as well as the clue change for HARRY from a name to “Badger”. I hope you’ve enjoyed your Saturday solving experience.

And, from Crack Teammate #2, J.C.:

I like trying multiple dozens of versions of every region within a themeless. Luckily, ML graciously puts up with my OCD about exploring the entire solution space. We saved so many versions that I didn’t remember which one we finally submitted. Thankfully, ML has a good eye for what’s the best trade-off between strong entries and gluey short ones. Looking back on it, I would have tried to open up the NW and SE corners, which feel more disconnected from the rest of the puzzle than I like. It did let us easily try many dozens of versions in each area, but with so few entries connecting everything up, hopefully solvers don’t get stumped on LAKSHMI or RIJKSMUSEUM.

For those of us wondering where the time went this week, here is a little video of a mama robin:

For $80 to $150 per night, per person, you can sleep on a tatami mat on the floor of a traditional guest room in a 1,000-year-old temple, eat the monks’ traditional vegan fare, and participate in the daily meditation and prayer. A few of the temples advertise amenities like sutra writing classes, views of monks raking the gardens below, or natural hot springs to bathe in — features you can’t filter for on Airbnb or Hotels.com. And in the case of many of the temples, you can’t be totally sure what you are getting — an ambiguity that appealed to me in an era when every possible travel destination is so scrupulously documented and Instagrammed.

Although the temples on Koyasan were originally reserved for the most devout pilgrims, Buddhism is famously accepting of other religions. So over the last century, as temples in Japan and elsewhere began to struggle financially with fewer donations coming in, the natural solution was to open the doors a little wider and welcome visitors who were curious about Buddhism.

Reading up on the shukubo options before my trip, I learned that many previous visitors to Koyasan were irked by the simplicity of the lodgings. Some wrote on TripAdvisor.com that their rooms were too cold, or that they could hear their neighbors snoring through the 200-year-old paper walls of the temple. More than one reviewer complained that the multicourse vegan meals were too simple to satiate people who are accustomed to eating meat. “Take snacks or you will starve,” one warned.

Others felt that they weren’t quite receiving a good enough spiritual bang for their buck. “I expected something a bit spiritual and to feel that Zen/Buddhist vibe,” one visitor from Ohio complained, “I have to say I did not feel it.” Some complained that the monks running the temples didn’t speak enough English, or didn’t offer visitors enough individual attention. “The major disappointment came during dinner,” another wrote. “I was expecting to have the opportunity to mingle with the monks.”

I found these comments more entertaining than dissuasive. I wanted to go and prove to myself how little I was bothered by a chill in the air or a little noise through the walls. Maybe that would be its own form of spiritual growth on a micro scale — proof of my own congruity with the universe even under mildly uncomfortable conditions.

Arriving at this micro-enlightenment would take many modes of transportation, it turned out. Although Koyasan is only about 86 miles outside of Kyoto, the journey to get there is its own self-selecting odyssey. From Kyoto, I took three separate trains past power plants, greenhouses, small towns, backyard yuzu trees and grass tennis courts. At the base of the mountain, I shuffled off the train and onto a cable car along with a handful of European backpackers. At the top of the mountain, a bus waited for us to make the final journey along mortifyingly steep cedar-studded ravines into the center of Koyasan.

I arrived at my temple, Eko-in (part of the Danjo Garan temple complex), just as an American couple and their teenage son were checking in. A monk showed us where to put our shoes by the broad carved wood entrance. Outfitted with wooden slippers, I walked through a maze of creaky wooden hallways to my room, a small, serene square of space with elaborately painted sliding doors and a large window looking out onto the temple’s central garden. The room came equipped with a TV, a space heater, a telephone, and Wi-Fi. Waiting for me were some small red bean sweets and a kettle full of hot water for tea.

When it was time for dinner, a fleet of several monks arrived, bearing a carafe of hot sake and several lacquerware platforms for the food, each containing a clutter of small bowls. The traditional temple cuisine, called shojin-ryori, incorporates a bright variety of tastes, textures and colors. Tiny cups of vegetable broth and miso soup flocked around plates of delicate tempura squash, lotus root and shiso leaves. A pot of slightly bland but hearty cabbage and mushroom udon sat over a little flame. My favorite dish was one that Koyasan is famous for: a savory tofu-like pudding called goma dofu, made from ground sesame and arrowroot flour.

Once it was dark, I slipped out of my room and down to the main entrance of the temple to retrieve my shoes and join the nighttime tour of Okunoin Cemetery. An English-speaking monk led a group of about 20 guests from Eko-in and some of the surrounding temples through the lantern-lit paths of Japan’s largest cemetery, pointing out the moss-covered tombs of important national figures, including the inventor of Kabuki and the founder of Panasonic. Since Buddhism values all forms of life, our guide explained, not all of the graves belonged to human beings; the writing on one of them translated essentially to “R.I.P. Ants.” In the 600-year-old cedars overhead, we could hear the chirps and squeaks of flying squirrels rippling through the brisk air.

In the early morning, before breakfast was served, guests of the temple were invited to attend morning prayer and a daily fire ceremony. The printed schedule left in our room requested that visitors not use flash photography and issued a stern warning: “The morning service and fire ritual are NOT A TOURIST SHOW, monks must do them every day to show daily appreciation to Buddhist saints.”

In spite of this, few attendees of the fire ritual could resist capturing a moment or two of cellphone video: the drums, chanting and flames rising up to the ceiling of the temple as the presiding monk burned a stack of wooden slats with prayers written on them. Most managed to do this surreptitiously while kneeling quietly. About halfway through the ceremony, though, my eyes widened when I recognized a Frenchwoman from the cemetery tour standing at the back of the room, doing what could only be described as dancing to the beat of the drums.

The rat has sensitive ears, strong legs and big feet, the better to hear a predator and leap in the air or kick sand in its attacker’s face. The snake has venom and a speedy strike.

In one recent study in a Southern California desert, rats overwhelmingly defeat snakes, escaping in all of 23 recorded attacks during 40 encounters. The recordings captured 15 different snakes, 21 identified kangaroo rats and 17 unidentified rats. Only once did a snake manage to sink its fangs in a rat deep enough to inject venom, and it wasn’t enough to stop the rat from getting away and recovering.

The rats also seemed to be able to prevent strikes, by so-called “predator deterrent” actions like kicking sand at the snake, drumming its foot, jumping back or going up to investigate the snake. According to some thinking about how prey and predator interact, these actions are ways for a prey animal to show off how quick or strong it is, essentially saying, “Forget about trying to catch me, you don’t have a chance.”

The story, published on Tuesday, went online days after the publication of the first of two investigative articles by The New York Times on Mr. Weinstein, who was fired from the Weinstein Company on Sunday.

Mr. Farrow, 29, is a son of Mia Farrow and Woody Allen, and a graduate of Yale Law School who hosted a short-lived show on MSNBC that was canceled because of low ratings. Since then, he has filed pieces for “Today” — Mr. Oppenheim’s last stop before his promotion in February — as part of a series called “Undercover With Ronan Farrow.”

So, why did Mr. Farrow, who had worked for NBC News since 2013, take it to a rival organization?

“I walked into the door at The New Yorker with an explosively reportable piece that should have been public earlier,” Mr. Farrow told Ms. Maddow on Tuesday. “And immediately, obviously, The New Yorker recognized that, and it’s not accurate to say that it was not reportable. In fact, there were multiple determinations that it was reportable at NBC.”

When Ms. Maddow pressed him to explain what had happened with NBC, he said, “Look, you would have to ask NBC and NBC executives about the details of that story.”

At the annual town hall meeting, Mr. Oppenheim said NBC had determined over the summer that Mr. Farrow’s reporting lacked some elements it needed for publication, but that he had since filled the gaps.

“Ronan very understandably wanted to keep forging ahead,” Mr. Oppenheim said, according to a transcript of his remarks provided by the network. “So we didn’t want to stand in his way, and he took it to The New Yorker and did a ton more extraordinary work. He greatly expanded the scope of his reporting. Suffice to say, the stunning story, the incredible story that we all read yesterday, was not the story that we were looking at when we made our judgment several months ago.”

Mr. Oppenheim said NBC News “couldn’t be prouder” of Mr. Farrow, who is no longer under contract with the network.

“I think all you need to know about our feeling about the importance of the story is that we have been putting him on our air throughout the day yesterday, and this morning, ever since,” he said.

The report, which Mr. Farrow worked on for several months with Rich McHugh, a producer in the investigative unit at NBC News, went through rounds of vetting within NBC — including with Kimberley Harris, NBC Universal’s general counsel, according to two people familiar with his reporting who were not authorized to speak publicly. By the time Mr. Farrow had given up on the idea that the story would air on NBC, he had on-camera interviews — with the subjects’ faces rendered in shadow — with employees at the Weinstein Company as well as other victims of harassment and assault, the people said.

In addition, Mr. Farrow had in his possession an audio recording made as part of a New York Police Department sting operation, in which Mr. Weinstein admitted groping a model named Ambra Battilana Gutierrez in 2015. Mr. Farrow had also collected LinkedIn messages from a concerned Weinstein Company executive that would ultimately make its way into his New Yorker article.

As of late July, Mr. Farrow also had an interview with one accuser who appeared on camera with her identity revealed. But that person wavered months after giving the interview, fearing legal action from Mr. Weinstein.

Once the interview with the woman was removed, NBC had concerns that the resulting piece would no longer include any on-camera interviews with people who revealed their identity, according to two people familiar with the news division’s thinking.

NBC recommended hitting the pause button on the story — partly because Mr. Farrow’s contract with the network was about to expire — but Mr. Farrow wanted to continue.

A new accuser had agreed to appear on camera — in shadow — and she had a serious sexual assault claim to make. After some back and forth between Mr. Farrow and the network, NBC said he was free to proceed but without help from the news division. Officials at the network wanted it postponed.

Mr. Farrow went ahead with the interview — and hired his own camera crew to conduct it.

During the course of his reporting, Mr. Farrow also interviewed, in the role of an expert talking head, the longtime New Yorker staff writer Ken Auletta, who had written a lengthy profile of Mr. Weinstein for the magazine in 2002. Given Mr. Farrow’s material, Mr. Auletta said on camera that it would be a “scandal” if NBC refused to air it, according to a person familiar with the interview.

By mid-August, Mr. Auletta had arranged for Mr. Farrow to meet with David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker. Mr. Farrow shared his materials with him and the person who would ultimately be his story editor, Deirdre Foley Mendelssohn. The New Yorker editors were of the opinion that Mr. Farrow had the groundwork of a major scoop, a story that many news organizations had been chasing for years.

“The building blocks were there,” Mr. Remnick said.

The publication of Mr. Farrow’s New Yorker story roughly coincided with the one-year anniversary of NBC’s losing a scoop when it hesitated to publish a story on the “‘Access Hollywood’ tape” — the recording of Mr. Trump, then a presidential candidate, boasting of having forced himself on women.

NBCUniversal is the owner of the syndicated “Access Hollywood” and had the recording in its archives. It lost the story, however, as its lawyers put the tape through a three-day vetting process. Complicating matters was the fact that Billy Bush, the “Access Hollywood” correspondent who played the eager and willing interlocutor to Mr. Trump in the 2005 tape, was by then a host of “Today.”

On Oct. 7, 2016, The Washington Post published the audio recording and an accompanying story about it under the headline “Trump recorded having extremely lewd conversation about women in 2005” just hours after it received a copy of the tape.

Mr. Trump at first defended his comments as “locker room banter,” before issuing a video apology in which he said, “Anyone who knows me knows these words don’t reflect who I am. I said it, I was wrong, and I apologize.”

At the meeting of NBC News staff members on Wednesday, Mr. Oppenheim seemed adamant that NBC News would not shy away in the future.

“So, what I would say is that we are going to keep digging, we are going to keep pursuing these stories,” he said. “We are not always going to be the ones that get it to the finish line, but I think, more often than not, we will be.”

Mr. Farrow did not reply to interview requests for this story, but when asked by Jake Tapper on CNN’s “The Lead” to clear up the back-and-forth, he said, “I truly do think we should stay focused on the women here.”",How Did NBC Miss Out on a Harvey Weinstein Exposé?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/business/media/nbc-news-harvey-weinstein.html

During the 1919 scenes she is occasionally stopped in her tracks by presentiments of what’s in store around the corner. It may even be that the 1937 scene is merely her dream — or nightmare.

For us it is a bit of both. Parts of “Time and the Conways” come off as obvious exercises in dramatic irony, as tedious as those charades. Other parts look at the world as it really is and are freshly gripping.

So give credit to the Roundabout for producing this thoughtful revival of an ambitious, vexing, multilayered drama. Still, there’s a reason it has not appeared on Broadway since its 1938 American premiere. Too often it feels like an elaborate mechanism for deploying once-fashionable cosmological ideas.

Influenced by the popular philosopher J. W. Dunne, and particularly his 1927 treatise “An Experiment With Time,” Priestley sought a dramatic structure that would demonstrate the idea that all parts of our lives occur simultaneously, even if we usually see only the current “cross section.” If we could instead grasp the whole thing, he argues, or at least have faith that it exists, we might stop acting as if “we were all in a panic on a sinking ship.”

The argument is flaky. Worse, it isn’t convincing on the play’s own terms. The evidence Priestley presents in the 1937 scene in no way bears out the belief expounded by placid Alan (Gabriel Ebert) that time is a “dream” moving us safely “from one peephole to the next.” Rather, the plot seems to support Kay’s view of time as “a great devil in the universe,” ruining everything indiscriminately.

Rebecca Taichman’s lovely staging does what it can visually to correct, or at least finesse, this problem. The simple morning-room set by Neil Patel performs a terrific bit of symbolic reconfiguration to accommodate the play’s porous sense of time, and Ms. Taichman, a recent Tony winner for “Indecent,” does haunting things with the characters who briefly step beyond time altogether. The costumes, lighting, wigs and makeup — and especially Matt Hubbs’s sound design and the original music by Dustin O’Halloran — also contribute to a vision that is almost brutally nostalgic.

And yet all this loving attention to the play’s philosophical superstructure does little to alleviate the stiffness of the actual scenes, which are filled with the kind of canned dialogue and bald exposition that Monty Python and other English satirists would come to savage a few decades later.

Perhaps it is not surprising, then, that the performances — including that of Ms. McGovern, who lately played a mother of similar vintage but more anodyne personality on “Downton Abbey” — are often overstated. That the problem affects both newcomers like Cara Ricketts, a Stratford Festival find, and New York stage regulars like Anna Camp, suggests direction that aims to score points and then rescore them as if in doubt of the audience’s comprehension.

When, for instance, in the 1919 scenes, a romantic opportunity is scotched or a guest insulted, the action is heavily underlined to make sure that the consequences in 1937 will line up. They would have anyway.

Priestley and the production are working too hard; he would be more successful integrating plot and metaphysics in his other so-called Time Plays, especially “An Inspector Calls,” revived on Broadway to great acclaim in 1994. But even in “Time and the Conways” he is more than a philosophical faddist and domestic dramatist: He is an astute social critic.

When the revival focuses on that, it achieves its greatest depth. The interval from 1919 to 1937 was, after all, unkind to more than the Conways; it was unkind to all of England. The chance to remake the country into a fairer one, in which social stratification and wealth inequality might be mitigated, was squandered, and by the time the Depression (which the British called The Great Slump) arrived, the middle and working classes were enemies instead of comrades. Even as one of the Conway children bemoans the situation, another helps break a railwaymen’s strike — and finds doing so “a great lark.”

Priestley connects this chaotic brew of entitlement and resentment to the rise of Nazism elsewhere in Europe. It’s no accident that it’s the gauche Mr. Beevers, a despised outsider with the wrong accent, who grimly explains to the impoverished Conways that their cavalier assumptions of privilege are now worthless. They no longer live at the end of the old war, he tells them, but “just before the next” one.

It’s a terrifying comment, especially as delivered by Steven Boyer, the “Hand to God” star unrecognizable here as a distinctly Bannonesque spoiler. However outlandish Priestley’s ideas about time, he totally nailed a future truth in his creation of this furiously vengeful arriviste bully. What Priestley wants you to understand in “Time and the Conways” is that such men are not the creators of rotten societies.

The broad debate over President Trump’s fitness for the difficult and demanding office he holds has recently been reframed in a more pointed and urgent way: Does he understand, and can he responsibly manage, the most destructive nuclear arsenal on earth?

The question arises for several reasons. He has threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea. He has reportedly pressed for a massive buildup in the American nuclear arsenal, which already contains too many — 4,000 — warheads. And soon he will decide whether to sustain or set a course to possibly unravel the immensely important Iran nuclear deal.

Doubts about his competency were reinforced this week by Senator Bob Corker, who charged that Mr. Trump was treating his office like “a reality show” with reckless threats that could set the nation “on the path to World War III.” Mr. Corker, a Republican from Tennessee, says he is relying on Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and John Kelly, the White House chief of staff, to help “separate our country from chaos.” That is a searing indictment, and Mr. Corker is no garden-variety legislator; as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he is a respected, and largely responsible, voice on national security issues.

Mr. Trump’s policy pronouncements during the campaign betrayed either profound ignorance or dangerous nonchalance: At one point he wondered why America had nuclear weapons if it didn’t use them; at another he suggested that Japan and South Korea, which have long lived under the American security umbrella, should develop their own nuclear weapons. But nothing he said has been quite as unsettling as his recent tweetstorms about North Korea, his warnings of “fire and fury” and his quip about “the calm before the storm.”",Mr. Trump Alone Can Order a Nuclear Strike.

“The Puerto Rican parrot is an iconic species of the island,” Marisel López, leader of the The Puerto Rican Parrot Recovery Program, of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, said. “It’s our legacy.”

While there were tens of thousands in pre-Columbian times, the parrot population dwindled to 13 by 1973 because of deforestation, hunting and species competition. Conservation efforts since then have helped rebuild the population, and before Maria, the captive and wild population combined numbered over 500, Ms. López said. At least seven parrots died in captivity because of the stress induced by the hurricane and the high heat in the days after because of the lack of canopy, she said.

Ms. López, whose team is trying to gain access to the western part of El Yunque where the parrots live, said the toll in the wild population was not known.

The tourism industry in Puerto Rico is deeply intertwined with its environment.

About 1.2 million people visit El Yunque every year for its hiking trails, zip-lining, camping and waterfalls. But the rain forest has remained closed since Maria left roads inaccessible and all its recreational facilities received blows, Ms. Wallace, the forest supervisor, said.

“We don’t know how long it is going to take to reopen,” she said.

And on an island, where 58 percent of the acreage is forests, Maria’s ecological damage was widespread.

The population of mountain coquí, one of the 14 species of a small native frog, with a distinctive mating call heard at night across the island, was severely decimated by Hurricane Hugo in 1989, Rafael Joglar, a professor of biology at the University of Puerto Rico, said.

Hurricane Maria could be the final straw for that species, Mr. Joglar said.

WASHINGTON — An American woman and her family who have been held hostage by militants in Afghanistan for five years have been freed, ending a case that has long frustrated diplomats and F.B.I. agents involved in trying to secure their release, according to people familiar with the situation.

The family was in Pakistan early Thursday, and the White House was preparing to release a statement once they are safely in American hands, according to people who described their status on condition of anonymity because the details have not yet been made public.

Media in the region reported that the Pakistani military had initially taken custody of the family.

The family was freed with the help of another country, the person said, but it was not clear what if any concessions were made to the Haqqani network, the Taliban faction that had seized Caitlan Coleman, 31, and her Canadian husband, Josh Boyle, 34.

Hillary Clinton warned during the campaign, in a foreign policy speech in June 2016, “This is not someone who should ever have the nuclear codes, because it’s not hard to imagine Donald Trump leading us into a war just because somebody got under his very thin skin.”

He continued, “I genuinely believe that if Trump wins and gets the nuclear codes, there is an excellent possibility it will lead to the end of civilization.”

That same month, Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia warned at the Democratic National Convention about “giving the nuclear codes to a man who praises Vladimir Putin and Saddam Hussein.”

In August 2016, a Republican representative, Richard Hanna of New York, endorsed Hillary Clinton because, as he put it: “I think Trump is a national embarrassment. Is he really the guy you want to have the nuclear codes?”

By the time Clinton had her first debate against Trump, she had sharpened this nuclear attack line, but something about it still felt dull: “A man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes.”

Something about all these warnings, while true, felt of another time, like they were happening during the Cold War, rather than tailored for an election about the culture wars. Still, a Fox News poll conducted a month before the election found that voters overwhelmingly trusted Clinton to do a better job making decisions about using nuclear weapons.

But enough Americans looked past these warnings, just as they pushed past so many others, to hand Trump the election. After all, the nuclear question was theoretical and academic, right? No, it wasn’t.

In fact, after the election, concern about Trump controlling our nuclear arsenal only congealed.

The worry is so real that in January, a Democratic representative, Ted Lieu of California, introduced the Restricting First Use of Nuclear Weapons Act, which is designed “to prohibit the conduct of a first-use nuclear strike absent a declaration of war by Congress.”

In May, The Washington Times quoted Senator Ed Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, as saying, “We do not trust him with our nuclear weapons arsenal” and “We do not want him to use nuclear weapons first in the North Korean standoff — not just there in Korea, but all across the planet.”

The article also quotes Markey as saying of Trump, “As his comments become more erratic and inconsistent on the use of nuclear weapons, we think it’s imperative for the United States Congress to reclaim its constitutional authority to have the power to determine whether or not these nuclear weapons are used first against any country.”

Trump continues his war of words and measuring of egos with Kim Jong-un of North Korea. While I still find the threat of a nuclear strike remote, it grows less and less remote with every passing day and every insult.

Kim Jong-un is irrational and unhinged, but so is Trump.

No matter whether I agreed with President Barack Obama’s policies or not, I never once worried that he might ignite a nuclear war. That assurance has now been removed. As my colleague Nicholas Kristof, who recently visited North Korea, said of the possibility of a war between our country and theirs, “War is preventable, but I’m not sure it will be prevented.”

This is what Senator Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican, meant when he talked to The New York Times last week. The Times reported that Corker charged that Trump was “treating his office like ‘a reality show,’ with reckless threats toward other countries that could set the nation ‘on the path to World War III.’ ”

Plenty of people tried to warn us about this moment, but not enough Americans took heed. To them, this was sky-is-falling hyperbole. The use of nuclear weapons was a thing of history and Hollywood.

But it is ever so clear that the threat is urgent and real and that the only thing standing between a nuclear strike and us is a set of short fingers that constantly type out Twitter insults.

Women with high blood pressure in their 40s are at increased risk for dementia in later years, researchers report. But the finding does not hold for men.

Beginning in 1964, investigators collected health and lifestyle information on 5,646 men and women when they were 30 to 35 years old, and again when they were in their 40s. From 1996 to 2015, 532 of them were found to have Alzheimer’s or other forms of dementia. The study is in Neurology.

Hypertension in women in their 30s was not associated with dementia. But women who were hypertensive at an average age of 44 had a 68 percent higher risk for dementia than those who had normal blood pressure at that age, even after adjusting for B.M.I., smoking and other risk factors.

And it is interesting, given that Mr. Hanks and Rita Wilson are celebrated as the king and queen of Hollywood, that there is a strain of melancholy that runs through many of the stories about small-town characters.

In one, “A Special Weekend,” a 9-year-old named Kenny is being raised by his moody father and brisk stepmother in a Northern California town — with a throng of siblings and stepsiblings — because his mother, a pretty waitress, broke up with his father when Kenny was little. He gets to spend a birthday weekend with his mother, who arrives in a cloud of perfume, with red lipstick that matches her red roadster.

When Mr. Hanks was 5, living in Redding, Calif., his parents separated. His mother, a waitress, kept the youngest of the four children while Tom went with the other two to live with his father. He was playing with his siblings one night when he was told he had to go with his father. He was a cook who married twice more and Tom had lots of stepsiblings and lived with a lot of upheaval. “By the age of 10, I’d lived in 10 houses.”

“By and large, they were all positive people and we were all just kind of in this odd potluck circumstance,” he said, adding that he still vividly recalls the confusion of being that little boy. “I could probably count on one hand the number of times I was in a room alone with my mom, or in a car alone. That is not exactly what happened to me, but there were times when either my mom or my dad — the same thing was true for both — in which being alone with them, I realized, was like, ‘This is a special time.’ For other people, it’s not a special time. It’s just part and parcel to the day.”

He took Ms. Ephron’s advice to heart. His voice is recognizably Hanks, with lots of Norman Rockwell phrasing: lollygagging, yowza, thanked his lucky stars, titmouse, knothead, atta baby.

The title of the book is drawn from his love of vintage typewriters.

We talk next to rows and rows of rare black and red and green typewriters that do not work but count as “objects of art” for Mr. Hanks.

There is also a glamour shot of Ben Bradlee, whom Hanks is portraying in “The Post,” the Steven Spielberg-directed movie about The Washington Post’s role in publishing the Pentagon Papers. “Ben knew he was the coolest guy in the room,” Mr. Hanks says.

In the adjacent room, bookcases are brimming with covered typewriters. Vintage posters of typewriters hang on the walls.

“Typing was the one requirement my dad had for me, going to school,” Mr. Hanks recalls. “He said, ‘goddamn it, you’ll take a typewriting course!’ I think that was the sum total of my dad’s advice to a young man.”

One of his characters in the book, an old-fashioned, tri-cities newspaper columnist, lovingly describes the chonk-chonkka of the keys with the ba-ding of the bell and the krannk of the carriage return and the shripp of the copy ripped from the machine.

He tried to write his fiction on a typewriter but concedes, “I only made it about five pages in.” That delete key on a laptop is too alluring.

All different brands of typewriters — Royals and Remingtons and Continentals — make cameos in the stories, with pictures. It’s “The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dogs” version of Alfred Hitchcock giving himself a walk-on in his movies.

When I ask Mr. Hanks how he fell in love with typewriters, he tells the basic story in “These Are the Meditations of My Heart,” noting, “I changed the gender so they wouldn’t all be about confused young men.” It’s a yarn about a young woman who finds a cheap typewriter at a church-parking-lot sale, goes to a Polish repairman to get it fixed and ends by upgrading to a Swiss sea-foam-green Hermes 2000, the Mercedes of typewriters, with an Epoca typeface.

Did his stint on the early ’80s sitcom “Bosom Buddies,” in which he dressed in drag, “Some Like It Hot” style, to live in an apartment building restricted to women, help him write in a woman’s voice?

“I’m not sure that Lenny Ripps and Chris Thompson wrote in women’s voices per se,” he says with a smile, referring to the show’s writers. “I think between all the women that I worked for and with and gave birth to and married, they all had a great amount of input.”

That character wants a typewriter because her handwriting is so bad. Mr. Hanks says that’s his problem, too, that his handwriting is “horrible, horrible.”

He looks at mine and says it’s just as bad, noting: “If you were up for murder, a handwriting expert would read it and say, ‘Oh, she’s guilty, look at the Ys versus the block Js.”’

I am also curious if the futuristic story on time travel, in which a middle-aged man goes back in time and falls in love with a young woman at the 1939 World’s Fair, was inspired by the fortunetelling machine Zoltar in “Big.”

“No,” he says, “that really came out of a desire to see the 1939 World’s Fair.”

Mr. Hanks eats a sushi lunch, casual in Uniqlo jeans, a James Perse black T-shirt, Ralph Lauren boots, a Filson watch with Smokey Bear on it, a David Yurman silver bracelet and a custom-made class ring from the “School of Hard Knocks” with his children’s initials engraved (both pieces of jewelry gifts from his “fabulous wife”). He’s also wearing a dark Lululemon jacket.

“Do not judge me,” he comically instructs. “What happened was that on Sunday, Rita said, ‘Let’s get out of the house.’ I had to buy some workout clothes and we went into Lululemon and I saw this and it kind of fit, so I asked, ‘Is it appropriate for men to wear?’ They said, yeah, so I’m wearing Lululemon.”

He looks trim. “It’s amazing what happens,” he says, “when you finally understand you have Type 2 diabetes and start eating like it.”

I had read that he got diabetes from gaining and losing a lot of weight for roles, but he tells me: “No, I got it from a life of the worst diet on the planet earth. I just ate sugar and stuff all my life.”

Although he admits he’s not “impervious to perks” — going on private planes is “literally like crack cocaine” — he said he didn’t have any trouble writing about ordinary people beyond the Hollywood bubble.

“Life here is not like ‘The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,”’ he says. “No one wears that much lip gloss 24 hours a day or constantly goes out to restaurants only to have arguments about ‘You didn’t invite me to your daughter’s bat mitzvah.”’

When one of his stories, a whimsical tale set in the future about four friends who build a spaceship and fly to the moon — besides typewriters, Mr. Hanks has long been obsessed with flying to the moon — appeared in The New Yorker in 2014, a couple of critics pounced. Slate complained that it was “a mediocre story that breezed past the bodyguards because of its Hollywood pedigree” and another writer in The Chicago Tribune, admitting envy, called Mr. Hanks “a dabbler at best.”

“Just don’t read the comments because nothing good can come out of it,” he says. “Have you ever had someone say, ‘I read the greatest review of your book,’ or ‘the most glowing review of your movie,’ and you read it and you say, ‘That’s not a glowing review. This guy takes cheap shots left and right and he didn’t get the point.’ Look, I’m 61. I don’t have time to read about how bad or how good I was at something. Just let it sit out there and they have to deal with the fact that I’m the famous guy who got my name in the paper.”

I ask him if he’s going for a Pegot (Pulitzer, Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony).

He laughs and says that sometimes you just have to take a risk and be bad at something and get outside yourself and have somebody else critique it and throw stuff away and work harder and that’s how you get better. “I went through some things like, Well, it looks like a piece of writing. It’s on a piece of paper with the right format. And it ain’t.”

As he told The Times Book Review, he’s a big reader with stacks of books at home. Does that make him an oddball in Hollywood?

“I think they just assume here you’re a Luddite because the coin of the realm right now is podcasts or obscure shows that are only on for 10 episodes on Hulu or Netflix,” he says. “The dinner party conversation is, ‘I read the most fascinating book about the Civil War’ and they go, ‘Hmm’ and then they move on to some other conversation.”

His favorite book when he was in high school was “In Cold Blood,” by Truman Capote, but now he prefers Cold War spy stories by Alan Furst and Philip Kerr. He says he’s not interested in murder or conspiracy stories. When he writes, he doesn’t try to get into the head of a psychopath, just a surfer, like himself.

I ask if, as the nation’s designated most likable actor — even his Halloween monster on “Saturday Night Live,” David S. Pumpkins, is cuddly — he felt pressure to make his fictional characters likable.

“‘Unleash the Charm Monster, damn it, that’s all we want from you,’” he intones in the collective Hollywood voice. But he gets a bit defensive on the issue.

“It’s not a matter of not willing to get dark,” he says. “Look, I played an executioner in a movie. Then the journalist says, ‘Yeah, but you were a nice executioner.’ It wasn’t fun to play a guy whose job it is to put everybody to death. In ‘Road to Perdition,’ I played a guy who shot people in the head. And you know what they say? ‘Yeah, but you shot him in the head for all the right reasons.’ I’m not interested to play a guy who is some version of ‘Before I kill you, Mr. Bond, would you like a tour of my installation?’ I like stories in which everybody makes sense, so you can hear their different motivations and understand them, as opposed to ‘When this elixir goes in the Gotham City water structure, then the city will be mine!’

“I think the best examples of a bad guy that I would jump to be able to play would be Richard III or Iago. I get that. Richard III is this misshapen guy who’s sick of being treated like a dog and he’s got a shot at being the king of England, and Iago lost out on a promotion. But the vast majority of bad guys — what am I going to do, play Loki? No one wants to see me do that. But I could play Jefferson Davis. The biggest thing I have to consider is: What’s my countenance? I don’t have a great deal of mystery.”

Doesn’t he ever want to be like Larry David and start yelling at people on the street? It must be hard when everyone expects you to always be nice.

“I think I am! I’m sorry!” he says, laughing. “I think I give everybody a fair shake. But I will tell you this, and there’s plenty of people who can attest to it, don’t take advantage of my good nature, because the moment that you do, you’re gone, you’re history. I mean, look, I’m not a sap. I’m not naïve. At least I don’t think I am. I understand that part of it is my nature, part of it is my DNA, part of it is the sum total of everything I went through, and it came out O.K. But part of it is a choice that just says, How do I want to spend my day? How do I want to spend these hours, pissed off at something or you just kind of let it roll off you. But don’t take advantage of my good nature because if you do, it will come back to haunt you and you will hear from me in no uncertain terms. I’ve yelled at people.” Even used vulgarities.

So now that we’re on the subject of screaming and vulgarities, I segue into the Harvey Weinstein scandal. Talk about a Bonfire of the Vanities, Sherman.

“I’ve never worked with Harvey,” Mr. Hanks says, after a long pause. “But, aah, it all just sort of fits, doesn’t it?”

Why did Hollywood help shelter him, if everyone knew about the decades of abusive behavior?

“Well, that’s a really good question and isn’t it part and parcel to all of society somehow, that people in power get away with this?” he says. “Look, I don’t want to rag on Harvey but so obviously something went down there. You can’t buy, ‘Oh, well, I grew up in the ’60s and ’70s and so therefore. ...” I did, too. So I think it’s like, well, what do you want from this position of power? I know all kinds of people that just love hitting on, or making the lives of underlings some degree of miserable, because they can.”

They think their achievements entitle them, he says, noting: “Somebody great said this, either Winston Churchill, Immanuel Kant or Oprah: ‘When you become rich and powerful, you become more of what you already are.’

“So I would say, there’s an example of how that’s true. Just because you’re rich and famous and powerful doesn’t mean you aren’t in some ways a big fat ass. Excuse me, take away ‘fat.’ But I’m not, you know, I’m not the first person to say Harvey’s a bit of an ass. Poor Harvey — I’m not going to say poor Harvey, Jesus. Isn’t it kind of amazing that it took this long? I’m reading it and I’m thinking ‘You can’t do that to Ashley Judd! Hey, I like her. Don’t do that. That ain’t fair. Not her, come on. Come on!’”

I ask him why Hollywood and Silicon Valley are still such benighted places about women’s rights, with conspiracies of silence about raging sexism and marauding predators.

“Look, I think one of the greatest television shows in the history of television was ‘Mad Men’ because it had absolutely no nostalgia or affection for its period,” Mr. Hanks says. “Those people were screwed up and cruel and mean. And, ‘Hey, wait, that’s going on today? Shouldn’t we be on this?’ Is it surprising? No. Is it tragic? Yes. And can you believe it’s happening? I can’t quite believe that” — here Mr. Hanks uses an expletive — “still goes on.”

(When I ask about Cam Newton’s gender faux pas, Mr. Hanks is more sympathetic. “Now I’ve done that,” he says. “I’m not so far away from ‘Hey, Maureen, how you doing, sweetie?’ ‘Well, look sweetheart.’ ‘Aw, doll baby, I don’t know how to answer that.’ I could have done that in a moment. What’s wrong with having there be a requirement to learn more rules of the workplace?”)

As long as we’re on the subject of Mr. Weinstein, a powerful, politically prominent man who got away with bad behavior toward women for an inexplicably long time, I bring up President Trump.

Photo

Mr. Hanks says he just listened to the NPR show in which a former producer of “The Apprentice” admitted that the show made the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, which was falling apart and, as Mr. Hanks says, “stank,” look glossy in an effort to sell the image of Trump, the successful businessman.

“At the time, who cares?” he says. “It’s just a show about a guy. But in retrospect, that is what the official record is of a public figure that holds sway. Making this stuff up is dangerous, man. It’s an absolute, total falsehood.”

He says Mr. Trump squeaked through because people were tired of the “Bush-Clinton continuum” for 30 years and political “doublespeak.” He realized, even before the 2016 election, when Joe Wilson yelled “You lie!” at President Obama during an address to Congress, that comity was gone.

I ask Hollywood’s top history buff, the man who sent the White House press corps an espresso machine after Trump’s election because he knew they’d need it (he did this for journalists covering the Bush White House in 2004, too): Is this the calm before the storm?

“Let me just read you one thing,” he says, getting up to go into the other room and coming back with “April 1865: The Month That Saved America,” a book by Jay Winik about the closing weeks of the Civil War: “‘And where abolitionists preached slavery as a violation against the higher law, Southerners angrily countered with their own version of the deity, that it was sanctioned by the Constitution. In the vortex of this debate, once the battle lines were sharply drawn, moderate ground everywhere became hostage to the passions of the two sides. Reason itself had become suspect; mutual tolerance was seen as treachery. Vitriol overcame accommodation. And the slavery issue would not just fade away.”’

He looks up. “Somehow, sometime in the last 20 years of our generation, that’s re-emerged. So, yes, this is the calm before the storm.”

I note that he savors the Philip Kerr character Bernie Gunther, a cynical Berlin detective who sees the Nazis for the beasts they are. Is he surprised the Nazis have crawled out of hell, marching in the open in Charlottesville?

“In Germany, in some of the smaller counties, they’ve got Nazis running for office,” Mr. Hanks says. “And jeez, we’ve got Nazis giving torchlight parades in Charlottesville. Don’t you hope that this is just some kind of doomsday fetishism” that will soon die out?

At a tribute to his career last November at the Museum of Modern Art, Mr. Hanks gave a soothing Sully Sullenberger-like speech about the election, with the theme “We are going to be all right.” I ask him if he is sure.

He replies that, except for some bone-headed amendments to the Constitution like prohibition — “that was so friggin’ stupid, completely contrary to human behavior” — America always course-corrects.

“It’s not the first time we’ve had a knot-headed president of the United States,” he says. “We have always corrected something that’s horrible. World War II was fought by a segregated United States of America, except for a few military units. And immediately after that, it altered. But you have to go through things that will alter the consciousness. And normalcy is always being redefined and you just have to have faith and you have to have some degree of patience and you do have to put up with, every now and again, let’s face it, Nazi torch parades surrounding a phantom issue of a statue that was put up in the 1920s.”

I ask where he stands on the removal of Confederate statues.

“Look, if I’m black and I live in a town and every day I have to walk past a monument to someone who died in a battle in order to keep my grandparents and my great-grandparents illiterate slaves, I got a problem with that statue,” he says. “I would say if you want to be on the safe side, take them all down. Put them in some other place where people can see them, in a museum somewhere.”

Mr. Hanks concludes about our rocky road to a more perfect union, “It’s going to be ugly periodically, but it’s also going to be beautiful periodically.” And he advises keeping a sense of humor.

“It might be the only ammunition that is left in order to bring down tyrants,” he says. “You know what Mark Twain says: ‘Against the assault of laughter, nothing can stand.”’","Hollywood’s Most Decent Fella on Weinstein, Trump and History",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/style/tom-hanks-uncommon-type-harvey-weinstein-donald-trump.html

We are talking, in other words, about the American workplace. The administration might have saved itself a bunch of keystrokes by simply writing “anyone.” For the “moral” objectors, the universe described is slightly smaller, but only for the time being. Publicly traded companies are omitted from this privileged list for now, but the administration reserves the right to include them later and seems inclined to do so.

It’s hard to overstate the radical nature of what has just happened. Just three years ago, in the Hobby Lobby case, the Supreme Court ruled that the Obama administration could not impose the mandate on a closely held for-profit business owned by a family with religious objections to birth control.

But the decision did not end there. In his majority opinion, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. emphasized that the administration was already offering a workaround accommodation for religious nonprofit organizations that gave them a hands-free way to have birth control coverage available for their employees. All that these organizations had to do was notify the Department of Health and Human Services or their insurance administrators of their objection and the coverage would automatically flow to the female employees without any further involvement by the employer. The administration should do the same thing for Hobby Lobby and similar companies, the court said, emphasizing that the intended beneficiaries would suffer no loss of coverage: “The effect of the HHS-created accommodation on the women employed by Hobby Lobby and the other companies involved in these cases would be precisely zero. Under that accommodation, these women would still be entitled to all FDA-approved contraceptives without cost sharing.”

Now the Trump administration has played the Supreme Court justices for chumps. The accommodation, carefully worked out and fought over, is a thing of the past. In its place is a flat-out exemption, with no requirement that women be offered any alternative route to coverage. “There are multiple federal, state, and local programs that provide free or subsidized contraceptives for low-income women,” the administration explained airily, noting that “many forms of contraception are available for around $50 per month.” Further, “As the government is under no constitutional obligation to fund contraception, even more so may the government refrain from requiring private citizens to cover contraception for other citizens in violation of their religious beliefs.”

These statements call to mind a particularly callous old Supreme Court case, United States v. Kras, in which a man with an income of a few hundred dollars a month and unpaid bills of $6,000 tried to file for bankruptcy but ran up against the $50 filing fee. He challenged the constitutionality of the fee and lost. “There is no constitutional right to obtain a discharge of one’s debts in bankruptcy,” Justice Harry A. Blackmun wrote for the 5-to-4 majority, observing that the fee could be paid over time for about $2 a month — less, he pointed out, than the price of a movie. (This was 1973.) Justice Thurgood Marshall wrote a stinging dissent that accused the majority of having no understanding of how poor people actually live. “The desperately poor almost never go to see a movie, which the majority seems to believe is an almost weekly activity,” he wrote.

The administration says the average price of a year’s birth control is $584. That’s probably low (an IUD can cost $1,000 up front, but the administration amortizes that cost over the five-year life of the product) but that’s not really the point. Others have called attention to the administration’s truly astonishing effort to show that birth control really isn’t all that important and may even be counterproductive. Statements like the one on page 46 of the religious exemption document, “Contraception’s association with positive health effects might also be partially offset by an association with negative health effects,” are hogwash, the result of careful cherry-picking of the literature, some of it quite dubious. One cited article from the Ave Maria Law Review by Michael J. New, a well-known anti-abortion activist, insists that there is “little evidence that increasing the use of contraception reduces the unintended pregnancy rate.”

The real point is that the Trump administration has outsourced a crucially important building block of national health care policy, enabling a fanatical fringe of the Republican base to exercise raw political power, clothed in religiosity under cover of the grandiloquently named Religious Freedom Restoration Act. That 1993 law, passed by overwhelming bipartisan majorities and signed by President Bill Clinton, is the object of growing buyer’s remorse on the part of liberal and moderate Americans — and should be.

To fully appreciate what happened last week, it’s important to understand what happened in the years following the Hobby Lobby decision. The Obama administration did as the Supreme Court said and offered the accommodation as Justice Alito described it. But a group of religiously affiliated nonprofits, mainly but not exclusively Catholic-run schools, colleges, nursing homes and other social service organizations, refused to accept it. Not good enough, they said, claiming that they would still be complicit in the sin of contraception, even if the employees’ receipt of the benefit required no action on the employer’s part beyond notifying the government that it was opting out. Only the complete exemption offered to actual churches would suffice. (It’s hard to understand how these employers justify giving their employees a paycheck that might be used to buy birth control, but I guess that’s a private matter.) The nonprofits took the Obama administration to court and lost almost everywhere.

When seven cases reached the Supreme Court last year, consolidated under the name Zubik v. Burwell, the justices asked both sides whether they would accept an arrangement in which no opt-out notification was necessary. Yes, both said, resulting in the court’s decision to send the cases back to the lower courts to work out the details. But that was not to be. The administration insisted that no matter how the opt-out was handled, women must still be able to get “seamless” contraception coverage, that is, without having to apply for a separate plan and search for a doctor willing to accept the coverage. The nonprofits held fast and would not agree. The impasse lasted until the end of the Obama administration.

The Trump administration’s rescission of the government’s birth control mandate, not only for these organizations but also for others that never even got around to asking for it, is thus a reward for intransigence matched only by the Senate’s blockade of the Supreme Court vacancy intended for Merrick Garland that it eventually handed to Neil Gorsuch.

A half dozen lawsuits have already been filed against the federal government, and at least partial success in freezing or overturning the new rules is not out of the question. Putting the new policy into immediate effect without the usual “notice and comment” rule-making places the administration’s action on shaky procedural ground. Extending the rescission to employers with “moral” objections has no statutory basis. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act at least requires a claim that has something to do, however implausibly, with religion. It doesn’t, yet, license those who, like Melville’s Bartleby the Scrivener, “would prefer not to.”

I used to think — in fact, I wrote last year — that the resistance to the contraception mandate was fueled by cultural conservatives’ determination not to let federal policy normalize birth control. But now I think it’s deeper than that. Conservatives, even the publicly pious ones, don’t seem to have a problem with limiting the size of their families. (Vice President Mike Pence has two children, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions has three. Need I say more?) The problem they have is with what birth control signifies: empowering women — in school, on the job, in the home — to determine their life course. That’s what they don’t want to normalize. It comes as no surprise which side Donald Trump is on; his administration’s action last week makes perfect sense. Or none at all.","On Contraception, It’s Church Over State",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/opinion/contraception-religious-exemption.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

This policy is bad for books, bad for authors and bad for Amazon’s customers.","Blemished books also seem to feed the gray market for “new” books. Bookstores will return shopworn books or those damaged in shipping under the category of “hurt books.” The publisher sells these books as used books. Online bookstores may buy them in bulk, sort through them, and resell as “new” the least damaged through Amazon.

Publishers sell books to international wholesalers at large discounts on a non-returnable basis. By contract these books must be sold abroad, but wholesalers could quietly dump these books in the American market through a third-party seller on Amazon, cheating the publisher.

Print-on-demand has created a new unscrupulous enterprise, that of counterfeiting books. These books look perfect; there is no way for the customer to tell they are illegal.

And finally, a number of review copies are sent out free to media outlets. They are not supposed to be sold. Some book sellers apparently have standing arrangements with magazine conglomerates and television networks to bulk purchase all the review copies they receive, which they could presumably then sell on Amazon. While this isn’t strictly illegal, it is unethical — and terribly unfair to authors and publishers.

These third-party sellers may not always be selling “new” books, according to Amazon’s own published definitions on its website, which, in part, read:

“New: A brand-new, unused, unread copy in perfect condition. The dust cover and original protective wrapping, if any, is intact.”

“Used — Like New: Dust cover is intact, with no nicks or tears. Spine has no signs of creasing. Pages are clean and not marred by notes or folds of any kind.”

In many of these sales, the author gets zilch, or close to zilch. And, according to the Independent Book Publishers Association, which has been conducting its own research into the issue by purchasing books on Amazon, the customer is sometimes sold a used book under false pretenses.

Publishers and authors, deprived of income and royalties, have long worried about this gray market. Amazon, to its credit, quickly tightened up its definition of a “new” book, to the one cited above. These definitions make clear that remainders are not regarded as “new” books, and the company insists that it follows a strict policy as to what qualifies.

“Only new books are eligible to be featured in the U.S. Books New Buy Box and be the ‘primary offer’ on a book’s detail page, whether offered from third party sellers or Amazon,” a company spokersperson said. “We move quickly to address any violations. These recent changes mean that our U.S. online bookstore now works like the rest of Amazon.com, where third party sellers compete with Amazon for the sale of new items.”

The Authors Guild has urged publishers to keep better track of remainders, overstocks and excess-discount sales, and some publishers have responded. But the cost of policing the market, marking and tracking books, and suing malefactors has proved daunting. Remainder overstock sales bring some revenue for publishers, but the authors receive little to no royalties.

Amazon, in its drive to take over the book market, has made a change that, at least inadvertently, can mislead its own customers and be hurtful to authors. The Amazon action comes at a time when authors are struggling more than ever to make a living in the harsh economics of the digital marketplace. Amazon’s policy will help undermine authors’ incomes even further if it directs customers to “new” books for which the author receives no royalty.

Comments posted online by buyers of everything from camera equipment to fountain pens suggest that Amazon’s third-party sellers sometimes operate in a broadly gray area, failing to disclose provenance before a sale. Only after buyers try to repair broken items do they learn warranties aren’t honored because the goods are gray.

Amazon does what it can to rein in bad actors but it is at the top of a slippery slope in turning over its main buy button for new books to third-party sellers.

• Sara and Charles Rippey, who were 98 and 100 years old, died together at their home in Napa.

They were childhood sweethearts who traveled the world and had five children.

“The fact that they went together is probably what they would have wanted,” the couple’s son, Mike Rippey, told The Times.

• Family members said Christina Hanson, 27, died at her home in Santa Rosa.

Ms. Hanson was wheelchair bound with spina bifida. Her stepmother told the San Francisco Chronicle that she loved music and volunteered regularly.

• Officials said a woman fleeing a fire in the Yuba County foothills died when her car swerved off the road.

The Sacramento Bee spoke to neighbors of the woman, whom they identified as Sandy Picciano, 77. They said she liked to tend to neighborhood animals.

• The family of Linda Tunis, 69, a resident of the Journey’s End mobile home park in Santa Rosa, told The Associated Press that her remains had been found in the debris of her home.

Her daughter said she had loved her family, bingo and the beach.

The search by family and friends for missing loved ones has been complicated by the chaos of the evacuations this week.

Tens of thousands of people scattered during the firestorm. Some ended up in hospitals. Many more have packed dozens of shelters across Sonoma County and beyond.

Friends and family members have been fanning out to those locations, distributing fliers and issuing pleas for information on social media.

“My heart is being ripped out and I don’t know what else to do,” Rachael Ingram said in a Facebook post on Tuesday.

She was looking for a close friend, Mike Grabow, 40, whose home and truck in Santa Rosa were incinerated.

Reached by phone, Ms. Ingram said she had been searching for him nonstop — by foot, phone and internet.

It wasn’t like him to go silent, she said, “He’s got a huge community of friends.”

Late Wednesday there was still no word.

FRIDAY PUZZLE — TGIF, everyone! What a way to kick off the weekend; Damon Gulczynski has returned for his seventh themeless puzzle this year, and like all the rest of his work, it’s chock-full of pizazz.

Themelesses by their nature have numerous longer entries, and they show off overall vocabulary as opposed to an interesting theme, with a few fun nuggets of surrounding fill. However, there are many different styles to actually creating a themeless that should be noted. Some constructions are focused on a formidable-looking grid that has super smooth fill and a low word count. Other grids are less open, yet their longer answers are much flashier and thus allow the solver to overlook any dull, shorter fill.

Today, Mr. Gulczynski presents us with a hybrid of this concept: at 70 words total, he hasn’t quite reached the maximum allowed for a themeless (72), and yet the grid doesn’t appear very open. However, every answer of eight or more letters ranges from good to phenomenal: PHALANGE, I DARE NOT, GARY HART, SODA JERK, TELEKINESIS, OVER THE HUMP, HOVERBOARDS, IT’S NO BIGGIE, GIVE ME A RING, PABLO NERUDA, GENDER-BINARY and JOLLY RANCHER. That’s a ton of juicy fill.

As I said above, with so many marquee entries, the shorter fill usually suffers. But today? I pored over this grid post-solve, as I do when working with Will and Joel on submissions, and I couldn’t find more than three — maybe five, if I’m being super nitpicky — subpar answers. Can you guess which ones they were?

To have a puzzle be both so smooth and so exciting is near impossible, though Mr. Gulczynski makes it look easy. Let’s take a look at the cluing:

Every day, he said, a pathologist faces the fleeting nature of mortality.

And after a while, he said, one is bound to ask, “What’s all this about?”

His plan is to become an ordained deacon in the United Methodist Church, with two goals: to serve as a chaplain for the Boy Scouts of America, and to join the Appalachian Trail Chaplaincy of the United Methodist Church so he can minister to troubled hikers, at least on the 161 miles of the storied trail that cross New Hampshire and its White Mountains.

Perhaps it should come as no surprise that an industry built around pretended characters and scenarios could have pretended for so long that nothing was amiss. Perhaps it should be no surprise, either, that its concept of ethics is every bit as ersatz and inconstant as most everything else in Tinseltown.

The outrage over Mr. Weinstein also has a whiff of opportunism. In recent years, notes New York magazine’s Rebecca Traister, Weinstein has “lost power in the movie industry” and is no longer “the indie mogul who could make or break an actor’s Oscar chances.” Lame horses get shot.

It’s in this context that one can mount a defense of sorts for Mr. Weinstein, who inhabited a moral universe that did nothing but cheer his golden touch and wink at (or look away from) his transgressions — right until the moment that it became politically inconvenient to do so. Conservatives are trying to make hay of the fact that Mr. Weinstein donated lavishly to Democratic politicians, backed progressive causes and distributed films such as “The Hunting Ground,” a documentary about campus sexual assault.

But the important truth about Mr. Weinstein isn’t his moral hypocrisy: In movies as in politics, hypocrisy isn’t just an accepted fact of life but also an essential part of the job.

The important truth is that he was just another libidinous cad in a libertine culture that long ago dispensed with most notions of personal restraint and gentlemanly behavior. “I came of age in the ’60s and ’70s, when all the rules about behavior and workplaces were different,” Weinstein wrote in his mea culpa to The Times last week. “That was the culture then.”

That line was roundly mocked, but it contains its truth. Like those other libidinous cads — Bill Clinton and Donald Trump — Weinstein benefited from a culture that often celebrated, constantly depicted, sometimes enabled, seldom confronted, and all-too frequently forgave the behavior they so often indulged in.

Hyenas cannot help their own nature. But the work of a morally sentient society is to prevent them from taking over the savanna. Our society, by contrast, festooned Weinstein with honors, endowed him with riches, and enabled him to feast on his victims without serious consequence for the better part of 30 years. The old saw that all that is needed for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing was never truer than it was in Weinstein’s case.

“To document reciprocity among mountain lions, we needed to step back and assess behaviors over longer time spans,” he said. By taking the longer view, “we captured the patterns of behavior that have no doubt been occurring among mountain lions all along.”

Dr. Elbroch said he was compelled to perform the research after observing two female pumas share a carcass in 2012 in a forest near Grand Teton National Park. Though he had initially assumed the two animals were sisters, later study revealed them to be unrelated. “So many questions exploded in my head that I just had to pursue some answers,” Dr. Elbroch said.

In the current study, the puma communities were determined largely by the territorial boundaries of the males, said Dr. Elbroch. “Males acted like governors of fiefdoms, structuring how all mountain lions across the landscape interacted with each other,” he said.

Though pumas are found throughout the Americas, hunting and human development have reduced their footprint in North America, where they are now found mostly in Mexico, southern Florida and the Western United States. Though they are listed as an endangered or protected species in many areas, hunting is still allowed in many parts of the U.S.

If pumas are living in communities, it raises new questions about the impact that hunting, especially adult males, may have on the animals, said Dr. Elbroch.

This kind of intimidation is not new in Northern Ireland, nor does it appear to be on the rise. Around 30 people have declared themselves homeless for similar reasons each year for the past half-decade, according to statistics provided by the Northern Irish government, and this year’s figure of 33 is no departure from that trend.

But the recent episodes at Cantrell Close have made headlines in Northern Ireland because they occurred in a place that was intended to be a foundation stone for a post-sectarian society. It has also raised concerns about certain politicians’ commitment to the process of integration, and about the ability of the Northern Irish police to curb the influence of sectarian paramilitary groups.

“This is a very good illustration of a much deeper problem,” said Stephen Farry, a lawmaker from the Alliance Party, which tries to bridge the divides between the province’s Unionists and nationalist communities. “Northern Ireland is not yet a peaceful society. We have ongoing coercive control by paramilitary structures at a local level across many communities.”

A recent stroll down Cantrell Close, a tiny T-shaped cul-de-sac, did not make this instantly obvious. At first sight, it was a picture of prim, docile suburbia: 41 two-story homes, each with a tidy lawn and a garden fence, lined a quiet road with a shiny bike rack at one end and a speed bump at the other. The tensions became apparent only when you looked toward the sky.

Flying from some of the lampposts were the flags of the Ulster Volunteer Force, or U.V.F., a banned terrorist group that killed more than 400 people during the Northern Irish Troubles, mostly targeting Catholics and Irish nationalists, or those opposed to Northern Ireland remaining part of the United Kingdom.

No faction has claimed responsibility, but the police believe that the threats came from people purporting to be part of the U.V.F. Two men have been questioned in connection to the crime, on suspicion of membership in the group.

The East Belfast Community Initiative, which says it mediates on behalf of former U.V.F. combatants, said the U.V.F. was not involved. Cantrell Close, meanwhile, is just one of many streets in East Belfast lined with the group’s flags.

On Cantrell Close itself, there appears to be an informal omertà in place. Of those who answered their doors on a recent afternoon, none would discuss the threats to their former neighbors.

One man even claimed he knew nothing at all about the situation, his mouth curling into a faint smile.

Some outside the neighborhood have been more outspoken, however, about a culture of impunity that they believe encouraged whoever made the threats.

Before moving in, residents of Cantrell Close signed pledges against the display of controversial flags. The government also says it is illegal to fly the flags of terrorist groups.

Yet when the U.V.F. flags suddenly appeared in June, no action was taken either to find the perpetrators or to remove them, creating the impression that sectarianism would be tolerated even at such a symbolic housing development.

“The police, who you’d expect to lead, didn’t,” said Mairtin O Muilleoir, a lawmaker from Sinn Fein, an Irish nationalist party. “And the gangs were emboldened.”

Local unionist politicians were also perceived to take too weak a stance back in June.

“I’ll always be cautious about causation and correlation,” said Cillian McGrattan, a politics professor at Ulster University. But the reaction of politicians from the Democratic Unionist Party, or D.U.P., to sectarian episodes during the summer, including the Cantrell Close issue, “really left a lot to be desired,” he added.

Asked for comment, Emma Little-Pengelly, one of the party lawmakers facing criticism, said she had been clear in June about her opposition to paramilitary flags. She and a D.U.P. colleague also issued an immediate condemnation of last month’s threats to Catholic residents.

Belfast’s top policeman meanwhile suggested that the flags had not been deemed problematic enough to justify their removal back in June.

“The reality is that while we understand the public’s frustration in this matter, police will only act to remove flags if there are substantial risks to public safety,” Chief Superintendent Chris Noble said in an emailed statement.

(The flags were taken down only several days after the threats were made.)

For the young cook and his fiancée, these explanations mean little. They feel frustrated at the authorities for doing nothing in the first place to remove the flags, which they said were clearly intimidating. They feel abandoned by the police for failing, once the threats were made, to provide a permanent presence on the street.

And they fault the housing authorities for failing to quickly find them alternative accommodations — and for assuring them that the street was safe to move to.

The cook’s fiancée, a 20-year-old waitress, said officials should have recognized her vulnerability as a young mother with a newborn in tow before encouraging her to move in.

Politicians like Mr. O Muilleoir hope the episodes at Cantrell Close will not derail plans for more integrated housing projects. “In Europe in 2017, we either let an armed gang dictate policy,” he said, “or we step things up.”

But for the targeted families themselves, the integration dream is over. From now on, the cook said, his family would stick to neighborhoods with a Catholic majority.",A New Street Was Meant to Bridge Belfast’s Sectarian Divide.

HEALY Watching the new “Dynasty,” I missed the old “Dynasty.” The new versions of both “Dynasty” and “Dallas” go young with their actors.
But the “Dallas” reboot still had J. R., Sue Ellen and Bobby, and they were up to their old tricks and in fine form.
If only Joan Collins wasreprising her role as Alexis in the “Dynasty” reboot, as a cougar to middle-aged Blake!","JACOBS A fig stuffed with goat cheese and wrapped in prosciutto! As played by Pamela Sue Martin (familiar to me from a terrifying afternoon watching “The Poseidon Adventure”), Fallon was my favorite character on the show: intelligent, free-spirited and sexually liberated.

Yes, she was a spoiled brat with an Elektra complex, but also a feminist who wasn’t about to let any man tell her how to live her life, a working mother who single-handedly turns around Blake’s hotel, La Mirage. The chemistry between her and the staid, dependable Jeff Colby (John James) was intoxicating to my preadolescent self.

HEALY Fallon the working mother … hmmm … there are working mothers and then there are Carrington working mothers. And I’m not sure “feminist” is the first word I’d use for someone who was so demeaning and spiteful (at least at first) to other women.

For me, Fallon represented a central flaw of “Dynasty.” The show was a portrait of wealth, glamour, conspicuous consumption and narcissism — nothing more, really. Everyone wanted Blake’s love and money, and to a lesser extent Cecil Colby’s. The sexual politics became increasingly problematic, too: While the men schemed and sabotaged, the women fought over men in lily ponds and apartments.

“Dallas” felt richer for its focus on family and betrayal. (It was not above a pool fight, but those usually involved men.)

Both shows did have great villains. How would you rate J. R. and Joan Collins’s Alexis?

JACOBS No contest. J. R. felt irritatingly underplayed, with a rushed mumbling delivery. His predilection for the insults “slut,” “loser,” “drunk” and “saddle tramp” got old fast.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

HEALY Alexis called Krystle “you bitch!” a fair amount too. Those lines were juvenile, but I was juvenile, and they made me laugh.

JACOBS And she managed to make “whore” a two-syllable word! Alexis was over the top but she was both always herself and constantly changing — and not just outfits. She rolled with whatever crazy story line the writers came up with (quite literally, in the case of the infamous mud-wrestling scene). And she always committed 100 percent, whether it was to singing a rendition of Frank Loesser’s “The Boys in the Back Room” à la Marlene Dietrich or falling off a balcony with Dex in the last season’s final episode.

Which brings us to cliffhangers. Sashaying down memory lane with you made me realize how much the experience of watching television has changed, from once-a-week treat to isolated bingeing-and-tweeting. Who the heck shot J. R., anyway?

HEALY J. R. took it in the chest from his mistress Kristin Shepard (Mary Crosby), Sue Ellen’s scheming sister. That guy was such a dirty dog, but he was also one of the first prime-time villains that viewers loved to hate. He was a forerunner to antiheroes like Tony Soprano, Walter White and Cersei Lannister.

The “Who Shot J. R.?” season finale of “Dallas” was, for me, the greatest TV cliffhanger of all time. It came in March 1980; it wasn’t until November that Kristin was unmasked as the shooter. During the intervening months, everyone from President Carter to Vegas oddsmakers weighed in on J. R. The watercooler energy was enormous. While other television shows had fan followings, “Dallas” demonstrated that you could keep viewers in thrall for much of a year without any new episodes.

“Dynasty” had its own cliffhangers. I’ll bet you a Dean & DeLuca coffee that we agree on the most memorable one.

JACOBS Well, it has deeply uncomfortable resonance right now, but the Moldavian Massacre was the most memorable to me. That was truly scary: terrorists, shattering glass, bloodied bodies. Better make it a martini.

HEALY Gruesome images — and then, cue the credits.

JACOBS It took place during a royal wedding, with the bride, Amanda Carrington, played by real-life royalty, Catherine Oxenberg. Somehow the “Dy” in “Dynasty” was all bound up in my head with Princess Diana, and her own royal wedding to Prince Charles (never mind that the English pronounced it “Din-asty”). Obviously this was a time of conservatism and convention and backlash to the progressivism of the ’60s and ’70s.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

HEALY The depiction of so many women on “Dallas” as sexual objects and playthings definitely ran counter to progressivism. But “Dynasty” and “Dallas” could be topical, too.

JACOBS “Dynasty” moved the national conversation forward on homosexuality. Steven Carrington is immediately introduced as being attracted to men, and despite tentativeness in how the show presented his orientation, one felt the creators were basically on his side — don’t you think? He was a likable and complex character, not a caricature.

Then, of course, Rock Hudson’s death shortly after appearing on the show provoked national hysteria that he might have infected Linda Evans with H.I.V. by kissing her, which led to important education about how the disease is actually transmitted.

It was dismissed for being superficial but was actually right on top of the issues! And it had a few African-American cast members, notably the great Diahann Carroll as the mega-glam Dominique Deveraux. Did “Dallas” have a single minority?

HEALY “Dallas” was an extraordinarily white show. For a state as racially and ethnically diverse as Texas, the series really failed by reducing people of color to servants and waitresses.

It did strive for some social relevancy, though, with its portrait of alcoholism. Sue Ellen struggled for years to get sober and stay sober: J. R. made serenity impossible, but it was really Sue Ellen’s battle with low self-esteem, betrayal, envy and self-loathing that proved painful to watch through her relapses — but ultimately pretty inspiring as she achieved stretches of sobriety.

With the stabs at realism came the fantastical. I speak, of course, about the Mortal Sin of “Dallas” — the entire season of episodes that was retroactively labeled a “dream” of Pam’s to explain Bobby’s death and subsequent reappearance in her shower. What was the best twist of “Dynasty”?

JACOBS I don’t recall anything as shocking as the gasp-inducing “scar” reveal by Marcia Cross on “Melrose Place,” but the return of regular-guy Matthew Blaisdel at the end of Season 7 was certainly unexpected. It was no surprise whatsoever to me, though, at that point, that he had elected to hold the Carrington family hostage.

And speaking of “Melrose,” that brings us to the current reboot, which stars Grant Show as Blake. How do you think it will stack up against the “Dallas” one a few years ago?

HEALY Watching the new “Dynasty,” I missed the old “Dynasty.” The new versions of both “Dynasty” and “Dallas” go young with their actors. But the “Dallas” reboot still had J. R., Sue Ellen and Bobby, and they were up to their old tricks and in fine form. If only Joan Collins wasreprising her role as Alexis in the “Dynasty” reboot, as a cougar to middle-aged Blake!

Tricky Clues

1A: “Agcy. for Kennedy and Reagan” is TSA because the clue is referring to the airports, not the presidents after which they are named.

28A: PREGGERS makes its New York Times crossword debut today, clued as “With child, informally.”

122A: This was too good to pass up. At first, I thought these were the kind of chocolate cups you make using a balloon and melted chocolate, but it turns out that we’re talking about the universe’s gift to personkind, the REESE’s peanut butter cup. And the man who first got peanut butter in his chocolate was H.B. REESE. I made sure to indulge in a few of these cups, just to make absolutely sure they were still a thing. No need to thank me. I’m happy to do the research so you don’t have to.

11D: A pun that rhymes. “Divine bovine?” is a SACRED COW.

39D: I think this clue is a nod to Brendan Emmett Quigley’s 2001 debut of the entry “WHY, YOU LITTLE ...” and it’s a great one. The answer, “SON OF A ...,” is also fairly unique, as it was used once in a 1965 puzzle as a fill-in-the-blank clue referring to a biblical quote.

43D: Clue of the Day, in my opinion. “Several quarter turns?” does not refer to actually turning something manually or screwing something in. It refers to the action of a COIN TOSS, when a quarter is turning in the air. I love visually evocative clues like that.

80D: A “System of roots?” sounds on the surface like it refers to a plant. Today it refers to ETYMOLOGY, the study of the origins of words, their roots, and how language has changed over time.

Constructor Notes

Erik Agard: Music and wordplay are but two of Alex’s superpowers (you can see some of her punny drawings on her Instagram), so when this puzzle’s then-half-formed theme needed rescuing, I knew who to shine the Bat Signal for. Through a couple revisions and upwards of a hundred emails, the collaboration was always fun, and I’m looking forward to her next puzzle. Alex Briñas: Erik was the true superhero here — he zipped nimbly through the bulk of the work and picked up after all my snafus. I’m a super-newbie to everything in the crossword world, but I do enjoy myself a good pun every now and then, so this was fascinating and foreign and exciting and daunting all at once. And I owe much thanks to Erik for inviting me to sidekick this mission in the first place. For your enjoyment (we hope), here are some of the theme answers from the cutting room floor: [Human Torch’s favorite band?] (3,7,4) [Blade’s favorite band?] (7,7) [Wonder Twins’ favorite band?] (5) [Storm’s favorite rapper?] (6) [Beast’s favorite singer?] (6) [Wolverine’s favorite guitarist?] (5) [Lady Deathstrike’s favorite band?] (13) [Banshee’s favorite band?] (5,5)

INDOORS Theron Potter Healy, an architect known as the King of the Queen Anne for his ornate Victorian residences, designed this house after visiting the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, which inspired him to tone down his style a bit. Even so, the house is filled with original details: first-cut oak hardwood floors and oak and cherry moldings; fireplace tiles; paneled doors; period light fixtures; cabinetry testifying to the architect’s previous life as a shipbuilder; and a stained-glass triptych at the base of the curving staircase that depicts a rising phoenix. The main floor has a large foyer, a pair of parlors, a dining room and a 156-square-foot kitchen. The original butler’s pantry was turned into a bathroom with a copper sink.

The second floor has four bedrooms, including a master and an adjoining sitting room that span the building’s width at the front. A full bathroom retains many original details, including a claw foot tub.

An unfinished third floor is topped with a vaulted pine-board ceiling.

OUTDOOR SPACE The house has a deep front porch and low-maintenance backyard with native plantings and two decks. A two-car garage can be reached from the yard or via a back alley (the structure opens on two sides).

HOW MUCH $515,000

SIZE 1,900 square feet

PRICE PER SQUARE FOOT $271

SETTING The house is part of the Greater World Community, a 340-acre subdivision with about 70 off-grid homes, 20 minutes south of Taos. It sits at 6,800 feet, with views of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains.

INDOORS Designed by Michael Reynolds, a longtime practitioner of sustainable architecture, the house is built with earth-filled tires that retain and release heat. Despite the region’s extreme weather conditions, the temperature inside is consistently about 70 degrees. The house produces its own electricity, collects and filters water from rain and snowmelt, and treats sewage on site. Gray water is recycled for plants in a greenhouse that runs the length of the building and includes a fishpond. Natural ventilation is provided through buried cooling tubes and operable vent boxes.

The interior contains a kitchen that opens onto a living-and-dining area and two bedrooms, each with its own bathroom. Custom and energy-saving features include copper kitchen counters, energy-efficient appliances, decorative stained glass made from recycled bottles, and clay-based paint throughout. The floors are flagstone and concrete.

OUTDOOR SPACE The 1.8-acre lot has a walled yard and flagstone patio with mountain views. The house has an attached one-and-a-half-car garage.

Prepare for PushbackNot everyone might be thrilled you’re having an intimate wedding.
Yes, You Should Still Create a Registry“No matter what size or type of wedding you’re having, it’s always a good idea to register,” said Kathy McTigue, Bloomingdale’s director of The Registry.
Not everyone agrees that having a registry is a necessity, but for us, it came in quite handy.
Her advice to others considering a microwedding: “Allow yourself to create the wedding.","Christina Friedrichsen, founder of IntimateWeddings.com and author of “Intimate Weddings: Planning a Small Wedding That Fits Your Budget and Style,” understands why couples are embracing the shift: “There is an overall trend towards minimalism and simplicity, and that goes for weddings too.”

“Planning a traditional wedding takes a great deal of time and energy,” Ms. Friedrichsen said. “So many people are overwhelmed just dealing with the pressures of day-to-day life; they simply don’t want the added stress of orchestrating a large event. Decision fatigue is real; a tiny wedding helps to alleviate some of that.”

“Microweddings afford a lot more flexibility and they’re easier on the budget,” Tatiana Brenizer, a Brooklyn-based wedding photographer, said. She and her husband, Ryan Brenizer, shoot about a dozen microweddings a year. They even celebrated their own microwedding in Prospect Park on June 9, 2015.

But the small size of microweddings doesn’t mean they’re headache-free. Here’s what you should know if you’re thinking about having one.

Prepare for Pushback

Not everyone might be thrilled you’re having an intimate wedding. Feelings might be hurt when you limit the guest list so severely, as it might go against expectations that friends and family members had that they would be invited to celebrate.

Approaching the subject with confidence is key.

“The more secure and confident a couple is when they drop this bomb on their family,” Ms. Tongg said, “the easier that they’ll take it.” She suggests sharing beautiful pictures of your wedding on social media to take the sting out of it for people who couldn’t attend. Once they see how private the ceremony was, she reasoned, people are more likely to understand why they weren’t invited.

Decide on Must-Haves

Every couple’s must-haves are different, but for a smaller wedding with a teensy budget, you should narrow down the essentials. Because I have a sweet tooth, my only must-have for my wedding was a custom cake from my favorite bakery. Mike’s only requirement was having a nonreligious ceremony, as I’m Jewish and he’s Catholic and he didn’t want to give the appearance of favoring one family’s traditions over another.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

For other couples, their must-have can be a particular location that holds sentimental value, like the couple’s first date or first kiss.

“Consider a place that’s meaningful,” Ms. Brenizer said. She suggests scouting the location at the time of day you’re planning on getting married to see what the crowds are like.

Yes, You Should Still Create a Registry

“No matter what size or type of wedding you’re having, it’s always a good idea to register,” said Kathy McTigue, Bloomingdale’s director of The Registry. “Many couples that have microweddings organize less formal get-togethers and celebrations leading up to the wedding date, and their friends and family members may want to throw them parties as well. Many people will want to get gifts for these events.”

Ms. McTigue also recommended registering for enough gifts to allow those who attend to have a nice selection to choose from across a variety of price points.

Not everyone agrees that having a registry is a necessity, but for us, it came in quite handy. We were surprised when co-workers, long-distance friends and relatives who weren’t invited to the wedding still wanted to buy us gifts. By assembling a reasonable registry, we not only helped guide them, but we also received items we could actually use.

If You Can Get Married in It, It’s a Wedding Outfit

Maggie Winters Gaudaen, co-founder of Washington’s Pop! Wed Co. and author of “Fun Size Weddings: The Simple Guide to Planning a Tiny Wedding You’ll Love,” says that when it comes to microwedding attire, there are no rules.

“There are nudist weddings out there. There are weddings where people spend $15,000 on a beautiful dress. There are weddings where people get married dressed up like their favorite character from a movie,” Ms. Gaudaen said. “You can get married in anything as long as that is the outfit you feel amazing in.”

Small Receptions Offer Lots of Freedom

In the same way attire and location are open to customization, receptions for microweddings can be tailored to reflect the interests and needs of the couple. Aside from being cheaper to facilitate, smaller receptions allow the wedded couple to spend quality time with each guest, something brides and grooms aren’t usually able to do when entertaining larger wedding parties.

As an elopement planner, Ms. Gaudaen helps organize a variety of small wedding receptions. She’s seen couples celebrate their union with a picnic in the park or renting out space at a bar or restaurant. One couple even had a group sleepover at a campground.

Sometimes newlyweds forgo a reception altogether, instead opting to hit the road and celebrate with their far-flung relatives. “Some of our couples will have multiple parties,” Ms. Gaudaen said. “One couple had a party for their D.C.-area family and then had a party for the Minnesota-area family a couple of months later.”

It’s Still a Wedding and Vendors Will Charge Accordingly

Even though I was unusually low key about my wedding, vendors still charged wedding prices. My beloved bakery charged us wedding prices even though our cake was for a smaller number of people than they would usually prepare an order for.

“You can get Ubers for 12 guests in ways that you probably can’t for 100,” Mr. Brenizer said. “But you still have all of those same considerations: weather, transportation, flowers, your music, your photography. Every time that you hire a vendor, you still have to consider contracts and payment and all of that stuff just the same.”

Appoint a Coordinator

It was stressful fielding text messages and coordinating transportation while simultaneously applying mascara and squirming into my Spanx before the main event. If I had to do my wedding over again, I would appoint a coordinator — perhaps a relative or trusted friend — for the day of the wedding to be a contact for those last-minute details.

“I would suggest because everyone’s all embedded together for the whole day, getting ready, driving to the ceremony, the ceremony, and going out to dinner, I think you could use maybe a day-of coordinator,” Ms. Tongg said. “You need to enjoy and not be trying to keep people organized or keep looking at the watch.”

It can be especially tough when you’re bringing two families together and everyone’s sense of time and urgency is different. For that reason, “you need somebody to be the buffer,” she recommends.

Embrace Flexibility

Andy Mills and his wife, Geri Cole, had their microwedding on Sept. 14, 2014, on Fire Island with about a dozen of their immediate family in attendance.

“We decided to have a small wedding because we realized how expensive weddings are and it wasn’t an expense we thought we wanted to spend,” Ms. Cole said.

For their ceremony, Ms. Cole maintained some traditions and ditched others. She didn’t wear a white dress and didn’t get married in a church, but she still jumped the broom. “When you choose to detach yourself from all cultural customs of what a wedding is supposed to be, it’s actually really liberating,” Ms. Cole said.

Use one or both hands to maintain firm, steady pressure directly on the bleeding site.
If the bleeding still does not stop, a second tourniquet can be placed closer to the torso.
If the victim is suffering from a gunshot to the head or abdomen, you should also apply pressure to stop bleeding, but the victim is less likely to survive, Dr. Jacobs warned.
The American Red Cross also addresses ways to stop bleeding in its first aid and CPR classes, and has a first aid app that includes information about controlling bleeding.","Since a severe injury can lead to life-threatening blood loss within minutes, time is of the essence, and ordinary citizens who just happen to be nearby are often in the best position to intervene.

Even if you have no medical background, you can master some simple techniques for stopping a bleed by taking an hourlong class, going online or downloading an app.

Contact with another person’s blood can potentially expose you to blood-borne diseases such as H.I.V. and hepatitis B and C. Use gloves if they are available.

“It’s very simple to do, it’s inexpensive and it doesn’t take a lot of time,” said Dr. Lenworth M. Jacobs, a trauma surgeon and director of the trauma institute at Hartford Hospital in Hartford, Conn., who started an initiative to increase survivability after mass shooting events, motivated by the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings in 2012.

There are several techniques for stopping bleeding. The first step is to expose the skin so you can see where the bleeding is coming from.

Use one or both hands to maintain firm, steady pressure directly on the bleeding site. You can also use your knee, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.

A second option is to use a bandage or commercial dressing designed to stop bleeding, called a hemostatic dressing, if available, or clothing, to apply firm, steady pressure to the site.

If the bleeding persists, place a tourniquet on a limb two to three inches closer to the torso from the bleeding and tighten until the bleeding stops (a tourniquet can be applied over clothing). If the bleeding still does not stop, a second tourniquet can be placed closer to the torso. If the injury is in a joint like the shoulder or the groin, pack the wound with gauze but do not use a tourniquet, said Paul Brooks, program manager for the Stop the Bleed Program run by the Office of Health Affairs at the Department of Homeland Security, which the Obama administration started in 2015.

If the victim is suffering from a gunshot to the head or abdomen, you should also apply pressure to stop bleeding, but the victim is less likely to survive, Dr. Jacobs warned.

Be aware that applying pressure on a wound can be very painful to the injured person, and it is important to talk the victim through the procedure and explain that the pain is necessary, and that help is on the way.

“You need to speak to them with kindness and explain it to them and say, ‘Hold on, we’re going to stop the bleeding; we’re going to get you to care.’ That makes a huge difference,” Dr. Jacobs said.

Though some bystanders may be afraid of touching a bleeding gunshot victim, or of causing further pain by improperly tying an improvised tourniquet, experts say that having the training is empowering and provides the tools to take action. The skills can be applied to bleeding injuries of all kinds, from kitchen accidents involving knives to automobile accidents.

In some public places like airport or shopping malls, specialized bleeding control kits that contain hemostatic bandages and tourniquets might be available, but they are not as ubiquitously stocked as automated external defibrillators, which are used to treat people with heart arrhythmias.

Blood loss is extremely dangerous, causing a cascade of medical events, including a drop in body temperature that affects clotting, exacerbating blood loss even further. Once people lose about 20 percent of their blood volume they go into a condition called irreversible shock, Mr. Brooks said. “It’s a downward spiral we can’t recover from.”

Resources include the Department of Homeland Security’s Stop the Bleed website and the American College of Surgeons site, where you can search for a Bleeding Control Basics class in your geographic region. The classes are an hour long and most are offered at no cost.

Educational programs recommended by the Department of Homeland Security include the First Care Provider Program and Until Help Arrives.

The American Red Cross also addresses ways to stop bleeding in its first aid and CPR classes, and has a first aid app that includes information about controlling bleeding.",How to Stop Bleeding and Save a Life,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/well/live/bleeding-first-aid.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

5A: Hi, kids! I wasn’t around for ADLAI Stevenson’s presidential campaign either, but I got this and I’ll explain how I did it.

In the mid-20th century, it was apparently fashionable among campaign slogan writers to try to make their slogans rhyme, primarily because it would have been considered laughable at the time to suggest that the candidate might want to have a beer with anyone who wasn’t at least a governor. Slogan writers would sit in small, smoke-filled offices with long lists of words that rhymed with their candidate’s name (“Badly for Adlai?” “No. ...” “Sadly for Adlai?” No!”), and they were released only when they hit on something that was not terrible and could fit on a campaign button. My point is, if you see a clue like “‘Madly for ___’ (1952 campaign slogan),” you have enough information to know that you should be thinking about a midcentury candidate whose name rhymed with “madly.”

42A: The holy Kaaba is a CUBE-shaped mosque in the town of Makka.

49A/57D: It’s unusual to see two words that are so close in current meaning in the same puzzle (YEARN and YENS), especially when they are clued so similarly. The etymology of the two words is different, however, so it’s allowable.

67A: “Even Homer NODS” is an idiom that means that even people who are the best at something can make mistakes during a momentary lapse in concentration. It’s an allusion to the epic poet Homer’s work, which apparently contains errors in continuity.

25D: This is not a comment on SEURAT’s mental health. “Artist who went dotty?” is a comment on his use of pointillism.

Prosecutors said the police did not have enough proof to show beyond a reasonable doubt every element of the two charges they could bring: forcible touching or third-degree sexual abuse. To prove either crime, the state must show the accused person touched someone to degrade them or for sexual gratification, not some other purpose.

Ms. Battilana had told the police she and Mr. Weinstein were discussing the possibility of her becoming a lingerie model when he asked if her breasts were natural or augmented and then touched her, two law enforcement officials familiar with the investigation said.

The project was removed from Fort Schuyler’s oversight in 2016, and given to Empire State Development, the state agency that oversees many of the governor’s economic development efforts.

The move came after Alain E. Kaloyeros, an innovative nanotechnologist and the president of the State University of New York Polytechnic Institute, was arrested on charges of corruption. Mr. Kaloyeros, who was the driving force behind the governor’s many nanotechnology investments, was accused of violating the state’s construction bidding rules by steering lucrative development deals to handpicked favorites, including COR.

My brother, Marcus, paced back and forth, checking to see if the windows and doors to our home were still intact.

We all worried about my father, who is 80 and has Alzheimer’s. He was crouched in his wheelchair, and we feared he might suffer another seizure like the one that nearly took his life in July.

When the winds finally quieted, I ventured out to the yard. As I had after Hurricane Irma, I had to navigate downed electric wires and pieces of neighbors’ roofs.

St. Thomas’s narrow, winding roads were an obstacle course, blocked by floodwaters, snapped light poles, crumbled houses and uprooted trees. Residents were already out with chain saws clearing as many fallen trees and poles they could.

The long lines for food at the grocery stores and local feeding center (originally a nonprofit focused on youth enrichment) told us the news of Puerto Rico’s devastation. Our main supply line had been destroyed.

After grabbing a tarp I returned home to find my neighbor Robert sitting in his green pickup truck waiting to help me, just as he had after Hurricane Irma.

“You’re ready to head back up again, bro?” Robert said, grinning. “I know Mother Bailey doesn’t want any more water wetting her.”

A sturdy six feet tall with a shiny bald head and a goatee, a parishioner at my mother’s church, Robert was a roofer in his native Grenada. There, he learned to build stormproof roofs after Hurricane Ivan barreled through in 2004. We used that expertise to build the best makeshift roof we could by gathering actual pieces of our roof. Piece by piece we nailed them together like a puzzle before covering the roof with the new tarp.

Below us, his 9-year-old son, R.J., amused himself with the hermit crabs, forced out of their caves by flooding, scurrying around the yard.

Robert and I gave each other high-fives after we finished our second makeshift roof. Then our small talk turned to whether our fellow Americans on the mainland cared about us.

Our governor, Kenneth Mapp, reminds us of our resilience in his daily radio news conferences, often saying, “We will be a constant force in our own recovery.”

But Robert saw things a different way. “It feels like we’ve been left to ourselves,” he said. “Bro, you think Trump will visit?”

Before I could answer, the sunset reminded us of the daily 6 p.m. curfew, so Robert and R.J. headed home.

That night while I took my usual bath outside with a bucket of water under the moonlight, I thought about Robert’s question. In fact, I’ve thought about it ever since.

Daily life on these storm-ravaged islands is taxing indeed. Commercial flights have finally been cleared to fly, sparingly, and seriously ill patients in our battered hospitals have had to be airlifted off the island. Hundreds of people remain in shelters, with many on waiting lists for mercy flights.

I think of my father’s illness and the possibility of another seizure. But my family is resilient, as Governor Mapp keeps saying. We’ve had the greatest storms thrown at us — and survived.

Nonetheless, many here in what’s billed as “America’s Paradise” are disappointed that our struggles have been overshadowed by the devastation in Puerto Rico, a short distance away.

As for President Trump’s visit, one that was anticipated here for weeks, the commander in chief instead opted to have Governor Mapp meet him aboard the assault ship Kearsarge off Puerto Rico. (Trump’s apparent snub was probably for the best, sparing us the embarrassment of being tossed paper towels.)

Military personnel have finally started to reach the island to help in the recovery. Some jog past our house in the mornings since we live close to the National Guard armory.

And it’s meant to be tweaked as needs change. “This continues to be iterated,” said Frank Cuevas, who is working on a major redesign at IBM — and whose use of the word “iterated” hints at the kind of start-up mentality the changes are intended to evoke.

“It’s not something we’re going stop and say, ‘This is it,’” he said.

The corporations setting the new standard are not young Silicon Valley companies known for free food, slides and foosball tables at work — or for carefree spending, as at Apple, whose new corporate mothership cost a reported $5 billion. Nor are the designs one-of-a-kind projects that veer toward eccentricity. Salesforce’s new skyscraper campus in San Francisco, for example, has areas on every floor for meditation, partly inspired by the teachings of Thich Nhat Hanh, a Buddhist monk.

Instead, the companies behind the emerging new norm in workplace design are a lineup of more staid companies across a range of industries, and they may spend heavily but also systematically. They include Microsoft, IBM and General Electric. Certain workspace innovations may surface first at Google or Facebook, but the older stalwarts are combining and refining them for mainstream businesses.

“These workplace ideas are beginning to be adopted across all industries,” said Arlyn Vogelmann, a principal at Gensler, an architecture and design firm whose clients include Facebook and G.E.

The new designs are not about looks. They are an attempt to adapt to the spread of internet-era digital technology — and its hurry-up ways — into every industry. Space drives behavior, experts say, and the goal of the new designs is to hasten the pace of sharing ideas, making decisions and creating new products. They are also meant to appeal to millennial recruits, many of whom are more comfortable working in a Starbucks than in a traditional office.

The new model eschews the common dogmas of work life: Everybody gets an office, or everyone gets a cubicle, or everybody gets a seat on a workbench. A diversity of spaces, experts say, is more productive, and the new concept is called “activity-based workplace design,” tailoring spaces for the kind of work done.

“Office geography matters, and it can be a key managerial lever to increase communication and the cross-fertilization of ideas,” said Christopher Liu, an assistant professor at the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto.

One of the most aggressive makeovers is happening at Microsoft, a change forced by business necessity. The company faces a new wave of technology, as the market has shifted to software delivered and constantly updated as a service over the internet cloud, as opposed to being loaded onto individual computers, with the code often stored on compact discs and sold as a product every few years. To compete, Microsoft has had to adopt a faster pace.

“You have to collaborate more,” said Michael Ford, Microsoft’s general manager of global real estate. “We absolutely have to change.”

For decades, the company, based outside Seattle, housed its software engineers in secluded offices, thinking that the privacy helped employees focus while writing computer code. But in 2010, Microsoft started testing open designs with a quarter of a floor, and then expanded. Since 2014, it has opened 10 renovated buildings without offices, including four this year.

Microsoft, Mr. Ford said, has taken a test-and-learn approach. It learned, for example, that its early designs were too open plan, with 16 to 24 engineers in team-based spaces. Engineers found those spaces noisy and distracting, and concentration suffered. Too much openness can cause workers to “do a turtle,” researchers say, and retrench and communicate less — colleagues who retreat into their headphones all day, for example

Today, there are more private spaces, and the team areas hold only eight to 12 engineers. “That’s the sweet spot for Microsoft,” Mr. Ford said.

The company thinks it is working. Microsoft’s Azure cloud software business has surged in the last few years, as has the company’s stock price. Mr. Ford said about 20 percent of the workplaces have been redone on Microsoft’s campus in Redmond, Wash., and the surrounding area. Within five years, he said, he expects the renovated share to reach 80 percent.

Offices, he said, will not disappear entirely, but they will be reserved mainly for people who regularly have confidential conversations, like lawyers and top executives.",Don’t Get Too Comfortable at That Desk,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/business/the-office-gets-remade-again.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

“It’s not something we’re going stop and say, ‘This is it,’” he said.

The corporations setting the new standard are not young Silicon Valley companies known for free food, slides and foosball tables at work — or for carefree spending, as at Apple, whose new corporate mothership cost a reported $5 billion. Nor are the designs one-of-a-kind projects that veer toward eccentricity. Salesforce’s new skyscraper campus in San Francisco, for example, has areas on every floor for meditation, partly inspired by the teachings of Thich Nhat Hanh, a Buddhist monk.

Instead, the companies behind the emerging new norm in workplace design are a lineup of more staid companies across a range of industries, and they may spend heavily but also systematically. They include Microsoft, IBM and General Electric. Certain workspace innovations may surface first at Google or Facebook, but the older stalwarts are combining and refining them for mainstream businesses.

“These workplace ideas are beginning to be adopted across all industries,” said Arlyn Vogelmann, a principal at Gensler, an architecture and design firm whose clients include Facebook and G.E.

The new designs are not about looks. They are an attempt to adapt to the spread of internet-era digital technology — and its hurry-up ways — into every industry. Space drives behavior, experts say, and the goal of the new designs is to hasten the pace of sharing ideas, making decisions and creating new products. They are also meant to appeal to millennial recruits, many of whom are more comfortable working in a Starbucks than in a traditional office.

The new model eschews the common dogmas of work life: Everybody gets an office, or everyone gets a cubicle, or everybody gets a seat on a workbench. A diversity of spaces, experts say, is more productive, and the new concept is called “activity-based workplace design,” tailoring spaces for the kind of work done.

“Office geography matters, and it can be a key managerial lever to increase communication and the cross-fertilization of ideas,” said Christopher Liu, an assistant professor at the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto.

One of the most aggressive makeovers is happening at Microsoft, a change forced by business necessity. The company faces a new wave of technology, as the market has shifted to software delivered and constantly updated as a service over the internet cloud, as opposed to being loaded onto individual computers, with the code often stored on compact discs and sold as a product every few years. To compete, Microsoft has had to adopt a faster pace.

“You have to collaborate more,” said Michael Ford, Microsoft’s general manager of global real estate. “We absolutely have to change.”

For decades, the company, based outside Seattle, housed its software engineers in secluded offices, thinking that the privacy helped employees focus while writing computer code. But in 2010, Microsoft started testing open designs with a quarter of a floor, and then expanded. Since 2014, it has opened 10 renovated buildings without offices, including four this year.

Microsoft, Mr. Ford said, has taken a test-and-learn approach. It learned, for example, that its early designs were too open plan, with 16 to 24 engineers in team-based spaces. Engineers found those spaces noisy and distracting, and concentration suffered. Too much openness can cause workers to “do a turtle,” researchers say, and retrench and communicate less — colleagues who retreat into their headphones all day, for example

Today, there are more private spaces, and the team areas hold only eight to 12 engineers. “That’s the sweet spot for Microsoft,” Mr. Ford said.

The company thinks it is working. Microsoft’s Azure cloud software business has surged in the last few years, as has the company’s stock price. Mr. Ford said about 20 percent of the workplaces have been redone on Microsoft’s campus in Redmond, Wash., and the surrounding area. Within five years, he said, he expects the renovated share to reach 80 percent.

Offices, he said, will not disappear entirely, but they will be reserved mainly for people who regularly have confidential conversations, like lawyers and top executives.",Don’t Get Too Comfortable at That Desk,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/business/the-office-gets-remade-again.html

MONDAY PUZZLE — Happy Monday, all! Sam Ezersky here again. You may remember me from my “big break” two weeks ago or my diagramless in yesterday’s Magazine. Either way, I’ll be sticking around through Friday, and I promise I don’t bite. [Can confirm. — D.A.]

Let me start by sharing a little secret from my constructing perspective: A solid Monday puzzle is surprisingly hard to create. The theme should not only be exciting on its own, but must also appeal to solvers with widely varying backgrounds and skill levels. On top of this, the surrounding fill should not only be squeaky clean, but largely familiar. Thus, I’m always excited to see Bruce Haight’s byline early in the week, as I know he can produce a top-notch crossword given these criteria. Today’s offering was no disappointment.

Today’s Theme

Bruce has treated us to five, rhyming _ _ _ _ Y - _ _ _ _ Y phrases that cross at the middle letter:

17A/3D: “Useful” = HANDY-DANDY 19A/11D: “Snobbish” = HOITY-TOITY 39A/29D: “Sophisticated” = HOTSY-TOTSY 58A/48D: “Affectionate” = LOVEY-DOVEY 60A/51D: “Weak and indecisive” = NAMBY-PAMBY

Themes don’t get much more straightforward than this, but this is cute and well-crafted, especially since all answers are adjectival phrases as opposed to, say, HOKEY POKEY or LAFFY TAFFY.

It’s also a testament to how helpful the theme can be for getting toeholds elsewhere in the puzzle. Having trouble in the bottom-left corner, where there isn’t an easy three- or four-letter answer in sight? Well, if you’ve caught on to the theme in other areas of the grid, then filling in LOVEY/DOVEY shouldn’t be a problem, and boom! You may have just enough letters to grok answers like SILTS, SAY-SO and perhaps even HONEY-DO.

He said Evans tried to emulate in America what Atget did in Paris.

PhotoIn an interview with Lincoln Kirstein, who wrote an essay for Evans’s 1938 book “American Photographs,” Evans said, “Take Atget, whose work I now know very well.","From grizzled cotton farmers to quiet small-town buildings and roadside stands, Walker Evans built his reputation on chronicling America’s out-of-the-way places and people. And while he was a prodigious chronicler of vernacular American culture, his own roots were hardly common. Born Walker Evans III, the scion of a prominent family, he grew up in privilege, attending Phillips Academy and then Williams College, dropping out after one year.

A turning point for Evans was his decision — like many young men of means — to go to Paris in 1926 to study for a year at the Sorbonne. His stay filled his head with ideas gleaned from Flaubert and Baudelaire, but it was another Frenchman — Eugène Atget — whose work affected him the most, leading to the dry, observational style that became his visual signature.

Clément Chéroux, a French curator, organized a massive Walker Evans retrospective at the Centre Pompidou in Paris, which recently traveled to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, (where he is now the head of the photography department). He said Evans tried to emulate in America what Atget did in Paris.

“Atget has tried to define, through his photographs — what is the Parisian vernacular? What is the visual spirit of Paris? And Evans has done exactly the same with America,” Mr. Chéroux said. “What is so interesting for me, in this exchange between American and French culture, is that he has tried to define the American vernacular culture, but with the method and style of French culture.”

Evans embodied a paradox: a member of the American elite drawn to unfussy places, urban workers and desperate farmers, becoming best known for his seminal project with James Agee, “Let Us Now Praise Famous Men,” about America’s poor and downtrodden during the Great Depression.

For Mr. Chéroux, this paradox was an interesting way to understand Evans. The curator has done scholarly research into the vernacular, which he defines as “useful, domestic and popular” in an essay in the exhibition catalog. “Maybe one of the reasons why I’m fascinated with Evans is because there is so much paradox in his work,” he said. “There is this dialectical tension between Europe and the U.S., and there is also this very strong dialectical tension between an aristocratic or elite point of view, and a subject which is definitely popular culture, and workers.”

The specific nature of the Atget-Evans vision, with its emphasis on large format, razor sharp, perfectly observed, almost preternaturally quiet moments, allows the photographs to impress viewers nearly a century later. Evans had a simple explanation: Atget’s photographs had a transcendent quality, which he tried to emulate.

In an interview with Lincoln Kirstein, who wrote an essay for Evans’s 1938 book “American Photographs,” Evans said, “Take Atget, whose work I now know very well. In his work you do feel what some people call poetry. I do call it that also, but a better word for it, to me, is, well – when Atget does even a tree root, he transcends that thing. And by God somebody else does not.”

By looking at things previously unobserved, or subjects once thought beneath the purview of art, Evans created a vision of America that is still inextricable from our national identity. And while his initial exposure to Atget’s work might have been coincidental — his friend Berenice Abbott showed him a trove of the Frenchman’s work — his subsequent choice of subject matter was not.

In another essay in the exhibition catalog, Evans said his early work was influenced by his feelings about the United States. “I was really anti-American at the time,” he said. “America was a big business and I wanted to escape. It nauseated me. My photography was a semi-conscious reaction against right-thinking and optimism; it was an attack on the establishment. I could just hear my father saying, ‘Why do you want to look at those scenes, they’re depressing. Why don’t you look at the nice things in life?’ Nothing original about that though.”

This might be the key to understanding his role in the history of photography, as he heavily influenced subsequent generations, including the famed “New Topographics” movement of the 1970s. (When asked via email whether Evans’s work had inspired him and his colleagues, Stephen Shore simply replied, “Yes.”)

According to Mr. Chéroux, Evans was able to adopt a neutral stance and let the magic, or inherent tension, of a scene speak for itself. He notably contrasted this style against the showy, artsy technique employed by contemporaries like Alfred Stieglitz and the Modernists.

“He wants to disappear in front of his subject, to let this emotion transfer from the subject to the viewer,” he said of Evans. “I think this is really what he understood. It’s the reason why he is so close to Atget. All the photographers who think that the subject is more important than themselves are in this position.”

The retrospective, while focusing on the past, and including selections from Evans’s personal collection of vernacular art, also allows viewers to appreciate how photography, a slice out of time, relates to the present. In particular, his 1937 photographs showing people displaced by floods in the South are just as relevant today.

“That’s the power of art,” Mr. Chéroux said, “to address some historical questions, but to address them in the present time. To create a kind of effect that is both present and past, and I think this is something photography is really great at.”

INDOORS Theron Potter Healy, an architect known as the King of the Queen Anne for his ornate Victorian residences, designed this house after visiting the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, which inspired him to tone down his style a bit. Even so, the house is filled with original details: first-cut oak hardwood floors and oak and cherry moldings; fireplace tiles; paneled doors; period light fixtures; cabinetry testifying to the architect’s previous life as a shipbuilder; and a stained-glass triptych at the base of the curving staircase that depicts a rising phoenix. The main floor has a large foyer, a pair of parlors, a dining room and a 156-square-foot kitchen. The original butler’s pantry was turned into a bathroom with a copper sink.

The second floor has four bedrooms, including a master and an adjoining sitting room that span the building’s width at the front. A full bathroom retains many original details, including a claw foot tub.

An unfinished third floor is topped with a vaulted pine-board ceiling.

OUTDOOR SPACE The house has a deep front porch and low-maintenance backyard with native plantings and two decks. A two-car garage can be reached from the yard or via a back alley (the structure opens on two sides).

HOW MUCH $515,000

SIZE 1,900 square feet

PRICE PER SQUARE FOOT $271

SETTING The house is part of the Greater World Community, a 340-acre subdivision with about 70 off-grid homes, 20 minutes south of Taos. It sits at 6,800 feet, with views of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains.

INDOORS Designed by Michael Reynolds, a longtime practitioner of sustainable architecture, the house is built with earth-filled tires that retain and release heat.

Return of the ’80s! Synth-Pop Bands Stage a Middle-Aged Comeback

Image Clockwise from top left, videos from Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark; Erasure; Depeche Mode; and Alphaville. Credit

“Dynasty” is back on television. “Blade Runner” is in theaters. And all your favorite synth pop bands from the 1980s, including Depeche Mode and New Order, have new albums.

As Generation X moves into wistful middle age, the new-wave hit makers of the MTV V.J. era are back and touring. Here are some new long-playing discs (also available for streaming!) that recall a time when all it took was an angular haircut and a Yamaha DX7 to rule the world.

Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark

New release: “The Punishment of Luxury,” released Sept. 1, is the band’s 13th album (and its third since reforming in 2006). The 12-track album remains true to the band’s signature robo-pop sound and offers a rumination and indictment on have-it-all consumerism.

Synth Classics : “ Enola Gay ” (1980); “So In Love” (1985)

Liner notes: With their knack for infectious hooks, the founding members Andy McCluskey and Paul Humphreys have been called “the Lennon-McCartney of synth pop.” The hit single “ If You Leave ” is forever burned into Gen X consciousness, thanks to John Hughes’s Brat Pack film “Pretty in Pink.”

’80s fashion faux pas : Kraftwerk for the masses (skinny ties and black turtlenecks).

Reviews: “As returns to form go, this is like Roger Federer winning this year’s Wimbledon. No, forget that — it’s like John McEnroe or Bjorn Borg winning this year’s Wimbledon.” — God Is in the TV , a music fanzine based in Britain.

New Order

New release : Following its highly regarded 2015 album , “Music Complete,” the band released a live album in May, “NOMC15” on vinyl, CD and for download , featuring new tracks and ’80s classics. It comes after a bitter breakup with the original bassist, Peter Hook .

Synth classics : “Blue Monday” (1983), “Bizarre Love Triangle” (1986).

Liner notes: Formed by the surviving members of the seminal post-punk band Joy Division after the lead singer Ian Curtis’s suicide, this Manchester quartet fused angsty guitar rock, electronica and a little bit of disco to become one of the most influential bands of the last three decades.

’80s fashion faux pas: Schoolboy gone to seed (messy haircuts, rumpled button-down shirts).

Reviews: “Not the best way to experience New Order, but it nevertheless doesn’t take anything away from their timeless studio albums or their memorable live shows face to face.” — Under the Radar , an indie music magazine based in Virginia.

Depeche Mode

New release : Like other ’80s bands trying to navigate the Brexit and Trump era, Depeche Mode has gotten ever more woke. The band’s 14th studio album, “ Spirit ,” has fiery anthems like “Where’s the Revolution” and “ Going Backwards .”

Synth classics: “Just Can’t Get Enough” (1981), “Personal Jesus” (1989)



Liner notes : Depeche Mode turned synth pop into stadium rock with its 1988 show at the Rose Bowl that drew 65,000 people. It has been in a nonstop comeback in the three decades since. Currently packing arenas on a world tour, Depeche Mode sold out two shows at Madison Square Garden last month.

’80s fashion faux pas : Transylvania Leather Bar (goatees, slicked-back hair, black leather).

Reviews : “The music moves away from the club dance floor; it moves in six beats rather than four. And the lyrics are as bluntly political as old Depeche Mode songs like ‘New Dress,’ openly confronting a new propaganda regime.” — The New York Times .

Erasure

New release : “ World Be Gone,” the band’s 17th, was released in May and offers a more brooding Erasure, trading the disco frothiness for weighty social commentary on topics like political disenfranchisement on tracks like “Oh What a World.”

Synth classics: “Chains of Love ,” “A Little Respect” (1988)

Liner notes: After helping start Depeche Mode and Yaz, Vince Clarke put an ad in Melody Maker in 1985 for a singer. That led him to Andy Bell; the two spawned dozens of hits that became dance club staples and went on to sell more than 25 million albums .

’80s fashion faux pas: Glam goes electronic ( gold lamé , thigh-high boots ).

Reviews: “Whether you like Erasure’s 17th studio album will depend on how you feel about facing the world, in its current state, in the mirror. Musically it is not their strongest, but this is one such occasion where the lyrics overpower almost everything.” — musicOMH , a Britain-based indie music site.

Alphaville

New Release : Strange Attractor , the band’s first in seven years (and only its second in 20 years) was released in April, and goes beyond the band’s synthpop DNA to dabble in funk, industrial, and rockabilly. Marian Gold’s voice still sounds ethereal on haunting songs like “A Handful of Darkness.”

Synth classics: “Big in Japan ,” “Forever Young” (1984).

Liner notes : Along with Nena and Falco , this German outfit brought a Teutonic moodiness to the Day-Glo MTV era. Alphaville crossed over, however unintentionally, to a new generation when Jay-Z reinvented one of its biggest hits as “Young Forever” on his 2009 album, “The Blueprint 3.”

’80s fashion faux pas : Star Trek: Die Nächste Generation (military-style jumpsuits channeling the 23rd century).

Reviews : “Ultimately, ‘Strange Attractor’ is a take-it-or-leave-it Gold moment. After all, for an artist who has been operating with an array of sonispheric colors and hues for thirty-five years now, there is really nothing more to defy. Gold is simply making music the way he feels like it.” — Cryptic Rock , apparently your go-to site for music and horror coverage.

We are talking, in other words, about the American workplace. The administration might have saved itself a bunch of keystrokes by simply writing “anyone.” For the “moral” objectors, the universe described is slightly smaller, but only for the time being. Publicly traded companies are omitted from this privileged list for now, but the administration reserves the right to include them later and seems inclined to do so.

It’s hard to overstate the radical nature of what has just happened. Just three years ago, in the Hobby Lobby case, the Supreme Court ruled that the Obama administration could not impose the mandate on a closely held for-profit business owned by a family with religious objections to birth control.

But the decision did not end there. In his majority opinion, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. emphasized that the administration was already offering a workaround accommodation for religious nonprofit organizations that gave them a hands-free way to have birth control coverage available for their employees. All that these organizations had to do was notify the Department of Health and Human Services or their insurance administrators of their objection and the coverage would automatically flow to the female employees without any further involvement by the employer. The administration should do the same thing for Hobby Lobby and similar companies, the court said, emphasizing that the intended beneficiaries would suffer no loss of coverage: “The effect of the HHS-created accommodation on the women employed by Hobby Lobby and the other companies involved in these cases would be precisely zero. Under that accommodation, these women would still be entitled to all FDA-approved contraceptives without cost sharing.”

Now the Trump administration has played the Supreme Court justices for chumps. The accommodation, carefully worked out and fought over, is a thing of the past. In its place is a flat-out exemption, with no requirement that women be offered any alternative route to coverage. “There are multiple federal, state, and local programs that provide free or subsidized contraceptives for low-income women,” the administration explained airily, noting that “many forms of contraception are available for around $50 per month.” Further, “As the government is under no constitutional obligation to fund contraception, even more so may the government refrain from requiring private citizens to cover contraception for other citizens in violation of their religious beliefs.”

These statements call to mind a particularly callous old Supreme Court case, United States v. Kras, in which a man with an income of a few hundred dollars a month and unpaid bills of $6,000 tried to file for bankruptcy but ran up against the $50 filing fee. He challenged the constitutionality of the fee and lost. “There is no constitutional right to obtain a discharge of one’s debts in bankruptcy,” Justice Harry A. Blackmun wrote for the 5-to-4 majority, observing that the fee could be paid over time for about $2 a month — less, he pointed out, than the price of a movie. (This was 1973.) Justice Thurgood Marshall wrote a stinging dissent that accused the majority of having no understanding of how poor people actually live. “The desperately poor almost never go to see a movie, which the majority seems to believe is an almost weekly activity,” he wrote.

The administration says the average price of a year’s birth control is $584. That’s probably low (an IUD can cost $1,000 up front, but the administration amortizes that cost over the five-year life of the product) but that’s not really the point. Others have called attention to the administration’s truly astonishing effort to show that birth control really isn’t all that important and may even be counterproductive. Statements like the one on page 46 of the religious exemption document, “Contraception’s association with positive health effects might also be partially offset by an association with negative health effects,” are hogwash, the result of careful cherry-picking of the literature, some of it quite dubious. One cited article from the Ave Maria Law Review by Michael J. New, a well-known anti-abortion activist, insists that there is “little evidence that increasing the use of contraception reduces the unintended pregnancy rate.”

The real point is that the Trump administration has outsourced a crucially important building block of national health care policy, enabling a fanatical fringe of the Republican base to exercise raw political power, clothed in religiosity under cover of the grandiloquently named Religious Freedom Restoration Act. That 1993 law, passed by overwhelming bipartisan majorities and signed by President Bill Clinton, is the object of growing buyer’s remorse on the part of liberal and moderate Americans — and should be.

To fully appreciate what happened last week, it’s important to understand what happened in the years following the Hobby Lobby decision. The Obama administration did as the Supreme Court said and offered the accommodation as Justice Alito described it. But a group of religiously affiliated nonprofits, mainly but not exclusively Catholic-run schools, colleges, nursing homes and other social service organizations, refused to accept it. Not good enough, they said, claiming that they would still be complicit in the sin of contraception, even if the employees’ receipt of the benefit required no action on the employer’s part beyond notifying the government that it was opting out. Only the complete exemption offered to actual churches would suffice. (It’s hard to understand how these employers justify giving their employees a paycheck that might be used to buy birth control, but I guess that’s a private matter.) The nonprofits took the Obama administration to court and lost almost everywhere.

When seven cases reached the Supreme Court last year, consolidated under the name Zubik v. Burwell, the justices asked both sides whether they would accept an arrangement in which no opt-out notification was necessary. Yes, both said, resulting in the court’s decision to send the cases back to the lower courts to work out the details. But that was not to be. The administration insisted that no matter how the opt-out was handled, women must still be able to get “seamless” contraception coverage, that is, without having to apply for a separate plan and search for a doctor willing to accept the coverage. The nonprofits held fast and would not agree. The impasse lasted until the end of the Obama administration.

The Trump administration’s rescission of the government’s birth control mandate, not only for these organizations but also for others that never even got around to asking for it, is thus a reward for intransigence matched only by the Senate’s blockade of the Supreme Court vacancy intended for Merrick Garland that it eventually handed to Neil Gorsuch.

A half dozen lawsuits have already been filed against the federal government, and at least partial success in freezing or overturning the new rules is not out of the question. Putting the new policy into immediate effect without the usual “notice and comment” rule-making places the administration’s action on shaky procedural ground. Extending the rescission to employers with “moral” objections has no statutory basis. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act at least requires a claim that has something to do, however implausibly, with religion. It doesn’t, yet, license those who, like Melville’s Bartleby the Scrivener, “would prefer not to.”

I used to think — in fact, I wrote last year — that the resistance to the contraception mandate was fueled by cultural conservatives’ determination not to let federal policy normalize birth control. But now I think it’s deeper than that. Conservatives, even the publicly pious ones, don’t seem to have a problem with limiting the size of their families. (Vice President Mike Pence has two children, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions has three. Need I say more?) The problem they have is with what birth control signifies: empowering women — in school, on the job, in the home — to determine their life course. That’s what they don’t want to normalize. It comes as no surprise which side Donald Trump is on; his administration’s action last week makes perfect sense. Or none at all.","On Contraception, It’s Church Over State",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/opinion/contraception-religious-exemption.html

Emily Naismith, an Australian writer and co-host of the food podcast Ingredipedia, said that she, like many Australians, had eaten the salty, savory spread her entire life.

“I feel like Vegemite is the great equalizer through all of Australia,” she said. “I don’t know who they’re trying to service — which type of market.”

Anthony Agius, a Melbourne resident who says he has eaten Vegemite for 32 years, purchased the new product out of curiosity. “I eat a lot of Vegemite, so I figured, Why not try a new flavor? Maybe I’d like it more than original Vegemite.”

Mr. Agius said he could not easily distinguish the new blend from the original. “Really couldn’t tell the difference,” he said. “It’s maybe a bit more salty, if I think about it, but that’s it.”

Other customers took to Twitter to review the new version.

“Some people spread their Vegemite on lightly; some lather it on,” said Mr. Hill, the Vegemite marketer. “I particularly say for those who lather it on to try this special edition. The higher intensity of the Vegemite taste means they can use less and savor the jar for longer.”

When asked whether the new product may be a cynical, short-lived marketing ploy to draw attention and stoke lighthearted controversy, Mr. Hill simply encouraged Australians to “embrace the taste.” The company, he said, did not plan to reissue the product after its initial run of 450,000 units. But if the new blend proved popular, Mr. Hill said, Bega might keep making it.

President Trump has continued to fuel the controversy, directing insulting tweets this week at Jemele Hill of ESPN; the N.F.L.","About three weeks ago — before President Trump said that N.F.L. owners should fire players who kneel during the national anthem — Democrats and Republicans held relatively similar views about the league. About 60 percent said they viewed it favorably, while about 20 percent said they viewed it unfavorably, according to daily online surveys conducted by Morning Consult, a polling, media and technology company.

Since Mr. Trump’s remarks, though, many of his supporters have changed their attitudes.

Trump voters are now much more likely to say that they view the N.F.L. negatively, reflecting a sharp change around Sept. 23, when Mr. Trump criticized the players at a speech in Alabama. The views of Hillary Clinton voters have not changed appreciably over the last few weeks.

Some of the difference may be a result of our collective filter bubbles, which make Americans more likely to engage with and share articles that reinforce their views.

Both Democrats and Republicans were more likely to report seeing negative news about the N.F.L. around the time of Mr. Trump’s remarks in Alabama and the protests that followed. But Trump voters were much more likely to do so, while respondents who said they voted for Mrs. Clinton were more mixed in the coverage they reported seeing.

One possibility is that the two groups are not reading the same kinds of articles, avoiding those they disagree with. Another is that people are simply taking different attitudes away from the same articles, tweets and Facebook posts.

The shifts are not limited to professional football. After LeBron James tweeted his support for Stephen Curry, whose invitation to the White House was rescinded by Mr. Trump (after Mr. Curry indicated he wouldn’t attend), the share of Trump voters who said they held very unfavorable views of Mr. James more than doubled, to 23 percent from 11 percent. For Clinton voters, the opposite was true: The event made them like Mr. James more.

In other polls, Americans’ views on the N.F.L. protests depend largely on how the questions are asked, and whether they emphasize patriotism, free speech or race. And while N.F.L. ratings are down compared with previous years, protests are probably not the main reason.

A helpful way to consider Americans’ attitudes toward the N.F.L. and the N.B.A. is to compare them with their views on other things. Every day, Morning Consult conducts large online surveys of about 5,000 adults in the United States, asking respondents their opinions about hundreds of brands and companies.

Most of the time, ratings are consistent among people of different political parties. For example, Americans have favorable views of Oreos, Home Depot and Bed Bath & Beyond, regardless of who got their vote in 2016. (And, on the whole, both Trump and Clinton voters have slightly negative views of companies like Goldman Sachs and Philip Morris.)

But a tiny fraction of these companies are divisive, with politics shaping how Americans perceive them. The N.F.L. has moved near the top of this list in recent weeks:

The Most Polarizing Brands and Companies Measured by Morning Consult

The N.F.L. is now among the nation’s most divisive brands, behind Trump Hotels and a handful of media companies, including The New York Times.

It’s hard to know if or when Americans’ views of the N.F.L. will go back to how they were before these protests. President Trump has continued to fuel the controversy, directing insulting tweets this week at Jemele Hill of ESPN; the N.F.L. players who protested; and the league itself. On Sunday, Vice President Mike Pence walked out of an Indianapolis Colts game when some players on the visiting team knelt during the national anthem. (President Trump said he directed Mr. Pence to do so.)

But her teenage discovery that her grandmother’s town was once home to thousands of Jews who perished in the Holocaust set her on a different path: a 30-year journey documenting persecuted religious minorities around the world.

Today she no longer considers herself religious “in terms of attending church,” but she appreciates the spiritual passion and ecstasy she documents in religious settings in far-flung countries. “My work can be a kind of prayer,” she said. “With time, I understood that what is interesting to me is not God — but God in people.”

Her research has led her to photograph Sufis in northern Africa, Christians in the Middle East, Tibetan Buddhist monks, Old Believers in Eastern Europe, Voudou practitioners in Haiti and Hasids in Galilee. Photographs from her work since 2001 are now featured in a book, “Where Gods Whisper,” published by Contrasto Books.

She has documented the unspeakable cruelties committed in the name of religion as well as uplifting moments of fellowship among Jews, Christians and Muslims. Her mission, to photograph oppressed religious minorities, she said, is a “kind of moral and ethical necessity.”

As a teenager, she had photographed Russian Orthodox churches where she felt seduced by the mysticism and the smells, colors and sounds that washed over her. At 19, she wandered along the borders of eastern Poland searching for remnants of communities and interviewing Byzantine Christians, Jews and Muslim Tatars. She has continued this work in pilgrimages to holy sites across five continents — teaching herself photography along the way.

Her grandparents’ house in Warka was a veritable shrine. “In one corner stood Our Lady of Perpetual Help, in another Our Lady of Sorrows,” she said and on Good Friday the townsfolk gathered in a Baroque church overlooking the river, where they knelt in prayer.

She was 6 when she learned that this had not always been the case.

“Beyond the bridge there was a sand hill that reared up steep as a mountain to our young eyes,” she wrote in “God’s People: A Travel Into Another Europe,” an earlier book. “In winter, our favourite sport was sledding down it and breaking the ice around the willows on the riverbank. One day around Christmas, my sled hit a rock and when I looked closely, I could see strange signs under the snow. Digging with my hands, I unearthed a sculpted lion. This lion buried in the snow, with arcane signs like hieroglyphics, left me breathless with astonishment. I felt as if I had discovered something fabulous, like those great sea captains and explorers, Ahab, Fridtjof Nansen and Eric the Red, that I had read about in the books my grandfather kept for us on his bookshelf.”

Ms. Bulaj had stumbled upon remains of a vibrant Jewish culture that had once flourished in her grandmother’s town, but had withered under centuries of virulent anti-Semitism and had ultimately been destroyed during the Holocaust. It was the town’s “total silence” about their former neighbors that led Ms. Bulaj to dedicate her life to documenting religious minorities.

Ms. Bulaj’s photographs bring us into the lives of endangered and oppressed communities while revealing the enduring power of spiritual experiences. Her work is a spiritual experience, too.

“I photograph instinctively,” she said. “I am close to them, I am touching them, I am crying for them.”

• Why California’s blazes are so destructive.

Wildfires often break out in the state at this time of year, but “we’ve never seen anything like this,” said a woman whose parents died on Monday. Experts explain why 2017 has been so bad.

The confirmed death toll has risen to 23, and exhausted firefighters are stretched to their limits.

• Hollywood has a problem.

“It is an industry with a history of sexually exploiting younger female performers and stamping expiration dates on older ones. It is an industry that consistently denies female directors employment and contemptuously treats the female audience as a niche, a problem, an afterthought.”

Manohla Dargis, one of our chief movie critics, writes about the troubles in the industry she covers.

The Weinstein Company said that allegations of sexual harassment and assault by Harvey Weinstein came as “an utter surprise.” But it had been grappling with his behavior for at least two years, interviews and records show.

• “They threw my baby into a fire.”

From a camp in Bangladesh, a Rohingya Muslim refugee gave our South Asia bureau chief a deeply disturbing account of what happened in her village in Myanmar, where the military is accused of a campaign of slaughter and rape.

Back Story

The controversy over football players kneeling during the U.S. national anthem rages on.

But an older patriotic ritual ran aground on geopolitical tensions.

Photo

That’s the Pledge of Allegiance, which was first recited in public schools on this day in 1892.

The pledge was written by Francis Bellamy, a Baptist minister and socialist, to be rolled out with a nationwide push to celebrate Columbus Day in schools. It was soon widely recognized.

Mr. Bellamy instructed that a salute be performed: right arm extended upward, with the palm twisting up at the first mention of the flag.

When fascist regimes emerged in Italy and Germany using extended-arm salutes, Bellamy’s began to fall from favor. As one author wrote, the “similarities in the salute had begun to attract comment as early as the mid-1930s.”

On Dec. 22, 1942, Congress amended the U.S. Flag Code to instruct that the pledge “be rendered by standing at attention facing the flag with the right hand over the heart” — the stance in use today.

Charles McDermid contributed reporting.

They’re the ones who finally brought the real Mr. Weinstein to light.","At a time when the news media is under financial distress, when billionaires with political agendas or personal grudges, like the Silicon Valley investor Peter Thiel, have shown a willingness to fund lawsuits able to run media entities out of business — as Mr. Thiel did to Gawker — legal threats are newly intimidating.

It is far worse for the victims of those in power, who are all too aware that speaking up may lead to stalled careers and ruined reputations. Many women who have fought back against sleazy, powerful men by filing lawsuits against them often end up with the consolation prize of an out-of-court settlement that comes complete with a nondisclosure agreement dictating that they must remain silent on the matter forevermore or face a steep financial penalty.

In this climate, breaking a story that includes tough accusations against those in high places requires more than a scrappy reporter with a notebook. It means having the resources to work the story exclusively for months. It means withstanding any legal challenges that may come. It means coaxing understandably reluctant victims to speak out against those who have the means and motivation to crush them.

In the days since The New York Times first published an article on Mr. Weinstein that named names and included details of at least eight settlements, a number of reporters and editors have spoken of their own missed chances to write the story earlier. For many journalists, Mr. Weinstein was the white whale that got away.

Bruce Headlam, a former editor for the late Times media columnist David Carr, told me that Mr. Carr twice came close to nailing down a story about abuses committed by Mr. Weinstein. In both cases, the accuser “backed out after agreeing to talk.”

There were similar stories of failed attempts involving Kim Masters of The Hollywood Reporter, Ken Auletta of The New Yorker, Benjamin Wallace of New York magazine and Times reporters.

As David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker, told me on Wednesday, a news organization cannot go after a powerful figure or institution if it does not have the resources for lawyers, fact checkers and experienced editors who won’t be intimidated by the protection racket.

“Journalistic institutions like these are rare and the times, the economic and political times, have made them fragile and essential at the same time,” Mr. Remnick said. “The stakes are very high.”

Publishing aggressive stories like the ones about Mr. Weinstein can be costly in other ways. As The Times’s executive editor, Dean Baquet, told me, “Harvey Weinstein is an advertiser – but that never even crossed my mind.”

Mr. Baquet added that he did not know how much the Weinstein Company spent to advertise its movies in The Times, but the newspaper was too large to be influenced by any amount. “That’s the other thing – you have to have the size and the history to not even take that into account.”

It costs serious money to give two reporters the go-ahead to devote months to an article that may or may not pan out, as The Times did in the case of Mr. Weinstein, especially as legal threats loom.

The threats, however, were combined with a personal touch from Mr. Weinstein, which, Mr. Baquet said, he rebuffed. “Harvey Weinstein a few times reached out to me to talk about the story, and I told him I did not think it was appropriate for him to talk to the executive editor about a story,” Mr. Baquet said. “He should be talking to reporters.”

Over the years, Mr. Weinstein spent as much time schmoozing reporters as he did berating them. A.J. Benza, a former gossip columnist at The Daily News – and, for a time, my colleague on the paper’s “Hot Copy” gossip column – described how Mr. Weinstein would provide him with access to the director Quentin Tarantino or the actress Salma Hayek as they were making their way into Hollywood’s stratosphere. He also provided Mr. Benza with invitations to his famous Oscar parties.

“I’ll put it this way: There’s a certain feeling you get when you’re allowed in those parties and other journalists are on the other side of the rope and can’t get through,” Mr. Benza said.

Tina Brown, with whom Mr. Weinstein started Talk magazine in 1999, wrote this week that the mogul kept a number of his journalists on his good side with sweet consultancy or development deals with Miramax.

“Another of his co-opting tactics,” she wrote for the Women in the World Summit she sponsors with The New York Times, “was to offer a juicy negative nugget about one of the movie stars in his films or people in his media circle (fairly often, me) in a trade to quash a dangerous piece about himself.”

Mr. Weinstein’s expertise in media manipulation was evident after the model Ambra Battilana Gutierrez went to the police with her charge that Mr. Weinstein forced himself on her at his TriBeCa offices in 2015. “Role Play: ‘Grope’ gal asked for movie part,” screamed a front-page New York Post headline above a large photo of Ms. Gutierrez a few days later. (A spokesman for The Post did not respond with a comment.)

At least 1,800 structures were reduced to ash, making the fire one of the most destructive in the state’s history.

A Fast-Moving Fire

The inferno, officially called the Tubbs fire, started around 9:43 p.m. on Sunday near Calistoga, a small town in Napa County known for its wineries and mud baths.

The fire moved quickly, traveling about 12 miles in a little over three hours.

By 1 a.m. Monday, the fire had reached Santa Rosa, a city of about 175,000 people in Sonoma County.

Christine Sims, a resident of Coffey Park, a neighborhood where several hundred homes were burned to the ground, said she could tell the fire was headed their way based on the wind.

“When we opened up the front door, the wind was blowing so fiercely, and there was so much smoke,” Ms. Sims said.

She fled at about 2 a.m. When she looked back, the neighborhood was glowing orange.

Flames Flow Like ‘Water Rushing Across the Ground’

The winds that drove the fire from north of Calistoga to Santa Rosa are common in Northern California in October. At about 4:30 a.m. on Monday, these so-called “diablo winds” reached a peak speed of more than 60 miles per hour, according to the National Weather Service.

The map below shows the wind conditions around this peak time.

Winds in excess of 50 miles per hour will cause flames to “sheet across the ground,” said Janet Upton, a deputy director of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. “It was literally parallel to the ground, racing across, almost like water rushing across the ground.”

Development in Wildlands Worsens Fires

Many of the homes that were incinerated were inside what are called wildland-urban interfaces — areas where homes and businesses are close to or intermingled with otherwise undeveloped wildlands.

Sources: Geospatial Multi-Agency Coordination (fire perimeters); SILVIS Lab at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the United States Forest Service (wildlife-urban interface)

Development in wildland-urban interfaces increases frequency of fires and contributes to the ferocity of a fire, said Volker Radeloff, a forest and wildlife ecology professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

“When you have more people in an area, the chances that something will go wrong and a fire will start is higher,” Dr. Radeloff said.

“It’s not only that the fires ignite the houses,” he continued, “but then the houses kind of fuel the fire.”

High-velocity winds in combination with this fire’s proximity to an urbanized area made it especially dangerous, said Jan Null, a meteorologist and adjunct professor at San Jose University.

A Drought, Record Rain and Another Dry Spell

A six-year drought was declared over in most of California in April, but dry vegetation still litters the state.

Record amounts of rain fell at the end of 2016 and in the beginning of 2017, which triggered new plant growth. Since then, there has been extreme heat and little rainfall, causing much of the new vegetation to become tinder dry by the fall.

Conditions were further exacerbated when the relative humidity reached single digits in recent days. Anything below 22 percent relative humidity means that there is a likelihood that something could ignite, said Ms. Upton of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.

A few years ago, at Easter dinner with my in-laws, I noticed my husband’s grandmother dipping pieces of yellow cake into her glass of soda. She’s a woman of nearly 90 with a preternatural grip for hugs and pinching cheeks but, in this, she was gentle: letting each bite soak into her orange Crush, allowing it to achieve full saturation before popping it in her mouth.

“Ew, Nonna!” someone chuckled in protest. But it was her table and home, and she’d apparently been doing this for years, so no one said much more about it.

Some seasons later, maybe a Thanksgiving, my other nonna-in-law did something similar with her dinner roll, tearing it into strips and letting the red wine from her glass climb up into the bread before eating it. This time, I resolved that I would ask why. But first — wanting my question to come across as the genuine curiosity it was, rather than an accusation of bad table manners — I decided to try it myself.

Those first few dips completely changed the way I eat at family meals. Part of what won me over was the pleasure of the thing itself: Wine-soaked bread is sharp, puckery and delicious, a double hit of fermented tang. But more important, I soon came to realize, was the role it can play in pacing out a marathon meal. Eating with my husband’s Italian family means incredible food, but far too much of it: antipasto; a soup course; a lasagna or pasta course; two kinds of meat (and if it’s Easter or Christmas, seafood and a turkey); hot vegetables; cold salad; then dessert. Rather than yielding to temptation for a second helping of anything, it’s far wiser to melt a bite of Chianti on your tongue instead.

The nonnas don’t have a word for this practice, but some Catholics do: intinction. Vatican documents specify everything about intinction from the size of the host (not too thin; not too small) to who dips (the priest, never the recipient) to how it’s received (by tongue only). But both nonnas have since taught me that you’re meant to dip bread into red wine; cake or cookies into white. These aren’t personal quirks but instead Italianish table mannerisms: To mask the taste of bad wine, meals often began with a bit of crisped bread dropped into the cup, hence the term “to toast.”",Letter of Recommendation: Dunking,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/magazine/letter-of-recommendation-dunking.html

Advertisement Continue reading the main storyRom has become the most prominent foe of copper-nickel mining near the Boundary Waters.
The deposits are near or under lakes and rivers that stream directly into the Boundary Waters.
The jobs may be seasonal or not pay as well as mining jobs; on the other hand, they are not as backbreaking and they foster a local creative class.","Now, mining supporters, among them Representative Rick Nolan, a Democrat who represents Ely’s district in Congress, are trying to undo the moratorium. The battle is being fought on both moral and economic grounds. Mining advocates stress the hundreds of tangible construction and mining jobs this copper-nickel operation could create in the coming decades. Boundary Waters activists argue that the very presence of mining — its disruption of this area’s natural character, not to mention the specter of pollution — could hamper the region’s “amenity-based” development in a multitude of tangible and intangible ways, from destroying property values to stripping away jobs that feed off this area’s natural beauty.

In the land of iron and water, opposition to copper-nickel mining is more than just a protect-the-wilderness stance; it also reflects a deeper desire to change the area’s character, from hardscrabble mining region to tourist destination that prioritizes protecting the wilderness over creating more mining jobs. Central to the debate between the two camps is a philosophical question: What is the right kind of economy for a place like the Boundary Waters?

For as far back as he can trace it, Dan Forsman’s family has lived here, where iron meets water. His great-great-grandfather migrated from Finland in the 1890s and homesteaded on a 474-acre lake. His great-grandfather, Emil Forsman, worked in the mines before opening a longtime Ely watering hole, Forsman’s Tavern. Emil’s son worked as a maintenance foreman in the crusher at an Ely mine. In 1947, Emil’s eldest grandchild was born above Forsman’s Tavern. That boy, Mike, grew up in Ely, worked for a canoe outfitter for $1.25 an hour, volunteered to join the Marines in the 1960s and worked in the mines for 34 years. His youngest son was Dan. Dan grew up in awe of the giant machines that his mechanic father worked to fix. When he turned 20, after training at a two-year community college to become a heavy-equipment mechanic, he got a job at the same mine as his father.

At 4:40 a.m. on a chilly late-spring morning, I pulled up to Dan Forsman’s house to drive with him to work. The diesel engine of his 2002 Chevy Silverado pickup was already growling. He had gotten up 12 minutes earlier, thrown on torn jeans, a T-shirt and a camouflage hunting jacket and packed a lunch: turkey and American cheese on white bread, a banana and a Little Debbie Cosmic Brownie. The 29-year-old tugged down on a cap that advertised the brand of nitrous oxide he uses to soup up car engines. A block away, he steered past his father’s house and the garage where he learned to tinker. His prized car is a 1979 Chevy Camaro; he can get it up to nearly 150 miles per hour on a nearby drag strip.

Forsman drove up the hill of Ely’s business district. Some people call this a mining town, others a tourist town, but East Sheridan Street shows it to be both. There’s the grilled-cheese shop frequented by tourists and the grocery store that stocks the hot smoked bologna local residents swear by. There are liquor stores that boycotted a local brewery after the brewery publicly sided with clean-water advocates, but down the street is a stylish new wine bar serving that same beer. More than a dozen local canoe outfitters that organize trips into the Boundary Waters are based here. Neighboring storefronts display yard signs: “We support mining. Mining supports us.”

“There are two Elys, two different realities, different visions,” Tom Coombe, the editor of The Ely Echo and a fourth-generation Elyite, told me.

As Forsman’s truck rumbled to the top of the hill, we passed a two-story building that used to be Forsman’s Tavern. Now it’s occupied by Piragis Northwoods Company, a successful canoe outfitter and outdoor store. Steve Piragis has run this shop a decade longer than Dan Forsman has been alive, but Forsman’s family still considers Piragis an outsider — a “packsacker,” the local term for people who moved here for wilderness instead of mining.

Past the city limits and into the heart of Minnesota’s Iron Range, fog lifted over white pine trees. A ring-necked pheasant strutted alongside Wolf Creek Pass. As Forsman parked in the same lot his father used to park in — 52 minutes door to door — steam poured from four chimneys.

Forsman is proud of his part in this 360-employee mining enterprise. He’s proud that his labor makes something tangible: Huge chunks of rock become tiny bits of rock, which are ground and baked into half-inch pellets containing 67.5 percent iron, which leave this processing plant on the rails at a rate of 8,500 tons a day. The pellets are loaded onto ships in Duluth, where they float along Lake Superior to the other Great Lakes. At the bottom tip of Lake Michigan, just east of Chicago, tons of these pellets are fed into the largest blast furnace in the Western Hemisphere and smelted into steel, eventually becoming cars or trucks or household appliances or plate steel for ships and armored vehicles.

Up a flight of metal stairs, Forsman entered the locker room, put on his blue coveralls and laced up his steel-toed boots. Everything in his workplace seems improbably enormous. The mining trucks, with their 12-foot-tall tires, can haul 240 tons of rock from the open-pit mines into the processing facility. Miles away, off a gravel road as wide as a six-lane highway, 280,000 pounds of explosives had been loaded into 132 16-inch-diameter holes in a mining pit — it was blast day. The explosions would shake the earth, breaking up rock for the processing facility. The pit looked like a gray moonscape.

“To make money, you have to make something that wasn’t there,” Forsman told me. “You dig it up or you grow it. Without those things, you’re just making nothing. Without the basic minerals to make a phone, you can’t make an app for the phone. Because there’s nothing there.”

Forsman says he loves and wants to protect the Boundary Waters. He also believes copper mining and clean water can coexist. Then again, the mine that Forsman works in is a taconite mine, not the type of copper-nickel mine that environmentalists decry as a threat to this watershed. But what matters most to Forsman is the need for jobs in this hollowed-out region. Ely’s population has shrunk 30 percent since 1980; school enrollment is a third of what it was in the late 1960s. “If they stop this new mine, what’s the draw to be up here if there’s no jobs?” Also, he notes, those who oppose new mining jobs — “elitists” and “hypocrites,” Forsman calls them — benefit from the same metals that blue-collar workers like him produce. “People don’t understand where things come from anymore,” he said.

When Forsman refers to these “people,” he’s often referring to one person in particular. Her name is Becky Rom, and she is the head of the Campaign to Save the Boundary Waters. What makes him most angry is Rom’s condescension, her moral certainty: “The way she comes off, her attitude and way of doing this, it’s part of the problem.”

“Danny Forsman drives to the mine in his truck, comes home and watches TV, and he doesn’t know this world exists,” says Becky Rom, a 68-year-old lawyer who returned to her childhood home after retirement and now leads the environmental campaign. One afternoon this spring, I stood on a dock with Rom and her husband, Reid Carron, as they lowered a canoe into the South Kawishiwi River. Rom dangled her feet over the water, which was a couple miles of portages, rivers and rapids from the southwestern border of the Boundary Waters. Chokecherry and juneberry trees were in bloom. Sometimes Rom sees moose, otters, timber wolves or black bears. Today a blue jay hopped along the shore near where a beaver had built a lodge of alder limbs. Rom guessed newborn beavers were inside.

Rom has an energy that can be difficult to keep up with, whether she’s channeling it into hourlong soliloquies about the history of the Boundary Waters or a breakneck march into the wilderness. Rom slid into the canoe, her husband in back and me in the middle. The water beneath us was nearly black, tannin-stained, jarringly cold. A few years ago, an environmental group cited the South Kawishiwi as one of America’s 10 most endangered rivers because of the possibility that Twin Metals would begin mining for copper-nickel nearby.

Rom has become the most prominent foe of copper-nickel mining near the Boundary Waters. She makes frequent lobbying visits to St. Paul and Washington to drum up support from administrative and elected officials. Her group commissions studies and opinion polls; she takes part in public debates. But even the miners who hate her most wouldn’t dare call her a packsacker. Rom’s family has lived in Ely as long as the Forsmans. Her grandfather, Caspar Rom, emigrated from Slovenia in the 1890s. In December 1917, three weeks after his ninth child was born, Caspar Rom was leaning over an ore car when a cave-in crushed his head. That newborn son was Bill Rom, Becky’s father. He hunted and fished with his brothers to help his mother put food on the table. In 1946, he opened Canoe Country Outfitters, soon one of the most successful outfitters around. Three years later, Becky was born.

Her father became a leader in the fight for the federal Wilderness Act, whose passage in 1964 helped create federally designated wilderness areas. During the battles over the tightening of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness regulations in the 1970s, Bill Rom became a symbol among local residents, who for generations had enjoyed this land with few restrictions, of environmentalism run amok. Under new rules, airplanes were banned, which meant no more flying seaplanes into remote lakes. Resorts were torn down. Motorboat use was limited. Resentful local residents harassed Rom. In 1975, logging trucks blockaded his business on two of the busiest weekends of the year. Snowmobiles buzzed around his house at night to keep the Roms from sleeping. Becky’s brother camped inside the family business with their dog and a gun. Eventually, Rom sold his business rather than endure protests from people he grew up with.

But his cause left a lasting imprint on his daughter. After Rom and her husband, Reid Carron, retired from the largest law firm in the Twin Cities — she was a commercial real estate lawyer, he a management labor lawyer — they moved north in 2012 to a modern log cabin they had built on land her father bought decades before on Burntside Lake. Today a copy of the 1964 Wilderness Act signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson hangs on Rom’s bedroom wall.

Rom maneuvered the canoe toward the other side of the river. Docks jutted into the water, evidence of homes hidden in the trees. She lifted her paddle and gestured toward some white pines: “This would be all mines,” she said. “The noise, the lights, the dust, it would be everywhere.” A woodpecker pounded its beak into a tree. A smallmouth bass hunting mayflies broke the river’s surface.

The edge of the Boundary Waters is several miles from three mineral deposits that Twin Metals hopes to develop and just a half-mile from a fourth one. The deposits are near or under lakes and rivers that stream directly into the Boundary Waters. Acid mine drainage could potentially flow past 30 resorts, outfitters and campgrounds, as well as hundreds of homes, before reaching the Boundary Waters at Fall Lake. From there, water enters Basswood Lake, a popular fishery that straddles the Canadian border, then Canada’s Quetico Provincial Park and then Voyageurs National Park and Rainy Lake. All told, polluted water could theoretically affect up to 2.3 million acres of American and Canadian public lands, according to a peer-reviewed study published in the Journal of Hydrology. Pollution could harm fish, wild rice and property values. (This sounds alarmist to those who support underground copper-nickel mining near Ely; the multiyear process of planning the mine and clearing it with regulators would, they believe, set up ample safeguards against pollution.)

Rom and her husband climbed out of the canoe. Back in town, they pointed out thriving enterprises. One family company makes outerwear, which nicely complements the family’s other business, a lodge that runs winter dogsledding trips. An outfit called Crapola makes cranberry-apple granola. An art gallery displayed prints from a nature photographer. A fancy new restaurant, a spa, a gift shop that also sells saunas, a renovated historic theater looking for a tenant — Rom regards all these small businesses as evidence that the future here will not replicate the mining past. The jobs may be seasonal or not pay as well as mining jobs; on the other hand, they are not as backbreaking and they foster a local creative class. Last year, National Geographic Adventure ranked Ely as one of the world’s nine best outdoor towns, citing its proximity to vast public lands. Only one other American community — Moab, Utah, near Arches and Canyonlands national parks — made the list.","In Northern Minnesota, Two Economies Square Off: Mining vs. Wilderness",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/magazine/in-northern-minnesota-two-economies-square-off-mining-vs-wilderness.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

“I am the first woman to jump in Vietnam during this first operational jump by American parachutists since the war began,” she wrote to her father on Feb. 23, 1967.","Catherine Leroy was 21 when she arrived in Vietnam in 1966 with only a hundred dollars, a Leica M2 and a limited professional portfolio. Over the next three years covering the war, she built an exceptional body of work: surviving and documenting a capture by the North Vietnamese Army, parachuting in combat operations with the 173rd Airborne, and being published on the covers of major magazines, including Life and Paris Match.

She was also the only female photojournalist then working in Vietnam, after the death of Dickey Chapelle, who was killed by a grenade in 1965.

Ms. Leroy wrote over 100 letters home during her three years in Vietnam, one almost every 10 days, and they show how she was processing her experiences and navigating professional challenges. They are candid and revealing, attesting to her resiliency, exposing insecurities, and showing her in moments of triumph, despair, optimism or courage.

Despite her many strong images, Ms. Leroy had remained relatively unknown, partly because she wasn’t a self-promoter, and partly because women photographers have often been excluded from the medium’s history, especially war photography. Now a selection of those letters are featured on a new website, accompanied by some of her archive and details from her life. It will be followed by the documentary “Cathy at War” by the writer and filmmaker Jacques Menasche.

Most of the letters are to her mother, Denise, focusing at first on topics that read like holiday postcards – gifts she hoped to send home, people she met, her tan. To her father, Jean, she wrote mostly about business — publications that bought her work, logistics and future plans. She frequently reassures them, noting in one letter to her mother that “if anything happens to me, you’ll be informed within 24 hours. So don’t worry if I sometimes leave you without any news.”

Her tone changed over time. In the early letters, she was unsure whether she should stay or go home, even as she felt less insecure about her technical skills. She spoke of the relationships she was forming with the military and about daily life. On Sept. 4, 1966, a few months after her initial arrival, she wrote to her mother:

I celebrated my 22nd birthday at the Da Nang press office in the company of lots of Marines. I had left Saigon a few days earlier with an AP reporter for an operation near the DMZ. On this occasion he opened a bottle of French champagne when we got back. I only got back last night, Saturday, very tired…I’m getting an iron reputation with the marines. I’m very proud of it. I’m leaving tomorrow, Tuesday, morning for the Delta. Subject: a village a few days from the election. The war seems to be calming down, as always happens just before political events. The Delta is the key region. I’ll stay there two or three days. After that, I don’t know. I’m preparing a few photos of me taken in various locations and will send them to you. I haven’t forgotten your wig, I’ll take care of it too. Don’t be angry with me. I’m always away: back in Saigon for two days, get something cleaned, tidy up, wash, everything is dirty.

As her confidence grew, she wrote about her professional successes. But the letters also showed low moments, like being unable to get the pictures she wanted in the field or leaving an envelope of her best prints in a taxi after fending off a robbery attempt from the driver.

The letters testify to the challenges women encountered in the field. While there were female journalists in Vietnam, Ms. Leroy was the only woman photographer after Chapelle’s death, and faced resistance from the military and male journalists. Robert Pledge, president of the board of the Catherine Leroy Fund, a not-for-profit organization in Paris dedicated to her work, said many prominent photojournalists questioned why a young woman wanted to cover war.

She wrote about how people were nice when they first thought she was an unintimidating, five-foot-tall, pigtailed girl. But when they realized she was a serious photographer, their opinions changed. “Many were very, very negative and very nasty with her,” said Mr. Pledge, who is also co-founder and director of Contact Press Images.

Writing to her father on May 13, 1967, after noting her successes in being published in leading magazines, she marveled how “I’m getting telegrams from people who I didn’t know existed for years, while at the same time I’m hated more than ever by known and unknown enemies in Saigon, American civilians, as well as servicemen in Saigon.”

One photographer told Mr. Pledge that the male photographers “were really nasty chauvinistic pigs.” That same photographer, who now is a filmmaker, called her late in life to apologize.

Still, she found the opportunities available to her in Vietnam surpassed anything back home in France. Like parachuting with the 173rd Airborne Brigade — the 85th jump she had taken in her life, after receiving her parachuting license as a teenager.

“I am the first woman to jump in Vietnam during this first operational jump by American parachutists since the war began,” she wrote to her father on Feb. 23, 1967. “I’m very proud to have jumped with the Americans here, it’s a big professional success in every way. I now know that I will be able to work in the United Sates one day without too much problem.” She wrote how she planned to submit her work to major competitions. “I’ve always thought I should succeed because I never gave in,” she continued.

Many consider Ms. Leroy as the most daring of all photographers in Vietnam, and she most likely spent the most time in combat because she needed the money. Being broke meant traveling with soldiers, sharing rations and sleeping in the countryside.

As Mr. Pledge noted, “If Robert Capa was saying that it’s not good enough because it’s not close enough — she was very close.”
