This was revealed in the 2017 Discovery Vitality ObeCity Index results released on Wednesday in Johannesburg.

Nearly half a million Vitality members from the Mother City, Johannesburg, Pretoria, Durban, Bloemfontein and Port Elizabeth were analysed in four categories. These were weight status (measured by Body Mass Index), food-purchasing score (the ratio of healthy versus unhealthy food), fruit and vegetable portions purchased and teaspoons of sugar and salt consumed.

Although some differences were ""marginal"", Cape Town scored best in all categories but the teaspoons of sugar and salt.

Bar the current water issues, it's not much of a surprise to us why Discovery members from the Mother City would emerge on top -- and here are 5 reasons why they may have a bit of an edge:

The sun

During the peak of summer, the sun sets at about 8pm. This would compel anyone to be out and about and make the most of what this city has to offer: walking your dog, a late run, a bike ride or exploring, on foot, one of many of Cape Town's night markets post-sunset.

A myth is defined as a widely held, but false, belief or idea. For example cracking knuckles can give you arthritis, or that the full moon can affect human behaviour. Some myths are dumb, some are funny, and some can be truly detrimental. Myths about mutual funds are the third sort and believing them can harm your financial health. Mutual funds are excellent financial products to build long-term wealth, but we need to debunk some popular mutual myths that surround them.

1: Mutual funds are risky

Mutual funds are perceived to be risky because they are associated with the stock markets. But the truth is that mutual funds are of many different types. Debt funds, for example, don't even invest in equities. Small-cap equity funds can be said to be the riskiest of all mutual funds, but even they mitigate the risk by diversifying and taking calculated calls. Hence, mutual funds are not dangerous if you understand the type of fund you are investing in.

2: You need a demat account to invest in mutual funds

You need a demat account to invest or trade in stocks, but you don't need one to invest in mutual funds. To invest in mutual funds, you need to be KYC-compliant, once that is done, you can invest through a fund distributor or through the fund company without a demat account.

3: Lower Net Asset Value (NAV) means a cheaper fund

A lower stock price can mean a cheaper stock, but a lower NAV doesn't mean a cheaper fund. All mutual funds start with a NAV of ₹10. As the fund's AUM grows, the fund's NAV also rises. The NAV is essentially the per unit price of the fund. It should not be a determining factor while choosing a fund.

4: You need a lot of money to invest in mutual funds

As little as ₹500 is enough to start a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) in a mutual fund. There is often a more considerable lump sum amount required to invest in a mutual fund, but a SIP can be started for a small amount as well.

5: Mutual fund investments take a lot of paperwork

This was true a few years ago, but now, the investment process, including KYC, can be done entirely online. You don't need to go to a fund company or distributor's office to invest in mutual funds anymore. You don't even need to take a print out or sign and courier a form anymore. All of the required paperwork can be finished online in a matter of minutes.

6: SIPs cannot be stopped

Many investors think that if they sign up for a 12-month or 24-month SIP, then they will compulsorily have to fulfil that obligation. But that is not the case. You can stop, pause and restart a SIP whenever you want.

7: The fund company will disappear with my money

The mutual fund industry is regulated by government bodies such as the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI). Every mutual fund company is given the license to run mutual funds after due diligence. The money you invest is also safe with a designated trust. The government has taken enough steps to ensure that your investments are safe and no fund company will run away with them.

8: Mutual funds will make you rich overnight

Mutual funds are not a scheme to make a quick buck. Sure, you can see an upside in a short period. But that is not what mutual funds are for. They are best suited to build wealth over a long-term. You shouldn't time the market with mutual funds and invest in them to earn quick returns. The pitfalls of this approach are way more than the rewards.

9: Mutual funds are expensive

Mutual funds cannot charge an expense ratio of more than 2.5% a year. This is an annual fund management fee that is deducted from the investments made in the fund. Most funds don't even touch this threshold of the expense ratio. The expense ratio is typically between 1-1.5%. This is a nominal fee to pay for the expert fund management and research services you receive from the fund company.

A family photo of James

A lot has been written about grief. You can Google it, and you will find any number of guides, or quotes laid on the background of a field, or fluffy white clouds.

You probably haven't Googled grief unless you have experienced it in someway or another... I certainly hadn't. In fact, I would go so far as to say I had no understanding or appreciation for what grief or loss really was, up until the 31st of October 2016. This is despite my job in the police, where I have comforted victims, the bereft and those worst affected by sad events. You don't truly know grief until it hits you, like a meteor striking the surface of a planet.

My happiest moments

On the 21st of September 2016, my wife Emily gave birth to twins, James and Isabel. They were perfect. After a brief stay in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, we as a family left our local hospital with our older daughter Lexy, and travelled home. I can't remember a time when I was prouder, or more elated... and probably more apprehensive as to what was life going to be like.

The next four weeks were like a blur. I wish they weren't. I wish I could remember it all like yesterday. But with little sleep and a lot of 'jobs', we as a couple kept our head above the water line, feeding, changing nappies and coming to terms with the fact that a small, two bedroom flat might struggle to hold the five of us! Looking back at that time, if I could give myself one bit of advice it would be to savour the moments and not to stress about the future and the 'what ifs'.

Transfer to hospital

On the morning of the 29th of October, James fell ill. He was rushed to our local hospital but he was so poorly he needed more specialist care. The amazing and dogged work by staff from our local hospital, then staff of the Children's Acute Transfer Service (CATS) ambulance team, and finally the intensive care doctors and nurses at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) allowed us to spend two more days with our boy, before he passed away in our arms on the 31st of October at 19:35hrs. We think, but will sadly never know for sure, that James died of sepsis. It was at that point when I began to understand what grief was really all about.

Then, three weeks after we lost James, his twin sister Isabel fell ill. It happened much like it did for James, but Isabel had completely unrelated problems. We repeated the journey to our local hospital, and then to GOSH, where Isabel was rushed into surgery, which saved her life. A year on, my sweet girl has just turned one, and the only mark to tell the story of that harrowing time is a small scar on her belly, in time it might even go completely.

Coming to terms with loss

In my eulogy at James' memorial I said: 'No parent should ever have to bury their child' and I don't think a truer word has ever been said. If I could have one wish, it would not be for James to be back in our lives, that would be a selfish wish. My wish would be for no father or mother to ever have to endure the pain and suffering of losing a child.

So what do you do when you've had the worst thing happen? To be honest, I couldn't tell you, because unlike the explanations on that search engine, your grief is unique to you. All I can say is you will learn to live with the ache, your heart will never be the same again but it will still beat and you must let it. You will find solace in something or someone, and they or it will help you on that path of recovery.

Creating a legacy for James



Our team of runners at the Royal Parks Half Marathon. Photo credit: Alexander Newton

One of our sticking plasters has been trying to give back, and so we started the Little Jimmy Brighter Future Fund in memory of James, to raise money for Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity, in December last year. We set ourselves a target of raising enough money for GOSH to buy two specialist ventilators for the CATS ambulances to take the sickest of children, like James, from their local hospital to GOSH for the very best of care. The machines will support the vital services that the CATS team provides, and they don't come cheap, but in less than a year we have raised over £140,000. That means we can buy not only the two specialist ventilators we set out to fund, but additional equipment that will also be used to help children on their journey of recovery.

'We' is the key word in that sentence. 'We' is friends, family, colleagues and complete strangers donating, running events like the Royal Parks Half Marathon with me and Emily, cycling, baking and many more things to help buy the equipment, but in their words, to help 'try and walk with us on that road to recovery'.

And that is my final point. When you are low, in the darkest of times, people are the one constant in getting you back to some semblance of existence. The family members' hug, the quiet drink with the friend or seeing a donation from a complete stranger... they are the actions that mean grief can be conquered.

Emily and Pete, and over 100 of their friends, family members and supporters of the Little Jimmy Brighter Future Fund ran the Royal Parks Half Marathon, with all money raised going to support Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity in James' memory.

According to Damian McClelland, Bupa UK’s musculoskeletal services clinical director, if you want to ease back pain, you should stop slumping over your phone or tablet in bed.

”When we lie or sit in bed to watch TV, or check emails on our phones or tablets, we tend to slouch and look downwards which isn’t good for our posture,” he exclusively told HuffPost UK.

“This usually means we’re not supporting our spine or head (generally the heaviest part of our body) properly. This puts a lot of strain on the muscles and joints in the neck.”

McClelland said the risk to back damage increases further if you’re watching content on a phone or tablet when it’s plugged in, because “you’re at the whim of a tiny wire”.

“If you find you often have to change position because you get pins and needles or a dead leg, or you’re just plain uncomfortable, that’s your body reminding you that you’re not in a good position,” he added.

“Not only is this painful at the time, but poor posture can have long term implications on your health, potentially leading to long term lower back, shoulder and neck pain affecting your work and social life.”

He stressed that if you do not change your habits, the effects of poor posture can lead to serious chronic pain. But the good news is McClelland doesn’t believe you need to ban Netflix from your bedroom completely.

He gave the following tips for using your phone, tablet or TV in bed:

1. Support your head. Sit upright with pillows behind you, or if you’re lying down ensure you have enough pillows to take your weight.

2. Avoid twisting your body. Keep your back straight with pillow support behind you if you’re on your side. Engage your core to keep your posture straight.

3. Keep your shoulders back and down if you’re sitting upright, not rounded or hunched. Don’t slouch to look at the screen, it should be at eye level like it should be when you’re at a desk.

4. Add some stretches to your Netflix routine. Put your hands above your head, reach up and at the same time stretch your feet down for a nice full body stretch. Also put your hands in the small of your back and push your chest out for a good lower back stretch.

5. Try to charge up your tablet or phone before using it, so you don’t end up spooning the plug socket.

6. Limit your phone or laptop use in bed. Definitely don’t do it just before bed, as it could interfere with your sleep cycle.

After all, how often do we get to see our proper, put-together, not a toe-out-of-line (at least publicly) 'stars' roll up their sleeves and fling fistfuls of mud at each other over the terminology used to describe their apparently clandestine affair? It is hard to believe, and remember, that the whole sordid mess became a matter of public record with someone calling someone else a ""silly ex"".

By the time you reach the sixth or the seventh course, you start to tire of even the most exotic ingredients. And by the eighth or the ninth course, the pants begin to pinch and chafe at the waist, making you secretly wish you'd stayed home in your holey pyjamas and eaten leftovers from lunch instead of signing up for the gourmet nightmare you can't politely exit from.

Even as one can't wait for the final course of this no-longer-palatable meal to roll in so we can all go home and go to sleep, for now, we must fork what's in front of us and swallow it. And right now, that happens to be Farhan Akhtar with an eloquently worded open letter about an open letter. How meta. Without naming either Hrithik Roshan, or Kangana Ranaut, he weighs in with his opinion of everything that's wrong in the way the public responded to the affair.

Indian actors Kangana Ranaut and Hrithik Roshan

In the letter, Akhtar spends a lot of time talking about how, when it comes to victim-blaming and repression, traditionally, it is the woman who is the victim, which he finds unacceptable, as evidenced by the foundation of MARD (Men Against Rape & Discrimination) by him. He then goes on to helpfully explain the difference between ""all"" and ""most"", a concept too difficult to grasp for the average human brain, apparently.

Akhtar then says that in the interest of ""objectivity and fairness"" he absolutely ""must speak up"" in this particular instance.

And so he does — about how reputed journalists have, possibly without realising it, pushed Ranaut's side of the story, effectively painting Roshan as the guilty party. Akhtar finds it worrisome that Ranaut's version has been taken at face value. Ironically, all the inconsistencies he points out in her narrative are things that have been widely reported, questioned and commented upon by the very media he so unhesitatingly chastises.

At the heart of Akhtar's soliloquy is the prospect that in giving the benefit of the doubt to the woman in this case, the man may have, inadvertently, been discriminated against.

All of these are noble intentions, undoubtedly. As a person with immense power to shape public opinion, Akhtar should absolutely stand up for those that he believes to be victims of unfairness. But discrimination is a big word to throw around, especially without completely understanding its ramifications.

And reading Akhtar's letter, one can't help but feel that he, like so many others in Bollywood, just doesn't get it.

As national celebrities with immense reach and star-power in their own right, neither Ranaut nor Roshan is what one can call ill-equipped to defend themselves, or hire a battery of lawyers, publicists and spin doctors to do it for them. Not naming them, or simply calling them ""a man"" and ""a woman"", like Akhtar did, is not going to change the fact that both come from a place of incredible power and privilege. By virtue of that fact alone, the thought that the media — that frankly doesn't care for either one more than the other — would randomly decide to discriminate against one of the two is slightly perplexing.

Does Akhtar believe that journalists have some strange anti-men agenda that they are unable to fathom or rise above? As a rank insider of an industry so extensively covered that actors, without a hint of irony, send out press releases about their 'airport looks', knowing full well that it will get them some press, somewhere, it is laughable that Akhtar would seriously propose it is we who haven't allowed Roshan's voice to be heard.

The only reason Ranaut's narrative has dominated news cycle every time the topic has come up is that she has been around, exercising her right to speak about her life the way she deems fit, just as Roshan exercised his to remain silent. He chose not to defend himself for reasons best known to him. When you do that, you always run the risk of people believing your adversary because theirs is the only voice they get to hear. That's logic, not a secret media conspiracy.

Unfortunately, that's just how news and commentary work. Just as Ranaut has had to bear the brunt of being too outspoken about her alleged mistreatment at the hands of her various past lovers by being ridiculed by wholly unconcerned third parties, Roshan has had to pay the price of silence. Each bears the burden of their choices. Where is the discrimination in that?

Now that Roshan has finally decided to speak up and put forth his truth, every news platform in the country is clamouring to interview him and get his side of the story. All it took was one Facebook post from him. If Roshan's version of the events that unfolded is true, he is a victim of cyber stalking and harassment, but certainly not of discrimination

It is true that Ranaut has the uncanny ability to land on her feet no matter how ugly the controversies she gets embroiled in. It is also true that she has managed to cement her position as the poster-girl of feminism in an industry as sexist as Bollywood. That's not always because everyone uniformly agrees with her opinion, but simply because she dares to speak about topics no one else does. How many Bollywood stars, the ones that enjoy a lot more wealth and power than her, would be willing to risk their neck and make enemies of the very people they depend on to give them work? Her fearlessness in addressing unpleasant issues is what made her admirable to so many women who grapple with similar situations in their own lives, not this odious never-ending saga with Roshan.

In the case of who cyber stalked and hacked whose account, Ranaut might enjoy the benefit of doubt because she's a woman, but it certainly hasn't insulated her from being called a liar when the situation has warranted it.

To insinuate that feminists are so blinded by their zeal to ensure that a woman gets justice that they are willing to knowingly sacrifice an innocent man in the pursuit is a grievous insult to sane, fair-minded equal rights crusaders like Akhtar himself.

Debbie Abrahams, the shadow work and pensions secretary, was condemning the Government’s use of a 0345 number for claimants - which HuffPost yesterday revealed could leave callers significantly out of pocket - when she was ensnared by LBC host Jim Diamond.

Abrahams was exercised about the 55p per minute call charges which Theresa May had been forced to defend during Prime Minister’s Questions on Wednesday, accusing the Conservatives of lacking “humanity”.

Labour MP tears into govt for using 0345 numbers, but is lost for words when LBC host tells her Labour use them too https://t.co/utRB2qxabJ — LBC (@LBC) October 12, 2017

“People can be racking up costs if they are using their mobile, if they don’t have a landline... at an average of £3.30 a call.

“Someone on a low-income to get the support they need to have to pay £3.30... that is a lot of money.”

Diamond then informed Abrahams that Labour uses an 0345 number for people wanting to sign up as members and asked, “if it is so bad” why does the party use it?

But as listeners were quick to point out, there was an easy defence for the Labour MP:

This is woeful. Didn’t it occur to her that Labour membership and claiming your benefits are two very different things? https://t.co/Im2QNfW7Zt — Stephen Bush (@stephenkb) October 12, 2017

A clearly flummoxed Abrahams replied: ” I don’t know. I think you make a very valid point. I had no idea about this and yes, we need to get our own house in order as well.”

When Diamond pushed her further, Abrahams tried to steer the conversation back to the Conservatives: “Lets not forget this is a Government programme and you’ve got me on here taking about this.”

After Diamond interjected to reaffirm his point, Abrahams concluded: “I agree with you. So can we move on.”

HuffPost tried contacting the government helpline on Wednesday and waited up to 12 and a half minutes to be answered in person. The call taker then refused to call us back straight away due to data protection rules.

Mais il ne sert à rien de vouloir répondre à ces préoccupations en annulant l'accord actuel. Cette mesure ne ferait que raffermir davantage la volonté de l'Iran d'acquérir un arsenal nucléaire. Au contraire, les États-Unis et leurs alliés (aux côtés de la Russie et de la Chine) devraient s'appuyer sur cet accord pour qu'à son expiration, l'Iran n'acquière pas rapidement des armes nucléaires. L'idéal serait que l'État iranien soupèse les avantages de ne pas se doter de ce type d'armes par rapport à n'importe quel avantage stratégique qu'il pourrait éventuellement tirer en obtenant pareil arsenal.

Cette solution ne garantit nullement que l'Iran abandonne son ambition d'acquérir des armes nucléaires. Mais elle donne à la communauté internationale le temps et l'occasion d'offrir à l'Iran des mesures d'encouragement ainsi que la perspective de devenir un membre actif, constructif et respecté de la communauté des nations, s'il demeure un pays non nucléaire.

Dans son discours à l'Assemblée générale des Nations Unies, le président américain Donald Trump a déclaré : « L'accord avec l'Iran est l'une des pires transactions et l'une des plus biaisées auxquelles les États-Unis aient jamais participé. Franchement, cet accord est un embarras pour les États-Unis et, croyez-moi, nous n'avons pas fini d'en entendre parler ».

Le problème, c'est que Donald Trump est tout simplement résolu à défaire les mesures législatives et les décrets du président Obama, qu'importe leur mérite, leur utilité ou leur efficacité.

Le problème, c'est que Donald Trump est tout simplement résolu à défaire les mesures législatives et les décrets du président Obama, qu'importe leur mérite, leur utilité ou leur efficacité. Hélas, le Plan d'action global commun n'y échappe pas. Le président américain ferait mieux de certifier que l'Iran a respecté et continue de respecter pleinement l'accord conclu, car l'annulation de ce dernier déclenchera des répercussions régionales et internationales dangereuses, bien au-delà de ce que Trump est capable d'envisager.

Avant la conclusion de cet accord, le gouvernement de Téhéran subissait déjà de fortes pressions, notamment de la population iranienne, pour résoudre le problème nucléaire avec les États-Unis, obtenir la levée des sanctions et atténuer la misère économique du peuple. Maintenant que le gouvernement respecte entièrement les termes de cet accord, les Iraniens soutiennent la position de leur gouvernement, même si cela signifie souffrir considérablement de l'imposition de nouvelles sanctions sévères. Les États-Unis ne peuvent donc pas compter sur le futur mécontentement de la population iranienne pour faire pression sur son gouvernement afin de négocier une nouvelle entente.

Une fois l'accord annulé, l'Iran sera libre de reprendre son programme nucléaire, au mépris des recommandations de la communauté internationale (d'autant plus que la plupart de ses installations sont toujours en place), ce qui entraînera inéluctablement une prolifération nucléaire au Moyen-Orient – précisément ce que les États-Unis cherchent à éviter. Trump pense qu'il pourrait négocier un meilleur accord, mais ses suppositions ne tiennent pas la route. Il lui reste encore à démontrer ses soi-disant talents de négociateur, alors qu'il a misérablement échoué à négocier avec son propre parti pour adopter un nouveau projet de loi en matière de soins de santé. En outre, comme l'Iran respecte en tous points l'accord actuel, il refusera catégoriquement de le renégocier.

Pour arrêter d'étendre son arsenal nucléaire, duquel il pense que la survie de son pays dépend, Kim Jong-un doit obtenir l'assurance que les États-Unis négocient de bonne foi.

À ce stade, l'annulation de cet accord entamera par ailleurs sérieusement la crédibilité des États-Unis qui essayent en même temps de trouver une solution pour négocier l'utilisation des armes nucléaires avec la Corée du Nord. Le dirigeant nord-coréen Kim Jong-un n'a aucune raison de se fier à Trump. Pour arrêter d'étendre son arsenal nucléaire, duquel il pense que la survie de son pays dépend, Kim Jong-un doit obtenir l'assurance que les États-Unis négocient de bonne foi. Or, renier l'accord nucléaire iranien compliquera considérablement toute négociation éventuelle avec l'État nord-coréen et ne facilitera pas la mise en place de solutions durables.

Les alliés des États-Unis, à savoir la France, l'Allemagne et la Grande-Bretagne – ainsi que la Russie et la Chine, cosignataires de cet accord – s'opposent fermement à l'annulation et ne soutiendront pas l'imposition de nouvelles sanctions. De plus, l'abandon de cet accord aura pour conséquences de laisser les États-Unis complètement isolés, de fragiliser la sécurité mondiale et de mettre à rude épreuve les relations de l'État américain avec ses alliés, eux-mêmes soumis à de fortes pressions à la suite du comportement imprévisible et malvenu de Donald Trump.

Si l'accord est annulé et que l'Iran obtient des armes nucléaires, cette situation consolidera sensiblement son emprise régionale et nourrira davantage son ambition hégémonique.

Si l'accord est annulé et que l'Iran obtient des armes nucléaires, cette situation consolidera sensiblement son emprise régionale et nourrira davantage son ambition hégémonique. De plus, l'annulation de cet accord aura pour conséquences d'intensifier le conflit entre l'Arabie saoudite et l'Iran, de prolonger la guerre par procuration entre les sunnites et les chiites au Yémen, en Irak et en Syrie, et d'enraciner davantage l'Iran dans tout le croissant entre le Golfe et la Méditerranée.

Les efforts des États-Unis pour lutter contre l'extrémisme islamique violent seront entravés, dans la mesure où l'Iran sera beaucoup plus dévolu au soutien de groupes extrémistes, au financement du terrorisme et à la déstabilisation de la région où et quand il le souhaitera. En outre, l'Iran poursuivra avec détermination son programme de missiles et aucune nouvelle sanction américaine ne pourra l'en dissuader, même si ces mesures ont permis de faire pression sur l'État iranien par le passé.

Le premier ministre israélien Benyamin Nétanyahou fait cavalier seul en poussant naïvement Trump à annuler l'accord iranien. Il semblerait cependant que celui-ci ne comprenne pas les conséquences que cet acte malavisé aura sur la sécurité nationale d'Israël. En effet, l'annulation de l'accord iranien désavantagera considérablement Israël, puisque l'Iran sera en mesure d'accélérer l'élaboration de ses armes nucléaires. Selon toutes les estimations, l'Iran sera capable de tester une arme nucléaire dans un an.

Enfin, l'annulation de cet accord changera radicalement l'équilibre du pouvoir au Moyen-Orient entre les États arabes et l'Iran. Elle aura le même effet sur Israël et Téhéran, puisque l'Iran neutralisera le bouclier nucléaire israélien et laissera le pays tributaire d'une dissuasion nucléaire précaire au lieu de bénéficier d'un avantage stratégique.

Trump devrait écouter son secrétaire à la défense James Mattis qui a récemment déclaré devant le Congrès qu'il était dans l'intérêt de la sécurité nationale des États-Unis de maintenir cet accord. Au lieu de l'annuler, et de faire face aux terribles conséquences évoquées ci-dessus, Trump (avec le soutien des autres signataires) doit veiller à ce que l'Iran continue de respecter pleinement l'ensemble des dispositions de l'accord, en avertissant Téhéran que la communauté internationale ne tolérera pas la moindre violation.

Les États-Unis doivent essayer de renforcer cette entente et s'assurer qu'à son terme, l'Iran continuera de respecter les règles et les exigences du traité sur la non-prolifération des armes nucléaires (TNP), dont l'Iran est signataire, afin de l'empêcher de poursuivre secrètement son programme nucléaire.

Les États-Unis doivent également insister sur le fait que l'Agence internationale de l'énergie atomique continuera de procéder à des vérifications et des contrôles intrusifs, illimités et inopinés, pour que Téhéran comprenne bien les conséquences désastreuses qui s'ensuivront si l'Iran se fait prendre la main dans le sac.

En outre, les États-Unis devraient renforcer pleinement la coopération de leurs services de renseignement avec ceux des leurs alliés en partageant des informations pertinentes pour empêcher l'Iran ou n'importe lequel de ses représentants de planifier et de mettre en œuvre un acte de terrorisme, ou d'envoyer ou de fabriquer des armes à l'un ou l'autre de ses clients, comme le Hezbollah au Liban.

Il faut convaincre Téhéran qu'il est inacceptable que l'Iran continue de soutenir des organisations terroristes en leur fournissant de l'argent et du matériel pour déstabiliser la région. L'Iran en paiera le prix non seulement par l'imposition de sanctions paralysantes, mais aussi en risquant une confrontation militaire avec les États-Unis.

Il convient de souligner que le potentiel d'acquisition d'armes nucléaires de l'Iran doit être examiné dans le contexte de la situation régionale. Les États-Unis devront donc tenir compte des conflits qui impliquent l'Iran – y compris les guerres au Yémen, en Syrie et en Irak – dès que l'État islamique sera totalement vaincu. En effet, tant que persistent ces luttes violentes, l'Iran cherchera sans aucun doute à obtenir des armes nucléaires pour renforcer sa stature et son influence dans la région.

Les États-Unis doivent dès lors inciter l'Iran à résoudre la guerre civile en Syrie, le conflit au Yémen et la stabilité future de l'Irak. L'État américain doit également reconnaître le droit à l'indépendance des Kurdes irakiens, une reconnaissance qui permettrait d'atténuer, plutôt que d'exacerber, les tensions entre les Kurdes irakiens et la Turquie, l'Irak et l'Iran. En outre, les États-Unis doivent apporter une aide financière au Liban, à la Syrie et au Yémen dans le but d'affaiblir l'influence et la portée de l'Iran.

Les États-Unis ne doivent laisser aucun doute dans l'esprit du clergé iranien : ils respecteront leur engagement de protéger leurs alliés s'ils sont menacés directement ou indirectement par l'Iran.

Enfin, les États-Unis doivent renforcer la défense des pays du Golfe afin de dissuader l'Iran de lancer des attaques conventionnelles, en fournissant à ces pays ainsi qu'à d'autres alliés du Moyen-Orient un parapluie nucléaire qui rendra bien moins attrayante la quête d'un armement nucléaire aux yeux de l'Iran. Les États-Unis ne doivent laisser aucun doute dans l'esprit du clergé iranien : ils respecteront leur engagement de protéger leurs alliés s'ils sont menacés directement ou indirectement par l'Iran.

À l'inverse, l'État iranien doit s'attendre à ce que ses relations avec l'Occident se normalisent et à ce que toutes les sanctions qui lui sont imposées soient progressivement levées, à mesure qu'il manifestera sa volonté de mettre un terme au soutien qu'il apporte aux organisations terroristes et aux extrémistes violents, en endiguant son programme de missiles à longue portée et en permettant l'organisation d'inspections continues et illimitées de ses installations nucléaires.

Toute mesure ne visant pas à certifier le respect par l'Iran de cet accord sera contre-productive, car elle le plongera dans la confusion et le désarroi, le mettant tout à fait en péril. Trump doit encore faire preuve de perspicacité diplomatique ou démontrer ses compétences pour résoudre des crises, mais il ne fait que s'engager dans des polémiques imprudentes et dangereuses qui empoisonnent davantage les relations entre les ennemis et les amis des États-Unis.

Rendre l'accord iranien nul et non avenu couronnera l'approche perfide et malavisée de Trump et sapera irrémédiablement le leadership mondial, moral et politique de l'Amérique. Les généraux de Trump le savent pertinemment bien et doivent donc l'arrêter avant qu'il ne soit trop tard.

Ihre Haut ist dünn und verletzlich. So wie die Flügel eines Schmetterlings. Es gibt nur wenige Momente im Leben der Zwölfjährigen, in denen sie ihre Krankheit vergessen kann. Die meisten davon erlebt sie an einem Ort, der im ersten Moment nicht danach klingt, als könnte es für ein an Epidermolysis bullosa leidendes Mädchen ein Happy Place sein: auf dem Rücken eines Pferdes.

Knöpfe oder Nähte, kleine Stöße. Dinge, die uns im Alltag begleiten und passieren können, stellen für Alinas Haut eine enorme Gefahr da. Eine unbedachte Bewegung, ein Moment der Unachtsamkeit – und schon reißt ihre Haut auf. „Unser Leben ist ein einziges Aufpassen“, sagt Alinas Mutter, Michaela Schierholz. Kleinigkeiten, die gesunde Menschen kaum kümmern, können für ihre Tochter gravierende Folgen haben. Selbst in der Schule. Wenn sie zu lange am Stück schreibt, fängt ihre gesamte Hand an zu bluten.

Und dann äußert Alina den Wunsch, reiten zu wollen. Reiten. Einer viel größeren Gefahr könnte sich Alina kaum aussetzen. Wo doch selbst der Gartenschlauch im heimischen Garten, über den sie im vergangenen Sommer gestolpert war, für Wochen voller Kummer und Sorgen gesorgt hatte. Doch auf dem Rücken von Therapiepferd Maggy ist die Zwölfjährige ein ganz normales Mädchen. Nur ein kleines Fell, das auf dem Sattel liegt, und zu harte Stöße dämpfen soll, unterscheidet sie von anderen pferdeverrückten Fast-Teenagern.

„Wenn ich auf Maggy reite, merkt sie sofort, wenn ich unsicher bin. Dann hält sie sofort an.“ Alina findet ihr Glück auf Maggys Rücken. Und allmählich ist auch Mama Michaela deutlich entspannter, wenn sie zum Reitunterricht fahren. „Anfangs bin ich tausend Tode gestorben“, erzählt sie. Immer hatte sie bange Fragen im Hinterkopf: Was passiert, wenn Alina vom Pferd fällt? Was, wenn im Stall etwas passiert? Passiert ist in den anderthalb Jahren, in denen Alina nun schon Reitunterricht nimmt, aber noch nichts.

Michaela Schierholz vertraut nicht nur Maggy, sie sieht auch, wie das Reiten ihre Tochter verändert hat. Alinas Gleichgewichtssinn hat sich deutlich verbessert. Die Folge: Sie fällt seltener hin als noch vor der Verwandlung zum „Pferdemädchen“. Und selbstbewusster ist die Zwölfjährige geworden. Nicht nur in der Arbeit mit dem Pferd. Sondern generell. „Maggy ist einfach toll“, sagt Alina. Das zarte Mädchen und das massige Kaltblut. Ein Bild voller Gegensätze – und voller Liebe.

Porträt: Reit-Therapiezentrum der Stiftung Synanon Berlin

Einmal in der Woche, immer freitags, fahren Alina und Mama Michaela auf den Hof der Stiftung Synanon in Berlin-Frohnau. In dieser Einrichtung werden unter anderem Suchtkranke betreut. Und seit drei Jahren wird dort auch heilpädagogisches Reiten angeboten. 13 Kinder und 3 Erwachsene mit unterschiedlichsten Krankheiten nehmen hier regelmäßig Reitunterricht. Autisten, Querschnittsgelähmte, Gehörlose, eine Frau mit multipler Sklerose und Alina.

Sie alle vereint, dass sie ein Leben leben, das sich zu einem großen Teil in Arztpraxen, Krankenhäusern und bei Physiotherapeuten abspielt. Doch der beste Therapeut, darin sind sich alle einig, heißt Maggy. Die 18-jährige Tinker-Stute ist eins von drei Therapiepferden auf dem Hof. Fernab vom Großstadt-Lärm schafft dieses sanfte Wesen etwas, das ihren Reitern weder Ärzte noch Medikamente geben können. Einen Moment der Freiheit, in dem sie den Augenblick genießen – und ihre Krankheiten keine Rolle spielen.

Auch Reitlehrerin Petra Mächold sieht, dass sich Alina in den vergangenen anderthalb Jahren verändert hat. „Ihre ganze Körperhaltung war zusammengekauert. Sie hatte permanent Angst, sich zu stoßen.“ Wer heute sehe, wie selbstbewusst und gerade Alina auf dem Pferd sitzt, könne sich kaum vorstellen, dass sie einmal anders gewesen ist. Was Alina beim Reiten am meisten Spaß macht? „Galoppieren natürlich! Da fühl ich mich so herrlich frei.“

Das einzige Manko: Hippotherapien werden nicht von Krankenkassen übernommen. Weil laut Bundesministerium für Gesundheit „ein therapeutischer Nutzen der Hippotherapie nicht nachgewiesen ist und die Therapie daher als nicht verordnungsfähiges Heilmittel zu führen ist“. Das heißt: Betroffene, die diesen Weg der Therapie gehen wollen, müssen ihn aus eigener Tasche bezahlen oder versuchen, ihn über Spenden zu finanzieren.

La dernière décennie a été marquée par une croissance sans précédent des acteurs privés dans l'éducation, notamment dans les pays à faibles revenus. Cette croissance est sur le point de transformer en profondeur des systèmes éducatifs déjà fragiles. De nombreux investisseurs, comprenant des entreprises multinationales, s'impliquent à grande échelle dans le marché jugé très lucratif de l'éducation. Certains proposent des services à bas coût, de mauvaise qualité, visant les populations pauvres, tout en s'exonérant des régulations des États. La croissance de ces acteurs privés, et plus généralement, de la marchandisation de l'éducation, est particulièrement marquée au niveau du cycle fondamental (primaire et secondaire), là où les injustices sociales se creusent.

Collaborer pour cerner les enjeux

Depuis 2015, un consortium international d'organisations travaille sur la privatisation de l'éducation et les droits de l'Homme afin de mieux cerner les enjeux de ce phénomène et d'agir de manière collective et constructive. Au sein de ce consortium, un réseau francophone contre la marchandisation de l'éducation (le réseau francophone) s'est constitué en 2016, dans lequel le Comité syndical francophone de l'éducation et de la formation (CSFEF) joue un rôle actif.

Un appel entendu

Le réseau francophone a organisé un colloque en mars 2016 au siège de l'OIF à Paris puis a lancé l'appel francophone contre la marchandisation de l'éducation, qui a reçu le soutien de 302 organisations dans 38 pays.

Les chefs d'État et de gouvernement ont aussi manifesté leur inquiétude face à la prolifération des écoles privées.

Cet Appel a été entendu par les chefs d'État et de gouvernement lors du Sommet de la Francophonie, qui s'est tenu à Madagascar en novembre 2016. En effet, l'éducation s'est taillé une place de choix dans la Déclaration qui a été adoptée lors de ce Sommet. Plusieurs paragraphes font écho aux revendications exprimées dans l'Appel, dont l'importance d'avoir des enseignantes et enseignants qualifiés pour une éducation de qualité, l'attachement à l'éducation publique et le contrôle renforcé du secteur éducatif privé. Les chefs d'État et de gouvernement ont aussi manifesté leur inquiétude face à la prolifération des écoles privées.

Réfléchir aux défis actuels

Dans le prolongement de ces actions, le réseau francophone organise en octobre 2017 une rencontre francophone sur la marchandisation de l'éducation qui sera l'occasion pour les acteurs impliqués dans la réalisation et la défense du droit à l'éducation (représentants des États, des organisations internationales, des ONG, des chercheurs...) de se réunir pour discuter des défis actuels que pose l'accroissement sans précédent des acteurs privés dans l'éducation, et de développer une réponse qui soit en phase avec l'histoire, les valeurs, et la culture des sociétés de la Francophonie.

Cette Rencontre de la société civile francophone sera aussi l'occasion de rappeler aux chefs d'État et de gouvernement les engagements qu'ils ont pris sur la scène internationale en faveur de l'éducation publique, gratuite et de qualité pour toutes et tous. Car ces engagements doivent se traduire en actions concrètes, dès maintenant.",Il faut agir pour contrer la privatisation et la marchandisation de l’éducation,http://quebec.huffingtonpost.ca/luc-allaire/il-faut-agir-pour-contrer-la-privatisation-et-la-marchandisation-de-l-education_a_23240499/

A family photo of James

A lot has been written about grief. You can Google it, and you will find any number of guides, or quotes laid on the background of a field, or fluffy white clouds.

You probably haven't Googled grief unless you have experienced it in someway or another... I certainly hadn't. In fact, I would go so far as to say I had no understanding or appreciation for what grief or loss really was, up until the 31st of October 2016. This is despite my job in the police, where I have comforted victims, the bereft and those worst affected by sad events. You don't truly know grief until it hits you, like a meteor striking the surface of a planet.

My happiest moments

On the 21st of September 2016, my wife Emily gave birth to twins, James and Isabel. They were perfect. After a brief stay in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, we as a family left our local hospital with our older daughter Lexy, and travelled home. I can't remember a time when I was prouder, or more elated... and probably more apprehensive as to what was life going to be like.

The next four weeks were like a blur. I wish they weren't. I wish I could remember it all like yesterday. But with little sleep and a lot of 'jobs', we as a couple kept our head above the water line, feeding, changing nappies and coming to terms with the fact that a small, two bedroom flat might struggle to hold the five of us! Looking back at that time, if I could give myself one bit of advice it would be to savour the moments and not to stress about the future and the 'what ifs'.

Transfer to hospital

On the morning of the 29th of October, James fell ill. He was rushed to our local hospital but he was so poorly he needed more specialist care. The amazing and dogged work by staff from our local hospital, then staff of the Children's Acute Transfer Service (CATS) ambulance team, and finally the intensive care doctors and nurses at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) allowed us to spend two more days with our boy, before he passed away in our arms on the 31st of October at 19:35hrs. We think, but will sadly never know for sure, that James died of sepsis. It was at that point when I began to understand what grief was really all about.

Then, three weeks after we lost James, his twin sister Isabel fell ill. It happened much like it did for James, but Isabel had completely unrelated problems. We repeated the journey to our local hospital, and then to GOSH, where Isabel was rushed into surgery, which saved her life. A year on, my sweet girl has just turned one, and the only mark to tell the story of that harrowing time is a small scar on her belly, in time it might even go completely.

Coming to terms with loss

In my eulogy at James' memorial I said: 'No parent should ever have to bury their child' and I don't think a truer word has ever been said. If I could have one wish, it would not be for James to be back in our lives, that would be a selfish wish. My wish would be for no father or mother to ever have to endure the pain and suffering of losing a child.

So what do you do when you've had the worst thing happen? To be honest, I couldn't tell you, because unlike the explanations on that search engine, your grief is unique to you. All I can say is you will learn to live with the ache, your heart will never be the same again but it will still beat and you must let it. You will find solace in something or someone, and they or it will help you on that path of recovery.

Creating a legacy for James



Our team of runners at the Royal Parks Half Marathon. Photo credit: Alexander Newton

One of our sticking plasters has been trying to give back, and so we started the Little Jimmy Brighter Future Fund in memory of James, to raise money for Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity, in December last year. We set ourselves a target of raising enough money for GOSH to buy two specialist ventilators for the CATS ambulances to take the sickest of children, like James, from their local hospital to GOSH for the very best of care. The machines will support the vital services that the CATS team provides, and they don't come cheap, but in less than a year we have raised over £140,000. That means we can buy not only the two specialist ventilators we set out to fund, but additional equipment that will also be used to help children on their journey of recovery.

'We' is the key word in that sentence. 'We' is friends, family, colleagues and complete strangers donating, running events like the Royal Parks Half Marathon with me and Emily, cycling, baking and many more things to help buy the equipment, but in their words, to help 'try and walk with us on that road to recovery'.

And that is my final point. When you are low, in the darkest of times, people are the one constant in getting you back to some semblance of existence. The family members' hug, the quiet drink with the friend or seeing a donation from a complete stranger... they are the actions that mean grief can be conquered.

Emily and Pete, and over 100 of their friends, family members and supporters of the Little Jimmy Brighter Future Fund ran the Royal Parks Half Marathon, with all money raised going to support Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity in James' memory.

C'est presque une expression toute faite tant elle est passée dans le langage commun. Cette loi non écrite aux contours flous fait pourtant des ravages. L'affaire Weinstein est une illustration parfaite de combien cette loi est puissante et ce silence, assourdissant.

Le producteur star américain Harvey Weinstein a été licencié ce dimanche 8 octobre par sa propre maison de production. Deux jours plus tard les accusations et les témoignages glaçants de victimes se multiplient. Ce mardi 10 octobre, deux Françaises, Emma de Caunes et Judith Godrèche, se confient. Tout comme des actrices puissantes et influentes comme Angelina Jolie ou encore Gwyneth Paltrow. L'Italienne Asia Argento assure, elle, avoir été victime d'un viol en 1997.

Pourquoi aujourd'hui, en octobre 2017? Pourquoi ne pas avoir parlé plus tôt? Certaines l'ont fait. Gwyneth Paltrow par exemple en avait parlé à Brad Pitt qui partageait sa vie alors. L'acteur était allé le confronter, assure-t-elle au New York Times mais à cause des pressions d'Harvey Weinstein sur la toute jeune actrice pour qu'elle se taise, rien n'a été rendu public. Judith Godrèche en parle quant à elle à une femme haut placée à Miramax qui lui conseille de garder le silence, pour que la promotion de son film n'en soit pas entachée.

Angelina Jolie confie de son côté avoir prévenu ceux qui pouvaient travailler avec lui de son comportement. Toutes ont vécu ces harcèlements, ces agressions et parfois ces viols au début de leur carrière. Laquelle aurait pu risquer sa carrière pour accuser publiquement un homme aussi puissant?

Parler mais peut-être tout perdre au passage

Preuve que la parole a mis beaucoup de temps à se libérer, en 2004, une journaliste américaine voulait déjà parler du comportement de ce producteur dans une enquête sur Miramax en Italie. Elle accuse désormais le New York Times de l'avoir censurée et dit avoir reçu des pressions des acteurs Matt Damon et Russell Crowe. Mais cela n'explique pas forcément le silence de ces femmes, parmi les plus influentes du monde du cinéma. Si même elles ne peuvent dénoncer un agresseur, qui le pourrait?

""Je ne suis pas étonnée de ce silence"", confirme Muriel Salmona, psychiatre et présidente de l'association mémoire traumatique au HuffPost. ""Dans tous les systèmes fermés qu'il s'agisse de la famille, du couple, d'une institution ou d'un milieu comme celui du cinéma, la loi du silence est présente"". À quoi s'exposent ces femmes? À ne pas être entendues, à ne pas être prises au sérieux, à être culpabilisées, à des menaces, à être mises en cause, à devoir se défendre, en un mot, à perdre beaucoup.

Leur statut de star confirmée ou en devenir, et celui de leur agresseur est une promesse supplémentaire que leur histoire sera ensuite décortiquée par la presse pendant plusieurs jours ou même plusieurs semaines. Qui, juste après une agression, aurait la force à ce compte de prendre la parole et de dénoncer?

L'effet de la dissociation traumatique sur la parole

Imaginons que Gwyneth Paltrow ou Angelina Jolie aient décidé de garder le silence sur ce qu'elles ont subi jusqu'à ce qu'elles aient une carrière bien installée. La première aurait pu prendre la parole quelques années plus tard, quand elle décrochait l'Oscar de la meilleure actrice pour son rôle dans ""Shakespeare in love"". Mais comment être sûre qu'elle n'allait pas tout perdre? Et le pouvait-elle vraiment?

Certaines victimes de violences peuvent développer une dissociation traumatique. Après l'agression, la victime est paralysée par un état de sidération. Le cortex cérébral est alors incapable de contrôler l'intensité de la réaction de stress. L'organisme perçoit qu'il y a un risque vital. Il déclenche des mécanisme de sauvegarde qui ont pour effet de faire ""disjoncter le circuit émotionnel"", selon les termes de Muriel Salmona et cela entraîne une anesthésie émotionnelle et physique.

C'est cette anesthésie qui produit la dissociation. Cet état s'affirme par ""un sentiment d'étrangeté, de déconnexion et de dépersonnalisation, comme si la victime devenait spectatrice de la situation puisqu'elle la perçoit sans émotion"". Voilà qui peut aussi expliquer bien des silences, car cet état de dissociation peut durer des années.

""Nous avons aussi un rôle à jouer""

""Même lorsqu'elles parlent, comme ces actrices l'ont fait, personne n'a vraiment envie de les entendre. La société n'a pas envie de savoir ça"", dénonce aussi Muriel Salmona. L'affaire Weinstein éclate quelques jours après la sortie en France du livre de Sandrine Rousseau, ""Parler"". Un récit de l'agression sexuelle qu'elle affirme avoir subi par l'ancien député Denis Baupin. Un témoignage pour encourager les victimes de violences sexuelles à ne plus se taire.

""Briser la loi du silence est un remède qui peut être douloureux au début mais aide à se réconcilier avec soi-même, à être plus forte ensuite"", écrit l'ancienne élue EELV. Mais comment y parvenir? Selon Muriel Salmona, il faut qu'une victime se mette à parler et soit entendue pour que d'autres puissent parler à leur tour.

Mais tout n'incombe pas à la victime. ""Nous avons aussi un rôle à jouer. Les médias doivent en parler en respectant les victimes, les professionnels de santé doivent poser la question à leurs patients. Mais plus largement, nous devons individuellement nous préoccuper de nos enfants, de notre famille, de nos amis et leur poser la question.""

En France, selon des chiffres dévoilés en février 2017, une victime de viol sur cinq n'a jamais parlé de son agression et seules 13% des personnes se déclarant victimes de viol ont déposé plainte.

""Teen Wolf"", ""Maze Runner"" und der Unfall

Nach dem Highschool-Abschluss ergatterte Dylan O'Brien seine erste größere Rolle: In der MTV-Serie ""Teen Wolf"" übernahm er 2011 die Rolle des Stiles. Stiles ist der beste Freund von Werwolf Scott McCall (Tyler Posey), der für jede Menge Lacher sorgt. Der Serie blieb O'Brien bis zur finalen, sechsten Staffel treu. Erst im September 2017 flimmerte die letzte Folge über die US-Bildschirme. Neben der Show bekam er kleinere Rollen, zum Beispiel in der Komödie ""Prakti.com"" an der Seite von Vince Vaughn und Owen Wilson oder in ""Deepwater Horizon"" mit Mark Wahlberg.

Erste Qualitäten als Leading Man konnte er in ""Maze Runner - Die Auserwählten im Labyrinth"" unter Beweis stellen. Er übernahm in der Buchadaption die Hauptrolle des Thomas. Die Sci-Fi-Filme basieren auf der Roman-Trilogie von James Dashner. Der erste Teil spielte im Jahr 2014 über 345 Millionen Dollar ein, ""Maze Runner - Die Auserwählten in der Brandwüste"" schaffte 2015 ebenfalls über 300 Millionen Dollar weltweit. Der dritte und letzte Teil, ""Maze Runner: Die Auserwählten in der Todeszone"", sollte 2017 erscheinen. Doch O'Brien wurde im März 2016 bei den Dreharbeiten schwer verletzt.

Lange Zeit war unklar, ob und wie es mit dem Film und dem Schauspieler weitergehen würde. Der Filmstart wurde in Deutschland schließlich auf 01. Februar 2018 verschoben. Das erste offizielle Foto von O'Brien gab es im September 2016, als er bereits für ""American Assassin"" vor der Kamera stand. In dem Streifen ist er ab 12. Oktober als die beliebte Buch-Figur Mitch Rapp zu sehen. Im Zuge der Pressetour sprach er erstmals öffentlich in Interviews über seinen Horror-Unfall, den Panikattacken, von denen er heimgesucht wurde und dass er beinahe alles hingeschmissen hätte.

Sein privates Glück

Doch der 26-Jährige hat sich erholt - körperlich und seelisch. Neben seinen Eltern wich auch seine Freundin Britt Robertson (27, ""Kein Ort ohne Dich"") in dieser schweren Zeit nicht von seiner Seite. ""Sie ist eine Heilige"", schwärmte er jüngst in einem Interview über die Unterstützung seiner Liebsten. Die beiden Schauspieler lernten sich bei den Dreharbeiten zum Teenie-Film ""The First Time - Dein erstes Mal vergisst du nie!"" (2012) kennen und lieben. Doch Robertson muss ihren Freund teilen...

In ""The Late Late Show with James Corden"" erklärte er Mitte September, dass es nichts gebe, was ihm mehr bedeute als Baseball und die Mets.

ISLAMABAD — A Canadian man, his American wife and their three young children have been released after being held captive for years by a network with ties to the Taliban, U.S. and Pakistani officials said Thursday.

U.S. officials say Pakistan secured the release of Joshua Boyle and his wife Caitlan Coleman who were abducted five years ago while travelling in Afghanistan and had been held by the Haqqani network in Pakistan.

Coleman was pregnant when she was captured. The couple had three children while in captivity, and all have been freed, U.S. officials say.

A U.S. national security official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing operation, commended Pakistan for their critical assistance in securing the family's release — and described the co-operation as an important step in the right direction for U.S.-Pakistani relations.

Pakistan criticized

The U.S. has long criticized Pakistan for failing to aggressively go after the Haqqanis, who have been behind many attacks against U.S. and allied forces in Afghanistan.

In Pakistan, its military said in a statement that U.S. intelligence agencies had been tracking the hostages and discovered they had come into Pakistan on Oct. 11 through its tribal areas bordering Afghanistan.

""All hostages were recovered safe and sound and are being repatriated to the country of their origin,'' the military said.

Three Pakistani military officials, all speaking on condition of anonymity as they weren't allowed to speak to journalists, also confirmed the hostages' identities.

This still image made from a 2013 video released by the Coleman family shows Caitlan Coleman and her husband, Canadian Joshua Boyle in a militant video given to the family.

The release, which came together rapidly Wednesday, comes nearly five years to the day since Boyle and Coleman lost touch with their families while travelling in a mountainous region near the Afghan capital, Kabul.

The couple set off in the summer 2012 for a journey that took them to Russia, the central Asian countries of Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, and then to Afghanistan. Coleman's parents last heard from their son-in-law on Oct. 8, 2012, from an internet cafe in what Boyle described as an ""unsafe'' part of Afghanistan.

In 2013, the couple appeared in two videos asking the U.S. government to free them.

A video released in August last year showed Coleman and Boyle warning that their captors would kill them and their children unless the government in Kabul ended its execution of Taliban prisoners.

Last December, in a video of the couple and two of their children that was uploaded to YouTube, the pair urged governments on all sides to reach a deal to secure the family's freedom. Boyle's parents had said the clip marked the first time they had seen their two grandchildren.

Patrick and Linda Boyle had said it was heartbreaking to watch their grandsons observing their surroundings while listening to their mother describe how they were made to watch her being ""defiled.''

""It is an indescribable emotional sense one has watching a grandson making faces at the camera, while hearing our son's leg chains clanging up and down on the floor as he tries to settle his son,'' the Boyles said in a written statement. ""It is unbelievable that they have had to shield their sons from their horrible reality for four years.''

The parents said their son told them in a letter that he and his wife tried to protect their children by pretending their signs of captivity are part of a game being played with guards.

In the clip, Coleman said she and her family had been living a ""Kafkaesque nightmare'' since 2012. The Boyles had said their daughter-in-law could not have used a more accurate term.

Meanwhile, Coleman's parents, Jim and Lyn Coleman, told the online Circa News service in July 2016 that they received a letter from their daughter in November 2015, in which she wrote that she'd given birth to a second child in captivity. It's unclear whether they knew she'd had a third.

Group typically does not execute hostages

""I pray to hear from you again, to hear how everybody is doing,'' the letter said.

In that interview, Jim Coleman issued a plea to top Taliban commanders to be ""kind and merciful'' and let the couple go.

""As a man, father and now grandfather, I am asking you to show mercy and release my daughter, her husband, and our beautiful grandchildren,'' Jim Coleman said. ""Please grant them an opportunity to continue their lives with us, and bring peace to their families.''

The family was being held by the Haqqani network. U.S. officials call the group a terrorist organization and have targeted its leaders with drone strikes. But the group also operates like a criminal network. Unlike the Islamic State group, it does not typically execute Western hostages, preferring to ransom them for cash.

This year, Australia experienced one of its worst flu seasons on record, prompting concerns over a similar epidemic here in the UK.

In September, it was reported there had been 170,000 influenza cases in Australia, double that of 2016, and more than 70 deaths related to the illness, which affected those over the age of 80 and children aged 5-9 the most.

The flu is a largely unpredictable virus which affects people in different ways.

For otherwise healthy people it can cause symptoms that will clear up in about a week, but there are some vulnerable groups - such as the elderly, pregnant women - who are at risk to potentially serious complications. According to Public Health England, on average 8,000 people die from flu on average every year.

A preventative flu jab is therefore offered - free of charge for at-risk groups - to minimise the impact of the virus. Here is what you need to know about eligibility, availability and effectiveness of this year’s vaccination.

What are flu symptoms?

Flu symptoms often come on quickly with sufferers experiencing a fever, a dry chesty cough, tiredness, the chills, joint pain or aching muscles. Much of the time it will make them too unwell to do anything.

Other symptoms include: diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, a sore throat, a blocked or runny nose, sneezing, loss of appetite and difficulty sleeping.

How does the flu jab work?

The annual flu vaccine stimulates the body’s immune system to make antibodies to attack the virus. The idea is that if you’re exposed to the flu virus after having the vaccine, your immune system will recognise it and know how to fight it.

According to the NHS, it can take 10-14 days for immunity to build up after having the vaccine.

It’s important to have the vaccine each year, as it is reformulated to try and combat different strains which scientists predict will be prevalent (more on that below).

Who should get the flu jab?

Between 2017 and 2018, the flu vaccination will be offered free of charge to:

:: those aged 65 and over

:: pregnant women

:: those aged six months to under 65 in clinical risk groups

:: people living in a residential or nursing home

:: the main carer of an older or disabled person

:: children aged 2-3

:: children in reception class and school years 1-4 (with their parents’ consent).

Where can you get the flu jab?

To get your vaccine or find out if you are eligible, contact your GP, pharmacist or midwife for more information. Some people may be offered the flu vaccine through their work’s health scheme.

You can also pay for the flu jab at a range of pharmacies including Superdrug, Boots and Lloyds Pharmacy, as well as in Asda and Tesco.

Is it suitable for vegetarians and vegans?

If you’re vegan, or a vegetarian who strictly doesn’t eat eggs, the flu vaccine won’t be suitable because it will have been incubated in egg. That said, it’s fine for people with egg allergies, according to PHE, as the levels are very low.

A spokesperson for PHE tells HuffPost UK: “The production and availability of egg-free flu vaccines is determined by flu vaccine manufacturers and they have not made any egg-free flu vaccines this season.”

Some of the flu vaccines available have a very low ovalbumin (egg protein) content - we’re talking trace amounts only. NICE has published a list of the vaccines available in the current flu season and the ovalbumin levels for each one, which you can find here.

When should you get the flu jab?

The NHS says the best time to get the flub jab is in autumn, between early October and November. If you miss this period, don’t worry you can also be vaccinated later in winter.

If you had a flu jab last year, you will need to get another flu vaccination this year.

What are flu jab side effects?

Contrary to what many believe, you can’t catch the flu from the flu jab. The adult vaccine doesn’t contain live viruses.

You may feel a mild fever or muscle aches after your flu jab, but this is your immune system reacting to the vaccine. These symptoms should pass within a few days.

The NHS recommends the following to alleviate mild symptoms:

continue to move your arm regularly – don’t let it get stiff and sore

take a painkiller, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen – pregnant women shouldn’t take ibuprofen unless a doctor recommends and prescribes it

Serious reactions to the flu jab are rare, but they may indicate an allergic reaction. Please visit your GP if you experience severe side effects.

Which strains does it protect against?

Every year, the World Health Organisation (WHO) reviews the global situation and recommends which three flu strains should go into the vaccine to be manufactured for the following season.

A spokesperson for Public Health England explains this recommendation is based on the viruses circulating each season and epidemiological data from around the world.

This process means the WHO has to decide which strains of flu to protect against before flu season has even begun and the illness has started circulating properly.

According to the NHS, most injected flu vaccines protect against three types of flu virus:

A/H1N1 – the strain of flu that caused the swine flu pandemic in 2009

A/H3N2 – a strain of flu that mainly affects the elderly and people with risk factors like a long term health condition. In 2017/18 the vaccine will contain an A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 H3N2-like virus

Influenza B – a strain of flu that particularly affects children. In 2017/18 the vaccine will contain B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus

The nasal spray flu vaccine and some injected vaccines also offer protection against a fourth B strain of virus, which in 2017/18 is the B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus.

The strain that has been witnessed predominantly in Australia this year is influenza A strain H3N2.

Leading infectious diseases expert Dr Peter Collignon told The Guardian that this particular strain hit the UK and other European countries last year and the vaccine for the strain “didn’t work”.

He added that it “was zero per cent effective for those over 65”.

What is the predicted success rate?

Over the past few years, success rates for the flu jab have fluctuated. In 2014, just one third of adults benefitted from the vaccine. Conversely, last year the vaccine was considered particularly effective among adults aged 18-64 - the jab reduced the risk of flu by 40.6% amongst those who received it.

In the over 65 population, however, last year’s vaccine was not very effective.

The reason success rates vary is largely due to the fact that the nature of the flu virus is unpredictable, but also because scientists have to predict which strains will be rife before flu season even starts.

A spokesperson for PHE said they cannot confidently predict how effective the vaccine will be this year, however they added that typical effectiveness of the flu vaccine is in the range of 40-60%. This means that for every 100 people vaccinated, 40 will be protected from this season’s flu.",Everything You Need To Know About This Year's Flu Jab,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2017/10/06/flu-vaccine-2017-what-you-need-to-know-about-jab_n_18245714.html?utm_hp_ref=uk

Erdem is known as one of the UK’s leading brands when it comes to ethical fashion and sustainability.

Among the first to partake in Livia Firth’s green carpet challenge, the couture brand is celebrated for their stance on fair trading practices and slow fashion.

Erdem x HM

H&M have been slowly introducing ‘conscious’ (ie sustainable) items into their range since April 2012.

The brand also recently implemented a commitment for all their cotton to be sustainable by 2020.

Erdem x HM

So, although the collaboration between the brands isn’t classed as sustainable, some of the cottons used in the range are organic.

Moreover, some of the pieces in the men’s collection are made of hand woven wool from Harris Tweed in Scotland.

Erdem x HM

While some Erdem fans might be a little disappointed that the entire collaboration can’t be categorised as sustainable (and therefore, ‘ethical’ as Erdem is known to be), this combined venture is still a step in the right direction.

In 2016, 43% of H&M’s cotton was sustainably sourced.

It would be interesting to see what 2017′s statistic will be, no doubt this collaboration will affect it.

Das TV-Duell vor der Niedersachsenwahl wurde zu einem hitzigen Wettstreit

SPD-Ministerpräsident Weil präsentierte sich gut aufgelegt – bei einer Frage verlor er den Faden

Gewissermaßen ist die Landtagswahl in Niedersachsen schon jetzt die bessere Bundestagswahl. Wenige Tage bevor die Wähler über das neue Parlament in Hannover abstimmen, bewegen sich CDU und SPD in Umfragen auf Augenhöhe.

Auch beim TV-Duell der Spitzenkandidaten Stephan Weil (SPD) und Bernd Althusmann (CDU) am Dienstagabend mussten Zuschauer die Differenzen der Volksparteien nicht mit der Lupe suchen.

Stattdessen lieferten sich Ministerpräsident Weil und sein konservativer Herausforderer ein leidenschaftliches Duell.

Der SPD-Kandidat, den viele nach dem plötzlichen Verlust der Regierungsmehrheit nach dem Fraktionsübertritt der Grünen Elke Twesten bereits angezählt hatten, konnte Althusmanns Angriffe über weite Strecken abwehren.

Sonntagsfrage #LTWNds Niedersachsen • INSA/BILD: SPD 33 %, CDU 32 %, GRÜ 10 %, FDP 10 %, AfD 7 %, LIN 5 %, Son 3 % – https://t.co/3YZHdks9fW pic.twitter.com/7MkZqClZtU — Wahlrecht.de (@Wahlrecht_de) 9. Oktober 2017

Nur bei einer entscheidenden Frage kam der SPD-Mann ins Schwimmen. Dabei hätte er es besser wissen müssen.

Weil will sich nicht zu Rot-Rot-Grün äußern

Als die Frage nach möglichen Koalitionen nach dem Urnengang der Niedersachsen am Sonntag aufkam, schaltete Althusmann auf Angriff. Auch der CDU-Kandidat weiß, dass ein rot-rot-grünes Bündnis – anders als im Bund – in Niedersachsen in Reichweite ist.

""Vielleicht äußern Sie sich dazu heute mal"", forderte der CDU-Mann in Bezug auf die Linkspartei. ""Sie eiern herum.""

Für die Konservativen ist das links-grün-sozialdemokratische Miteinander ein Schreckgespenst. Und auch Weil schien sich nicht offensiv zu einer solchen Option positionieren zu wollen.

Der Sozialdemokrat blockte recht ungeschickt ab: Man befasse sich natürlich äußerst kritisch mit den Linken. ""Das ist eine ganz klare Aussage."" War es nicht.

Fast war es, als habe der Ministerpräsident das Bundes-Desaster der SPD gar nicht mitbekommen, als die Sozialdemokraten den Wahlkampf mit der Ambition den Kanzler zu stellen bestritten, aber keine Regierungsoption präsentieren konnten. Viele SPDler an der Basis hatten sich ein frühes Bekenntnis zu Rot-Rot-Grün gewünscht.

Im Fall Twesten kann Weil punkten

Bei anderen Themen sah der SPD-Mann aus Hamburg besser aus. Die CDU habe sich im Fall Twesten unanständig verhalten, polterte Weil. ""Das bleibt in den Hinterköpfen der Menschen, weit über SPD-geneigte Kreise hinaus"", erklärte er und sprach damit ein für den CDU-Herausforderer kritisches Thema an.

Auch der Ministerpräsident merkte, dass er einen Treffer gelandet hatte. Er verstehe ja, dass Althusmann nicht über den Parteiwechsel der Grünen-Abgeordneten reden wolle, der die Wahl erst nötig gemacht hatte, legte er nach. ""Das war ein schwerer Fehler – ich glaube, das hängt Ihnen wie ein Mühlstein um den Hals, Herr Althusmann.“

Der konterte eher halbherzig: ""Sie hat sich entschieden, in die CDU-Fraktion zu kommen.""

Bildungspolitik und Dieselskandal

Das im zweitgrößten Bundesland wichtigste Wahlkampfthema ist die Bildungspolitik. Für Althusmann boten sich hier im TV-Duell des NDR die besten Chancen zur Attacke. Der CDU-Mann war bis 2013 selbst Kultusminister, der rot-grünen Schulpolitik wird derweil zumeist ein eher bescheidenes Zeugnis ausgestellt.

""Nicht versetzt"", urteilte Althusmann daher. Besonders am Konzept der Inklusion machte er sich zu Schaffen. Die SPD habe bei der Integration von Kindern mit Behinderung in den Schulalltag zu viel gewollt: ""Wir brauchen dringend eine Atempause."" Weil vertrat den gegensätzlichen Standpunkt: Inklusion sei nunmal ein Menschenrecht.

Der ambitionierte Plan sei umsetzbar, auch weil seine Regierung mehr Pädagogen und Betreuer eingestellt habe. Ohnehin habe auch Althusmann in seiner Zeit als Kultusminister viele Fehler gemacht, die es nun auszubaden gelte, so die Meinung des Ministerpräsidenten.

Bei einem anderen Thema wollte Weil dagegen lieber auf die Bremse treten. Das Thema VW sei ""zu wichtig, um damit Wahlkampf zu machen"". Althusmann dagegen ätzte, Weil lasse sich von den Konzernchefs vorführen. Vom Dieselskandal habe der VW-Aufsichtsrat aus den Medien erfahren.

Weil muss sich noch immer vorwerfen lassen, eine Regierungserklärung nach dem Abgas-Skandal vorher mit dem Konzern abgestimmt zu haben.

So war es der CDU-Mann, der wohl den empfindlichsten Treffer landete: ""Sie sind am Ende vom Konzern-Vorstand durch die Manege gezogen worden.""

Ο επικεφαλής του Facebook Μαρκ Ζούκερμπεργκ αποκάλυψε τη νέα αυτόνομη συσκευή εικονικής πραγματικότητας Oculus Go, η οποία δεν απαιτεί σύνδεση σε υπολογιστή όπως το Oculus Rift, κάτι που ο ίδιος ελπίζει ότι θα διευκολύνει την εξάπλωση της νέας αυτής τεχνολογίας στο ευρύ κοινό.



Η νέα συσκευή, σύμφωνα με τα πρακτορεία Γαλλικό και Ρόιτερς, θα κοστίζει 199 δολάρια και θα αρχίσει να πωλείται στην αρχή του 2018.



Όπως είπε ο επικεφαλής του Facebook, η νέα συσκευή αποτελεί το πρώτο προϊόν που προσφέρει εμπειρία εικονικής πραγματικότητας χωρίς να απαιτεί ούτε τη σύνδεσή της μέσω καλωδίου με έναν επιτραπέζιο υπολογιστή, ούτε το συνδυασμό της με ένα «έξυπνο» κινητό τηλέφωνο για να λειτουργήσει.



Το Oculus Go χρησιμοποιεί εσωτερικές κάμερες, αισθητήρες και ειδικό λογισμικό για να καταγράφει τις σωματικές κινήσεις, οι οποίες «μεταφράζονται» σε κινήσεις στους εικονικούς κόσμους που βλέπει ο χρήστης.



Ο Ζούκερμπεργκ δήλωσε ότι στόχος του είναι «να φέρουμε ένα δισεκατομμύριο ανθρώπους στην εικονική πραγματικότητα. Ο δρόμος δεν θα είναι εύκολος, αλλά η εικονική πραγματικότητα θα αλλάξει τον τρόπο που βλέπουμε τον κόσμο και θα κάνει τις ζωές μας πολύ καλύτερες».



H Sony, η HTC και η Oculus (που εξαγοράσθηκε από το Facebook το 2014 αντί 3 δισ. δολαρίων) είναι προς το παρόν οι σημαντικότεροι «παίκτες» στην αγορά προσωπικών συσκευών εικονικής πραγματικότητας. Η Google προσφέρει τη συσκευή Google Daydream που χρησιμοποιείται σε συνδυασμό με ορισμένα smartphones.



Η Oculus ανακοίνωσε επίσης ότι, παράλληλα με την κυκλοφορία του Oculus Go, θα μειώσει από 499 σε 399 δολάρια την τιμή του Oculus Rift, που είχε κυκλοφορήσει το 2016. Σύμφωνα με την εταιρεία ερευνών Super Data, αναμένεται φέτος να πωληθούν 213.000 συσκευές Oculus Rift έναντι 305.000 συσκευών Vive της HTC.

Miles de personas, convocadas en Barcelona por Sociedad Civil Catalana y otras diez entidades, se han sumado a la manifestación del 12 de Octubre bajo el lema: 'Cataluña sí, España también', una protesta que reivindica de nuevo hoy la unidad de España y su rechazo a la independencia.

La marcha ha arrancado en el paseo de Gràcia de Barcelona, a la altura de La Pedrera, y se mueve en dirección a la plaza de Catalunya, en donde se prevé la lectura de un manifiesto por parte de los organizadores.

El acto central del Día de la Fiesta Nacional ha comenzado con la llegada de los Reyes a la madrileña plaza de Lima , donde han sido recibidos con aplausos y gritos de ""viva España"" y ""viva la Corona"" de cientos de personas. Pasadas las 11 horas, se ha iniciado el acto al que asiste el Gobierno en pleno, encabezado por Mariano Rajoy -salvo el ministro de Economía, Luis de Guindos, que se encuentra en Washington-, las más altas autoridades del Estado y la mayoría de líderes políticos. Junto a Felipe VI, con el uniforme de capitán general del Ejército del Aire, y doña Letizia, con vestido de chaqueta y falda en tonos grises, se han situado sus hijas la princesa Leonor y la infanta Sofía. Los cientos de personas presentes en el recorrido han aplaudido el paso del Rolls Royce que trasladaba a los Reyes a la tribuna principal y se han escuchados vivas al Rey, a la Monarquía y a España, así como ""Puigdemont a prisión"".

La ministra de Defensa, María Dolores de Cospedal, ha afirmado tener la ""casi completa seguridad"" de que no será necesaria la intervención de las Fuerzas Armadas en Cataluña. ""Tengo la casi completa seguridad de que no será necesaria su intervencion, pero tienen la obligación de estar preparadas para defender a su país, bien sea dentro o fuera de sus fronteras, yo creo que esto no será necesario"", ha afirmado en declaraciones a RTVE antes del inicio del desfile militar con motivo del Día de la Fiesta Nacional. No obstante, ha precisado que aun así hay muchas acciones que pueden realizar las Fuerzas Armadas como apoyo logistico o ayuda a las Fuerzas y Cuerpos de Seguridad del Estado en Cataluña.

""Es el día que es, estamos en representación del Ayuntamiento. El Ayuntamiento está en la fiesta nacional"", ha declarado a Telemadrid. También ha bromeado diciendo que hoy ""es día para ponerse lo mejor que uno tiene"".

Días atrás la alcaldesa ya confirmó su asistencia al desfile. ""Claro, cómo no"", contestó.

Carmena sí acudió al desfile del año 2015, el primero para ella como alcaldesa, pero no pudo asistir al de 2016 por encontrarse en un viaje por Bolivia dentro del marco de un encuentro con ciudades latinoamericanas.

Jusqu'à ce que les interventions des Nicolas Demorand, des Thomas Legrand et autres Léa Salamé n'apparaissent plus que comme d'insipides grumeaux dans un plein saladier de pâte à crêpe publicitaire?

Jusqu'à ce que soit rattrapé par France Inter le très haut niveau d'engorgement publicitaire qui a fini par rendre à peu près inaudibles (soit dit par euphémisme compatissant) les programmes de ses concurrents Europe 1 et RTL?

S'agit-il désormais, pour les experts comptables des deniers de Radio France, d'aller rivaliser avec le fourre-tout sonore, le bric-à-brac auriculaire et mercantile auquel s'est lui-même condamné le dissident Patrick Cohen?

Est-il secrètement question, dans une démentielle stratégie de conquête de nouvelles ressources, d'en profiter pour laminer toute velléité de concurrence? En préemptant, pas à pas, spot par spot, message après message, la totalité de ce que seuls de très simples d'esprit, ou d'exceptionnels charlatans dénués de papilles gustatives, osent encore nommer le ""gâteau publicitaire""?

Fumeuse théorie

L'objectif militaro-industriel des généraux de Radio France est-il de s'imposer, demain, en premier collecteur et diffuseur d'engrais radiophonique publicitaire à déverser sur les champs du temps de cerveau disponible d'auditeurs-consommateurs?

Veut-on assécher les ressources de RMC, rayer NRJ de la carte, couler Europe et RTL, étrangler M6 et TF1 au niveau du porte-monnaie, en finir avec France Télévisions? Toutes choses qui ne seraient peut-être pas si graves, d'ailleurs, s'il n'était hélas prévisible qu'elles contribuent, du même coup, par ricochet, à définitivement éradiquer le plus ténu désir d'écouter France Inter...

Une fumeuse théorie, en vogue depuis trop longtemps chez apprentis sorciers managers qui dirigent l'audiovisuel public de ce pays, voudrait que la ""manne de la pub"" (comme ils disent, religieusement, obséquieusement) contribue à l'amélioration des programmes, à la production, et à la sauvegarde des emplois.

Dans le genre théorie à fort potentiel de ""Foutage de gueule"", on est là pas loin du sans-faute et du chef d'œuvre. On touche à la perfection! Du pur bon sens. C'est évident! Rien de tel que laxatifs, déodorants, zooms sur des mycoses plantaires et gros plans sur la panoplie des accessoires palliant aux fuites urinaires pour rehausser la qualité des journaux et programmes de mi-journée sur France 2 et France 3. On s'y sent immédiatement à l'aise! En phase avec la tonalité gériatrique d'une télévision en fin de vie à force de ramper devant le coffre-fort des annonceurs.

Est-ce là le radieux et cacochyme avenir que nous préparent les matinales de France Inter? Dans ce cas, qu'on ait l'obligeance de prévenir l'auditeur. Parce que...

Négation d'une singularité

C'est déjà très déplaisant, pour le dire avec modération, de devoir s'acquitter d'une redevance audiovisuelle en ayant le sentiment (la conviction intime) de ne la verser utilement que pour Radio France et Arte... Alors s'il s'agit demain, avec France Inter, comme dans le cas de France Télévisions, d'en arriver à financer massivement par la redevance un service public radio incapable de s'auto-suffire sans affermer des parcelles entières de son antenne à la grande et petite distribution de voitures, meubles, téléphones, miracles cosmétiques et autres cirques à ""Mille étoiles Mercedes"" – même et toujours de plus en plus ""connectés"", même avec caméra de recul, même avec un crédit illimité –, c'est non!

Trois fois non! Mille fois non!

Il y a quelque chose d'infiniment méprisant à l'égard des auditeurs dans la démarche de France Inter. Dans cette méthodique négation de ce qui fut l'honneur et la singularité d'une radio exemptée des contraintes horaires et des ""espaces"" tarifés aux annonceurs. Dans cette outrancière commercialisation de tous les intervalles, de tous les interstices, de tous les frontons et perrons d'émissions. Dans ce j'm'en-foutisme rémunérateur appelé à transformer toute voix, tout talent, toute pensée de journalistes ou d'animateurs en faire-valoir de marques et produits, en timbres vocaux-sandwich comme il fut des hommes du même nom.

Il est vrai, dira-t-on, que personne n'est obligé d'écouter Inter ou de regarder les après-midi de F2 et F3 (c'est encore heureux et salutaire, dans ce dernier cas)... Il est vrai, encore, et c'est regrettable, que l'on n'assiste pas à une massive levée de boucliers d'auditeurs. Pas d'attroupement pour un sens sonore commun, pas de manifestation pour toutes les oreilles, pas de rassemblement ""En Marche"" contre ce qui n'est rien d'autre que la dégradation, publicitairement enjouée, de ce qui pouvait être considéré comme un patrimoine pas moins digne d'intérêt et de sauvegarde que les autres, à savoir: une radio 100 % de ""service public"". Sans devoirs ni servitudes mercantiles.

Il est vrai, enfin, que les dirigeants de Radio France peuvent se dire qu'ils engrangent ainsi quelques millions d'euros supplémentaires par an à peu de frais...

Mais, à peu de frais, vraiment? Aujourd'hui, admettons. Dans leur quête forcenée du Graal Publicitaire, les petits chevaliers de la Maison Ronde peuvent encore arguer, pour cautionner ce lucratif saccage d'antenne, des bonnes audiences et de la positive notoriété d'Inter en 2017. Mais pour combien de temps encore ?

Agir comme ils le font, c'est ne pas voir que ce qu'il a fallu des décennies pour construire et ériger en modèle radiophonique risque de s'effriter à grande vitesse en quelques années. C'est contribuer à l'effacement d'une distinction, au gommage d'une ""Différence"" qui fut aussi conquise en se démarquant des stations 100 % commerciales.

C'est, surtout, enfin ne pas comprendre le nouveau sens de l'histoire des médias. C'est ne pas saisir l'émergence d'un monde de pratiques et de nouveaux modes de consommation des images et des sons. Un monde où rien ne ""date"", ne banalise, n'encombre et ne ringardise plus un programme que de l'engoncer dans la désuétude d'un ""écran"" de pub.

""An immediate 'I'm breaking up with you' might be too direct,"" Alan Manning, one of the researchers, said in a university press release.
If you're going to be the bearer of bad news, don't make it any worse than it has to be.","There's no perfect way to break up with someone.

But science may have pinned down a good general guideline. Most people seem to prefer getting bad news given to them directly.

A study coming out of Brigham Young University and the University of South Alabama says the average person would rather people be upfront with them about ending a relationship instead of beating around the bush and working up to the bad news.

For the study, 145 people were given a range of scenarios where they got bad news in two different way. They ranked the deliveries on how direct, efficient, honest, specific, and reasonable they were. They also ranked which traits they thought were most important. Generally, clarity and directness were the most valuable characteristics.

All you need is a 'we need to talk' buffer.

In a break-up situation, the person getting broken up with tended to prefer being given a few seconds of buffer and then immediately the bad news, instead of working towards it through a few minutes of chatting or small talk.

""An immediate 'I'm breaking up with you' might be too direct,"" Alan Manning, one of the researchers, said in a university press release. ""But all you need is a 'we need to talk' buffer — just a couple of seconds for the other person to process that bad news is coming.""

The study didn't look solely at breakups.

When losing a job, people had similar feelings. They wanted a few seconds of buffer, but no hedging around the issue for too long.

If your house is on fire, you just want to know that and get out. Or if you have cancer, you'd just like to know that. You don't want the doctor to talk around it

When it came to bad medical news, participants overwhelmingly reported that they didn't want any buffers at all. They wanted doctors to get straight to the point with the problem.

""If we're negating physical facts, then there's no buffer required or desired,"" Manning added. ""If your house is on fire, you just want to know that and get out. Or if you have cancer, you'd just like to know that. You don't want the doctor to talk around it.""

If you are working on how to dump someone though, HuffPost blogger Marcia Sirota also recommends being direct with your partner and not dragging things out. She also recommends making sure you're ready to let go so that you don't go through all the messy pain of breaking up only to get back together.

Sure, dragging out a tense conversation might feel better for the person delivering the news, but it doesn't make the receiver feel better about the information they're getting.

If you're going to be the bearer of bad news, don't make it any worse than it has to be.

2000년 대선 전날 밤, 하비 웨인스타인은 언론인에게 헤드록을 걸었다.

뉴욕 옵저버 기자 앤드류 골드먼은 트라이베카 그랜드 호텔에서 웨인스타인에게 다가갔다. 웨인스타인이 골드먼의 동료이자 당시 연인이었던 레베카 트레이스터에게 욕을 퍼부었기 떄문이었다. MTV VJ였던 캐런 더피가 중추 신경계 관련 질병에 걸렸다가 회복된 이야기를 담은 책 ‘Model Patient: My Life as an Incurable Wise-Ass’의 출간 파티장이었다. 트레이스터에 의하면 웨인스타인이 주최한 파티였고, 트레이스터는 무모하게도 미라맥스가 보류한 영화에 대한 질문을 했다.

웨인스타인은 그 질문이 마음에 들지 않았다. “나를 쌍년(cunt)라고 부르고 자기가 ‘이 빌어먹을 무법 도시의 보안관’인 게 다행이라고 말했다.”고 트레이스터는 뉴욕 지의 더 컷에 썼다. 이때 골드먼이 끼어들자, 하비 웨인스타인은 그에게 헤드록을 걸었다.

다른 매체 기자들도 있는 공개석상에서 일어난 일이었다고 골드먼은 허프포스트에 말했다. 하지만 트레이스터가 거의 17년이 지난 다음에 글을 쓰기 전까지, 뉴욕타임스가 수십 년에 걸친 웨인스타인의 성적 불법 행위를 다루기 전까지 우린 그 사실을 몰랐다. 타임스 기사 이후 엔터테인먼트 업계에서는 헐리우드의 ‘다 아는 비밀’이 왜 이제서야 공개되었는지 묻는 목소리가 일었다. 그에 대한 대답은 비유적으로, 또한 문자 그대로, 웨인스타인이 미디어에 헤드록을 걸고 있어서였다.

그들은 언론인들을 돈으로 사고, 위협하고, 자기들에게 필요한 일이라면 뭐든 한다.

웨인스타인이 썼다는 방법들은 다양했다. “하비는 무엇이든 뒤바꾸거나 억누를 수 있었다. 그의 돈을 받는 언론인들이 정말 많았다. 영화 프로젝트의 컨설턴트로 일하거나, 시나리오를 쓰거나, 그의 잡지에서 일하는 사람들이었다.” 트레이스터가 쓴 글이다.

“그들은 언론인들을 돈으로 사고, 위협하고, 자기들에게 필요한 일이라면 뭐든 한다.” 베테랑 연예 기자가 웨인스타인의 팀에 대해 허프포스트에 한 말이다. 웨인스타인 측은 가차없이 여러 수단을 동원한다. 이 기자는 자신의 매체는 웨인스타인이 수사를 방해할까 봐 웨인스타인에 대한 기사를 준비하는 기자들의 이름을 숨겼다고 말했다.

언론계에서는 앞으로 호의적인 기사를 써주는 대가로 수익성 좋은 책 출판 계약을 해주는 등의 돈이 오갔다는 이야기가 몰래 오갔다. 때로는 노골적으로 드러나는 경우도 있었다. 웨인스타인은 어느 파티에서 페이지 식스 기자에게 “시나리오 어디 있어?”라고 외친 적이 있다고 한다.

웨인스타인은 커리어를 띄워줄 수 있는 것 만큼 망칠 수도 있었다. 뉴욕 사교계에서 아주 막강한 인물이 되어, 연예 기자들을 자기가 여는 파티와 시사회에 못 오게 할 수 있었을 뿐 아니라 다른 주요 행사에도 오지 못하게 할 수 있었다고 헐리우드에 정통한 한 인물은 말했다.

웨인스타인은 여러 방면에서 미디어에 압박을 가할 수 있었다. 2004년에 샤론 왁스먼이 뉴욕 타임스에 웨인스타인의 나쁜 행실에 대한 기사를 쓰고 있을 때, 맷 데이먼과 러셀 크로우는 왁스먼에게 전화를 걸어 말렸다. 왁스먼에 의하면 나중에 에디터들이 그 기사를 잘라냈다고 한다.

프로듀서 스콧 루딘은 셀러브리티 언론인 니키 핑크에게 웨인스타인 측에서 자신에게 ‘하비를 보호하고 페이지 식스에 거짓말을 해달라’고 부탁했다고 인정한 적이 있다. 핑크 자신도 웨인스타인이 그녀를 ‘창문이 없는 방’에서 90분 동안 개인적인 모욕을 퍼부었다고 말했다.

웨인스타인의 변호사, 에이전트, 기업은 언급 요청에 대답하지 않았다.

작년에 벤저민 월러스는 뉴욕 지의 요청으로 웨인스타인을 둘러싼 혐의들을 수사하기 시작했다. 월러스는 본격적으로 전화를 돌리기 시작하자 곧 웨인스타인의 강력한 변호사와 홍보 담당자들이 대거 몰려들어, 뉴욕 지에게 물러나라고 압박했다고 한다. 그중에는 막강한 변호사 데이비드 보이스도 있었다.

월러스는 자신과 에디터들이 웨인스타인의 압박에 무릎꿇었다는 지난 주말의 뉴욕 포스트 기사를 반박했다. 월러스는 자신의 보도는 사실 반발에 거의 영향받지 않았다고 한다. 그는 3개월 동안 수사한 끝에 폭로 기사를 쓸 만한 내용을 많이 모으지 못해 미뤄두었다고 한다.

“나는 그 기사를 내려고 애썼다.” 뉴욕 지의 아담 모스 편집장은 “취재를 든든하게 지원해 주었고, 하비 웨인스타인이 기사를 막지도 않았다. 기사가 나왔다면 우리는 신이 났을 것이다.”고 월러스는 말한다.

뉴욕 지는 90년대에도 웨인스타인의 범죄 혐의를 조사한 적이 있었다. 그러나 웨인스타인이 방해했다. “가차없이 압력을 넣었다. 개인적으로 전화가 걸려오고, 변호사들이 쉴새없이 고소하겠다고 위협했다.” 당시 뉴욕 지 에디터였던 TV 프로듀서 마이클 허숀의 말이다. “그리고 다른 식으로 접근할 수도 있다고 말해왔다. 당시는 그런 게 중요했던 때였다.”

허숀은 페이스북 포스트에서 90년대의 조사와 자신이 잘 아는 다른 건에 대해 자세히 밝혔다. “웨인스타인과 일급 변호사들이 매체와 관련된 여성들에게 엄청난 압박을 넣어서 두 조사 모두 가장 문제적인 이야기들을 보도하지 않기로 했다. 웨인스타인은 매체사 사장들에게도 당근과 채찍 전략을 취했다. 결국 관련 여성들은 무릎을 꿇었고, 사장들은 우리 조사를 끝내게 했다. 혹은 변호사들이 위험 대비 보상을 고려해보고 보도하지 말 것을 권하기도 했다.”

베테랑 연예 기자에 의하면 모든 규모의 기사에 대해 이런 식으로 접근했다고 한다. 웨인스타인 측은 나중에 특종을 주겠다며 웨인스타인에 대한 아주 작은 기사도 다 막으려 했다고 한다.

그 결과 전반적으로 부드러운 톤의 기사가 나가게 되었다. 예를 들어 웨인스타인이 트레이스터와 골드먼에게 폭력을 휘두른 것은 지나치게 밀어붙이는 언론인과 성자 같은 영화계 거물 사이의 유감스러운 몸싸움 정도로 미화되었다. 그러나 트레이스터와 골드먼의 이야기를 들어보면 사실은 전혀 달랐다.

골드먼이 허프포스트에 전한 바에 의하면 논쟁 중에 웨인스타인은 “누가 이 쌍년을 이 암 파티에 들여보냈어?”라고 여러 번 외쳤다고 한다. 그는 골드먼이 녹음기를 들고 있는 걸 알아차리기 전까지 골드먼에게도 욕설을 퍼부었다고 한다.

“몇 마디를 주고받았다.그러다 그는 내 녹음기에 달려들었다. 나는 녹음기를 뺏기고 싶지 않았기 때문에, 우리는 트라이베카 그랜드 한복판에서 양손을 공중에 치켜든 채 서로 막 잡아당겼다.”

녹음기를 뺏지 못한 웨인스타인은 골드먼을 호텔 앞으로 끌고나가 헤드록을 걸었다고 골드먼은 말한다. “이 사람이 내게 이런 짓을 하다니, 공개적으로 이런 일이 일어나다니 믿을 수 없다고 생각했던 기억이 난다.”

골드먼은 뉴욕 데일리 뉴스 사진사가 사진을 찍은 게 기억난다고 했다. “수십 장, 어쩌면 수백 장 찍었을지도 모른다.” 주위에는 다른 기자들도 몇 명 있었는데, 한 명은 “하비, 이러지 말아요! 이러면 안돼요!”라고 말했다고 골드먼은 회상한다. 결국 골드먼과 트레이스터는 그 자리를 떴다.

골드먼은 “젠장, 내일 데일리 뉴스 표지에 나오겠군.”이라고 생각했다고 한다. “끝내주는 뉴욕 타블로이드 기사감이었다. ‘영화계 거물이 멋진 파티에서 멍청한 기자에게 헤드록을 걸다’”

그런데 이상한 일이 벌어졌다. “다음 날 아침에 보니 신문에 전혀 실리지 않았다. 내가 아는 한 그 사진들은 아무도 보지 못했다.”

그러나 곧 뉴욕 포스트에 있는 골드먼의 지인에게서 전화가 걸려왔다. “하비가 파티에서 당신이 누군가를 공격했다는 이야기를 퍼뜨리고 있다”는 말을 “믿을 만한 사람”에게서 들었다는 내용이었다. 몸싸움 중에 한 여성이 다쳤다. 골드먼은 당시에는 그 사실을 몰랐다고 허프포스트에 말했다.

뉴욕 포스트는 골드먼과 트레이스터가 웨인스타인을 ‘한계점까지 밀어붙인 기자들’이라고 낙인찍었다. 또한 웨인스타인과 더피의 우정을 다루며, 더피가 병으로 고생할 때 웨인스타인이 ‘그녀의 생명을 구했다’며 성인처럼 묘사했다.

웨인스타인은 더프[sic]를 적절한 의사들에게 데려다주고 즉시 치료받게 해주어 생명을 구해준 다음 금세 친해졌다.

뉴욕 타임스 역시 골드먼을 에둘러 비난했다. 이름이 등장하지 않은 ‘미라맥스 관계자’는 골드먼 혼자 폭력을 휘두른 것처럼 말했고, 웨인스타인과 트레이스터는 “그가 인터뷰를 계속할 수 없다고 합의했고, 그건 괜찮았다. 그러나 앤드류가 끼어들었다.”고 했다.

골드먼의 상사인 옵저버의 에디터 피터 W. 카플란은 타임스에 골드먼을 옹호하는 성명을 전달했다. “앤드류는 책임감있게 프로답게 행동했고, 동료를 위해 나선 것이었다.” 그러나 이 성명은 끝에서 두 번째 문단에서야 등장했다. “골드먼 씨의 녹음기가 다른 손님의 머리에 세게 부딪혔고”, 골드먼이 웨인스타인의 요구에도 불구하고 사과하기를 “거부했다”는 무명의 미라맥스 관계자의 말이 그보다 먼저 나왔다. 포스트와 타임스는 이 기사들에 대한 언급 요청에 응답하지 않았다.

골드먼은 미디어 보도를 보고 충격을 받았다.

“그들은 내가 파티에서 여성에게 다가가 녹음기로 여성의 머리를 때린 것처럼 보이게 하려 했다. 하비와 내가 나의 녹음기를 두고 싸우고 있었다는 사실은 언급하지 않았다.”

골드먼은 이 사건으로 정신을 번쩍 차리게 되었다. 웨인스타인이 정확히 어떻게 했는지는 모르지만, 자신의 영향력을 발휘해 기사를 자기 구미에 맞게 바꾸고 사진이 보도되지 않게 했음을 골드먼은 직감적으로 알 수 있었다.

“누군가 완벽한 뉴욕 타블로이드 기사감을 완전히 없앨 수 있다는 건 나로선 놀라웠다.”

“그의 솜씨가 대단했다는 건 인정해야겠다.”

Obviously Dove was not thinking very straight when it released a Facebook advert that showed a black woman pulling off her T-shirt to reveal a white woman underneath. The white woman then pulls off her T-shirt to reveal an Asian woman underneath.

Dove probably did not mean to be racist. After all, the ad does not end with a white woman as the final, glowing product of the regular Dove treatment. A commenter responding to the ad seemed to think that and pointed out, ""I think they meant it's for all skin types... it went from black to white to another race.""

But we don't live in a colour-blind society. We live in one where skin lightening products are a huge business, whether in Nigeria or India. And the Dove ad, whatever its intention, seemed to dovetail a little too neatly with social stereotypes of race and beauty. The T-shirt peeling was a little too close to facial peels for fairness. And it did not help either that this was the company that released an ad with Before and After images where a black woman seemed to turn Latino and then white after using Dove body wash.

At that time, Dove put out a rather flustered defence saying the ad was just ""intended to illustrate the benefits of using Dove VisibleCare Body Wash, by making skin more visibly beautiful in just one week.""

It said all three women were meant to ""demonstrate the 'after' product benefit"" even though their placement in the ad certainly did not look that way.

This time Dove quickly apologized and pulled the ad without trying to mount any kind of fairness-for-all defence. Racism, like beauty, can often be in the eye of the beholder. And if an ad requires a company statement to explain why it's not being racist, then it was probably not a very effective ad to begin with.

But we can still conceivably see that this time at least with its black-white-Asian beauty parade they truly might have been trying to do an inclusive ad that misfired. The same cannot be said about the many fair and beautiful skin lightening products in India. These products are not limited to India, though it's a 400 million dollar market here according to The Atlantic.

A star like John Abraham can use a face wash and do it everyday on our TV screens. And it would be passed off as a cultural preference rather than a racist stereotype of beauty.

They are deliberately and unapologetically driving home the point that fair is always better, that their products are meant to lighten and whiten. In India, an ad which shows a dark-skinned model turn fair after using a body wash would be par for the course. A star like John Abraham can use a face wash and do it everyday on our TV screens. And it would be passed off as a cultural preference rather than a racist stereotype of beauty on par with those in the West who rush to tanning parlours to get a bronzed tan.

Except as Kavitha Emmanuel of the Dark is Beautiful campaign said ""I'm not going to be treated differently because I've tanned my skin.""

Yes, it's true companies like Unilever are meeting a market demand. They are not responsible for creating it anymore than Shah Rukh Khan is responsible for men wanting to be fair and handsome. What can all our Fair and Lovelies do after all in a culture that still demands that brides have fair skin in matrimonial ads. This is a society in which we routinely say, ""She's pretty even though she is dark"" and genuinely think we are paying someone a compliment.

Nandita Das told DesiYup.com that every article about her begins with ""dark and dusky as if without that I am incomplete."" Kareena Kapoor on the other hand is never described as the ""fair and beautiful Kareena"".

This is a society in which we routinely say, ""She's pretty even though she is dark"" and genuinely think we are paying someone a compliment.

This is a country where our biggest stars are not embarrassed to be brand ambassadors for lightening creams. This is a country where we even saw a line of body washes and creams to make vaginas lighter and then tighter, a double whammy of pleasure as it were. And it was sold as empowering women (for the pleasure of men). Underarms, vaginas, nothing is exempt from the curse of darkness. Every nook and corner of the body must be made fair and beautiful. As Rajyasree Sen observed, in a country where girls risked being killed off as a foetus, women were being told to ""tighten, whiten and lighten up.""

It's not just about the pretty bride who needs to seduce her man anymore. What's worse is our companies sell that fairness as a prerequisite of success for the independent-minded achiever.

As Deepanjana Pal writes, ""Nowadays, the person who needs fair skin is the woman who wants a job, the athlete who wins a tournament, the consummate professional that stands on her own two feet... They show working women who are successful and tell the viewer that the critical component of their success is that their appearance is acceptable to men.""

Abhay Deol once called out many of his colleagues for endorsing these products even though the Advertising Standards Council of India banned ads depicting dark-skinned people as inferior in 2014. Deol wrote, ""Advertising preaches that we would get a better job, a happier marriage and more beautiful children if we were fair. We are conditioned to believe that life would have been easier had we been born fairer.""

The ads didn't create the demand for fairness. The removal of the ads won't end the stigmatization of dark skin.

The ads didn't create the demand for fairness. The removal of the ads won't end the stigmatization of dark skin. But there's no need to feed into that stigmatization either, that there's no need to cash in on our insecurities about something like skin colour.

In a sense, that Dove ad touched that already tender point of insecurity. But to be fair, they were probably trying to say something else altogether. It just came out horribly wrong. Unfortunately our fair and lovely Indian companies have no such excuse. They out-Dove Dove any day and very deliberately so.","Dove Apologized For A Skin Tone-Deaf Ad, But India's Fairness Industry Has No Such Compulsion",http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/10/09/dove-apologized-for-a-skin-tone-deaf-ad-but-indias-fairness-industry-has-no-such-compulsion_a_23236888/

Dans le cadre d'un partenariat avec Parcs Canada, Google Street View a capté des images de ce parc reculé pour offrir aux internautes une expérience se voulant immersive, avec des prises de vue panoramiques qui simulent une visite réelle.

Emma Upton, de Parcs Canada, explique que dans le cadre de ce projet particulier, la caméra était montée non pas sur un véhicule, mais sur des randonneurs.

«Une fois rendu au parc, on est vraiment limité à se déplacer avec ses deux pieds», souligne la gestionnaire de Quttinirpaaq, parc dont les sites archéologiques témoignent de l'arrivée des Paléo-Esquimaux, il y a des millénaires.

Un hélicoptère a également été mis à profit pour couvrir une plus grande superficie de ce parc de 37 000 kilomètres carrés, précise-t-elle.

Le tournage s'est étiré sur une seule semaine, en juillet 2016, puisque la lumière se fait rare le reste de l'année, à 800 kilomètres du pôle Nord.

«Notre été, c'est littéralement deux semaines», a raillé Emma Upton, en entrevue téléphonique à partir d'Iqaluit.

Elle estime que Quttinirpaaq — le parc le plus au nord au pays — n'accueille pas plus que 25 visiteurs annuellement, sans compter les chercheurs, qui y vouent un intérêt particulier.

«Ça prend du temps, de l'effort et un budget aussi pour y aller en personne, reconnaît Mme Upton. De plus en plus de (Canadiens) vivent dans les grands centres urbains, nos parcs ne sont pas aussi accessibles qu'on l'aimerait.»

C'est pourquoi depuis 2013, Parcs Canada et Google Street View s'associent «pour amener les parcs dans les salons» en arpentant, caméra sur le dos, 150 sites naturels et historiques, a-t-elle poursuivi.

Parmi eux figurent la forteresse de Louisbourg et l'habitation de Port-Royal, en Nouvelle-Écosse, de même que le parc Forillon, en Gaspésie.","Le parc national Quttinirpaaq, le plus au nord du Canada, accessible de son salon avec Google Street View",http://quebec.huffingtonpost.ca/2017/10/12/le-parc-national-quttinirpaaq-le-plus-au-nord-du-canada-accessible-de-son-salon-avec-google-street-view_a_23241039/

El espacio se convirtió en una parte de él, una especie de escafandra que ceñía su cuerpo. 'Veía las paredes como mi concha. La habitación como contenedor tenía cierta relación con el espacio imaginario que encierra un monitor'.

Al entrar en Video Ergo Sum lo primero que me encuentro es la instalación de vídeo Kiva. Aquí empieza la experiencia que propone Campus al espectador, puesto que una parte de las obras mostradas no se activa sin la intervención del visitante. Al colocarme delante de la cámara me siento vampirizado como el cineasta protagonista de Arrebato. Este sentimiento me acompañará durante todo el recorrido. Si en la película de Zulueta la cámara acababa captando la misma existencia del personaje, aquí nos devuelve una imagen proyectada de nosotros mismos que nos hace dudar de nuestra posición en el espacio.

'Estamos condicionados por la imagen inversa que nos entrega el espejo, nos sorprendemos constantemente cuando se nos presenta la imagen directa del vídeo. Cualquier movimiento asimétrico provoca una pérdida de la identificación con la imagen de uno mismo que se proyecta'

Kiva es un artefacto de visión autorreferencial, casi con vida propia. Está articulado con unos espejos colocados con hilos delante del objetivo de la cámara, sensibles al movimiento del aire ambiental. El espectador sale intermitentemente de la vista de la pantalla, que ocupa en ciclos de tiempo discontinuo.

Desde hace años, Peter Campus es una referencia del videoarte a nivel mundial. Un pionero cuya naturaleza de sus obras, con instalaciones complejas, ha limitado siempre su presentación. Así que la muestra del Centro Andaluz de Arte Contemporáneo, organizada por el Jeu de Paume de París, es una oportunidad única para acercarnos a su experimentación.

En Optical Sockets me dejo atrapar en el centro de cuatro cámaras de videovigilancia que a ras de suelo graban sin piedad. Las imágenes de los diferentes puntos de vista se mezclan y se transmiten simultáneamente a cuatro monitores colocados sobre pedestales entre las cámaras, a la misma distancia. Me siento la presa de un animal electrónico que en función de mis movimientos consigue desorientarme, al reflejar mi figura con sustrato de relatividad.

Escapo de la tela de araña óptica y entro en Dor, un cuarto oscuro que propone un juego de perspectivas. Estoy sin compañía, esperando verme proyectado, pero no ocurre nada porque la imagen solo puede verse en la pared del cuarto cuando el visitante está en el campo de la cámara, en la zona de la luz, es decir aún en el pasillo. Así cuando vuelvo al pasillo tengo la sensación de que dejo atrás un espectro, pero giro la cabeza y ya no está allí. Soy yo mismo intentando verme.

​​​​

Al salir aturdido del cuarto oscuro, pensando todavía en mi fantasma, me enfrento a la videoproyección en gran escala de la cabeza del actor John Erdman con un semblante que deja entrever su lado más oscuro. Head of a Man with Death on His Mind me conecta de inmediato con un primer plano de Bruno Ganz en El Cielo sobre Berlín. Me transmite lo mismo, una comprensión de la mortalidad, de lo final.

Además de estos dispositivos de vídeo de circuito cerrado, la exposición posee un carácter íntimo y poético que abarca otros formatos. Una colección de sus performances para la cámara como Three Transition, que denuncia cualquier pretensión de una imagen inamovible y sólida. En estos vídeos se realiza una acción, con una duración específica, que se graba en continuo y en plano fijo. También acompañan videografías (planos fijos sin montaje), retratos, fotografías de la naturaleza y el tratamiento de imágenes configuradas por píxeles en movimiento, que dotan de otro grado de abstracción a su carrera.

Su trabajo más reciente, La Jetée, comparte puntos en común con la reflexión filosófica que plantea la película de Chris Marker, como el propio autor comenta: 'hemos llegado a un punto final y no hay más salida posible que ir atrás describiendo un bucle'. La Jetée de Campus es una videografía realizada a propósito para esta retrospectiva en ultra alta definición (4K) en el enclave natural de un rompeolas por donde caminan los paseantes.

Más allá del interés que despierta toda su obra, lo que convierte a esta exhibición en una experiencia son las instalaciones interactivas que succionan nuestra imagen para devolverla encapsulada en una pantalla, que hace las veces de contenedor, de escafandra, en la que nos percibimos ajenos. Un mecanismo de espejos y reflejos que suscita una ilusión enigmática de la imagen de uno mismo.

ÉTATS-UNIS - La liste des victimes d'Harvey Weinstein ne cesse de s'allonger. Le producteur de 65 ans est accusé d'avoir harcelé sexuellement des dizaines de femmes en l'espace de 20 ans, tout en profitant de sa position de ""faiseur de rois d'Hollywood"". Et depuis les révélations du New York Times jeudi 5 octobre, les témoignages accablants affluent et dépeignent un homme capable d'agression sexuelle mais aussi de viol, de manipulations et d'intimidation.

Après Angelina Jolie, Gwyneth Paltrow, Emma de Caunes et de nombreuses autres actrices, Cara Delevingne a publié -sur son compte Instagram- un témoignage glaçant sur sa rencontre avec le producteur.

Dans un premier temps, l'actrice et mannequin britannique explique comment Harvey Weinstein l'a menacée de plomber sa carrière si elle s'affichait publiquement avec une femme. ""Quand j'ai commencé à travailler en tant qu'actrice, je travaillais sur un film et j'ai reçu un appel de Harvey Weinstein me demandant si j'avais couché avec n'importe laquelle des femmes avec qui j'ai été vue dans les médias. (...) il m'a dit que si j'étais gay ou décidée à être publiquement avec une femme, je n'obtiendrais jamais le rôle d'une femme hétéro et je ne serais jamais actrice à Hollywood.""

La comédienne raconte ensuite avoir rencontré le producteur dans le hall d'un hôtel pour un futur film. Une fois seuls, Harvey Weinstein a proposé à la jeune femme de monter dans sa chambre. Une demande que Cara Delevingne refuse, avant d'accepter sur les conseils de l'assistante du producteur.

""A ce moment précis, je me sentais impuissante et effrayée mais je ne voulais pas le montrer. J'espérais que je me trompais sur la situation. En arrivant dans la chambre, j'ai d'abord été rassurée en voyant qu'une autre femme était présente. Il nous a demandé de nous embrasser et elle a commencé à l'aguicher"", explique-t-elle avant de poursuivre.

""Je me suis rapidement levée et lui ai demandé s'il savait que je chantais. Et j'ai commencé à chanter... Je pensais que cela améliorerait la situation, en la rendant... plus professionnelle... comme une audition... j'étais tellement nerveuse. Après avoir chanté, j'ai répété que je devais partir. Il m'a raccompagnée à la porte de sa chambre et a essayé de m'embrasser sur les lèvres. Je l'ai arrêté et j'ai réussi à sortir de la pièce.""

Cara Delevingne confie également les raisons de son silence, à la fin de son message. ""Je ne voulais pas faire de mal à sa famille, je me sentais coupable comme si j'avais fait quelque chose de mal"", explique-t-elle.","Affaire Weinstein: ""Je me sentais impuissante et effrayée"", le témoignage glaçant de Cara Delevingne",http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2017/10/11/affaire-weinstein-je-me-sentais-impuissante-et-effrayee-le-temoignage-glacant-de-cara-delevingne_a_23240427/

Die AfD hat bei der Bundestagswahl in Sachsen die CDU überholt

Sachsens Ministerpräsident forderte als Reaktion einen Rechtsruck

Elisabeth Galli stieg daraufhin aus der CDU aus – und erklärt in der HuffPost, warum

Für die CDU in Sachsen wurde die Bundestagswahl zur Schmach. Im Vergleich zum Wahljahr 2013 verloren die Konservativen fast 16 Prozent, die AfD wurde zur stärksten Kraft im Land.

Sachsens CDU-Ministerpräsident Stanislav Tillich reagierte mit der Forderung nach einem vehementen Rechtsruck auf die peinliche Wahlschlappe. Ex-Ministerpräsident Kurt Biedenkopf kritisierte Tillich scharf, es fehle ihm an ""Vorbildung"". Auch an der Parteibasis wandten sich viele Christdemokraten gegen Tillich und seinen geforderten Ruck nach rechts.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: So erklärt der Chefredakteur der ""Leipziger Volkszeitung"" den Wahlerfolg der AfD in Sachsen



Die Dresdner Rechtsanwältin Elisabeth Galli, zuvor Mitglied im Kreisvorstand der Stadt, entschied sich gar, aus der CDU auszutreten.

Über den geforderten Rechtsruck sagt Galli der HuffPost: ""Wenn man das will, verabschiedet man sich als Partei von seinen Werten."" Die von Tillich geforderte Verschiebung einer CDU Sachsen nach rechts folge der AfD, setze ihrer Marktschreierei aber nichts entgegen.

""Wenn CDU sich Pegida entgegen gestellt hätte, hätte die AfD sie nicht überholt""

Tillich will offenbar von der AfD lernen.

Die CDU-Aussteigerin Galli sieht das größte Versäumnis der Partei im Gegensatz zu Tillich darin, sich nicht entschieden von den Rechten abgesetzt zu haben. ""Es ist ein unverzeilicher Fehler, sich hier nicht von vornherein klar distanziert zu haben"", sagt Galli der HuffPost.

Und weiter: ""Was wäre das für ein Bild gewesen: die sächsische CDU stellt sich gemeinsam mit den Bürgern Pegida entgegen und für unsere Demokratie, in erster Reihe Herr Tillich."" Die Lokalpolitikerin glaubt nicht, dass die Bewegung Pegida ""dann jemals dieses Ausmaß erreicht hätte und ich glaube auch nicht, dass die CDU dann von der AfD überholt worden wäre"".

Die Dresdnerin hatte ihren Austritt auch bei Twitter öffentlich gemacht und für ein enormes Medienecho gesorgt.

Das darf einfach nicht wahr sein. #Tillich: mein Grund jetzt aus der sächsischen CDU auszutreten. #CDU #Sachsen https://t.co/5rXCk2v7lY — Elisabeth Galli (@galli_elisabeth) 30. September 2017

Tillich habe außerdem keine Vision für sein Bundesland, kritisiert Galli. Auch Sachsens ehemaliger Ministerpräsident Kurt Biedenkopf hatte seinem Nachfolger vorgeworfen, zu ""scheu"" zu agieren – und über Kompromisse zu regieren.

So habe die CDU in Sachsen die Unsicherheit der Menschen nicht ernstgenommen, glaubt Biedenkopf: ""Wenn Tausende Lehrer und Pflegekräfte fehlen, in Dörfern kein Bus mehr fährt und kein Arzt oder Laden mehr zu finden ist, dann muss man nicht nach rechts oder links rücken, sondern Probleme lösen.“

Journalist Rohini Singh, who investigated into the alleged irregularities in business enterprises run by Jay Amitbhai Shah, BJP President Amit Shah's son, for The Wire, has stood up for herself after being slapped with a defamation case. In a Facebook post, she made her stance clear, explaining that her job as a journalist is to speak to truth to power and she wouldn't desist from it.

According to reports, Jay Shah has sued the independent news portal for Rs 100 crores, after the latter ran a story outlining alleged financial irregularities involved in his business transactions.

Based on filings available with the Registrar of Companies, Singh reported that Temple Enterprise Private Ltd, a company of which Jay is director, increased its turnover by a staggering 16,000 times since the BJP-led government at the Centre came to power under the prime ministership of Narendra Modi. Jay's father is a close associate of the PM and a leading light of the BJP.

From Rs 15,000 in 2014-15 to Rs 80.5 crore in 2015-16, the rise in revenue for Temple Enterprise has been wondrous, bolstered by an unsecured loan of Rs 15.78 crore from Rajesh Khandwala, a relative of Rajya Sabha member Parimal Nathwani, who is also a senior executive at Reliance Industries.

The Wire's findings have led to speculations whether such deals were struck between the various parties with the collusion of politicians, business leaders and elected lawmakers.

However, Jay said the report had made ""false, derogatory and defamatory imputation against me by creating in the mind of right-thinking people an impression that my business owes its 'success' to my father's political position.""

According to The Indian Express, he claimed his businesses are ""fully legitimate and conducted in a lawful manner on commercial lines"" reflected in his tax records and through banking transactions.

""I have repaid the loans by cheque on commercial rate of interest and within the time stipulated. I have mortgaged my family property with the cooperative bank to get the credit facilities,"" he said to quash all the allegations raised against his dealings by Singh.

Even before the publication of the article in The Wire, Jay's lawyer had already warned Singh, or any other media organisation, to not broadcast any potentially defamatory comments about his client.

""If you or anyone in the print, electronic or digital media carries and/or broadcasts any defamatory and/or false imputations including those which breach his fundamental right of privacy and/or defame him, Mr. Jay Shah reserves the right to prosecute and sue such person/entity including anyone who carries or broadcasts a repetition of such libelous/defamatory statement,"" the lawyer's response read.

Singh, who was previously employed with The Economic Times, is a well-known business journalist. Along with Sruthijith KK*, she exposed Congress President Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law Robert Vadra's involvement with DLF's real estate business in an ET investigation in 2011.

Following the publication of her story on Jay, members of political parties from across the spectrum have reacted to it with expected pique.

""Today, we want to ask our Prime Minister, what do you have to say about crony capitalism now? Will you direct the CBI to probe? Will you direct the ED to probe? Will you ask them to arrest them? Because in the case of opposition, the ED immediately sends notice and shows speed in arresting them... But if somebody's name is Jay, Amit and Shah, who can arrest them? I can confidently tell you that the Prime Minister will remain silent,"" said Kapil Sibal of the Congress.

CPI(M)'s Sitaram Yechury and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) both added their voices to the clamour. AAP said it as a ""classic case of money laundering"", while Yechury asserted that ""very clearly, the son (of Amit Shah) has misused this government in order to accumulate riches in a very clandestine fashion...""

Railway minister Piyush Goyal and member of BJP strongly defended Jay, saying there was no irregularity in his operations and Singh's article is without completely substance. The army of supporters of the right-wing party on social media also chimed in with their support.

In the meantime, top government lawyer Tushar Mehta told NDTV that he may take up Jay's case against The Wire.

Österreich klagt vor dem EuGH gegen die deutsche Pkw-Maut

Die Ungleich-Behandlung von Ausländern sei nicht mit EU-Recht vereinbar

Im Streit um die deutsche Pkw-Maut wird Österreich eine Klage vor dem Europäischen Gerichtshof (EuGH) einbringen. Die geplante Einführung der Maut sei diskriminierend, begründete Verkehrsminister Jörg Leichtfried (SPÖ) am Donnerstag in Wien den Schritt. ""Das ist eine reine Ausländer-Maut"", sagte der Minister.

Die EU-Kommission habe sich davor gedrückt, Deutschland die Stirn zu bieten. Österreich gehe nun voran, sagte Leichtfried. Ein von der Regierung in Auftrag gegebenes Rechtsgutachten bescheinigt gute Aussichten auf einen Erfolg vor Gericht.

Die Klage hat keine aufschiebende Wirkung für die für 2019 geplante Einführung der Maut. Dies müsste eigens beantragt und vor Gericht bewilligt werden.

Österreich ist einer der schärfsten Kritiker der deutschen Maut. Aus Sicht der Regierung in Wien spricht nichts grundsätzlich gegen die Einführung eines Maut-Systems - auch Österreich selbst verfahre so.

Dass am Ende nur Ausländer zahlten, sei aber nicht mit den Grundwerten der EU vereinbar, hatte Leichtfried in der Vergangenheit mehrfach betont. ""Ich kämpfe auch für eine Europäische Union, die eine Solidargemeinschaft ist"", so Leichtfried.

Dobrindt mntzt über ""Ösi-Maut-Maulerei""

Die Ankündigung der Klage fällt in Österreich in das Wahlkampffinale. Die Alpenrepublik wählt am Sonntag ein neues Parlament.

Ende März hatte der Bundesrat in Berlin trotz erheblicher Kritik den Weg für die Einführung einer Pkw-Maut auf deutschen Autobahnen und Bundesstraßen freigemacht und ein dafür vom Bundestag beschlossenes Gesetzespaket passieren lassen.

Eigentlich war die Maut schon 2015 beschlossen worden. Da Brüssel kurz darauf ein Verfahren wegen der Verletzung von EU-Recht gegen Deutschland eröffnete, wurden die Gesetze aber bisher nicht umgesetzt.

Die EU ließ ihre Einwände fallen, nachdem Bundesverkehrsminister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) das Modell an einigen Stellen geändert hatte. So werden mehr Kurzzeit-Tarife für Fahrer aus dem Ausland angeboten.

Die Maut gilt als Prestigeprojekt der CSU. Dobrindt, der laut Leichtfried im Vorfeld über die Klage aus Wien informiert wurde, wies Vorwürfe Österreichs mehrfach als ""Ösi-Maut-Maulerei"" zurück.

Das Thema Maut könnte aber auch innerhalb Deutschlands noch zu einem Streitpunkt bei Koalitionsverhandlungen werden. Die Grünen und die FDP sind dagegen, die Linken und die AfD ebenso.

Die SPD will die Lkw-Maut nicht auf Fahrzeuge unter 7,5 Tonnen ausdehnen, da dies vor allem Handwerksbetriebe belasten würde.

Rund 70.000 Syrer und Iraker wollen derzeit Familienmitglieder nach Deutschland nachholen

Die Zahl ist deutlich niedriger, als es von vielen Politikern angemahnt wurde

Der sogenannte Familiennachzug für Flüchtlinge ist längst ein Schreckgespenst der Rechten geworden. Regelmäßig geistern Szenarien von massenhafter Zuwanderung per Familiennachzug durch die Republik. Die AfD fantasiert immer wieder von zwei Millionen Menschen, die als Angehörige von anerkannten Flüchtlingen in die Bundesrepublik kommen dürften.

Die aktuellen Zahlen sehen anders aus: Rund 70.000 Syrer und Iraker bemühen sich derzeit um einen Familiennachzug für ihre Angehörigen nach Deutschland. Das erfuhr die Deutsche Presse-Agentur aus dem Auswärtigen Amt.

Demnach liegen an den zuständigen deutschen Auslandsvertretungen in Beirut, Amman, Erbil, Ankara, Istanbul und Izmir in dieser Zahl Terminanfragen für einen Familiennachzug zu syrischen und irakischen Schutzberechtigten vor.

Von Anfang 2015 bis Mitte 2017 hatte das Außenamt bereits rund 102.000 Visa zum Familiennachzug für Syrer und Iraker erteilt. Auf Basis dieser bisher erteilten Visa und der aktuellen Terminbuchungen schätzt das Ministerium, dass bis einschließlich 2018 etwa 100.000 bis 200.000 weitere solcher Visa hinzukommen könnten.

Für 2015 bis einschließlich 2018 geht es beim Familiennachzug zu Syrern und Irakern demnach also um einen grob geschätzten Umfang von 200.000 bis 300 000 Angehörigen.

Asylsuchende, die in Deutschland Schutz bekommen, dürfen Ehepartner und minderjährige Kinder zum Teil nachholen. Auch anerkannte minderjährige Flüchtlinge dürfen ihre Eltern hinterherholen.

Subsidär Geschützte haben bis 2018 keine Möglichkeiten, die Familie nachzuholen

Für eine bestimmte Gruppe mit eingeschränktem Schutzstatus, subsidiär Geschützte, hatte die große Koalition den Familiennachzug im März 2016 beschränkt und für zwei Jahre ausgesetzt: bis März 2018.

Das Außenamt ist dafür zuständig, Visa zum Familiennachzug zu erteilen. Zu laufenden Anträgen gibt es keine Statistik, erfasst werden aber die Terminanfragen zum Familiennachzug, die das Ministerium neben den Zahlen zu bisher erteilten Visa für die Schätzung der künftigen Entwicklung nutzt.

Von Januar 2015 bis Ende Juni 2017 hatte das Außenamt nach eigenen Angaben weltweit 230.000 Anträge auf Familiennachzug bewilligt. Diese Gesamtzahl betrifft aber Menschen aus allen möglichen Staaten jenseits der EU - und nur zu einem Teil Flüchtlinge.

Unter Flüchtlingen - also anerkannten Schutzberechtigten mit Anspruch auf Familiennachzug - bilden Syrer mit Abstand die größte Gruppe. Zwischen Anfang 2015 und Mitte 2017 gingen 102.000 Visa zum Familiennachzug an Syrer und Iraker, rund 3000 an Afghanen.

Doch erst jetzt konnten Forscher die Inschriften vollständig auswerten

Die offenbaren, wie damals zahlreiche Imperien und Hochkulturen im öst­li­chen Mit­tel­meer­raum untergegangen sind

Eine alte Steinplatte könnte ""eines der größten Puzzles der mediterranen Archäologie des Mittelmeers"" lösen. Das teilen Schweizer und niederländische Forscher selbstbewusst mit.

Schon seit Jahrhunderten rätseln Forscher, warum vor 3200 Jahren innerhalb kurzer Zeit zahlreiche Imperien und Hochkulturen im öst­li­chen Mit­tel­meer­raum untergegangen sind.

Zwar wurde die Steinplatte schon 1878 in der heutigen Zentraltürkei entdeckt. Doch erst jetzt konnten die Forscher die Inschriften auf dem Stein entziffern - und fanden dabei neue Hinweise.

Demnach soll die 29 Meter lange Platte die Ereignisse am Ende der Bronzezeit im östlichen Mittelmeerraum beschreiben. Die Forscher wissen nun, dass die Schriftzeichen die Eroberungsfeldzüge von Großkönig von Mira, einem Vasallenstaat in Anatolien, erzählen - und die letztendlich einen Mas­sen­kol­laps in Gang setzten.

Rätselhafte Hieroglyphen

Der 35 Zentimeter dicke Kalksteinfries trägt die längste bekannte Hieroglyphen-Inschrift aus der Bronzezeit. Bauern aus Beyköy hatten die in mehre Stücke geteilte Platte vor über 100 Jahren gefunden. Dorfbewohner verwendeten die Steine später als Baumaterial für eine Moschee.

Zwar begann in den 1950er Jahren ein türkisch-amerikanisches Expertenteam mit dem Entziffern der Hieroglyphen. Doch eine Veröffentlichung wurde immer wieder verschoben, 1985 starb der letzte an der Arbeit beteiligte Wissenschaftler.

Nun hat Eberhard Zangger, Präsident der Luwian Studies Foundation, das Material zusammen mit einem Kollegen aus der Niederlande erneut ausgewertet. Luwian Studies ist eine gemeinnützige Stiftung mit Sitz in der Schweiz, deren alleiniger Stiftungszweck die Förderung der Erforschung vorchristlicher Kulturen in Anatolien ist.

Laut Zangger wurde die Inschrift von Kupanta-Kurunta, dem Großkönig von Mira, in Auftrag gegeben.

Ende der Bronzezeit

Glaubt man Zanggers Forschungsergebnis, dann befahl Kupanta-Kurunta seinen Heeren um 1190 v. Chr., nach Osten zu stürmen. Nachdem die Soldaten an Land erfolgreich waren, formten vereinte Streitkräfte aus Anatolien eine Flotte und eroberten zahlreiche Küstenstädte im Süden Anatoliens sowie Provinzen im heutigen Syrien und Palästina.

Die Luwianer, ein lo­ser Ver­bund anatolischer Kö­nig­rei­che, kämpften sich bis zur ägyptischen Grenze vor. Zanggers Theorie zufolge trugen die Luwianer entscheidend zu den sogenannten Seevölkern und damit zum Ende Bronzezeit im östlichen Mittelmeerraum bei.

Zanggers These widerspricht damit der bisherigen Forschungsmeinung. Bisher gingen Historiker laut dem ""Spiegel"" davon aus, dass der Niedergang der Großreiche durch eine Kom­bi­na­ti­on aus Na­tur­ka­ta­stro­phen, Hun­gers­nö­ten und ei­nem bron­ze­zeit­li­chen Kli­ma­wan­del verursacht wurde.

Nous avons constaté, de l'intérieur, que nous ne sommes pas égaux devant la loi. Les pressions financières et économiques ont raison de l'indépendance que la justice se devrait d'avoir. Les politiciens font les annonces qui leur conviennent or nous –lanceurs d'alerte- n'avons plus aucune attente ni aucune naïveté concernant les prises de décision du pouvoir politique.

Chacun d'entre nous a subi les conséquences dramatiques des très importants conflits d'intérêts auxquels se livrent nos dirigeants. Les effets d'annonces de la loi Sapin II, de la Présidentielle et des élections législatives n'en sont que de récents exemples. Il nous est alors clairement apparu que la seule façon d'aider les futurs lanceurs d'alerte en leur apportant un soutien indépendant, apolitique et donc sans conflit d'intérêt viendrait de lanceurs d'alerte eux-mêmes; c'est-à-dire que la solution sera apportée par des femmes et des hommes qui ont appris de leur douloureux parcours, où ils ont souvent fait leurs propres erreurs. Les lanceurs d'alerte, garants de l'exemplarité et de l'éthique, prennent dorénavant leur destin en main. Ce sont les seules personnes légitimes à pouvoir apporter un accompagnement sur les plans juridique, financier, médiatique, psychologique aux lanceurs d'alerte déclarés à ce jour ainsi qu'à ceux de demain. Peu de citoyens osent encore parler car ils redoutent les conséquences. La meilleure façon de répondre à leur peur légitime est de leur permettre de continuer leur carrière et leur vie personnelle sans perte financière.

Dans le pays des droits de l'homme, chacun des lanceurs d'alerte français croyait en l'état providence et en l'exemplarité de notre nation. Dans le lancement de l'alerte, nous étions en attente de l'intérêt de nos élus. Si la France souhaite rayonner de nouveau dans le monde, si notre pays veut se montrer exemplaire notamment en matière de liberté d'expression, fondement de notre constitution, alors elle pourra mettre en avant les initiatives en faveur des lanceurs d'alerte. Ces actions y trouveront une crédibilité puisque indépendantes de l'Etat.

Notre solution unique, dans le cadre d'une activité économique réelle, retiendra uniquement les affaires sérieuses; elle appuiera la défense et l'intérêt des citoyens qui le méritent, elle détectera et éludera les dossiers et les personnes qui ne sont ni honnêtes, ni sincères. Nos actions de conseil seront crédibilisées par l'apport de moyens indépendants, apolitiques et sans conflit d'intérêt: Themis, véritable société rassemblant un certain nombre d'experts dont l'éthique et l'indépendance ne peut être remise en cause, agira concrètement pour permettre aux lanceurs d'alerte d'aller jusqu'au bout de leurs procédures, sans peur ni crainte.

L'ancien journaliste de Canal+, qui réside désormais en Espagne, se trouvait en Suisse où il était venu prendre part mercredi à Lausanne à une audience du Tribunal arbitral du sport. Dans ce dossier, il conteste sa suspension de 10 ans infligée par la justice interne de la Fifa notamment pour son implication dans une affaire de revente de billets du Mondial-2014.

Pour ces faits, le MPC a rappelé que Jérpôme Valcke fait l'objet d'une autre procédure pénale ouverte en particulier pour soupçon de différents actes de gestion déloyale.","La justice suisse ouvre une procédure pénale contre Nasser Al-Khelaïfi, le président du PSG",http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2017/10/12/la-justice-suisse-ouvre-une-procedure-penale-contre-nasser-al-khelaifi-le-president-du-psg_a_23241136/

The collection consists of men’s and womenswear garments with a moody, ethereal aesthetic, which is a nod to Victorian elegance.

With frills and florals on both the men’s and women’s items, the range is a more romantic take on spring/summer fashions.

Erdem x HM

Erdem is known as one of the UK’s leading brands when it comes to ethical fashion and sustainability.

Among the first to partake in Livia Firth’s green carpet challenge, the couture brand is celebrated for their stance on fair trading practices and slow fashion.

Erdem x HM

H&M have been slowly introducing ‘conscious’ (ie sustainable) items into their range since April 2012.

The brand also recently implemented a commitment for all their cotton to be sustainable by 2020.

Erdem x HM

So, although the collaboration between the brands isn’t classed as sustainable, some of the cottons used in the range are organic.

Moreover, some of the pieces in the men’s collection are made of hand woven wool from Harris Tweed in Scotland.

Erdem x HM

While some Erdem fans might be a little disappointed that the entire collaboration can’t be categorised as sustainable (and therefore, ‘ethical’ as Erdem is known to be), this combined venture is still a step in the right direction.

Erdem x HM

In 2016, 43% of H&M’s cotton was sustainably sourced.

It would be interesting to see what 2017′s statistic will be, no doubt this collaboration will affect it.

With an increasing focus back in Britain on preparations for a ‘no deal’ outcome, we may find out if that tactic has worked or backfired.

What was really extraordinary yesterday was the way Theresa May appeared to publicly smack down her Chancellor over his reluctance to spend hard cash on a hard Brexit prep. Hammond had told the Treasury Select Committee that he would only authorise such spending at the very last moment, because every pound spent on a hard border was “a pound that we can’t spend on the NHS or social care or education or deficit reduction”. Yet in PMQs, the PM seemed to be much firmer, cheering her Brexiteers with talk of spending whatever was necessary.

The BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg was first to reveal yesterday that this came off the back of a spat at Cabinet on Tuesday, when there was tense exchange over ‘no deal’ preparations. I’m told that Michael Gove certainly made a pointed intervention, though with a politesse that avoided a full-blown ‘row’. (Robert Peston reveals how he tried to ‘bounce’ the PM, backed by Chris Grayling). What’s fascinating is the way Gove is being deployed by May to reassure the more Euroscep MPs that all is well. He was the minister chosen to attend the backbench 1922 last night, just as he was the one defending the PM last Friday from the Shapps attack.

Theresa May looked rather irritated by Heidi Alexander’s claim she was ‘running scared’ of her party’s ‘right wing’ (watch those papers fly). And on paper, May and Hammond said exactly the same thing yesterday: that ‘no deal’ spending would be made “when necessary”. But some in No.10 want to remind Hammond who’s really in charge. Their frustration really stems from the fact that the Cabinet is actually pretty united on the fundamentals of Brexit: Hammond got his way on a transition and replicated EU rules, the Brexiteers got their way in limiting the transition to not much more than two years and a pledge to leave the single market and to ‘control’ migration.

Still, the Brexiteers’ disdain for Hammond is unmistakeable and many think he’s still an embittered Remainer who should be put in Osborne’s deep freeze. The Mail calls him ‘treacherous’ today. Business minister Claire Perry (seen as an Osborneite who once compared Leavers to ‘jihadis’) told the Today programme that was “unhelpful language…despite what the Daily Mail says we are unified as a government”. The crunch will come in December. Brexiteers say that if the EU still refuses to budge on trade, May should pull out of the talks altogether. Donald Tusk also said everyone would have to think again if there was no progress by Christmas. It’s a reminder once again that some in Brussels and some Leavers agree on one thing: the hard logic is that there really is no middle way, that there’s either ‘hard Brexit’ or no Brexit at all.","The Waugh Zone Thursday October 12, 2017",http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2017/10/12/the-waugh-zone-thursday-october-12-2017_n_18244774.html?utm_hp_ref=uk

My cousin was here from Ireland a few years ago and summed up Sydney drivers like so: ""It's like everyone has a boat, but they're like 'beep beep get outta my f**kin way I need to get to the beach and relax on my boat'.""

Flash forward a year and there's this huge bloke who's blocked me and my wife Tracy into a cul de sac in Canterbury, and he's out of his car and challenging me to a fight.

Minutes earlier, apparently, we'd gotten in the way of his boat ride. We were cruising down a wide but quiet street and old mate was right up our bums, so Tracy pulled over to let him pass.

Admittedly I gave him a sarcastic thumbs up as he passed. ""He's on his way to pick up his boat,"" I said, or something like that.

Suddenly, old mate screeches to a halt and gets out of his car. ""Why'd you stick your finger up at me?"" he yelled.

Um.

He comes at us. ""Do you wanna fight me?"" he shouted.

People who know me sometimes confuse my lyrical and silky Irish tones for exaggerated flair, so you can take this cold-hard-print as gospel truth; this bloke was a giant. He looked like Bane from Batman but with a moustache and a slightly shorter jacket. Bull shoulders coated in fur emerging from a tiny Silver VW Polo like a dreadful cosmic joke.

He starts coming towards us. ""Get out of the car, pussy"". Or something.

At the time, Tracy and I were home in Australia on holiday from our jobs in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, one of the world's car jacking capitals.

We didn't need this shit.

Tracy reversed the car back 50 metres, then drove around him and through a STOP sign to get away. She'd had some near misses in Moresby and wasn't going to take it from this bloke.

So we continued on our way. But this guy hops back in his car and starts chasing us through the streets. We end up in another cul de sac with his car across the street and him out of it blocking our only escape.

""Come on, fight me! Why'd you stick your finger up at me?""

Tracy and I had only left the house that day to pick up some work equipment from home base. Clutching my shiny new tripod I make for the door handle. I'm pretty stressed at this point.

The People's Republic of The Inner-West was, after all, our oasis after an extremely stressful year in PNG (a mutiny, a political crisis and guns, guns, guns in my face, while Tracy got two strains of Malaria, and I lucked out with one.)

So I was stressed, Tracy was stressed and Bigger Bane from Batman was stressed. Something had to give.

""I'm gonna batter this bastard"" I told Tracy, who suddenly (and wisely) locked the door.

""Nah,"" she said.

She reversed the car again, getting caught in a fast but complicated three point turn. Old mate advanced, stepped in the way and raged ""c'mon"", and then suddenly Tracy found herself driving towards him.

He jumped out of the way but grabbed my arm through an open window. Tracy pushed on, mounting the curb slightly and suddenly we were clear. She ducked around a few corners at speed and we were home. Safe.

It didn't occur to us to call the cops. Sorry about that. Again, stressful year in a country with sub-standard policing. If it happened again I'd be onto them in a shot.

Back In PNG, a year after our Canterbury drama, Tracy had another frightening experience. She was returning from a late night party with friends when a car suddenly pulled up in front of them.

A group of men, weapons in hand, got out and suddenly made for their car. Tracy's driver reversed, blowing a tyre on the jagged stump of a worn-out roundabout.

With sparks flying they drove at high speed through the pre-dawn darkness to the DFAT residences at Konedobu.

This morning I asked her which experience she found more stressful: PNG or Canterbury.

""Canterbury,"" she replied. ""In PNG it was somewhat expected. It's opportunistic and born out of poverty and desperation. But in Sydney it was just pure malicious, vindictive rage. I was not prepared for it to happen. That bizarre Sydney driver rage.""",Living In A Land Of Carjackings And Murder Was Less Stressful Than Driving In Sydney,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/eoin-blackwell/living-in-a-land-of-carjackings-and-murder-was-less-stressful-than-driving-in-sydney_a_23240658/

Am 15. Oktober wählt Österreich einen neuen Kanzler

Die Spitzenkandidaten der fremdenfeindlichen FPÖ und der konservativen ÖVP trafen am Sonntag in einem TV-Duell aufeinander

Die Harmonie zwischen Kurz und Strache deutet auf eine mögliche schwarz-blaue Koalition hin

Am kommenden Sonntag wählen die Österreicher ein neues Parlament – und schon jetzt deutet sich eine beunruhigende Regierungskonstellation an. Eine so genannte schwarz-blaue Koalition aus der regierungserfahrenen ÖVP und der rechtspopulistischen FPÖ gilt als immer wahrscheinlicher.

Beim TV-Duell am Sonntag zeigten FPÖ-Chef Heinz-Christian Strache und der konservative ÖVP-Obmann Sebastian Kurz, wie wohlgesonnen sie sich sind.

Gleich zu Beginn der Diskussionsrunde auf dem Sender Puls4 kam es zu einer bemerkenswerten Szene.

FPÖ-Mann Strache schenkte dem 31-jährigen ÖVP-Chef eine Ausgabe des beliebten Detektivspiels ‘Cluedo‘. “Vielleicht könnt mer das mit dem Herrn Kern spielen, vielleicht kommt man da drauf wer wirklich die Verantwortung hat,” schlug Strache vor.

Er bezog sich damit auf die Facebook-Hetzkampagne gegen den Außenminister, hinter der die sozialdemokratische Partei von Kanzler Christian Kern stecken soll.

Der Feind meines Feindes

Kurz und Kern hatten ihre Differenzen bereits in einem vorangegangenen Duell ausgetragen. Das sogenannte “Dirty Campaigning” war das am heftigsten diskutierte Thema. Kurz’ Partei ÖVP hatte am Freitag sogar eine Klage wegen Verhetzung gegen die Sozialdemokraten angekündigt.

Auf Facebook-Seiten mit den Namen ""Wir für Sebastian Kurz"" und die ""Wahrheit über Sebastian Kurz"" waren rassistische Inhalte im Namen des ÖVP-Chefs verbreitet worden. Laut einer Recherche des österreichischen Magazins ""Profil"" und der Zeitung ""Die Presse"" soll der in Israel festgenommene Ex-Kern-Berater Tal Silberstein hinter der Kampagne stecken.

Zunächst war jedoch die fremdenfeindliche FPÖ in den Verdacht geraten, hinter den Fake-Profilen zu stecken. Ob tatsächlich die SPÖ den Auftrag zur Silberstein-Kampagne gegeben hat, ist zwar noch unklar. Klar ist jedoch, dass ÖVP und FPÖ in der Reaktion zusammengerückt sind.

""Geschenksackerl für den Hund""

Während sich Kurz und Kern zankend in den Haaren lagen, verlief das Duell zwischen Strache und Kurz so weitaus harmonischer. Fast freundschaftlich.

Auch Kurz’ machte dem FPÖ-Mann – so sah es die Sendung vor – ein Geschenk – und auch sein Präsent hatte einen starken symbolischen Wert. Er überreichte dem Kontrahenten ein “Geschenksackerl” für dessen Hund – bekanntlich der billigste Trick um sich Freunde zu machen. “Sie haben einen wirklich coolen Hund, den ich immer wieder auf Facebook bewundern darf”, legte der Shootingstar der österreichischen Politik nach.

Koalition is in the air

Die Debatte verlief dann auch weiter ohne große Reibungen. In vielen Punkten pflichteten sich die Gegner bei.

Etwa was die militärische Neutralität Österreichs anbelangt: Strache bekräftigte seine Überzeugung, Österreich solle niemals Teil eines internationalen Verteidigungsbündnisses werden. “Das wollen wir unseren Kindern und Kindeskindern ersparen, dass wir nie wieder in einen Offensivkrieg oder Konflikt hinein gezogen werden”.

Kurz widersprach nicht, hielt jedoch fest, dass er sich eine stärkere Zusammenarbeit auf europäischer Ebene im Kampf gegen den Terror wünsche. Das hieße aber keineswegs, dass dies auf Basis einer europäischen Armee oder eines NATO-Beitritts geschehen müsse.

Und selbst wenn Uneinigkeit herrschte, legten die beiden einen bemerkenswert respektvollen Umgangston an den Tag, etwa im Punkt Migration.

Auf die Kritik des FPÖ-Mannes an seinem späten Umschwung in der Migrationspolitik (“2015 sind sie noch auf dem Schoß von Frau Merkel gesessen"") reagierte Kurz mit einem Verweis auf das Koalitionsabkommen mit der SPÖ, die er nicht überstimmen wollte.

""Ich hätte liebend gerne mit ihnen gestimmt, dass keine Familienbeihilfe ins Ausland geht, und vieles andere“, erklärte Kurz. Der Außenminister machte keinen Hehl daraus, dass er bereit ist, Politik mit den Rechten zu machen.

Er sprach von den großen Fortschritten, die man seit 2015 gemacht habe. Die illegale Migration konnte “massiv begrenzt werden”, stellte der Außenminister fest und fügte hinzu: “Ich lad’ Sie ein, unterstützen Sie mich dabei, diesen Kurs weiter fortzusetzen”.

Darf man das schon als Koalitionswunsch verstehen?



“Duett mit wenig Misstönen”

Der österreichische “Kurier” glaubt genau das: ""Man merkt, dass da zwei mögliche Partner miteinander diskutiert haben,” wird der ehemalige österreichische Moderator Gerald Groß in der Analyse des Duells zitiert. Weiterhin kommt die Zeitung zu dem Schluß: Manchmal hatte man den Eindruck, dass die beiden sich geradezu überwinden müssen, einander zu kritisieren.



Auch das Boulevardmedium “OE24” findet, dass sich beide inhaltlich über weite Strecken einig waren. “Die Presse” schreibt von einem “Duett mit wenigen Misstönen”.

Am Ende gab es nochmal Geschenke: Shootingstar Kurz überreichte Strache ein Buch über ÖVP-Stammvater Alois Mock, “das daran erinnern soll, dass wir Österreicher, wenn wir wollen, die Kraft haben in Europa wirklich etwas zu bewirken.”

Ob Kurz und Strache dieses Projekt tatsächlich gemeinsam angehen, wird die Wahl am 15. Oktober zeigen.","TV-Duell in Österreich: Eine Szene zeigt, was dem Land nach der Wahl blühen könnte",http://www.huffingtonpost.de/2017/10/09/tv-duell-in-osterreich-ei_n_18222682.html?utm_hp_ref=germany

And if they don't, well, let's assume they a) are single or b) won't last in their relationship very long.
""Compromise is absolutely key, I have to say, but of course it will vary from couple to couple,"" Matt Garrett from Relationships Australia told HuffPost Australia.
When you are talking to a couple about committing to a relationship, you are really asking the person to give up half of themselves.
""If you are entering a relationship, I think you need to expect to compromise to some degree,"" Garrett said.","Anyone who has ever been in a relationship will tell you compromise is key. And if they don't, well, let's assume they a) are single or b) won't last in their relationship very long.

However, while a certain amount of compromise is healthy, if someone feels they are underappreciated or are thanklessly giving up things that are important to them, it can cause resentment, friction and ultimately could lead to a relationship's demise.

So how much compromise is healthy?

""Compromise is absolutely key, I have to say, but of course it will vary from couple to couple,"" Matt Garrett from Relationships Australia told HuffPost Australia.

""It's such a fraught topic. Many couples, especially that we see here, really struggle with the idea of compromise, most often because it relates to issues of fairness.

""Fairness is closely linked to intimacy. How? Because in a compromised situation you are sending a partner a message of how much you are thinking of them in terms of putting their needs before yours.

""It taps into some very powerful forces between a couple. Fairness, equity... often you will have couples come to you with these little checklists, almost like scales weighing up how much I do for him and how much he does for me.""

When you are talking to a couple about committing to a relationship, you are really asking the person to give up half of themselves. Matt Garrett, Relationships Australia

Garrett said often -- though not always -- this can be amplified if one individual works and the other doesn't.

""It is quite often represented if someone is staying home and doing all the housework, who may or may not feel as though their partner 'wants me to be at their beck and call' and has what they feel is the lion's share of domestic responsibilities,"" Garrett said.

""Conversely, the person who is out all day may feel they work hard to bring home the money, and then when they do arrive home they don't feel appreciated.

""The idea of compromise can be tangled up in those mundane and important issues that couples have to work out.""

It's also important to note what does and doesn't constitute healthy levels of give and take.

""If you are entering a relationship, I think you need to expect to compromise to some degree,"" Garrett said.

""But not to the point where you lose your dignity and self respect. There is a very sharp boundary about what you 'put up with' so if it's around safety, and someone's gambling or not allowing you a bank account or being controlling, we are not talking about that.

""Likewise if your partner is expecting you to do things in the bedroom you're not comfortable with. That is not 'compromise' and not what we are discussing today.

If you are going into a relationship expecting that you won't have to change... then I'm sorry, you are in for a rocky time.

""In terms of what is reasonable... interestingly when I first did my training I remember one of my tutors saying to me, 'When you are talking to a couple about committing to a relationship, you are really asking the person to give up half of themselves', which I think is a good rule of thumb.

""In order to make a relationship work, you do need to 'give up' a lot of your individuality to be a part of the couple. If you are going into a relationship expecting that you won't have to change and that the other person will have to fit around your routine or what you like or your preferences then I'm sorry, you are in for a rocky time.""

For this reason, Garrett says it's important to set up boundaries and discuss expectations early on in the piece, rather than letting resentment build over time.

""So many people leave it way too long,"" he said. ""When we see them in the counselling room the levels of resentment and unhappiness are quite high.

Have the discussion early on.

""I know in the early stages of a relationship, you want things to be rosy and gentle. You're in the throes of lust and don't want to come across as critical or unappreciative. But if you don't have those discussions early on, it will come up later and often in an ugly way.""

So what do you do if things have wandered off track?

""I think asking the question, 'Well, how did it get to this point?' is incredibly useful,"" Garrett said. ""Often you'll find it's a series of events that have changed the circumstances of the couple over time.

""It's about saying, 'This is how we've started out and now with three children I can't maintain the home as well as a job as well as I used to, and I need more help.

""I really think finding out about the events which led to the dissatisfaction is very important. You can often quite accurately track where it started to fall away or change.

""One very classic example is people can get complacent and forget to let the other person know how they are feeling or their gratitude, or to express their admiration or love.

""A lot of it is about trying capture the essence of what brought them together in the first place.

""However I will say if it's getting to the point where a couple are disagreeing and aren't able to modify their own behaviour within the relationship, they need outside help.""

Síguenos también en el Facebook de HuffPost Blog","El independentismo catalán dio este martes un nuevo paso hacia la secesión a través de una nueva artimaña ejecutada por los golpistas para ganar la batalla de la comunicación y la propaganda. El golpista Puigdemont declaró la independencia unilateral de Cataluña y, a los segundos, propuso al Parlament suspenderla durante varias semanas, sin que sepamos que tal cosa se decidiera, dado que todo lo que vimos después fue a los diputados independentistas firmar un documento plagado de patrañas con el que se comprometían en su objetivo secesionista. El objetivo de Puigdemont y el de sus compañeros de viaje es, además de salvarse de las consecuencias jurídicas de su golpe contra la democracia, tratar de aparecer como víctima ante parte de la opinión pública española, confundir y enfrentar a los partidos políticos nacionales, lograr la mediación internacional y, con todo ello, alcanzar su objetivo, con el que están claramente comprometidos.

Para alcanzarlo, se han saltado las más básicas normas de convivencia, vulnerado todos los procedimientos legales y constitucionales imaginables, desobedecido todas las resoluciones del Tribunal Constitucional, despreciado el Estado de Derecho, perjudicado a conciencia y gravemente los intereses económicos de Cataluña y de toda España y celebrado un referéndum ilegítimo e ilegal, provocando con todo ello la ruptura de la convivencia ciudadana y la paz social, todo esto a través de una estrategia comunicativa y propagandística perfectamente diseñada, incluidas lágrimas de cocodrilo, enfados impostados de los antisistema y... el vergonzoso comportamiento de Podemos, Colau y resto de ya confirmados enemigos de España, plenamente dispuestos a que salte todo por los aires, a ver si les cae algo.

Y esto solo los últimos años, porque son décadas el tiempo que llevan trabajando para lograr la independencia de Cataluña: desde el adoctrinamiento ideológico desde la más tierna infancia hasta el control de todos los medios de comunicación. Ahora pretenden el golpe final, a través de una trampa más que evidente, en la que ni el gobierno, ni el PP, ni el PSOE ni Ciudadanos deberían caer. Y caerían en ella si deciden, otra vez, no hacer nada, disimular o mirar a las musarañas. Lo que deben hacer es justo lo contrario: aplicar toda la ley y todos los artículos de la CE para parar definitivamente este ataque a nuestra democracia.

Ni el gobierno ni los partidos políticos democráticos deberían dejarse engañar por los golpistas... ni alcanzar ningún tipo de apaño con ellos.

Puigdemont y sus iluminados y enloquecidos compañeros de viaje apelan hipócritamente al diálogo para solucionar este supuesto conflicto ""entre Cataluña y España"", como si ellos fueran Cataluña y como si fuera democrático dialogar con golpistas que han vulnerado la CE y la legalidad vigente. Es obvio que forma parte de su estrategia. El problema es que no pocos despistados caen en la trampa mientras otros la extienden para sacar tajada. El diálogo es diálogo democrático cuando se produce sin trampas ni engaños, entre demócratas que respetan los procedimientos establecidos y las leyes y cuando se produce en las instituciones que correspondan. En este caso, en el Parlamento de Cataluña o el Congreso de los Diputados, pero cumpliendo todas las condiciones anteriores, no incumpliéndolas, que es lo que llevan tiempo haciendo los nacionalistas en Cataluña. No hay margen para los atajos o los amaños. Si se pretende reformar la CE, se propone en el Congreso de los Diputados y se trata de convencer al respetable... respetando escrupulosamente el Estado de Derecho y sus normas: lo otro es un golpe de Estado inaceptable, por el que no pueden salir impunes.

En fin, que nadie se lleve a engaño: lo llevado a cabo ayer en el Parlamento de Cataluña por parte de los golpistas es otra burla más al Estado de Derecho, como todo el proceso que estamos viviendo. Un cúmulo de mentiras, maniobras e ilegalidades que forman parte de una misma estrategia y que no tienen otro objetivo que lograr finalmente y a las bravas la independencia de Cataluña y, de paso, escapar de sus responsabilidades penales. Ni el gobierno ni los partidos políticos democráticos deberían dejarse engañar por los golpistas... ni alcanzar ningún tipo de apaño con ellos.

If you play your cards right, the next couple of weeks could be the perfect time to book your long-haul flights (particularly if you're heading to Europe or the U.S.).

Why? It all comes down to a little something known in the travel industry as 'earlybird season' where airlines tend to drop their flight prices for the following year.

While the best months are typically September and October, sales can continue throughout the rest of the year, usually ending with a bang on Boxing Day.

""Who coined the term 'earlybird', I don't know, but the point of the earlybird season is getting in early to book the cheapest flight possible,"" Nathan Graham, regional sales manager at Cheapflights told HuffPost Australia.

""Exactly when each airline releases their deals can differ from airline to airline, but essentially they are coming out with tactical fares for the low seasons or the routes they find hard to fill.

""Some airlines might be planning on adding some routes to their inventory, and if they are planning to do that next year they might start planning ahead and release flights early.

""At the end of the day, it's an excuse for them to be competitive on price and entice people to come and book with them directly.""

Yes please.

In terms of how to bag the best deal, Graham said it pays to be vigilant and to keep track of each airline's deals and sales.

""It's a very important time for people to keep an eye our for the deal they are after and the destination they are after,"" he said.

""Obviously we are talking long haul flights and not closer destinations like Bali or Thailand. For the long haul routes, this is probably your best bet to get a really good deal, unless you wait until next year and try your luck with a last minute fare. But I don't like to advise that.""

According to Graham, while some airlines start their earlybird season in August, things really get into going in September and October.

""Depending on the airline, some are quick to the market and some of them are a little bit more reactive,"" he said.

While typically the season comes to an end at the end of October/early November, Graham said some airlines ""continue having sales until Boxing Day, which is a big sales day"".

""For consumers, the key [to nabbing a great deal] is if you see a large brand come out with a sale or branded early bird or whatever, just watch their competitors.

""Because if they are a reactive brand it's very likely they will come out with something cheaper and then the fight is on and the consumer wins. Just keep an eye on it.

Ce mercredi, j'étais sûre que j'allais commencer à fléchir et à rêver d'un bon traiteur libanais pour ma pause déjeuner. J'ai donc préparé donc un repas froid, simple, inspiré d'une recette du livre ""Simplissime Salades Complètes"" de Jean-François Mallet chez Hachette Cuisine.

Mélangez un avocat coupé en morceaux, le concombre en bâtonnets, des miettes de thon (optionnel), le jus d'un demi-citron, les pois chiches rincés et égouttés. Épluchez et coupez en fines rondelles l'oignon rouge, faites-les attendrir dans un peu de vinaigre. Ciselez du persil, de la coriandre, de la menthe selon votre goût (ajoutez-les au dernier moment). A côté, un peu de houmous et du pain pita.

En dessert, du raisin.

Hatheier told the Today Show that her mother called her from Sydney's Cronulla beach, telling her there was a shark in the Oak Park Rock Pool and that she had already called the Police.

Hatheier and her daughters jumped into the car and headed to the beach to investigate. When the Police were unsure what to do about the animal, Hatheier took matters into her own hands.

""So I came down, there was a bit of a crew down here, and had a look and he was a little Port Jackson and was doing laps of the pool and I said, you know I'm going to go in and check him out,"" Hatheier told Today.

Hatheier's daughter Shannon filmed her mother as she swam fearlessly up to the one-metre-long creature, picked it up and threw it over the pool's barrier and into the ocean.

Cette semaine, Le HuffPost vous invite à préparer vos propres plats maison pour votre pause déjeuner, comme indiqué dans notre événement Facebook. Et on ne peut évidemment pas passer outre les différentes soupes.

Attention, on ne parle pas de la soupe filandreuse, fade ou achetée en brique. Ces recettes de soupe vous promettent bien plus: du réconfort, de la douceur et surtout, du goût! Entre l'arrivée précoce de la grippe, les fêtes de fin d'année bientôt terminées, la rentrée qui arrive, le froid qui s'est durablement installé, nous en avons tous besoin.

Toutes extraites du livre "" Ces soupes qui nous font du bien"", de la blogueuse Cléa et de Clémence Catz, ces recettes de soupes mettent en valeur les épinards, la courge butternut, le miso ou encore le potimarron.



Velouté d'épinards au sésame

Pour 4 personnes

2 c. à soupe de graines de sésame blond toastées

1 kg d'épinards frais

1 oignon

1 c. à soupe d'huile de sésame ou de coco

1 pointe de couteau de cumin en poudre

½ c. à café de thym séché

Facultatif : yaourt de brebis à la grecque

Faire tremper les graines de sésame dans un peu d'eau pendant 6 à 8 heures. Laver les épinards, les blanchir 2 minutes à l'eau bouillante, égoutter et réserver. Peler et émincer l'oignon et le faire revenir dans l'huile jusqu'à coloration. Ajouter les épinards hachés et faire revenir 5 minutes supplémentaires. Mixer avec les graines de sésame et leur eau, ainsi que le cumin et le thym. Saler et servir chaud avec une belle cuillerée de yaourt à la grecque si souhaité.

Pour le topping: Graines de sésame toastées, pincée de thym séché ou de cumin en poudre, cuillerée de yaourt de brebis à la grecque.

Velouté de butternut au curcuma frais





Ce velouté très chaleureux, dont le parfum évoque le safran et la noisette grillée, marie le ghee et le curcuma, deux stars de la cuisine indienne ayurvédique, avec de la butternut rôtie et une pointe de gingembre et de citron. À consommer tout l'hiver pour ses vertus anti-inflammatoires et son action bénéfique sur la digestion et le système immunitaire.

Pour 3 à 4 personnes

Pour le velouté

1 butternut (1 kg)

2 c. à café de ghee ou d'huile de coco (+ 1 c. à soupe rase de ghee) (voir la recette ci-après)

600 ml de bouillon végétal

1 gros pouce de curcuma

1 cm de racine de gingembre

2 c. à café de jus de citron

Pour le topping

Noix de cajou hachées, coriandre, gomasio.

Préchauffer le four à 180 °C. Couper la butternut en deux dans la longueur et ôter les pépins. Badigeonner la chair avec les 2 cuillerées à café de ghee ou d'huile de coco, saler et poivrer. Faire cuire pendant 30 à 40 minutes environ, jusqu'à ce que la courge soit bien tendre (vérifier avec un couteau). Laisser tiédir un peu, puis éplucher. Préparer le bouillon, puis le mixer longuement avec la courge en morceaux, le ghee restant, le curcuma et le gingembre râpés ainsi que le jus de citron. Saler et bien poivrer. Servir bien chaude, avec les toppings souhaités.

Recette du ghee (ou beurre clarifié)

Dans une casserole à fond épais, faire fondre la quantité désirée de beurre cru (500 g minimum), à feu très doux et sans mélanger. Au fur et à mesure, retirer la mousse qui se forme à la surface à l'aide d'une cuillère en bois ou d'une écumoire. Une fois le beurre fondu, le ghee se trouve en surface tandis que le petit-lait reste au fond sous la forme d'une couche blanchâtre. Filtrer avec une étamine ou un chinois à mailles fines pour ne garder que le ghee. Le conserver dans un récipient hermétique en verre, à température ambiante et consommer dans les trois mois.



Soupe miso aux nouilles soba





Les soba sont des nouilles japonaises à base de farine de sarrasin (il en existe des 100 % sarrasin ou des 60 % sarrasin, en mélange avec de la farine de blé). Les Japonais les consomment généralement nature, chaudes ou froides, avec une sauce à base de soja et de bouillon dashi. Mais rien n'empêche de les intégrer directement à un potage, surtout si celui-ci est à base de miso : cela donne une soupe japonaise rassasiante et très jolie à regarder.

Pour 4 personnes

1 poireau

2 gousses d'ail

250 g de champignons de Paris (ou shiitakés)

2 carottes

5 oignons nouveaux

1 c. à soupe d'huile de sésame

1 cube de bouillon

1 morceau d'algue kombu

200 g de nouilles soba

250 g de tofu aux algues

1 c. à soupe de miso

Laver le poireau, ôter la barbe et la partie dure du vert et émincer le reste. Peler, dégermer et hacher les gousses d'ail. Peler les champignons et les couper en lamelles. Peler les carottes et les couper en petits cubes. Émincer les oignons nouveaux. Chauffer l'huile de sésame dans un faitout et faire revenir le poireau et l'ail sur feu assez vif. Baisser le feu et ajouter les champignons, les carottes et la partie blanche des oignons nouveaux. Couvrir d'eau à hauteur, ajouter le cube de bouillon et l'algue kombu. Laisser mijoter pendant 15 minutes.

Ôter l'algue et mettre de côté. Filtrer le bouillon et réserver les légumes. Porter le bouillon à ébullition et ajouter les nouilles soba. Cuire pendant 2 minutes à frémissement, puis ajouter le tofu coupé en cubes et cuire pendant 2 minutes supplémentaires. Prélever les nouilles et le tofu à l'aide d'une écumoire et répartir dans des bols. Placer le miso dans une petite passoire et placer la passoire dans le bouillon. À l'aide d'une petite cuillère, faire passer le miso dans le bouillon. Remettre les légumes dans le bouillon, mélanger puis répartir dans les bols de nouilles. Garnir de la partie verte des oignons nouveaux émincés et servir sans attendre.

Velouté de potimarron, orange et cacao





Cette recette vraiment bluffante et pourtant très facile à réaliser, marie trois ingrédients qui semblent nés pour finir ensemble dans une soupe d'hiver : le potimarron, l'orange et le cacao cru, une vraie petite bombe nutritionnelle. En bonus, le plaisir de regarder fondre doucement les copeaux de chocolat sur le bol de velouté fumant... Si vous n'avez pas de pâte de cacao cru, remplacez-la par quelques carrés de bon chocolat noir.

Pour 4 personnes

1 potimarron (1 kg)

1 oignon jaune

25 g de beurre de cacao

1 orange

1 cube ou 1 c. à café bombée de bouillon végétal

1 c. à soupe d'huile d'olive

15 g de pâte (ou 8 fèves, ou 2 c. à soupe de poudre) de cacao cru

Brosser l'écorce du potimarron, puis le faire cuire au four à 180°C pendant 30 à 40 minutes, jusqu'à ce que la chair soit tendre (vérifier en le transperçant avec la lame d'un couteau). Laisser tiédir, ouvrir en deux et ôter les graines. Sans l'éplucher, couper la chair en morceaux. Émincer l'oignon et le faire blondir dans l'huile d'olive. Ajouter le potimarron et le zeste de l'orange et faire revenir pendant 3 minutes en remuant. Couvrir d'eau à hauteur, ajouter le bouillon cube et laisser mijoter 20 minutes à couvert. Mixer longuement avec le jus de l'orange afin d'obtenir un velouté lisse et onctueux, saler, poivrer et répartir dans des bols. Parsemer de copeaux de pâte de cacao cru (ou bien de fèves concassées ou de poudre tamisée).

Topping crumble au beurre de cacao cru

30 g de noix de cajou

25 g d'amandes

10 g de graines de tournesol

2 pincées de cumin en poudre

2 pincées de cardamome en poudre

1 pincée de muscade

20 g de beurre de cacao cru

Mixer rapidement les graines avec les épices, le sel et le poivre afin de les hacher plus ou moins finement sans les réduire en poudre : le résultat doit être irrégulier. Faire fondre le beurre de cacao à feu très doux ou au bain-marie, verser sur les graines et bien mélanger afin d'obtenir un mélange sableux. Conserver dans un bol, à température ambiante ou au réfrigérateur pour une texture plus croquante.

As if the dismal count of women leaders wasn't bad enough, it appears that what they are valued for is also drowned in stereotypes. Let's examine both with an example, the numbers and nature of women held up as examples of leadership. Harvard Business School caters to approximately 80% of the business cases studied across the world. Across its 53 best-selling case studies over five years, only seven feature women protagonists (of which two are actually men with names changed to add to the gender mix). Sadly, even this low percentage (13%) beats the real-world figure, despite the rise in the number of women CEOs in 2017 from 21 to 32 amongst the Fortune 500 companies (i.e. 6%).

An INSEAD graduate, Lesley Symons, decided to delve deeper and founded an organisation The Case for Women, which conducts detailed research into the representation of women in business school papers and case studies. To begin with, in the women-led Harvard case studies mentioned above, Symons discovered that these seven women were limited to working in 'pink' industries: food, family, furniture and fashion, that are stereotypically associated with women leaders. She performed the 'Bechdel test' on these case studies (calling it the 'Symons test') and found that only three out of these seven women in leadership positions were actually portrayed as speaking to other women 'about' the business. She also notes that their descriptions are much less in-depth than the important men within the same case study and that they are never accorded any importance in the world portrayed in the case study.

Men take recourse to the narrative of being the breadwinner of the house, hence alleviating any guilt about their inability to help out at home

Apart from their limitation within the 'pink industries', the one glaring aspect about women leaders highlighted in business case studies is how they deal with 'work-life-balance'. Men in leadership positions do not have to be concerned about the home while women leaders must always balance their professional lives with the personal, especially if they have children. Anecdotally, too, whether it is in conferences or celebrated interviews with successful women, there is almost always airtime dedicated to how they cope with work and home, together. Many women leaders offer sage advice on the importance of marrying the right person and having supportive in-laws as critical factors for getting ahead in the workplace!

Talking about 'the right partner', what is the expectation from men? There are studies to indicate that men take recourse to the narrative of being the breadwinner of the house, hence alleviating any guilt about their inability to help out at home. According to a survey by the Working Mother Research Institute, 79% of working mothers are responsible for doing the laundry, and mothers are twice as fathers likely to handle the cooking. The results of this survey also say that working fathers tend to take over the outdoor chores, but working mothers handle most of the childcare.

It is clear that women have to simultaneously deal with the pressure at work, the unfair expectations on them to outperform their peers to prove that they are 'serious' about and committed to their work, as well as the guilt and judgment that comes with being a working mother, from family members and colleagues, if they do not spend time at home. Women who manage both home and work well are idolised as the superwomen of our generation.

But is this a fair expectation?

Is this a fair expectation only of women? While women are beginning to assume leadership positions, with growing representation in areas such as automobiles and defence, we need to create change beyond the professional universe. Conversations at home must change. Whether it is about men wanting to parent more or share domestic chores in greater measure, or women wanting to step out more, these equality-oriented steps have to become more visible and loud. And if we truly want to break stereotypes, work-life-balance must matter to both, equally.

Not only are we not providing enough women role models, but even the ones that exist bear the burden of every existing gender stereotype out there. This can never lead to a balanced 'home' or 'professional space'. If even hypothetical situations (business case studies) fail to show equality in its true sense of the word, how do we influence and change the direction of young minds who will shape the future of the professional world sustainably?

Now that bed-time stories are becoming gender-transformative, isn't it time for business schools to take a cue?

Philosoph Precht polterte, Özdemir dürfe auf keinen Fall Außenminister werden

Precht ist überzeugt: ""Es gibt keine grüne Außenpolitik""

Vor wenigen Monaten hätte es kaum einer für möglich gehalten. Die Grünen könnten bald regieren, wenn die schwierigen Verhandlungen zur Jamaika-Koalition glücken.

Den Grünen könnte so sogar eine der wichtigsten Positionen im neuen Merkel-Kabinett zukommen. Beobachter sehen Cem Özdemir als aussichtsreichen Anwärter auf den Posten des Außenministers.

In der ZDF-Talkshow von Markus Lanz diskutierten unter anderem der Journalist Wolfram Weimer und Philosoph Richard David Precht über die mögliche neue Regierung.

""Man kann keine grüne Außenpolitik machen""

Beide waren sich einig: Union, FDP und Grüne seien alle in der politischen Mitte angesiedelt, mit ein bisschen Kompromissbereitschaft könnte eine funktionierende Regierung entstehen.

Als es dann aber um den möglichen Außenminister der Grünen ging, wurde Precht plötzlich aufbrausend. ""Ich persönlich würde es zutiefst bedauern, wenn Özdemir Außenminister wird"", sagte der Philosoph. Der Grund für seine Ablehnung: ""Man kann keine grüne Außenpolitik machen.""

Wenn die Partei aber diesen ""Riesenposten"" bekomme, könne man in anderen Punkten der Koalitionsverhandlungen womöglich ""wenig in die Waagschale werfen"". Die Posten des Landwirtschaftsministers und des Umweltministers würden den Grünen als Konsequenz womöglich entgehen.

""Und wofür haben die Leute denn die Grünen gewählt?"", fragte Precht. Die Partei stehe für Nachhaltigkeit und eine ökologische Politik in Zeiten des Massenkonsums. Das Amt des Außenministers dagegen würde an Özdemir ""verpulvert"" werden – aufgrund des ""persönlichen Ehrgeizes eines Menschen"".

Die Folge sei, dass das Landwirtschaftsministerium womöglich ein CSU-Politiker bekomme. ""Was ich für ein Problem halte, weil wir insbesondere auf dem Agrarsektor, bei der Massentierhaltung, eine unglaubliche Veränderung brauchen, den wir mit der CSU nicht kriegen, und für den die Grünen stehen"", erklärte Precht.

""So ein Amt darf ein Grüner nicht bekleiden""

Dann wurde es zunehmend bizarr.

Precht redete sich weiter in Rage: ""Was ist denn grüne Außenpolitik? Das ist doch völliger Quatsch!"" Er schimpfte regelrecht: ""Das ist alles nur Unsinn."" Man könne in Peking nicht nur die Klimapolitik ansprechen statt der Menschenrechte.

""So ein Amt darf man als Grüner nie bekleiden wollen, oder man ist kein Grüner"", polterte Precht. Eine steile These.

Schließlich haben auch die Grünen ein ausgearbeitetes außenpolitisches Programm, pochen immer wieder entschieden auf die Einhaltung der Menschenrechte in aller Welt. Zwischen 1998 und 2005 bekleidete mit Joschka Fischer ein Grüner das Amt des Außenministers.

Das Studiopublikum applaudierte Precht dennoch frenetisch.

Weimer hielt dagegen: Der Philosoph unterschätze die Partei. ""Da sind schon schlaue Menschen dabei. (...) Die haben schon politische Überzeugungen.""

Auch die proeuropäische Haltung der Grünen ließe sich in eine konkrete Politik umsetzen, nicht nur der Klimaschutz. Fischer sei rückblickend ""kein so schlechter Außenminister"" gewesen.

Colin Bateman, who has seen the cover of his darkly comic 1995 book Divorcing Jack apparently doctored by Jones and used repeatedly by the press, said the picture has become the “ultimate stock image.”

“Nobody ever asks why on earth a Syrian terrorist would be holding a Jack Russell,” he told HuffPost UK.

Sally Jones, who was also known as the White Widow, died earlier this year in a US drone strike in Syria, according to multiple reports, including one in The Sun, which printed the oft-used picture of her on its front page.

Jones used her Twitter to recruit women and provided practical advice on how to join Isis in Syria.

She is believed to have been behind dozens of terror plots and was the leader of the secret Anwar al-Awlaki battalion’s female wing.

Reacting to news of Jones’ death on Facebook, Bateman said “she just hijacked the image, which was then itself hijacked by the world’s media”.

The nun image, one of only a handful of Jones, is often used by the media without any context, implying it is real.

Bateman, a Northern Irish screenwriter and ex-journalist, told HuffPost he was dismayed how often the media would use the picture with no context or explanation of its origin.

Sally Jones The 'nun with a gun' image of Sally Jones is actually a crude photoshop of the Divorcing Jack cover

“Nobody delves any deeper. Obviously there’s very little information about her so they grasp at what they’ve got. Nobody ever goes deep on it and asks why it’s being used or where it’s from or where it originated.

“It’s become the ultimate stock image.”

In 2014, the Daily Express ran the image under the caption: “Sally Jones in her nun and gun outfit”.

In January 2015, The Times called it an “Isis recruitment poster”.

In September 2014, The Evening Standard ran it, calling it “bizarre”.

When asked if he wanted the media to stop using it, Bateman said: “I was a journalist for 20 years. I know how it works... Sometimes it’s the easiest thing you grab [to use as a picture].

“But I just think a little bit of context is useful to have.”

HuffPost understands it was taken from one of Jones’ social media accounts when it was first reported that she had travelled with her husband Junaid Hussain to Syria to join Isis in 2013.

Twitter 'White Widow' Sally Jones has reportedly been killed in a US drone strike

He was killed by a US drone in 2015, and had reportedly been planning “barbaric attacks against the West” including terror plots targeting high profile public commemorations this summer.

Bateman believes Jones herself may have created the image. She played in an all-female punk group in the 1990s and Bateman said this coincided roughly with the time of the book’s success.

“The book was quite punky and had a lot of punk references. I presume she picked it up around then, because the image hasn’t been on the book for quite a few years, so it’s not something she’s picked up recently,” he said.

Bateman remembers first seeing the photoshopped image when he opened a newspaper and saw it on page three.

“It was just a shock,” he said. “You read into it and you realise how surreal and bizarre it is that this has come back to haunt you.”

Since then, Bateman has had no one had ever approached him over the connection between his book and the picture.

He said when he first saw it on The Daily Mail, he posted a comment pointing out the connection but had no response.

“I know it’s been used for terrible things. If in some way I’m connected to even one person being recruited to go out there. I really hate that fact,” he said.

“It’s just a bizarre connection to have. I’m just sorry if any people have suffered because of it.”

He added: “It corrupts my happy memories of the book in a way but also I’m quite proud of the image and the book, the fact that people are still talking about it 22 years after it was published.”

STOCKHOLM -- U.S. economist Richard Thaler won the 2017 Nobel Economics Prize for his contributions in the field of behavioral economics, showing how human traits affect supposedly rational markets, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said on Monday.

Thaler brought to prominence the idea of ""nudge"" economics, where humans are subtly guided toward beneficial behaviors without heavy-handed compulsion, the theme of a 2008 book he co-wrote which caught the eye of policymakers around the world.

In his award citation, the Academy said his research had harnessed psychologically realistic assumptions in analyses of economic decision-making, exploring the consequences of limited rationality, social preferences, and lack of self-control.

""In total, Richard Thaler's contributions have built a bridge between the economic and psychological analyses of individual decision-making,"" the award-giving body said on announcing the 9 million Swedish crown ($1.1 million) prize.

""His empirical findings and theoretical insights have been instrumental in creating the new and rapidly expanding field of behavioral economics, which has had a profound impact on many areas of economic research and policy.""

The economics prize, officially called the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, was established in 1968. It was not part of the original group of awards set out in dynamite tycoon Nobel's 1895 will.

Economy is the last of this year's Nobels. The prizes for physiology or medicine, physics, chemistry, literature and peace were all awarded last week.

The United States has dominated the economics prize, with American economists accounting for roughly half of laureates since the inception of the award. Indeed, between 2000 and 2013, U.S. academics won or shared the prize every year.

While few economists are household names, past winners have included Milton Friedman, in 1976, whose work is a cornerstone of current monetary policy, and James Tobin, in 1981, who proposed countries should tax financial transactions.

Some countries in the European Union agreed on such a tax to help fight the debt crisis, but implementation has been delayed, among other things by Britain's decision to leave the bloc.

Sufferers can also develop ruddy skin, prominent blood vessels, pimples and, most surprisingly to some, eye problems.
But if left untreated, some of the most severe ― and rare ― cases of rosacea can leave sufferers blind.
“All of the most severe cases of each subtype may lead to ocular rosacea and rarely to blindness.”She added that ocular (or eye) rosacea is prevalent in up to 58 percent of current rosacea sufferers, more commonly among men.
“Lasers that eliminate excess superficial blood vessels are also extremely effective.”","Rosacea is a skin condition that currently affects over 14 million Americans and it usually begins to appear in people over the age of 30. It’s generally characterized by redness on the forehead, nose, cheeks and chin. Sufferers can also develop ruddy skin, prominent blood vessels, pimples and, most surprisingly to some, eye problems. But if left untreated, some of the most severe ― and rare ― cases of rosacea can leave sufferers blind.

“Rosacea is a highly inflammatory condition affecting the face and commonly causes eye irritation, feeling like grittiness, stinging, or swelling of the eyelid,” Dr. Ellen Marmur, president and founder of Marmur Medical and associate clinical professor at Mount Sinai Medical Center, told HuffPost.

“There are many types of rosacea, from common flushing to acneiform rosacea (pink pimples on the cheeks, nose and chin with dry, sensitive skin) to rhinophymatous rosacea (the classic large nose with big pores like W.C. Fields, due to years of inflammation causing the soft tissue of the nose to grow thicker),” Marmur said. “All of the most severe cases of each subtype may lead to ocular rosacea and rarely to blindness.”

She added that ocular (or eye) rosacea is prevalent in up to 58 percent of current rosacea sufferers, more commonly among men.

“Rosacea increases the number of small blood vessels in the eyelids, blockage of the meibomian glands (glands on the edge of the eyelid that add a little oil to the tears so they last longer and keep the eye nice and moist), and dryness of the eye which may ultimately lead to thickening of the cornea called rosacea keratitis,” Marmur said. Basically, it boils down to this:

“When rosacea flares up, it blocks the glands and the tears evaporate faster without the natural oils, leading to dry eyes and blepharitis,” she explained. “This leads to itchy, dry eye and flakey red eyelids.”

Again, while cases of rosacea that leads to blindness are extremely rare, it’s important to be very aware of your skin and certain symptoms if you have rosacea and develop a treatment plan with your dermatologist. You can tell that your rosacea is worsening (or reaching the point that it’s very severe) when you experience persistent flushing, redness or broken blood vessels, according to Marmur.

“The skin appears swollen or congested. The eyes are very uncomfortable and vision may even become impaired,” she said. “Early anti-inflammatory creams and medicines truly help prevent these serious endpoints of rosacea.”

In order to keep your rosacea under control, try avoiding triggers like heat and alcohol, wear sunscreen and find a treatment that works for you.

“Prescription creams or gels such as Rhofade, a new vasoconstrictor, or Finacea, an anti-inflammatory, help tremendously,” Marmur said. “Lasers that eliminate excess superficial blood vessels are also extremely effective.”",A Very Important Reason You Should Never Ignore Your Rosacea,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-scary-reason-you-should-never-ignore-your-rosacea_us_59cbfcdce4b05063fe0ebd59?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009

Η Angelina Jolie μίλησε μέσω email με τους The New York Times και ανέφερε ότι κατά την δεκαετία του '90 ο Weinstein τις είχε κάνει ορισμένες «προτάσεις» που η ίδια είχε αρνηθεί.

«Είχα μία κακή εμπειρία με τον Harvey Weinstein όταν ήμουν νέα, και ως αποτέλεσμα επέλεξα να μην δουλέψω ξανά μαζί του και να προειδοποιώ άλλους όταν το έκαναν. Αυτή η συμπεριφορά απέναντι στις γυναίκες, σε οποιοδήποτε τομέα, οποιαδήποτε χώρα, είναι απαράδεκτη.»

Την εμπειρία της μοιράστηκε και η Gwyneth Paltrow, η οποία ανέφερε ότι την κάλεσε ο ίδιος στη σουίτα του για μίτινγκ, λίγο αφού ο παραγωγός την προσέλαβε για τον πρωταγωνιστικό ρόλο στην ταινία «Emma», σε ηλικία 22 ετών.

Η Paltrow ισχυρίζεται ότι ο Weinstein, έβαλε τα χέρια του πάνω της προσπαθώντας να της κάνει μασάζ και την προσκάλεσε στο υπνοδωμάτιό του. Η Paltrow έφυγε αμέσως και είπε για το περιστατικό στον τότε σύντροφό της, Brad Pitt, ο οποίος σε μία πρεμιέρα πήγε στον γνωστό παραγωγό και του είπε να «μην ακουμπήσει την Paltrow ξανά». Ο Weinstein έγινε έξαλλος και για πολύ καιρό της φώναζε.

Η Rosanna Arquette, δήλωσε με τη σειρά της ότι μία φορά ο Weinstein της είχε ζητήσει να περάσει από το Beverly Hills Hotel για να πάρει το σενάριο και στη συνέχεια να ανέβει στο δωμάτιό της, όπου εκείνος της υποδέχτηκε με τη ρόμπα και παραπονέθηκε ότι πονάει ο αυχένας του, ζητώντας της να του κάνει μασέζ. Η Arquette προσπάθησε να του συστήσει μία επαγγελματία μασέρ, αλλά εκείνος άρπαξε το χέρι της και το πήγε κοντά στον καβάλο του. Η Arquette του είπε ότι δεν είναι «αυτό το κορίτσι» και έφυγε από το δωμάτιο.

Η Heather Graham δήλωσε ότι ο Weinstein την είχε καλέσει στο γραφείο του και της είχε προτείνει να κάνουν σεξ σε αντάλλαγμα για έναν ρόλο σε μία από τις ταινίες του.

Ακόμα και γυναίκες που δεν έχουν βιώσει σεξουαλική παρενόχληση από τον Weinstein, έχουν μιλήσει ανοιχτά για την υπόθεση.

Η Cate Blanchett που έχει συνεργαστεί με τον Weinstein δήλωσε:

«Κάθε άντρας σε θέση εξουσίας που νομίζει ότι είναι δικαίωμά του να απειλεί, εκφοβίζει ή να παρενοχλεί σεξουαλικά οποιαδήποτε γυναίκα που συναντά ή συνεργάζεται μαζί της, πρέπει να γίνεται υπόλογος. Δεν είναι ποτέ εύκολο για μία γυναίκα να βγαίνει μπροστά σε τέτοιες καταστάσεις και μέσα από την καρδιά μου υποστηρίζω εκείνες που το έχουν κάνει.»

Η Lena Dunham ζήτησε και από τους άντρες του Χόλιγουντ να μιλήσουν ανοιχτά:

«Είμαστε εδώ, μέρες αργότερα, περιμένοντας από του πιο ισχυρούς συνεργάτες του Weinstein να πουν κάτι. Οτιδήποτε. Δεν θα ήταν μόνο δώρο στις γυναίκες που έχουν πέσει θύματα,, αλλά και ένα μήνυμα σε όλες τις γυναίκες που βλέπουν από κοντά την βιομηχανία. Χρειάζονται ένα σημάδι ότι δεν εγκρίνουμε την κατάχρηση εξουσίας και το μίσος προς τις γυναίκες, που είναι η κινητήριος δύναμη πίσω από τέτοιου είδους συμπεριφορά».

Να σημειωθεί ότι ο George Clooney, έχει ήδη τοποθετηθεί σχετικά με το θέμα στο The Daily Beast.

«Δεν υπάρχει τίποτε να πει κανείς, πέρα από το ότι μπορεί να το υπερασπιστεί.»

Παραφωνία σε όλα τα παραπάνω σχόλια αποτελεί η δήλωση που έκανε η καλή φίλη του Weinstein, Donna Karan, και η οποία άφησε να εννοηθεί ότι μπορεί να έφταιγαν και οι ίδιες οι γυναίκες που «πήγαιναν γυρεύοντας».

Debbie Abrahams, the shadow work and pensions secretary, was condemning the Government’s use of a 0345 number for claimants - which HuffPost yesterday revealed could leave callers significantly out of pocket - when she was ensnared by LBC host Jim Diamond.

Abrahams was exercised about the 55p per minute call charges which Theresa May had been forced to defend during Prime Minister’s Questions on Wednesday, accusing the Conservatives of lacking “humanity”.

Labour MP tears into govt for using 0345 numbers, but is lost for words when LBC host tells her Labour use them too https://t.co/utRB2qxabJ — LBC (@LBC) October 12, 2017

“People can be racking up costs if they are using their mobile, if they don’t have a landline... at an average of £3.30 a call.

“Someone on a low-income to get the support they need to have to pay £3.30... that is a lot of money.”

Diamond then informed Abrahams that Labour uses an 0345 number for people wanting to sign up as members and asked, “if it is so bad” why does the party use it?

But as listeners were quick to point out, there was an easy defence for the Labour MP:

This is woeful. Didn’t it occur to her that Labour membership and claiming your benefits are two very different things? https://t.co/Im2QNfW7Zt — Stephen Bush (@stephenkb) October 12, 2017

A clearly flummoxed Abrahams replied: ” I don’t know. I think you make a very valid point. I had no idea about this and yes, we need to get our own house in order as well.”

When Diamond pushed her further, Abrahams tried to steer the conversation back to the Conservatives: “Lets not forget this is a Government programme and you’ve got me on here taking about this.”

After Diamond interjected to reaffirm his point, Abrahams concluded: “I agree with you. So can we move on.”

HuffPost tried contacting the government helpline on Wednesday and waited up to 12 and a half minutes to be answered in person. The call taker then refused to call us back straight away due to data protection rules.

Love and acceptance -- they're two of the things that the world can never have enough of.

Even prior to the ballots being delivered in the same sex marriage postal survey, the National Mental Health Commission released a statement expressing ""alarm"" at the detrimental mental health impacts of the marriage equality debate as ""damaging, emotive mistruths"" began to be spread about LGBTQ people by the 'No' campaign.

""I think fundamentally what's important is that we recognise everyone has dignity and everyone deserves to be treated equally,"" Atlassian's Head of Global Diversity and Inclusion, Aubrey Blanche, told HuffPost Australia.

""I think when you look at [marriage equality] from the lens of everyone needs a little bit more love in the world, then it seems like a pretty easy call to make.""

Atlassian staff donning their 'Love is Love' t-shirts.

But light projections aren't the only way Atlassian is rallying around their 'Outlassian' community -- they've also had a lot of internal initiatives that range from a rainbow bake sale (the proceeds of which went towards counselling services for LGBTQ individuals), staff donning 'Love is Love' t-shirts and an office with rainbow flags flying proudly.

""I will tell you that there's been more than a few tears of joy,"" Blanche said.

""The thing that resonates with me is when they [employees] say things like 'It's so hard right now but at least I can come to work', because they know [they belong] ... We use these symbols to communicate to them that they belong.""

Atlassian HQ will be lit up in support of marriage equality over the next week.



​At the heart of the company is a mission ""to unleash the potential in every team"" which starts from examining diversity at a grassroots level and working ""to do things that positively benefit the people around you"".

It's well known that the tech industry is a 'boy's club' -- in Australia women make up 46.3 percent of all employees, but only 28-31 percent occupy roles in technology -- and Atlassian is well aware that some of their female employees may sometimes feel isolated working in teams that lack a sense of community.

""With that insight [and] empirical knowledge, we were able over the last couple of years to invest in initiatives and programs ... so that they did have that feeling of belonging and that sense of community,"" she said.

To boost inclusivity, the company hosts initiatives like an informal 'coffee date' program where female employees are paired up and meet regularly for (you guessed it) coffee. There's also more formal peer mentoring and 'emerging leaders' programs that female employees can utilise.

As a result of specific programs and initiatives aimed at attracting Australia's top female talent, the multi-billion dollar enterprise said its proportion of female graduates jumped this year from 17 percent in 2016 to 55 percent.

""From what I've seen working in this space, one of the biggest things existing companies can do is to start showing off the amazing work that women in technology are already doing,"" Blanche said.

""When you lack a role model it's incredibly hard to choose a career path ... From a representation or numbers perspective -- what you've seen is two years ago we were hiring about 10 percent of women into our technical role and we've seen an 80 percent improvement.

The multi-billion dollar software enterprise has seen incredible growth in the representation of women in leadership.

""We've also seen incredible growth especially in the representation of women in leadership -- more than a third of the leaders brought on in the last year were women.""

Like everything though, the company isn't perfect -- and it acknowledges that. Indeed, Blanche knows that it's always important to be brutally honest while remaining committed to learning about initiatives that have worked and letting go of those that haven't.

La missive du député du Vaucluse, cosignée par 16 de ses collègues des Républicains, 11 hommes et 5 femmes, fait suite à la parution, aux éditions Hatier, d'un manuel scolaire ""Découvrir le monde"" de CE2, utilisant cette écriture.

M. Aubert demande au ministre ""la prohibition de cette pratique"" dans les manuels scolaires, pour ""empêcher la propagation de l'écriture inclusive dans les livres de nos enfants"", poursuit le député.

Interrogé sur le sujet fin septembre, le ministre Jean-Michel Blanquer avait jugé ""questionnable"" l'utilisation de cette écriture dans des manuels: ""que cette liberté soit offerte dans la vie démocratique courante, ça me paraît compréhensible. A l'école je suis plus réservé (...) quand je vois les difficultés qu'on a à bien consolider la lecture"" chez les élèves.

Un outil pour lutter contre les stéréotypes

L'écriture inclusive est un outil destiné à lutter contre les stéréotypes liés aux sexes et les inégalités entre les femmes et les hommes. Son caractère le plus visible est l'accord des noms et des adjectifs au féminin et au masculin lorsque c'est possible. Par exemple, les phrases ""les électeurs et les électrices votent"" et ""les électeur.trice.s votent"" sont rédigés en écriture inclusive. Contrairement à la ""novlangue"" d'Orwell, ce type d'écriture n'a aucun caractère obligatoire.

La lettre de M.

Ο επικεφαλής του Facebook Μαρκ Ζούκερμπεργκ αποκάλυψε τη νέα αυτόνομη συσκευή εικονικής πραγματικότητας Oculus Go, η οποία δεν απαιτεί σύνδεση σε υπολογιστή όπως το Oculus Rift, κάτι που ο ίδιος ελπίζει ότι θα διευκολύνει την εξάπλωση της νέας αυτής τεχνολογίας στο ευρύ κοινό.



Η νέα συσκευή, σύμφωνα με τα πρακτορεία Γαλλικό και Ρόιτερς, θα κοστίζει 199 δολάρια και θα αρχίσει να πωλείται στην αρχή του 2018.



Όπως είπε ο επικεφαλής του Facebook, η νέα συσκευή αποτελεί το πρώτο προϊόν που προσφέρει εμπειρία εικονικής πραγματικότητας χωρίς να απαιτεί ούτε τη σύνδεσή της μέσω καλωδίου με έναν επιτραπέζιο υπολογιστή, ούτε το συνδυασμό της με ένα «έξυπνο» κινητό τηλέφωνο για να λειτουργήσει.



Το Oculus Go χρησιμοποιεί εσωτερικές κάμερες, αισθητήρες και ειδικό λογισμικό για να καταγράφει τις σωματικές κινήσεις, οι οποίες «μεταφράζονται» σε κινήσεις στους εικονικούς κόσμους που βλέπει ο χρήστης.



Ο Ζούκερμπεργκ δήλωσε ότι στόχος του είναι «να φέρουμε ένα δισεκατομμύριο ανθρώπους στην εικονική πραγματικότητα. Ο δρόμος δεν θα είναι εύκολος, αλλά η εικονική πραγματικότητα θα αλλάξει τον τρόπο που βλέπουμε τον κόσμο και θα κάνει τις ζωές μας πολύ καλύτερες».



H Sony, η HTC και η Oculus (που εξαγοράσθηκε από το Facebook το 2014 αντί 3 δισ. δολαρίων) είναι προς το παρόν οι σημαντικότεροι «παίκτες» στην αγορά προσωπικών συσκευών εικονικής πραγματικότητας. Η Google προσφέρει τη συσκευή Google Daydream που χρησιμοποιείται σε συνδυασμό με ορισμένα smartphones.



Η Oculus ανακοίνωσε επίσης ότι, παράλληλα με την κυκλοφορία του Oculus Go, θα μειώσει από 499 σε 399 δολάρια την τιμή του Oculus Rift, που είχε κυκλοφορήσει το 2016. Σύμφωνα με την εταιρεία ερευνών Super Data, αναμένεται φέτος να πωληθούν 213.000 συσκευές Oculus Rift έναντι 305.000 συσκευών Vive της HTC.

Im Video oben erklären wir euch, wie das biologisch gesehen funktioniert

Beim Zungenkuss tauschen Menschen Speichel miteinander aus und noch dazu etwa 80 Millionen verschiedene Bakterien. Das klingt alles andere als appetitlich und schon gar nicht romantisch. Aber warum küssen sich Menschen dann eigentlich so gerne mit Zunge?

Forscher haben dafür verschiedene Erklärungen gefunden. Die am weitesten verbreitete lautet: Beim Küssen können wir einschätzen, ob die andere Person gesund und fruchtbar ist. Denn unbewusst nehmen wir die Hormone unseres Kusspartners wahr. Daraus leiten wir ab, ob der andere Mensch zu uns passt.

Vor allem Testosteron ist gut aus dem Speichel des Partners zu erkennen. Das geschieht über Nase und Mund. Die Anthropologin Helen Fisher vermutet, dass Männer beim Küssen ihr Testosteron an die Frau übertragen wollen, um deren Sexualtrieb zu erhöhen.

Möglicherweise ist es nur eine Angewohnheit

Biologisch notwendig ist der Zungenkuss jedoch nicht. Shelly Volsche, Professorin für kulturelle Anthropologie an der University of Las Vegas im US-Bundesstaat Nevada fand heraus, dass Menschen, die keine Zungenküsse kennen, stattdessen an ihren Gesichtern knabbern oder diese aneinander kuscheln.

Das Team um die Professorin stellte fest, dass es den Zungenkuss gerade einmal in 46 Prozent aller menschlichen Kulturen gibt - und nicht, wie die Forscher erwartet hatten, in 90 Prozent.

Möglicherweise küssen sich viele Menschen also nur mit Zunge, weil es eine kulturelle Angewohnheit geworden ist. Oder - und diese Erklärung ist ein bisschen schöner - einfach nur, um zu zeigen, wie sehr sie sich mögen.

Ce jeudi 12 octobre, le tribunal de grande instance de Nanterre a débouté ""de toutes ses demandes"" Salah Abdeslam dans le litige qui l'opposait au député Les Républicains Thierry Solère.

Ce dernier accusait l'élu des Hauts-de-Seine d'avoir porté atteinte à sa vie privée, en décrivant notamment dans le Journal du dimanche ses conditions de détention en isolement qu'il avait pu apercevoir sur des vidéos de surveillance. Salah Abdeslam est en effet le seul détenu de France à bénéficier d'une vidéosurveillance permanente. Une mesure de sécurité dont il s'était déjà plaint, arguant qu'il avait lui aussi droit à la vie privée, comme tout détenu. Cependant, au vu de l'importance et de la sensibilité du dossier dans lequel il est impliqué, la justice a décidé de maintenir cette mesure exceptionnelle. Le cas du jihadiste est donc particulier, mais qu'en est-il de la vie privée des autres détenus?

Difficile de préserver un peu d'intimité lorsque l'on partage sa cellule où lorsque celle-ci est fouillée par les gardiens. Si les détenus ne sont pas, eux, sous surveillance vidéo constante, ils ont d'autres problématiques liées à leur vie privée. Et celles-ci varient en fonction des régimes de détention et des catégories de condamnation, nous explique une source pénitentiaire. Un meurtrier multirécidiviste aura évidemment moins de libertés qu'un homme incarcéré pour fraude fiscale. Tout comme des détenus jugés définitivement ont souvent plus de libertés que des prévenus en maison d'arrêt en attente de jugement.

""Les distinctions pour ce type de questions se font au cas par cas, les textes sont très flous en ce qui concerne la vie privée des individus en milieu carcéral. Le but étant de maintenir la sécurité au sein de l'établissement"", explique au HuffPost une porte-parole de l'Observatoire international des prisons. Sans compter les fouilles de cellules et la promiscuité quotidienne des autres détenus, la vie privée des personnes incarcérées - dont certains leur dénient même le droit - est mise à mal, en particulier lorsqu'il s'agit d'interagir avec l'extérieur.

Inspection du contenu des lettres envoyées et reçues

Correspondre par lettres est un droit fondamental reconnu aux détenus. Même lorsque l'un d'eux est en cellule de discipline et n'a plus droit aux visites au parloir, les lettres sont toujours autorisées. Tous peuvent envoyer et recevoir des courriers, quelle que soit la personne et quelle que soit la fréquence. Toutefois, les missives sont susceptibles d'être lues n'importe quand, à l'envoi comme à la réception, par le vaguemestre, personnel de la prison en charge de l'inspection des courriers.

Pour les prévenus, qui sont en attente de jugement, elles sont même relues par le magistrat en charge du dossier. En effet, celles-ci peuvent receler des informations pouvant compromettre le bon déroulé de l'enquête, voire contenir de nouveaux éléments susceptibles de la faire avancer. Cependant, seuls les échanges épistolaires avec l'avocat, l'aumônier et certaines autorités administratives et judiciaires bénéficient du secret de la correspondance.

Certaines lettres peuvent même être retenues et n'arrivent jamais à destination. ""Imaginez qu'un détenu envoie le plan d'une partie de la prison. L'administration pénitentiaire ne peut évidemment pas la laisser passer. Mais cela peut aussi concerner des échanges avec d'anciens détenus, si le chef d'établissement pense que ça peut nuire à la réinsertion"", explique la porte-parole de l'OIP. Enfin, le chef d'établissement peut interdire la correspondance d'un détenu avec certaines personnes lorsqu'elle paraît ""compromettre gravement la réinsertion ou la sécurité et le bon ordre de l'établissement"", selon les Articles 145-4, D.65 et D.414 du Code de procédure pénale. ""Ça c'est dans les textes. Dans la réalité, les détenus craignent tous les jours que leurs lettres ne soient pas envoyées, même celles aux contenus anodins. Normalement lorsqu'elles sont retenues on est censé les avertir, mais je ne sais pas si c'est vraiment fait systématiquement"", précise la porte-parole de l'OIP.

Les appels téléphoniques sur écoute

Si les échanges épistolaires sont un droit fondamental en prison, il n'en va pas de même pour les appels téléphoniques. Le régime d'utilisation du téléphone varie selon les individus. Seuls les condamnés incarcérés dans les établissements pour peines et ceux placés dans les centres pour peines aménagées peuvent être autorisés à téléphoner. La fréquence peut varier d'une fois par mois à plusieurs fois par semaine selon les établissements. Mais une fois encore, les appels sont sur écoute afin de contrôler ce qui est transmis à l'extérieur de la prison. Exit donc l'intimité lors des entretiens conjugaux et familiaux. L'intimité des détenus se partage alors avec le conjoint, la famille ... et le gardien de prison qui est à l'écoute.

Et c'est notamment à cause de ce manque de vie privée que l'on voit la recrudescence des téléphones mobiles illégaux dans l'enceinte des structures pénitentiaires. ""Les détenus se procurent ces téléphones pour pouvoir parler librement à leur famille, avoir un peu d'intimité avec leur conjoint et ne pas être constamment sous surveillance"", assure l'OIP.

Selon cette dernière, ce point met également en lumière un autre aspect de cette surveillance rapprochée. ""Les lettres sont lues, les appels sont sur écoute... Evidemment, les détenus s'autocensurent dans ce qu'ils disent parce qu'ils savent que ce qu'ils racontent peut se retourner contre eux. La personne qui lit -ce n'est jamais la même et le prisonnier ne sait pas qui elle est- est censée garder secret de ce qui est lu, (dans le cas où elle ne comporte rien de suspect). Mais ce n'est pas toujours le cas. Alors il est très facile de faire pression sur l'auteur de la lettre"", explique la porte-parole.

Les visites également sur écoute, mais il existe de (rares) havres de paix

Les détenus ont droit de recevoir des visites au parloir, bien que la fréquence et le contexte varient selon les détenus. Pour un condamné ""dangereux"", le parloir avec une paroi vitrée sera privilégié. Pour d'autres, cela peut se passer dans des boxes. Mais dans les deux cas, les discussions sont susceptibles d'être mises sur écoute par un gardien. Il n'y a qu'un lieu où le détenu et sa famille peuvent échapper aux oreilles indiscrètes: les unités de visites familiales.

""Ce sont des appartements dans l'enceinte de la prison où les condamnés peuvent être avec leur famille, sans surveillance ni écoute, pendant une durée allant jusqu'à 72 heures. Mais même si tous les détenus sont censés y avoir droit, il y en a très peu en France et donc peu de personnes peuvent en profiter"", nous explique une source pénitentiaire. Au 1er mai 2015, seuls 26 établissements sur 187 étaient pourvus d'unités de visites familiales, pour un total de 83 sur le territoire.

Federal government pressures kills off pill testing at Spilt Milk.","A progressive pill testing trial that was to be implemented for this year's Spilt Milk music festival in Canberra along with the support of the ACT government will reportedly no longer be happening after a testing advisory body was unable to provide event organisers with relevant documentation in time.

In a post to Facebook on Thursday night, event organisers from management group Kicks Entertainment said planning, risk assessment, insurance and legal framework documents were not provided by the Safety Testing Advisory Service at Festivals and Events (STA-SAFE), a collaborative body of health organisations who were behind the pill testing trial, in time for a festival licence application to be lodged with the federal National Capital Authority (NCA).

#BREAKING Aus-first trial of pill testing at a music festival will no longer go ahead after the organisers of Spilt Milk pulled out — Avani (@AvaniDias) October 12, 2017

Due to the fact that the Spilt Milk festival is held at Commonwealth Park, which is land owned by the Federal Government, STA-SAFE needed to meet the NCA festival licence application deadline in order for pill testing to be approved and included as an aspect of the event.

""Since the ACT Government's progressive announcement that pill testing would be conducted by STA-SAFE at this year's Spilt Milk event, we have been awaiting STA-SAFE's operational plan, associated risk assessment, insurance and legal framework for their trialling of pill testing on federal land,"" the post said.

""With these items not yet received, and Spilt Milk just six weeks away, we had to submit 2017 event operation planning without STA-SAFE's pill testing to the NCA, the owner of the land on which Spilt Milk takes place. We had to do this to ensure everything necessary was in place for the event to take place on the 25th of November.

""Unfortunately, what this means is that pill testing is not able to be trialled at this year's event. We are hugely disappointed as Spilt Milk strongly supports pill testing as a harm minimisation measure, but we would be more disappointed for this hugely complicated and important issue to be handled incorrectly and result in a trial that doesn't institute change in Australia.""

In September, it was confirmed that the ACT government had thrown its support behind the trial, with pills that were brought to the testing service expected to be examined by emergency consultant Dr David Caldicott and a team of chemists from the Australian National University (ANU).

On Thursday night, a spokesperson for the ACT Government told HuffPost Australia in a statement the absence of pill testing at the festival is ""disappointing"".

""This is a disappointing decision. The ACT Government, through the risk assessment process we undertook, determined that pill testing was appropriate to reduce the harm of individuals engaging in recreational drug use,"" the spokesperson said.

""This was the opportunity to hold the safest festival in Australia. We will be looking into whether we can provide any further information before any final decisions are made.""

Pill testing at Spilt Milk festival wont go ahead. What devastating news for HR and saving lives. Keep at it @ShaneRattenbury @ReGenUC — FFDLR (@FFDLR) October 12, 2017

And while the trial was heralded as a win for harm reduction among festival patrons, Gino Vumbaca, the president and co-founder of Harm Reduction Australia -- the parent body behind STA-SAFE -- confirmed to HuffPost Australia that the advisory body had only been made aware by the NCA of additional documentation requirements on Wednesday, and then 24 hours later were told it had missed the deadline.

""We were asked for all that information yesterday. The promoter was asked to provide that to the NCA at short notice. We're still working on that documentation and still working on getting it altogether,"" Vumbaca said.

""We understand the pressures that are on the promoter to get approvals. We understand that the festival was in jeopardy without that documentation but the reality is that the NCA provided a very unrealistic time-frame for us to get that information to them.""

""The ACT government is committed to pill testing at the festival, we're committed to doing it and so we'll do it -- if not at this [year's festival], the next one. It will happen.""

Despite this, comments from the ACT Shadow Minister for Health Vicki Dunne in August threw doubt over the future of the program after she said that she was uncertain on whether the Federal government would give its approval.

""There is serious doubt as to whether the government can or should be implementing pill testing,"" she told Parliament.

""The Spilt Milk festival is at Commonwealth Park, which is on Commonwealth land. Pill testing will need Commonwealth Government approval, and I doubt that they will give it.""

This is pretty crap news. Federal government pressures kills off pill testing at Spilt Milk. https://t.co/FeylLtpDoF — David Shoebridge (@ShoebridgeMLC) October 12, 2017

Adults have an instinctive need to protect children. It is a worthy goal, but when adults begin to sanitise the world children are exposed to, it is analogous to keeping them in a sterile environment. They are deprived of a chance to develop, and to understand the world. Sanitising stories of things that are uncomfortable to discuss begs the question: what are we protecting the child from? Is there an appropriate age, for example, at which to let children learn that grown-ups like becoming close friends, dating, falling in love, marrying each other, separating from a partner, not necessarily in that order? Whether we wish it or not, children see these things all around them and interpret their place or value in their own lives, in their own way.

Children are not simple. In his book The Uses of Enchantment, Bruno Bettelheim tells us how fairy tales play a crucial role in relieving the subconscious pressures a child faces but is unable to recognise or articulate. The child does this by projecting onto these stories and characters the emotions they feel. Fairy tales of substance are for that very reason not sanitised of the darker or deeper aspects of our lives that are a very real, unavoidable part of growing up. This also subliminally prepares children for what lies ahead. In the world of Harry Potter, which children are able to enter and inhabit with ease, unfairness and death is a constant presence. JK Rowling also revealed that she had always envisioned a complex and well-loved character in Harry Potter as being gay after a generation of children had grown up surrounded by all of the characters in the books.

We see that often it is adults who read too much into the nature of stories and characters, while children are not given credit for the open-mindedness with which they accept them.

A child—any child—has moments of feeling confused and lonely. Imagine the confusion and fear for those children who do not find characters like themselves reflected in stories they read: 'am I the only one who feels this way?' And as they read more stories all of which are sanitised, the confusion and fear grows: 'is there something odd about me? This is certainly true of children who know at a very young age that they are different from others, but this could also be true for a child at a later stage of growing up.

Queer children should be able to find quirky, colourful, even lovable characters who, like themselves, are different in one crucial aspect of who they are.

Here is what is at the heart of this piece — we never know who a child is going to be. Pigeonholing does not work well for people in general and particularly not for children, who have plastic minds and personalities that defy the taxonomy of 'straight' 'bi' or 'gay'. I call 'queer' or 'questioning' any child who feels the need either to expand definitions of gender (some prefer the term 'gender-expansive') or to push against the boundaries of who they are allowed to find attractive. Queer children should be able to find quirky, colourful, even lovable characters who, like themselves, are different in one crucial aspect of who they are. It is important that we make accessible to them books that have such characters in them.

In her 1990 article 'Mirrors, Windows, and Sliding Glass Doors' Rudine Sims Bishop says: ""When children cannot find themselves reflected in the books they read, or when the images they see are distorted, negative, or laughable, they learn a powerful lesson about how they are devalued in the society of which they are a part."" It is one thing to be able to see queer characters in films or on television as children today can, but in reading children are able to know those characters at their own pace, in a deeper and far more sensitive way. There is a strong need to have queer characters in children's stories, queer literature in children's libraries—meant not just for queer kids but all kids—or even to create children's queer libraries. For a child to know, for instance, that it is possible for them to express their gender as they experience it, or to feel deeply for a person of any gender, whether those feelings go on to be physically expressed or not once they grow up, is a reassurance that is priceless.

Such books do exist. Princess Princess Ever After by Katie O'Neill and King and King by Linda de Haan and Stern Nijland queer the usual pairing of different-gender royal couples by having same-gender ones live happily ever after. The Boy & the Bindi by the Toronto-based writer Vivek Shraya is about a young Indian boy's fascination with his mother's bindi, who doesn't chastise him for wearing one. One of a Kind, Like Me by Laurin Mayeno is the story of Danny, who knows exactly what he will be in tomorrow's school parade: a princess. He and his mom race to a thrift store to find him a costume.

In two articles on bookriot.com, Kelly Jensen has listed 26 English-language LGBTQ books for middle-school children while adding that some of these books are either out of print or hard to find in print format. Some with different strands of queerness are: The Boy in the Dress by David Williams, about a boy who among various interests like soccer also enjoys wearing dresses; George by Alex Gino and Gracefully Grayson by Ami Polonsky, each about a child who knows she's a girl inside but is seen by everyone else as a boy. The Other Boy by M.G. Hennessey is about a trans boy who is threatened by a classmate with having his secret revealed. In Kiss by Jacqueline Wilson, a girl has a crush on a boy, but he is interested in another boy. When he kisses him resulting in gay-bashing, she and another friend try to protect his feelings.

Noddy and Big Ears who share a house and a bed got censored in England. George in The Famous Five is fairly clearly 'different.' So are the main characters in the Wizard of Oz

Books need not be exclusively or explicitly classified as ""LGBTQ"" either for a queer child to identify with the characters. Such books may still face opposition for addressing or including queerness. Ruth Vanita, the author who has extensively researched queer representation, draws attention to characters in children's literature ""who are now read as gay and even get censored for that. For example, Noddy and Big Ears who share a house and a bed got censored in England. George in The Famous Five is fairly clearly 'different.' So are the main characters in the Wizard of Oz, barring Dorothy. The two lead characters in the children's Hindi comics and videos, Motu Patlu, are single and live together, sometimes sharing a bed. In other words,"" she concludes, ""before the current labels there were plenty of such 'different' characters.""

Queerness, in the sense of outside the normative, can also include such realities as alternate family structures or intense friendships between children of the same gender. In Heather Has Two Mommies by Leslea Newman, Heather and her classmates draw their respective families - and no two look the same. An article by Mridula Chari talks about the challenges facing such books in India while listing some of them: Shals Mahajan's Timmi in Tangles touches on families with single parents. Balaji Venkataraman's Flat Track Bullies has a child who takes off over the summer holiday to spend time with Durai, the son of his family's domestic help. These books are important milestones in Indian children's literature, but it must be remembered that they are few and far between, and the ones mentioned here are restricted to English language publishing. They would be a welcome addition to any library, and there are many shelves to be filled.

A queer book can be a place for confession and validation. In there lie the possibilities of a communion between just the child and the book.

How is a queer-inclusive library to be envisioned? It would mean, for one, a place where adults are more supportive than not. No child is kept from reading a particular age-appropriate book because an adult doesn't approve of the story. Nor are they scolded for reading something related to bodies, gender and sexuality, as happens all too often. Adults don't realise that such attitudes result in an internalised fear in children of talking about these things and they end up becoming more vulnerable to abuse. As it is growing up is a lonely experience for kids who feel they do not fit in. A queer book can be a place for confession and validation. In there lie the possibilities of a communion between just the child and the book. It is in there that the child may whisper little secrets, secrets that do not face the danger of being betrayed or exploited. A queer library would also make accessible these books to children of parents who cannot afford to buy them but are open to them.

Finally, why should a 'straight' child read such stories, some may ask. As Danika Ellis says in her wonderful article Kids Need Queer Books, ""Because some kids are queer. And those kids who aren't will be sharing a planet with people who are."" It is no secret that children learn to make value judgments about markers of identities: skin colour, food habits, class, caste, relationships. It is in childhood that we learn the process of 'othering' and so, in childhood that the interventions must begin. By crossing these seemingly insurmountable barriers of talking about non-normative gender identities or same-gender desire, we can normalise them and start to make a difference in the attitudes and lives of children.

The very act of reading stories written and illustrated especially for children is one of the children identifying with the characters or creatures in the book, empathising with their experiences. Children will have to live among all sorts of people--queer, disabled or of a different faith. If a child is told the story of two princes who kiss, or two women who together bring up a child, they will be the better for it. The question: 'Is there something odd about me?' may happily disappear in the shelves of the queer-inclusive library.

A two-judge bench of the Supreme Court has ruled that sex between a man and his minor wife would constitute rape under the Indian Penal Code.

Justices Madan B Lokur and Deepak Gupta said today that the exception in Section 375, the law against rape in the IPC, is discriminatory, capricious and arbitrary. The exception states: ""Sexual intercourse by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under fifteen years of age, is not rape.""

The court ruled that lowering the legal age for sex to 15 only because the minor was married violated the Constitution of India. ""If a man has sexual intercourse with a wife who is below 18 years, it is an offence. The minor wife can complain against the husband within one year,"" the judges said.

""The exception in rape law under the IPC is contrary to other statutes, violates bodily integrity of girl child,"" they said.

Under Indian law, sex with a minor (below 18) is a crime. Until today, the only exception to the law was if the minor was a wife. The exception also ran contrary to the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) which criminalizes sex with minors as rape.

The judgment outlawing sex with a minor wife could have a significant impact on curtailing child marriages. The apex court also urged the Indian government to take more initiative in preventing child marriages in the country. The judges observed that social justice laws are not being implemented with the spirit in which they were enacted.

The Supreme Court clarified that it had not ruled on marital rape.

The ruling today was the result of a petition filed by Independent Thought, a Noida based NGO, which challenged the exception under Section 375 as being violative of fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution.

HuffPost-Autor Sebastian Christ schreibt, warum er Air Berlin vermissen wird

Liebe Air Berlin!

Meine Facebook-Timeline ist voll mit Abschiedspostings. Es ist die Zeit der letzten Air-Berlin-Flüge. Ich finde es rührend, was da zu lesen ist: Viele meiner Freunde sprechen dem Personal ein letztes Mal Mut zu und wünschen ihnen alles Gute für den Weg in eine ungewisse Zukunft.

Jetzt, da eine Ära vorbei geht, scheint das geschäftige Treiben an den Flughäfen dieser Republik, zwischen Rollkoffern und Businessanzügen, plötzlich menschliche Züge zu bekommen. Das ist ein gutes Zeichen.

Andere schreiben wehmütig über den Geschmack der Schokoherzchen, die es früher beim Aussteigen gab. Zugegeben, ich fand die Teile auch lecker. Aber sie sind so ziemlich das Unwichtigste, was ich an Air Berlin vermissen werde.

Früher war Fliegen noch außergewöhnlich

Seit Donnerstag ist klar, dass Air Berlin größtenteils von der Lufthansa übernommen wird. Damit dürfte sich der Flugverkehr, so wie wir ihn kennen, radikal ändern. Jeder, der das Fliegen noch in den 1990er-Jahren erlebt hat, dürfte da eine Vorahnung haben.

Ich habe meinen ersten Flug in einem Linienjet erst mit 22 Jahren machen können. Dabei hatte ich weder Flugangst noch war ich jemand, der keine Lust aufs Reisen hatte. Ich konnte mir es schlicht und einfach nicht leisten, für mittlere Strecken ein Flugticket zu erwerben.

Bis vor etwa 20 Jahren war Fliegen etwas Besonderes, wenn es um innerdeutsche Strecken ging. Preise von 600 oder 800 Mark für ein Flugticket von Hamburg nach München waren damals nichts Außergewöhnliches, sondern eher etwas ganz Normales.

Das war etwas für Geschäftsreisende, deren Firmen bereit waren, teures Geld dafür zu bezahlen, um fähige Fachkräfte von A nach B zu transportieren. Aber kein echtes Konkurrenzangebot für die Bahn, die damals noch staatlich-gemächlich durch Deutschland zockelte.

Das Aufkommen preisgünstiger Flugangebote hat vieles verändert: bisweilen sogar die Infrastruktur unserer Städte. Vor allem aber die Art und Weise, wie wir reisen.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Luftfahrtunternehmer Niki Lauda kritisiert die Übernahme von Air Berlin durch die Lufthansa

Du warst bei allem der Dreh- und Angelpunkt

Es ist heute kein Problem mehr, morgens in Stuttgart und nachmittags in Hamburg zu sein. Es gibt heute sogar Studenten, die Fernbeziehungen per Flugzeug führen – weil man es sich leisten kann, am Freitagmorgen von Berlin nach Köln zu fliegen, und am Sonntagnachmittag wieder zurück. Vorausgesetzt, man bucht rechtzeitig.

Und Du, Air Berlin, warst bei allem der Dreh- und Angelpunkt. Wahrscheinlich beschäftigt Dein Niedergang auch deswegen so viele Menschen: Wenn die Lufthansa für die Fernreisenden ein Stück Alltagskultur geworden war, warst Du es für die Kurz- und Mittelstrecken.

Und wenn wir schon über die Lufthansa sprechen: Genau da fängt das Problem an. Außer Germanwings und Eurowings gibt es sonst auf dem deutschen Markt keine größeren Billigfluganbieter mehr. Beide Gesellschaften gehören zu Lufthansa. Und die schluckt jetzt eben auch noch Air Berlin.

Um das ganze mal mit Fakten zu illustrieren: Im Juni 2017 belegten die nunmehr vier Fluglinien der Lufthansa die Plätze eins bis vier nach Abflugzahlen in Deutschland. Gut 46.200 Flüge gehen auf das Konto des Lufthansa-Imperiums. Auf Platz fünf folgt dann Ryanair mit 4.600 Abflügen.

Man muss kein Wirtschaftswissenschaftler sein, um an dieser Stelle eine Gefahr für den Wettbewerb zu sehen.

Uns droht eine Saure-Gurken-Zeit

Billigflüge könnten künftig wieder zu etwas werden, was in der Nische stattfindet. Zumindest hätte die Lufthansa die nötige Marktmacht, um das durchzusetzen.

Das hätte nicht nur Folgen für den Flugverkehr.

Denn auch die Bahn hat sich unter dem zunehmenden Druck von Seiten des Flugverkehrs in den vergangenen 20 Jahren zusehends modernisiert. In einigen Wochen zum Beispiel wird die Strecke von Berlin nach München für den Personenverkehr freigegeben: Dann wird man in vier Stunden von der Hauptstadt nach Süddeutschland fahren können.

Solche Trassen werden nicht gebaut, um den Bussen Konkurrenz machen zu können. Sondern, weil die Bahn gegen den Flugverkehr ankommen will. Vier Stunden – das ist durchaus eine wettbewerbsfähige Fahrtzeit. Leider bietet die Bahn viel zu wenige dieser Verbindungen an.

Im Gegensatz zu Frankreich übrigens. Dort war es offensichtlich möglich, ein Hochgeschwindigkeitsnetz für die Schiene aufzubauen. In Deutschland droht uns nach dem Wegfall der Konkurrenz aus der Luft eine neue Saure-Gurken-Zeit.

Auch deswegen werde ich Dich vermissen, Air Berlin. Es geht nicht um die Schokoherzen – sondern darum, einem bisweilen recht schwerfälligen Land den Mut zur Veränderung schmackhaft zu machen. Doch leider könnten wir uns bald schon wieder in Reisewelten befinden, die ein wenig streng nach den 90er-Jahren müffeln.

Il presidente brasiliano Michel Temer avrebbe deciso - secondo quanto riportano i media locali - di revocare l'asilo politico all'ex terrorista dei Pac (Proletari armati comunisti) condannato, in Italia, all'ergastolo per quattro omicidi. Ora l'ultima parola spetta però al Supremo tribunale federale (Stf), chiamato a decidere se accettare o meno il riconoscimento dell'habeas corpus (l'istituto giuridico a tutela delle libertà individuali) invocato dai legali dell'ex terrorista nel settembre scorso, quando l'Italia era tornata a sollecitare l'estradizione. E reiterato solo pochi giorni fa, quando Battisti era stato arrestato a Corumba, nel nord della Bolivia, in quello che molti hanno letto come un tentativo di fuga dal Brasile per sfuggire alla possibile procedura di rientro in Italia.

""Mi consegnano alla morte"" è il primo commento di Battisti, ""non so su cosa si voglia basare il gabinetto giuridico della presidenza brasiliana perché io possa essere estradato. Non so se il Brasile voglia macchiarsi sapendo che il Governo e media hanno creato questo mostro in Italia"". Battisti ribadisce che il suo arresto è stato una montatura, una trappola brasiliana.

Secondo fonti vicine a Temer citate dai media brasiliani, se Luis Fux, il magistrato dell'alta corte che deve esaminare il caso, tardasse troppo nel prendere una decisione, l'ufficio legale della presidenza potrebbe emettere un parere ufficiale che renderebbe inevitabile l'estradizione di Battisti verso l'Italia. Le stesse fonti hanno spiegato che comunque ""l'opzione meno probabile"" è che il Stf conceda all'ex terrorista l'habeas corpus.

La difesa di Battisti è convinta che il presidente brasiliano rispetterà le regole e non consegnerà all'Italia l'ex terrorista dei Pac. ""La revisione della decisione presidenziale è impossibile a cause del lasso di tempo e del fatto che non esiste alcun difetto nella conclusione finale, come riconosciuto dallo stesso Tribunale supremo federale"", hanno affermato i legali parlando con la stampa brasiliana. Inoltre, secondo gli avvocati, ""la prescrizione della richiesta punitiva per i reati attribuiti (a Battisti) nel Paese di nascita impedisce anche la sua estradizione"". ""Si spera - hanno concluso - che il presidente della Repubblica, noto docente di diritto costituzionale rispetti le leggi brasiliane, anche a fronte delle pressioni politiche interne ed esterne"".

La vicenda ha avuto degli sviluppi inattesi mercoledì della scorsa settimana in seguito all'arresto di Battisti al confine boliviano per sospetto traffico di valuta e riciclaggio. Anche se un giudice d'appello gli ha concesso la libertà provvisoria, per mancanza di prove, nel governo brasiliano si è fatta strada l'idea che un crimine di natura fiscale potesse rafforzare le motivazioni giuridiche per la sua estradizione in Italia. E molti avevano scommesso sulla decisione di Temer di annullare l'asilo politico concesso all'ex membro dei Proletari armati per il comunismo nel 2010 dall'ex presidente Lula.

Battisti, intanto, è tornato nella sua casa sul lungomare di San Paolo dopo tre giorni di carcere nel Mato Grosso. Visibilmente soddisfatto, con tanto di birra in mano immortalata dai fotografi, anche se con l'obbligo di non lasciare la zona senza autorizzazione della giustizia e di presentarsi ogni mese in tribunale.

Fonti diplomatiche italiane pur ricordando che l'esito della vicenda al momento non è ancora scontato, alla luce del pendente ricorso giurisdizionale al Stf, ricordano che c'è piena fiducia nel governo brasiliano con il quale si intende rilanciale le già ottime relazioni. Il governo italiano nei mesi scorsi è tornato alla carica con la richiesta formale alle autorità brasiliane, affidata dal ministro degli Esteri Angelino Alfano all'ambasciatore a Brasilia, di riavviare le procedure per l'estradizione di Battisti.",Cesare Battisti un passo più vicino all'estradizione.

Η επιγραφή είναι πολύ μεγάλη, και ο Μέλααρτ δεν μπορούσε να διαβάσει, πόσο μάλλον να διαβάσει λουβικά, όπως τονίζουν στο paper τους.","Μία πέτρινη πλάκα 3.200 ετών, η οποία φέρει επιγραφή που αναφέρεται σε έναν πρίγκιπα της Τροίας και πιθανώς στους μυστηριώδεις «Λαούς της Θάλασσας» (οι επιδρομές των οποίων θεωρείται πως έπαιξαν σημαντικό ρόλο στην κατάρρευση των πολιτισμών της Εποχής του Χαλκού στην ανατολική Μεσόγειο) αποκρυπτογραφήθηκε από αρχαιολόγους.

Όπως αναφέρεται σε δημοσίευμα του LiveScience, η επιγραφή, μήκους 29 μέτρων, περιγράφει την άνοδο ενός ισχυρού βασιλείου, ονόματι Μίρα, το οποίο πραγματοποίησε μια στρατιωτική εκστρατεία με επικεφαλής έναν πρίγκιπα από την Τροία, ονόματι Μούξους.

Η επιγραφή είναι γραμμένη στη Λουβική γλώσσα- τη γλώσσα του λαού των Λουβίων, για τους οποίους τα ερωτηματικά εξακολουθούν να είναι πολλά: Ενδεικτικά, μόλις γύρω στους 20 μελετητές ανά τον κόσμο είναι σε θέση να τη διαβάσουν σήμερα, Μεταξύ αυτών η Φρεντ Γουντχούιζεν, ανεξάρτητος ερευνητής, ο οποίος κατάφερε να αποκρυπτογραφήσει ένα αντίγραφο της επιγραφής.

Ο Γουντχούιζεν και ο Έμπερχαρντ Ζάνγκερ, γεωαρχαιολόγος και πρόεδρος του Ιδρύματος Λουβικών Μελετών, θα προβούν σε αναλυτικές δημοσιεύσεις τον Δεκέμβριο, στο Proceedings of the Dutch Archaeological and Historical Society. Όπως αναφέρει το LiveScience, αν η επιγραφή είναι αυθεντική παρέχει μια πολύτιμη ματιά σε μια περίοδο κατά την οποία οι, αποκαλούμενοι σήμερα «Λαοί της Θάλασσας»- θεωρείται πως επρόκειτο για μια χαλαρή συμμαχία φύλων/ λαών- προκάλεσαν την κατάρρευση πόλεων και πολιτισμών στη Μέση Ανατολή. Το βασίλειο της Μίρα, το οποίο πραγματοποίησε την προαναφερθείσα εκστρατεία, εκτιμάται πως ανήκε σε αυτή τη συμμαχία.

Ένας «Τρωικός πόλεμος»;

Η επιγραφή μιλά για το πώς ο βασιλιάς Κουπαντακουρούντας κυβερνούσε ένα βασίλειο ονόματι Μίρα, στη σημερινή δυτική Τουρκία. Η Μίρα είχε υπό τον έλεγχό της την Τροία, σύμφωνα με την επιγραφή- στην οποία αναφέρεται ότι ο Τρώας πρίγκιπας Μούξους ηγήθηκε μιας ναυτικής εκστρατείας που είχε ως αποτέλεσμα την κατάκτηση της Ασκελόν στο σημερινό Ισραήλ και την ανέγερση ενός φρουρίου εκεί.

Ειδικότερα, όπως αναφέρεται σε σχετικό δημοσίευμα του PhysOrg, όταν ο Κουπαντακουρούντας θεώρησε πως το βασίλειό του ήταν αρκετά ισχυρό, γύρω στο 1190 πΧ, έστειλε τις στρατιές του προς την ανατολή, εναντίον των βασιλείων που ήταν υποτελή στους Χετταίους. Μετά από μια σειρά επιτυχών εκστρατειών στην ξηρά, δημιουργήθηκε ένας στόλος από τις ενωμένες δυνάμεις της δυτικής Μικράς Ασίας, ο οποίος επιτέθηκε εναντίον πολλών πόλεων στις ακτές της νότιας και της νοτιοανατολικής Μικράς Ασίας, της Συρίας και της Παλαιστίνης. Του στόλου αυτού ηγήθηκαν τέσσερις πρίγκιπες, μεταξύ αυτών και ο Μούξους της Τροίας. Οι εκστρατείες αυτές είχαν ως αποτέλεσμα οι Λούβιοι να φτάσουν μέχρι τα σύνορα της Αιγύπτου. Γενικότερα, εκτιμάται πως η δραστηριότητα των Λουβίων αποτέλεσε σημαντικό κομμάτι των εισβολών/ επιδρομών των Λαών της Θάλασσας- μια θεωρία η οποία δείχνει να αποκτά δυναμική τα τελευταία χρόνια.

Επίσης, στην επιγραφή περιγράφεται η πορεία του Κουπαντακουρούντας μέχρι την κατάκτηση του θρόνου της Μίρα. Ο πατέρας του, βασιλιάς Μασουΐτας, πήρε τον έλεγχο της Τροίας μετά την εκθρόνιση ενός Τρώα βασιλιά ονόματι Βάλμους. Λίγο μετά, ο Μασουΐτας επανέφερε τον Βάλμους στον θρόνο της Τροίας, με αντάλλαγμα την πίστη και υπακοή του στη Μίρα.

Ο Κουπαντακουρούντας έγινε βασιλιάς μετά τον θάνατο του πατέρα του και εδραίωσε τον έλεγχό του στην Τροία, αν και δεν έγινε βασιλιάς της: Στην επιγραφή χαρακτηρίζεται «προστάτης» της Τροίας (η οποία αποκαλείται Βιλούσα, ένα αρχαίο όνομα για την πόλη).

Η ίδια η επιγραφή δεν υπάρχει πλέον, καθώς καταστράφηκε τον 19ο αιώνα, αλλά υπάρχουν αρχεία για αυτήν, περιλαμβανομένου ενός αντιγράφου, που κατείχε ο Τζέιμς Μέλααρτ, ένας διάσημος αρχαιολόγος που πέθανε το 2012. Ο Μέλααρτ ανακάλυψε πολλούς αρχαιολογικούς χώρους στη ζωή του, ο πιο γνωστός εκ των οποίων ήταν η Τσατάλ Χουγιούκ: Μια μεγάλη πόλη 9.500 ετών στην Τουρκία, για την οποία κάποιοι πιστεύουν πως είναι η παλαιότερη του κόσμου.

Ο Μέλααρτ άφησε πίσω του σημειώσεις και οδηγίες, όπου επισήμαινε ότι η επιγραφή δεν ήταν δυνατόν να αποκρυπτογραφηθεί πλήρως και να δημοσιοποιηθεί- και ότι άλλοι μελετητές θα έπρεπε να ασχοληθούν μαζί της. Ωστόσο, κάποιοι επιστήμονες έχουν εκφράσει προβληματισμούς για το ενδεχόμενο η επιγραφή να είναι πλαστή- ένα κατασκεύασμα του ίδιου του Μελάαρτ ή κάποιου άλλου.

Ο Μέλααρτ είχε αναφερθεί στην ύπαρξη της επιγραφής σε τουλάχιστον μία δημοσίευσή του, το 1992, στο journal της Anglo-Israel Archaeological Society, ωστόσο ποτέ δεν την περιέγραψε πλήρως σε επιστημονική δημοσίευση. Σύμφωνα με τις σημειώσεις του, η επιγραφή αντιγράφηκε το 1878 από έναν αρχαιολόγο ονόματι Zωρζ Περό, κοντά σε ένα χωριό με το όνομα Μπεικόι στη σημερινή Τουρκία. Λίγο μετά την καταγραφή της επιγραφής, οι ντόπιοι χρησιμοποίησαν την πλάκα ως υλικό για την κατασκευή ενός τζαμιού. Λίγο μετά οι αρχές έκαναν έρευνες στο χωριό και βρήκαν τρεις χάλκινες πλάκες με επιγραφές, η τύχη των οποίων σήμερα αγνοείται- είναι παντελώς άγνωστο τι μπορεί να έγραφαν.

Ένας μελετητής ονόματι Μπαχαντίρ Αλκίμ (πέθανε το 1981) ανακάλυψε την καταγραφή του Περό και έκανε αντίγραφο, το οποίο ο Μελάαρτ με τη σειρά του αντέγραψε και πρόσφατα αποκρυπτογράφησε ελβετο-ολλανδική ομάδα επιστημόνων.

Σημειώνεται επίσης πως ο Μελάαρτ ήταν μέλος ομάδας ερευνητών που, ξεκινώντας από το 1956, προσπαθούσε να αποκρυπτογραφήσει και δημοσιοποιήσει το αντίγραφο της επιγραφής που είχε κάνει ο Περό, μαζί με τις χαμένες χάλκινες πλάκες και άλλες λουβικές επιγραφές. Στις σημειώσεις του Μελάαρτ αναφέρεται πως η ομάδα δεν τα κατάφερε να ολοκληρώσει το έργο της πριν τα περισσότερα από τα μέλη της πεθάνουν. Ο Μελάαρτ ήταν ο τελευταίος που έμεινε, και πέθανε σε ηλικία 86 ετών. Οι ερευνητές της ελβετο-ολλανδικής ομάδας ανακάλυψαν πως είχε καταβάλει πολυετείς προσπάθειες να αποκωδικοποιήσει τα αντίγραφα των διαφορετικών λουβικών επιγραφών που είχε στην κατοχή του, ωστόσο δεν μπορούσε να διαβάσει λουβικά: Είχε μπει στην ομάδα λόγω των γνώσεών του πάνω στο αρχαιολογικό «ανάγλυφο» της δυτικής Τουρκίας. Άλλα μέλη της ομάδας ωστόσο, μπορούσαν να το κάνουν.

Αμφιβολίες

Μιλώντας στο LiveScience, επιστήμονες που δεν συμμετείχαν στην έρευνα εξέφρασαν προβληματισμούς για το ενδεχόμενο να πρόκειται για πλαστή επιγραφή, υποστηρίζοντας πως μέχρι να βρεθούν αρχεία για αυτήν που να μην προέρχονται από τον Μέλααρτ δεν μπορεί να είναι σίγουρο πως η επιγραφή υπήρξε στα αλήθεια. Οι Ζάνγκερ και Γουντχούιζεν εκτιμούν ωστόσο πως θα ήταν δύσκολο, αν όχι αδύνατο, να κάνει μια τέτοια πλαστογραφία ο Μέλααρτ ή κάποιος άλλος. Η επιγραφή είναι πολύ μεγάλη, και ο Μέλααρτ δεν μπορούσε να διαβάσει, πόσο μάλλον να διαβάσει λουβικά, όπως τονίζουν στο paper τους. Επίσης, σημειώνουν πως κανείς δεν είχε καταφέρει να αποκρυπτογραφήσει τα λουβικά μέχρι τη δεκαετία του 1950, κάτι που σημαίνει πως ούτε ο Περό θα ήταν σε θέση να την πλαστογραφήσει. Οι Ζάνγκερ και Γουντχούιζεν υπογραμμίζουν πως σήμερα ελάχιστοι είναι σε θέση να διαβάσουν λουβικά, πόσο μάλλον να γράψουν μια μακροσκελή επιγραφή. Επίσης, προσθέτουν πως δεν είναι σε θέση να σκεφτούν έναν λόγο ο Μέλααρτ να μπει στη διαδικασία να προβεί σε μια τόσο μακρά και πολύπλοκη πλαστογραφία, αλλά να την αφήσει αδημοσίευτη. Σημειώνεται πως ο Μέλααρτ είχε κατηγορηθεί κατά καιρούς για συνεργασίες με λαθρεμπόρους και υπερβολές όσον αφορά σε στοιχεία που στήριζαν τις αρχαιολογικές του απόψεις, ωστόσο ποτέ δεν κατηγορήθηκε για πλαστογραφίες.

Παρόλα αυτά, ο Ζάνγκερ είπε στο LiveScience πως, μέχρι να βρεθούν αρχεία σχετικά με την επιγραφή τα οποία δεν προέρχονται από τον Μέλααρτ, δεν μπορεί να επιβεβαιωθεί πέρα από κάθε αμφιβολία πως είναι αυθεντική και όχι πλαστή.

Ο Ζάνγκερ δημοσιεύει λεπτομέρειες σχετικά με την, πλέον αποκωδικοποιημένη, επιγραφή, σε ένα βιβλίο στα γερμανικά με τίτλο «Die Luwier und der Trojanische Krieg – Eine Forschungsgeschichte» (Orell Füssli, 2017) (Οι Λούβιοι και ο Τρωικός Πόλεμος- Η ιστορία μιας έρευνας).",Αποκρυπτογράφηση επιγραφής 3.200 ετών: Μιλά για τους μυστηριώδεις Λαούς της Θάλασσας και έναν πρίγκιπα της Τροίας,http://www.huffingtonpost.gr/2017/10/11/eidhseis-culture-apokryptografhsh-epigrafhs-3200-etwn-laoi-ths-8alassas_n_18233448.html?utm_hp_ref=greece

After the tragedy two months ago where more than 60 children had died in Gorakhpur's BRD medical college, reports suggest that another such disaster has unfolded in the hospital in Uttar Pradesh with the death of 69 children since October 7.

Indian Express reports that 12 children died on October 7, 20 on October 8, 18 died on October 9 and 19 died on October.

The report says that of the 19 deaths yesterday, 13 were newborns. All of them have reportedly died of Acute Encephalitis Syndrome.

This disaster should, perhaps, serve as a wake up call for Yogi Adityanath who had bragged about UP's health care at a rally in Kerala. He had even said that Kerala should learn how to run hospitals from UP.

Adityanath's statements ring hollow at a time when, clearly, the health care system is consistently failing to cope up with an encephalitis epidemic.

This comes even has the Uttar Pradesh government had faced severe criticism for the deaths of 60 children, allegedly because of lack of oxygen, which the government had vehemently denied.

The National Human Rights Commission had issued a notice to the Government of Uttar Pradesh saying it ""has observed that reported deaths, in such a large number in a government run hospital, amount to serious violation of Right to Life and Health of the innocent victims. This indicates towards gross callousness on part of the hospital administration and the Medical Education and Health Department of the Government of Uttar Pradesh. Earlier also, it has come across several instances of deaths in the hospitals due to Japanese Encephalitis.""

The chief of the hospital, who was suspended after the incident two months ago, had also blamed the government of apathy.

""The delay (in payments) happened because the funds hadn't come in,"" Dr Misra had said at a press conference after his suspension.

He said that he had written three letters to the government flagging the issue. The first letter, he said, was sent to the government on 3 July.

The government, meanwhile, had said that deaths of children in the hospital this year was much lower than previous years due to steps taken by the administration.","69 Children Have Died in Gorakhpur's BRD Medical College In the Last 4 Days, Says Report",http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/10/12/69-children-have-died-in-gorakhpurs-brd-medical-college-in-the-last-4-days-says-report_a_23240862/

En promotion pour son nouvel album, French Touch, l'ancienne première dame se confie dans une interview accordée au site Refinery 29. Elle y détaille sa vision des luttes pour les droits des femmes, mais revient aussi sur sa vie de couple -et sa vie sexuelle- avec Nicolas Sarkozy.

Installée dans un restaurant New Yorkais, à picorer les olives de sa salade maison, la chanteuse se souvient : ""quand j'ai grandi dans les années 70, il y avait une grande vague de féministes radicales. Pour moi, se décrire comme féministe revenait à assumer cette responsabilité"".

""Aux États-Unis, les femmes ont encore le pouvoir d'inspirer toutes les autres""

""Je viens de cette époque où les femmes se battaient pour le droit à prendre la pilule, où ces femmes nous ont donné le droit de posséder son propre corps"", précise-t-elle. Pourtant, malgré ces grandes avancées, l'ancienne mannequin reste inquiète des évolutions actuelles de la société. ""De bien des façons, nos droits ont presque reculé.""

""Aujourd'hui, il est encore plus important de se battre et d'être radical"", assume Carla Bruni.

""Regardez la marche des femmes"" aux États-Unis, s'exclame-t-elle. Le 21 janvier 2017, plusieurs centaines de milliers de femmes avaient convergé dans le centre de Washington D.C. pour protester contre l'investiture de Donald Trump, pour une manifestation historique. Même si Trump est resté à la maison blanche, explique la chanteuse, ""imaginez qu'il y ait une femme de Russie, d'Inde, de Chine ou d'un pays arabe, et qu'elle regarde les images de cette marche des femmes.""

""Les États-Unis sont la plus grande démocratie au monde, alors même si tout n'y est pas parfait, les femmes y ont encore le pouvoir d'inspirer toutes les autres à travers le monde.""

""Nous avons aussi des rapports sexuels fantastiques""

Au-delà de ces sensibilités féministes, l'ancienne première dame revient aussi sur sa vie personnelle, sa vie ""égoïste"" bousculée par la maternité. Mais aussi sur des détails plus intimes.

""Oui, je suis toujours attiré par mon homme, et j'imagine qu'il est toujours attiré par moi -je l'espère, après ces dix années"", assume-t-elle dans un rire. Elle explique avoir trouvé un équilibre entre désir et amitié, condition nécessaire pour maintenir un mariage d'après la chanteuse.

Carla Bruni ne se contente pas de le dire. Elle en donne des exemples. Pour le versant amitié, alors qu'il était encore président, elle dînait avoir lui le soir, chaque fois que son agenda le lui permettait. ""Nous pouvions prendre un petit repas ensemble, et bavarder, parce que nous sommes amis."" Pour le versant désir... ""Nous avons aussi des rapports sexuels fantastiques.""

La mannequin détaille ses astuces pour faire durer la passion au sein du couple: ""quand il n'y a plus de mystère, c'est à ce moment que vous êtes tenté de tromper et de mentir, et puis tout s'arrête"".

Wenn ich an Themen wie Massentierhaltung denke, dann sehe ich uns als Konsumenten in die Verantwortung genommen.

Ähnlich ergeht es mir, wenn ich voller Technikbegeisterung ein neues Smartphone auspacke und dabei an die Verschwendung der Rohstoffe und die schlechten Bedingungen in der Produktion denke.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Ich habe mir angeschaut, wie in Deutschland über Armut geredet wird und Erschreckendes festgestellt

Welche Alternativen und welchen Spielraum haben wir bei unseren Alltagsentscheidungen?

Die Ethikkonferenz ""Beyong Good"" greift solche Themen auf und stellt Fragen nach unserer individuellen Haltung und der Verantwortung des Einzelnen in unserer Gesellschaft und darüber hinaus.

Es sind die immer wieder zu überdenkenden Fragen nach dem moralischen Fundament unseres Zusammenlebens.

Ob es uns, die ""im Himmel auf Erden leben"" dürfen, jemals möglich ist, uns so zu verhalten, dass wir dort auch hingehören, kann ich nicht beantworten. Aber es ist mir wichtig, darüber nachzudenken.

A family photo of James

A lot has been written about grief. You can Google it, and you will find any number of guides, or quotes laid on the background of a field, or fluffy white clouds.

You probably haven't Googled grief unless you have experienced it in someway or another... I certainly hadn't. In fact, I would go so far as to say I had no understanding or appreciation for what grief or loss really was, up until the 31st of October 2016. This is despite my job in the police, where I have comforted victims, the bereft and those worst affected by sad events. You don't truly know grief until it hits you, like a meteor striking the surface of a planet.

My happiest moments

On the 21st of September 2016, my wife Emily gave birth to twins, James and Isabel. They were perfect. After a brief stay in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, we as a family left our local hospital with our older daughter Lexy, and travelled home. I can't remember a time when I was prouder, or more elated... and probably more apprehensive as to what was life going to be like.

The next four weeks were like a blur. I wish they weren't. I wish I could remember it all like yesterday. But with little sleep and a lot of 'jobs', we as a couple kept our head above the water line, feeding, changing nappies and coming to terms with the fact that a small, two bedroom flat might struggle to hold the five of us! Looking back at that time, if I could give myself one bit of advice it would be to savour the moments and not to stress about the future and the 'what ifs'.

Transfer to hospital

On the morning of the 29th of October, James fell ill. He was rushed to our local hospital but he was so poorly he needed more specialist care. The amazing and dogged work by staff from our local hospital, then staff of the Children's Acute Transfer Service (CATS) ambulance team, and finally the intensive care doctors and nurses at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) allowed us to spend two more days with our boy, before he passed away in our arms on the 31st of October at 19:35hrs. We think, but will sadly never know for sure, that James died of sepsis. It was at that point when I began to understand what grief was really all about.

Then, three weeks after we lost James, his twin sister Isabel fell ill. It happened much like it did for James, but Isabel had completely unrelated problems. We repeated the journey to our local hospital, and then to GOSH, where Isabel was rushed into surgery, which saved her life. A year on, my sweet girl has just turned one, and the only mark to tell the story of that harrowing time is a small scar on her belly, in time it might even go completely.

Coming to terms with loss

In my eulogy at James' memorial I said: 'No parent should ever have to bury their child' and I don't think a truer word has ever been said. If I could have one wish, it would not be for James to be back in our lives, that would be a selfish wish. My wish would be for no father or mother to ever have to endure the pain and suffering of losing a child.

So what do you do when you've had the worst thing happen? To be honest, I couldn't tell you, because unlike the explanations on that search engine, your grief is unique to you. All I can say is you will learn to live with the ache, your heart will never be the same again but it will still beat and you must let it. You will find solace in something or someone, and they or it will help you on that path of recovery.

Creating a legacy for James

One of our sticking plasters has been trying to give back, and so we started the Little Jimmy Brighter Future Fund in memory of James, to raise money for Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity, in December last year. We set ourselves a target of raising enough money for GOSH to buy two specialist ventilators for the CATS ambulances to take the sickest of children, like James, from their local hospital to GOSH for the very best of care. The machines will support the vital services that the CATS team provides, and they don't come cheap, but in less than a year we have raised over £140,000. That means we can buy not only the two specialist ventilators we set out to fund, but additional equipment that will also be used to help children on their journey of recovery.

'We' is the key word in that sentence. 'We' is friends, family, colleagues and complete strangers donating, running events like the Royal Parks Half Marathon with me and Emily, cycling, baking and many more things to help buy the equipment, but in their words, to help 'try and walk with us on that road to recovery'.

And that is my final point. When you are low, in the darkest of times, people are the one constant in getting you back to some semblance of existence. The family members' hug, the quiet drink with the friend or seeing a donation from a complete stranger... they are the actions that mean grief can be conquered.

Emily and Pete, and over 100 of their friends, family members and supporters of the Little Jimmy Brighter Future Fund ran the Royal Parks Half Marathon, with all money raised going to support Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity in James' memory.

Au cours des six premiers mois de 2017, les déclarations d'usage de l'arme individuelle ont augmenté de 39,58% par rapport à 2016, en passant de 116 à 192. Selon l'Inspection générale de la police nationale (IGPN), cette hausse s'était déjà amorcée fin 2016.

Neuf mois après l'adoption par le Parlement d'une loi assouplissant les règles de la légitime défense pour les policiers, le nombre de tirs en direction de personnes dangereuses ""pour tuer ou blesser"", reste stable d'une année sur l'autre, passant de 17 à 19.

En revanche, les tirs d'intimidation ou de sommation enregistrent ""la plus forte progression"", avec une hausse de 89,47% (de 2 à 19 tirs). ""Dans la majorité des cas, ces tirs sont effectués alors que les policiers sont encerclés et pris à partie par des groupes d'individus menaçants, armés et de plus en plus souvent cagoulés"", note l'IGPN.

Augmentation des tirs accidentels

Dans une autre note publiée en juillet, l'IGPN s'alarme du nombre ""important"" de tirs accidentels avec les nouvelles armes longues dont certaines équipent les unités de police, primo-intervenantes depuis les attentats de 2015. Au cours des six premiers mois de l'année, 19 tirs avec ces armes ont été répertoriées dont 18 sont accidentels. Pour 2016, ""ce chiffre déjà élevé s'établissait à 65%"", relève la police des polices.

Ces déclarations de tir par imprudence concernent essentiellement l'utilisation des fusils d'assaut G36 et pistolets mitrailleurs Beretta 12SD. Selon l'IGPN, la cause de ces tirs accidentels s'explique ""par un défaut de maîtrise d'armes plus complexes et plus encombrantes"".

Si l'IGPN relève que les 18 usages d'arme ""n'ont heureusement pas fait de victime"", il ""convient aujourd'hui de prendre en compte un risque non-négligeable pour des fonctionnaires ou des usagers"".

""Ces armes, nécessaires sur le plan opérationnel, exigent un niveau de compétence plus important et ne peuvent être remises en dotation qu'à des fonctionnaires, certes formés et habilités mais également entraînés et rompus à leur manipulation"", souligne l'IGPN.

President Trump's belligerent approach in muddying the water with Iran is yet another ploy to remain true to populist promises he made to right-wing audiences, at home and abroad, in the course of his 2016 campaign for the White House. However, despite all his rhetoric, what remains obscure at the end of the day is what is to be gained by 'decertification of the nuclear agreement' and how such a move is likely to chastise Iran while enhancing US or Western interests?

The truth of the matter is that since the ratification of the nuclear deal in July 2015, Iran, despite having complied with all its obligations, has continued to suffer from persistent US obstructions. These obstructions have essentially prevented international banking and financial institutions from actively participating in what is generally believed to be the world's largest foreign investment market. Hence, all 'antics' aside, the only real difference in US position vis-à-vis Iran is that while the Obama administration made promises that it did not keep, President Trump, intends on passing the buck to Congress so that it can then re-impose the kind of robust measures, which the Treasury Department under his predecessors had never removed.

What is even more unclear is how exactly the pursuit of such gratuitous belligerency, which could potentially result in the cancellation of the nuclear agreement, benefit the US, its allies, and the cause of non-proliferation at a time when all parties are engaged in a serious crisis over international security with North Korea. Trump's message is clearly in contradiction to positions enunciated by all senior military officials as well as his key cabinet members who have spoken on the record about the need to honor the commitments which the US has made in conjunction with Russia, China, France Britain and Germany to the nuclear agreement that has also been endorsed by the UN Security Council.

Moreover, Trump's actions in this regard will not even satisfy regional players such as Israel or Saudi Arabia. They see this empty and inconsequential gesture on the part of the US President as a ploy for not living up to the kind of expectations he had created in advance of his election. In the case of Israel, such a ploy that is incapable of making any material short to mid-term difference to Iran's overall strategic disposition in the region is hardly any compensation for not moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem, or openly validating Israeli settlement policies in the occupied territories. For Saudi Arabia, Trump's 'bad mouthing' of the Iranian regime in the absence of any direct military action against Iranian targets, falls way short of the kind of US support that would help resurrect their fortunes from the downward spiral of their bankrupt policies on Yemen and Qatar, while Iran consolidates its position in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.

There is no question that Trump's exacerbation of a situation that hinders the flow of capital and investments needed for economic reconstruction into Iran, will seriously affect the lives of millions of ordinary Iranians. They had hoped that on the back of the nuclear agreement, the road would be paved for further agreements with the West that would assist Iran's complete rehabilitation and reintegration into the world community.

Sadly the Iranian people's overwhelming support for the re-election of Hassan Rouhani in the recent presidential election in face of hardline elements bent on frustrating his moderate and progressive agenda is being rewarded by policies and pronouncements that enhances the position of only those who want to emulate the North Korean model in dealing with the US.

In the final analysis, any move to dismantle the nuclear deal will not have the support of world public opinion or that of any of the other major signatories to that agreement. It will only relinquish the high moral ground to Iran, leaving the US as the isolated party.

Every few months (or weeks, it's difficult to say these days) news of another mass-shooting in the world's only global superpower, the United States, makes headlines around the world. This time, the venue was the glitzy streets of Sin City, Las Vegas, as 58 people attending a music concert were shot dead. Stephen Paddock, from his room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, shot innocent bystanders to death as if picking fish in a barrel.

The Vegas shooting has now become the worst such crime in US history. The immediate reactions in the US, and around the world, were similar to previous such incidents in the country as much of the narrative in the hours following the atrocity was based around the usual debate of gun ownership laws. It is perhaps not contestable in a civilised world that current American gun laws allowing people to buy weapons from grocery stores in some-sort of a dystopian stage play hiding under the guise of the country's second amendment, which in turn liberally allows anyone to own guns under the ruse of 'self-protection', is indigestible. However, many debated on why Paddock was not being labelled as a terrorist.

The term 'terrorist' has a heavy weightage to it and has a complex web of attempts that try to define the same. At the United Nations, almost the entire gambit of nation-states, big or small, democratic or autocratic, come together in New York every year with one of the main unsolved questions to assess what the term and ideas behind 'terrorism' really are. The term itself is plagued by its own malice, with countries around the world unable to decide what constitutes terrorism, and how to politically define it as a global phenomenon.

The fact remains his crime does not fit within the parameters of what we know as terrorism.

For example, the United States today is looking to sanction and declare the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp (IRGC), an elite force under the Ayatollah of Iran's command as a terror group with President Trump looking to exit the Iran nuclear deal. Meanwhile, the same American State Department, till date, despite a 14-year-long war in Afghanistan, has not officially declared the Afghan Taliban a designated sponsor of terror. This highlights the fractures and complexities of the global 'terrorism' debate and the politics around it.

Ideology is a critical aspect when it comes to the definition of terrorism, which separates the same from other crimes such as mass-murder, assassination and so on. Much of the debate around Paddock's heinous crime has now come to the fold of him not being labeled as a 'terrorist' because he is white, and while this may have some degree of truth, the fact remains his crime does not fit within the parameters of what we know as terrorism, or what the discourse of the studies around the topic is attempting to translate both the violence and intent behind the terminology and those who use it as a tool of coercion and political chaos.

One of the definitions of terrorism that this author considers closest to being acceptable comes from Professor Yonah Alexander, Senior Fellow and Director; International Center for Terrorism Studies, Potomac Institute for Policy Studies based in Arlington, Virginia, USA. As a foremost theorist in the field, Alexander defines terrorism as 'the use of violence against random civilian targets in order to intimidate or create generalised pervasive fear for the purpose of achieving political goals'.

The 'political goals' terminology, which finds itself in many other theorists' definitions and research, is an important point. Others such as Alex Peter Schmid, a Dutch terrorism scholar, further highlights that the eventual targets of a terror attack serve as 'message generators' for further political or ideological ends. In her article for The New Yorker, journalist Masha Gessen highlights the Irish political scientist Louise Richardson's seven main characteristics for an act of terror, these are: 1) It is politically inspired, 2) use of violence, 3) deliverance of a message to the enemy, 4) symbolism of the violence and its victim, 5) the attack is carried by a sub-state group, 6) distinction between victims and audience of the message of the attack and lastly the act deliberately targets civilians.

By the above standards, unless Paddock was identified as a neo-Nazi or a white-nationalist, or acting on behalf of ISIS, which oddly, has claimed that he converted to Islam six months ago and carried the attack in the name of the caliphate (refuted by investigating agencies till now, however, latest issue of ISIS's weekly newsletter al-Naba advertised the attack as its own), it is not wise to club him under the bracket of a terrorist.

The Guns & Guitars shop where Stephen Paddock, the gunman who attacked the Route 91 Harvest Country Music Festival in a mass shooting in Las Vegas, was a customer, is pictured in Mesquite, Nevada, U.S.

The term 'terrorism' itself has been more ingrained in American society and culture only in the post 9/11 era, specifically with the moniker of 'War on Terror', which saw the US invade Afghanistan and Iraq as a fallout of the attacks on New York. The term has perfected itself into the American subconsciousness as a broad stroke for largely Islamist violence. To counter this fallacy ridden narrative, which was a tool of American foreign policy, many attacks that are racist, xenophobic, mass-murders are labelled under the 'terrorist' ambit. In fact, India is much more accustomed to using the term 'terrorism' closer to what it is meant to be than America, thanks to decades-long suffering from cross-border terrorism sponsored by Pakistan. In India terrorism has clear, example led narratives and the distinction between mass-shootings (which largely do not occur thanks to guns not being available for sale on the same counters as chocolates) and terrorism-related attacks.

In India terrorism has clear, example led narratives and distinction between mass-shootings and terrorism-related attacks.

In the US, the fact remains that even as labelling people like Paddock as a terrorist pacifies internal rage at some level, it is the debate of gun control that remains paramount. While Paddock's crime led to the biggest mass-shooting in American history, if the US was not moved to a war-footing to ban guns after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012, which saw the murder of 20 children in Newtown Connecticut, then labeling mass-shooters as 'terrorist' for narratives' sake is nothing but trivial victories.

Chess and the hijab: Iran's Dorsa Derakhshani finds her way in America: https://t.co/gQ9mRcrzl7 pic.twitter.com/Rc8XrOfjSx — American Chess Mag (@ACMChess) September 30, 2017

Εκτιμά πως ο αποκλεισμός της ίσως να ήταν μια προσπάθεια της Σκακιστικής Ομοσπονδίας της Τεχεράνης να τραβήξει την προσοχή από το μποϊκοτάζ που είχαν εξαγγείλει πολλές γυναίκες σκακίστριες- όπως η διεθνούς φήμης αμερικανίδα Nazí Paikidze-Barnes- αντιδρώντας να διαγωνιστούν φορώντας τζιχάμπ. «Δεν είμαι κατά του Ισλάμ. Υπερασπίζομαι την θρησκευτική ελευθερία όσο και το δικαίωμα στην ελεύθερη επιλογή» ανέφερε σε δήλωσή της η Barnes πριν το τουρνουά ενώ εξηγούσε πως ήθελε να διαμαρτυρηθεί κατά του «νόμου της κυβέρνησης που περιορίζει τα δικαιώματα μου ως γυναίκα».



Εκτός πάντως από την Dorsa Derakhshani αποκλείστηκε και ο 15χρονος αδερφός της Borna, από τον αγώνα με ισραηλινό σκακιστή στο τουρνουά του Γιβλαρτάρ. Και αυτός σήμερα έχει μετακομίσει στο Καντέρμπουρι και έλαβε άδεια να παίξει για την Αγγλική Σκακιστική Ομοσπονδία.

Πάντως ο πρόεδρος της Σκακιστικης Ομοσπονδίας του Ιράν προσπάθησε να αμβλύνει τις εντυπώσεις σχετικά με τον αποκλεισμό των αδερφών λέγοντας ότι δεν ήταν ασυνήθιστο για τους παίκτες να αλλάζουν εθνική ομάδα ενώ πρόσθεσε με νόημα πως η Derakhshani «έπαιξε για το Ιράν μόνο μια φορά το 2014».

Ωστόσο, η Derakhshani υποστηρίζει πως είχε αρνηθεί αρκετές φορές να παίξει στο Ιράν επειδή δεν ήθελε να πειθαρχήσει στους κανόνες που ισχύουν στην εθνική ομάδα.

«Έχω ξεκαθαρίσει εδώ και χρόνια ότι δεν θέλω να παίξω για την εθνική ομάδα του Ιράν αλλά συνέχισαν να μου το ζητούν , γνωρίζοντας ότι η απάντησή μου δεν πρόκειται να αλλάξει» ανέφερε η παίχτρια η οποία πάντως δήλωσε «συγκλονισμένη» από την ανακοίνωση του αποκλεισμού της αλλά και πως δεν περίμενε κάτι τέτοιο.

«Γιατί ξεκίνησαν όλο αυτό το θέμα με μένα τον Φεβρουάριο; Ήταν ηλίθιο και με πλήγωσε...Στην αρχή δεν μπορούσα να καταλάβω γιατί ο αδερφός μου και εγώ είχαμε δεχθεί μια δημόσια επίθεση για ένα θέμα επί του οποίου δεν είχε λάβει καμία προειδοποίηση», ανέφερε.

Το μεγαλύτερο παιδί ιατρού και ψυχολόγου, η κ. Derakhshani εμφανίστηκε στην ιρανική τηλεόραση ως μικρό παιδί, αφού ένας παραγωγός το είδε σε ηλικία 16 μηνών, «τραγουδώντας και χορεύοντας» σε ένα εμπορικό κέντρο.

Η Derakhshani, είναι το μεγαλύτερο παιδί ενός γιατρού και μιας ψυχολόγου και εμφανίστηκε για πρώτη φορά στην ιρανική τηλεόραση αφού ένας παραγωγός την είχε δει να τραγουδά και να χορεύει σε ένα εμπορικό κέντρο και σε ηλικία μόλις 16 μηνών.

Ο πατέρας της έπαιζε σκάκι στο σχολείο και της έμαθε το παιχνίδι όταν ήταν μόλις δύο χρονών ενώ άρχισε να παίζει επίσημα από τα έξι της χρόνια.

Συμμετείχε στην εθνική ομάδα του Ιράν σε τουρνουά που διεξήχθη στην Κίνα το 2014 αλλά έκτοτε κατέστησε σαφές ότι δεν ήθελε να παίξει ξανά για το Ιράν.

«Θέλω να συνεχίσω τις σπουδές μου και να μπω σε ιατρική ή οδοντιατρική σχολή» αλλά πάντως δηλώνει: «θέλω να είμαι [μεταξύ των] κορυφαίων γυναικών σκακιστών».

With the Supreme Court banning the sale of firecrackers ahead of Diwali this year in Delhi-NCR, there's a perception that the move is meant to attack religious customs of Hindus.

Allá donde un árbol crece en la soledad de una cumbre, donde las casas son más lodo que hogar y un niño de nadie con un ramo de flores naranja se para a la orilla de la carretera. Allí la gente sólo deja verse de la boca para arriba, buscando mirar al que llega, sólo para comprobar que la cosa no se ponga peor.

El martes 6 de junio el rumor convertido en amenaza empezó en Facebook y luego se expandió en hojas regadas en las calles de Tepozcuatla y Ahuihuiyuco. Fue un murmullo sin rodeos: un grupo de la delincuencia organizada amenazaba con asesinar el viernes 9 de junio a quienes no abandonaran esas comunidades, por lo que entre el 7 y 8 de junio el éxodo fue inevitable..

Desde entonces, lo que cuenta lo que ahí hubo son los lugares no las personas: hotel Mi Corazón, Sur 13, deshuesadero, se venden marranitos finos... y una iglesia resplandeciente, intacta, vacía, como si a alguien se le hubiera olvidado cerrar la puerta y también las de los seis baños construidos a su costado.

Ahuihuiyuco se quedó sin su población de aproximadamente mil 300 habitantes. Todavía el 9 de junio se podían ver por sus veredas a algunas familias que buscaban salir del lugar en camionetas.

En este lugar, dedicado principalmente a la siembra de autoconsumo y a la elaboración de la cinta de palma, sólo quedó abierta la iglesia.

Se trata de una zona estratégica para el trasiego de drogas, pues conecta con Ciudad de México o Puebla, explica el activista Manuel Olivares, del Centro Morelos, mientras estira el brazo para señalar el camino que tiene a su derecha y que, en un punto, parece volverse uno con la sierra: ""Esa ruta nos puede conectar con Zitlala, derecho llega a Copalillo y de ahí uno puede entroncar hacia la Ciudad de México o Puebla; son lugares muy estratégicos"".

De lo que se trata es de sembrar terror en el enemigo, no hay un cártel que sea menos sanguinario que otro, descuartizan, matan, esas son las razones por las que la lucha es tan sangrienta y tan cruel y que por la que ahora pelean por las comunidades."" Manuel Olivares.

La gente ha ido regresando de a poco, pero las escuelas y los centros de salud siguen vacíos; las cortinas de los negocios bajadas y las pocas personas que hay, sólo caminan, caminan, frenan un poco cuando algo o alguien sale a su paso, otean, se cubren la boca, se sacuden las piernas y siguen.

En Tepozcuautla el panorama es similar.

""Prácticamente se ve muy poca gente en las calles por el miedo, a partir de las 5 de la tarde la gente se regresa a su casa, como en una especie de toque de queda autoimpuesto, pero también demuestra que no le tiene confianza a los militares, porque justo hay una comisaría ocupada por los militares a unos metros"", continúa Manuel, quien comanda una Misión Civil de Observación con organismos internacionales a fin de hacer visible la emergencia.

Muchas casas siguen vacías, el retorno no se ha completado y, probablemente, no se complete; se sabe que muchas familias no piensan regresar ante la creciente práctica del reclutamiento forzado por parte de grupos de la delincuencia organizada.

Lo que antes se entendía por la lucha por la plaza era la lucha por el mercado de consumo, pero cuando el narcotráfico toma tintes empresariales, los fines económicos de la delincuencia organizada incrementan, aumentan los secuestros, el cobro de piso, la venta de protección, la extorsión, empiezan a controlar los servicios públicos."" Manuel Olivares

El tema del desplazamiento por la violencia se da al menos desde hace 10 años en Guerrero, explica José Raymundo Díaz, del Colectivo contra la Tortura y la Impunidad.

""En el estado de Guerrero hay desplazamiento desde hace mucho tiempo, pero ha estado silenciado y ahora en Chilapa se está documentando y tratando de visibilizar estos casos de desplazamiento que se están dando desde 2015"", señala.

Fue entre el 9 y 14 de mayo de 2015 que un grupo de 300 personas armadas tomó la ciudad de Chilapa, hubo, entonces, entre 31 y 32 desaparecidos. La gravedad se acentuó porque los hechos se dieron con la presencia de la Gendarmería Nacional y el Ejército.

De 2015 a la fecha, en Chilapa hay al menos 150 casos de desapariciones y sólo 14 se han podido denunciar ante la PGR para acceder al fondo de la Comisión Ejecutiva de Atención a Víctimas (CEAV); al resto, las autoridades no les han acreditado la declaración de ausencia, denuncia el Centro Morelos, el cual se ha encargado de documentar cada uno de los casos.

Hemos visto el momento en que Chilapa era un paraíso, llegaba mucha gente de otros lugares a vivir, nadie preguntaba nada mientras uno no se metiera en problemas, era un territorio libre para todos."" Manuel Olivares.

ENTRE LA ANARQUÍA Y LA OMISIÓN

El desplazamiento en Ahuihuiyuco y Tepozcuautla se dio en ""mucha anarquía, mucho desorden"", señala Manuel, pues aunque el Ejército y la Policía Municipal acompañaron a algunas personas, sólo las llevaron a la carretera y ahí las familias ""le dieron para donde mejor entendieron"", por eso no se tiene certeza sobre su paradero.

""Algunas familias fueron a dar a Chilpancingo, otras a Iguala, otras a Morelos, a diferentes partes del estado y del país; eso también tiene que ver con la desconfianza que tienen hacia el gobierno porque no fueron capaces de unificarse y plantearle al presidente municipal una solución.

""Cuando menos el presidente municipal de Chilapa no es ajeno a uno delos grupos de delincuencia organizada y la gente sabe que si van a presentar una denuncia al Ministerio Público más tardan en presentarla que el mismo MP que tomó la denuncia le esté informando al amo, al que le sirva"", acusa.

El centro de defensa de derechos humanos es claro en su mensaje, no quieren señalar a ningún grupo delictivo, pero sí exigirle al gobierno que haga las averiguaciones previas, que las carpetas de investigación avancen, que ""realmente se investigue y que realmente se castigue a los responsables.""

El Estado tiene la obligación de garantizar nuestro derecho a la vida, a la integridad física, a nuestro patrimonio y, cuando no es capaz de esto, pues la gente tiene que exigirle. Además nos enfrentamos a que el Ejército ha generalizado la visión de que los defensores de derechos humanos, defendemos a delincuentes, eso es muy grave porque tiene que ver con una criminalización y estigmatización hacia nuestro trabajo que provoca un linchamiento moral de la población hacia nosotros."" Manuel Olivares.

CHILAPA Y NUEVE ASESINATOS POR DÍA

De julio de 2013 a la fecha, en Guerrero suman 5 mil personas desplazadas en al menos 30 comunidades de 20 de los 81 municipios que integran la entidad.

Chilapa es una de las regiones más violentas, pero, a diferencia del norte, aquí la lucha no es por los capos, sino por comunidades pequeñitas, para que trabajen para un grupo y si se van con otro grupo, los matan"". Abel Barrera, Centro de Derechos Humanos de la Montaña Tlachinollan.

Actualmente en Chilapa hay tres retenes militares, es una localidad de 31 mil 157 habitantes, según cifras del Inegi, y en un día pueden ocurrir hasta nueve asesinatos.

Mientras que las desapariciones comenzaron desde 2014, con 19 personas; en 2015, 43; en 2016, 282; y hasta la primera quincena de septiembre de 2017, sumaban 188.

En lo que va del año, en el municipio de Chilapa 19 comunidades han registrado hechos violentos, mientras que en Zitlala, siete.

Destaca el éxodo de Quetzalcoatlán de las Palmas, una comunidad en el municipio de Zitlala: el 6 de enero del año pasado, un grupo armado entró, asesinó a seis personas, amenazó con regresar a matar a los demás y la comunidad, cargando a sus muertos, se desplazó.

Suena bastante grave, pero cargaron a sus muertos en una camioneta y todas las familias se salieron.

Hay gente que no soporta el sometimiento de los grupos criminales que los obliga a participar en actividades propias de la delincuencia y terminan huyendo"". Manuel Olivares.

SONAR LAS ALARMAS

La mañana del pasado 19 de septiembre dos cuerpos desmembrados fueron dejados en cuatro bolsas en el barrio San Juan, en Chilapa. Ese mismo día, llegaba a la cabecera municipal una Misión Civil de Observación. Ese mismo día, más tarde, un sismo causaría gran devastación en Ciudad de México, Morelos y Puebla.

La Misión de Observación, organizada por la Red Nacional de Organismos Civiles de Derechos Humanos (Red TDT), y en la que participaron las Brigadas Internacionales de Paz (PBI), Amnistía Internacional, Serapaz México y el Centro de Derechos Humanos de la Montaña Tlachinollan, buscaba visibilizar los casos y reunirse con el gobernador de Guerrero, Héctor Astudillo Flores, a fin de emitir una serie de recomendaciones para atender la creciente crisis de inseguridad en Chilapa, sin embargo el encuentro fue pospuesto debido a la emergencia nacional que desató el sismo del pasado 19 de septiembre.

La misión concluyó que no hay condiciones de seguridad para las comunidades desplazadas e hizo un llamado al gobierno del estado para garantizar los derechos humanos de las víctimas, las comunidades y los defensores de derechos humanos.

Mandan un operativo policiaco para acompañar a la misión y vemos que esos actores armados lo que hacen es vigilar el trabajo de los defensores y defensoras; falta visión de derechos humanos para entender la problemática de las víctimas. La forma en que se atiende a defensores y defensoras es colocar en el primer frente al Ejército, a la Policía.

Hubo tensión al llegar a Chilapa, estaba un retén, es una manera de dar la bienvenida con el fusil en la mano."" Abel Barrera Centro Tlachinollan

Para los activistas, la política de seguridad implementada, sobre todo en Guerrero, está siendo causante de la crisis de seguridad, porque consuma más violaciones graves a los derechos humanos, fomenta la impunidad y la falta de acceso a la justicia.","Chilapa, el municipio secuestrado: Las comunidades que el narco desplazó",http://www.huffingtonpost.com.mx/2017/10/12/chilapa-el-municipio-secuestrado-las-comunidades-que-el-narco-desplazo_a_23240700/?utm_hp_ref=mx-homepage

Universal Credit is due to be rolled out more widely in the coming months, despite persistent reports of problems.","Universal Credit claimants languish on hold to a government helpline while racking up bills as high as £16, without the option of an immediate call back, contradicting claims made by Downing Street.

One call placed by HuffPost UK to the dedicated 0345 number on Wednesday afternoon took 12 and a half minutes to be answered in person, at which point an advisor refused to call back straight away due to data protection rules.

The call would have cost some Universal Credit claimants more than 11 percent of their weekly allowance, which is meant to “help with living costs”.

It came amid a growing row over the policy, as Theresa May was earlier forced to defend the up to 55p per minute call charges during Prime Minister’s Questions.

HuffPost UK Calls to the Universal Credit helpline are charged at up to 55p per minute from mobiles in England. Welsh language calls are free

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn urged the PM to “show some humanity” and scrap the cost altogether.

The PM’s official spokesperson later suggested there was an immediate call back option, with advisors able to return calls at no cost to the claimant “straight away”.

But Downing Street’s claim prompted derision from Labour, with Corbyn’s spokesperson saying: “The No.10 line that you can ask for a ‘call back’ is a joke as they’ve cut so many staff you can’t get through and are held in a queue.”

And during HuffPost’s call, our reporter was asked to input information via an automated answering service, yet at no time did the service ask for a telephone number for a call back.

After three minutes and 11 seconds, the call was placed in a queue as ‘Spring’ from Vivaldi’s Four Seasons played on loop.

‘You can call back later’

Automatic messages heard in the queue also undermined Number 10′s defence.

“All our lines are still busy. Please hold and we will answer your call as soon as we can. Or if you prefer you can call back later,” a voice said at regular intervals.

After 12 minutes and 30 seconds, the call was eventually answered by an advisor who said they could not call the reporter back straight away due to data protection rules.

“Firstly, I need to know if you are registered with us and complete necessary security checks,” they said.

HuffPost’s call ended after 13 minutes and 40 seconds - a total cost to callers on some mobile phone networks of £7.51.

Universal Credit claimants without children and aged under 25 take home just £62.94 a week, according to the government’s website.

The helpline assists those who are confused by the new system or who need to register changes in circumstances.

Some 55,000 calls a week were made to the helpline during August, according to a freedom of information request (pdf).

The request revealed callers have experienced a “maximum” wait time of 29 minutes, costing £15.95 to those on mobiles.

‘Money I could be using for food’

‘Sue’, a 54-year-old claimant explained to Citizens Advice Bureau (pdf) that she phoned the helpline because she couldn’t use a computer.

“The process is complicated if you aren’t very good at using computers,” she said. “Going to the job centre and using wifi all costs money I could be using for food.”

Some 30 percent of respondents to a Citizens Advice survey of claimants reported calling the helpline more than 10 times.

An earlier call made by HuffPost dropped out unexpectedly after two minutes and 11 seconds, at a cost of £1.20 to those on a mobile.

It has also been revealed that calls to the Universal Credit helpline are free for Welsh language speakers.

Criticism has mounted of the new benefit system, which replaces Job Seeker’s Allowance and combines all welfare entitlements into one monthly payment.

Trials of the policy have seen many claimants fall into arrears with rent payments and face homelessness as delays in the first payments of Universal Credit force others to use loan sharks and food banks.

It has been widely condemned by politicians on both sides of the House of Commons, and the issue dominated Wednesday’s PMQs.

Universal Credit is due to be rolled out more widely in the coming months, despite persistent reports of problems.

It comes as Tory minister Liz Truss appeared on the BBC’s Daily Politics, urging people to go to a job centre to seek advice if they could not afford the charge.

Colin Bateman, who has seen the cover of his darkly comic 1995 book Divorcing Jack apparently doctored by Jones and used repeatedly by the press, said the picture has become the “ultimate stock image.”

“Nobody ever asks why on earth a Syrian terrorist would be holding a Jack Russell,” he told HuffPost UK.

Sally Jones, who was also known as the White Widow, died earlier this year in a US drone strike in Syria, according to multiple reports, including one in The Sun, which printed the oft-used picture of her on its front page.

Jones used her Twitter to recruit women and provided practical advice on how to join Isis in Syria.

She is believed to have been behind dozens of terror plots and was the leader of the secret Anwar al-Awlaki battalion’s female wing.

Reacting to news of Jones’ death on Facebook, Bateman said “she just hijacked the image, which was then itself hijacked by the world’s media”.

The nun image, one of only a handful of Jones, is often used by the media without any context, implying it is real.

Bateman, a Northern Irish screenwriter and ex-journalist, told HuffPost he was dismayed how often the media would use the picture with no context or explanation of its origin.

Sally Jones The 'nun with a gun' image of Sally Jones is actually a crude photoshop of the Divorcing Jack cover

“Nobody delves any deeper. Obviously there’s very little information about her so they grasp at what they’ve got. Nobody ever goes deep on it and asks why it’s being used or where it’s from or where it originated.

“It’s become the ultimate stock image.”

In 2014, the Daily Express ran the image under the caption: “Sally Jones in her nun and gun outfit”.

In January 2015, The Times called it an “Isis recruitment poster”.

In September 2014, The Evening Standard ran it, calling it “bizarre”.

When asked if he wanted the media to stop using it, Bateman said: “I was a journalist for 20 years. I know how it works... Sometimes it’s the easiest thing you grab [to use as a picture].

“But I just think a little bit of context is useful to have.”

HuffPost understands it was taken from one of Jones’ social media accounts when it was first reported that she had travelled with her husband Junaid Hussain to Syria to join Isis in 2013.

Twitter 'White Widow' Sally Jones has reportedly been killed in a US drone strike

He was killed by a US drone in 2015, and had reportedly been planning “barbaric attacks against the West” including terror plots targeting high profile public commemorations this summer.

Bateman believes Jones herself may have created the image. She played in an all-female punk group in the 1990s and Bateman said this coincided roughly with the time of the book’s success.

“The book was quite punky and had a lot of punk references. I presume she picked it up around then, because the image hasn’t been on the book for quite a few years, so it’s not something she’s picked up recently,” he said.

Bateman remembers first seeing the photoshopped image when he opened a newspaper and saw it on page three.

“It was just a shock,” he said. “You read into it and you realise how surreal and bizarre it is that this has come back to haunt you.”

Since then, Bateman has had no one had ever approached him over the connection between his book and the picture.

He said when he first saw it on The Daily Mail, he posted a comment pointing out the connection but had no response.

“I know it’s been used for terrible things. If in some way I’m connected to even one person being recruited to go out there. I really hate that fact,” he said.

“It’s just a bizarre connection to have. I’m just sorry if any people have suffered because of it.”

He added: “It corrupts my happy memories of the book in a way but also I’m quite proud of the image and the book, the fact that people are still talking about it 22 years after it was published.”

Immer wieder werden Flüchtlinge in Deutschland für hohe Vergewaltigungszahlen beschuldigt

Jüngst veröffentlichte Zahlen des bayerischen Innenministeriums befeuerten die Debatte

Nun zeigt eine aufwendige HuffPost-Recherche: Die Wirklichkeit sieht weit weniger dramatisch aus

Es muss ein schreckliches Martyrium gewesen sein: Mitten im Ortskern von Höhenkirchen-Siegertsbrunn bei München sollen zwei Flüchtlinge im September hintereinander ein 16-jähriges Mädchen vergewaltigt haben. In der Folge diskutierten viele Menschen in der Region über angeblich zunehmende Sex-Attacken durch Flüchtlinge - und nicht nur dort.

► Geschürt wurde die Angst durch Horrorzahlen, die vor der Wahl die Runde machten: Bayerns Innenministerium hatte gewarnt, die Zahl der Vergewaltigungen habe im Freistaat drastisch zugenommen.

► Und in der ZDF-Sendung „Klartext, Herr Schulz“ war in einer Zuschauerfrage sogar von einem Anstieg der Sexualdelikte von Flüchtlingen um 500 Prozent in nur vier Jahren die Rede.

Die Schlagzeilen verbreiteten sich rasch.

Dass die erste Meldung so nicht haltbar ist und die zweite nach Ansicht vieler Experten ebenfalls schlicht falsch ist, ging im Vorwahl-Getöse weitgehend unter. Das Bild vom Vergewaltiger-Flüchtling war im Kopf mancher Deutscher nicht mehr wegzubekommen – und dürfte wohl eine Ursache für den massiven Wahlerfolg der AfD sein.

Denn wer genauer schaut, was wirklich hinter den Zahlen steckt, merkt: Die Wirklichkeit sieht weit weniger dramatisch aus – für die Behauptung, dass durch die Zuwanderung die tatsächliche Zahl an Sexualstraftaten deutlich ansteigt, gibt es jedenfalls keinen Beweis.

► Die HuffPost hat überprüft: Nehmen die sexuellen Übergriffe in Deutschland tatsächlich zu – und wenn ja, geht das Plus auf Flüchtlinge zurück?

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Bayern diskutiert über Vergewaltigungen durch Zuwanderer - das sagen Experten dazu

Das Vergewaltigungs-Risiko stieg seit 2011 geringfügig an

Zwar ist die Zahl der bei der Polizei registrierten angezeigten Sexualstraftaten 2016 gestiegen – doch das heißt nicht zwangsläufig, dass auch die tatsächliche Zahl an Übergriffen zugenommen hat.

Ein Anstieg könnte Experten zufolge beispielsweise auch an einer erhöhten gesellschaftlichen Sensibilität für das Thema und einem damit einhergehenden veränderten Anzeigenverhalten liegen.

Eine sogenannte Dunkelfeldstudie des Kriminologischen Forschungsinstituts Niedersachsens (KFN) zeigt: Die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass eine Frau zwischen 16 und 40 Jahren in den letzten fünf Jahren Opfer sexueller Gewalt wurde, lag im Jahr 2011 bei 2,4 Prozent.

Derzeit liegt dieser Wert nach Erkenntnissen des Kriminologen Christian Pfeiffer bei etwa 2,6 Prozent. Zum Vergleich: 1992 war das Risiko mit 4,7 Prozent sogar fast doppelt so hoch wie heute.

In den repräsentativen Dunkelfeldstudien wurden Frauen nach ihren Erfahrungen gefragt – sie erfassen deshalb auch Delikte, die nicht angezeigt wurden.

Pfeiffer, der mit Kollegen derzeit der Frage nachgeht, ob Zuwanderer mehr Sexualdelikte begehen als Einheimische, betont: Anders als in Medien kolportiert, lasse sich nicht sagen, dass Flüchtlinge bei den Sexualverbrechen ""besonders schlimm auffallen"".

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Wie Medien über Flüchtlinge und sexuelle Gewalt berichten halte ich für unverantwortlich - es verhöhnt vergewaltigte Frauen

So denkt ein syrischer Flüchtling wirklich über Frauen

Sex-Attacken durch Flüchtlinge insbesondere in deren Unterkünften

Dennoch unterstellen rechte Hetzseiten Flüchtlingen massenhafte Vergewaltigungen. Der Begriff ""Rapefugee"", eine Mischung der englischen Worte für Flüchtling und Vergewaltiger, fand sogar Einzug bei Wikipedia.

Dabei halten sogar Kritiker der deutschen Flüchtlingspolitik, wie Rainer Wendt, Chef der Deutschen Polizeigewerkschaft (DPolG), die Darstellungen für übertrieben.

""Die Behauptung, dass Eingewanderte haufenweise Frauen vergewaltigen, ist einfach nur Unsinn"", erklärt Wendt. Zwar gebe es eine kleine Minderheit an Zugewanderten, die mit Sexualstraftaten auffällig werden. Das sei ""natürlich ein Problem"".

Doch die Opfer seien ""vor allem die Bewohnerinnen der Flüchtlingsheime"". Das sei nicht ""weniger schlimm"", aber die Gefahrenlage der einheimischen Bevölkerung steige eben - anders als mitunter behauptet - durch diese Fälle nicht an.

Das Risiko, Opfer einer Sexualstraftat zu werden, sei nirgendwo größer als in den Flüchtlingsunterkünften selbst, weiß auch Martin Rettenberger, Direktor der Kriminologischen Zentralstelle in Wiesbaden.

So hat allein die Berliner Polizei im vergangenen Jahr 71 Sexualdelikte von Zuwanderern gezählt, die in einem Wohnheim für Geflüchtete begangen wurden.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Flüchtlinge und sexuelle Übergriffe: Wo ist der Zusammenhang?

Anteil der angezeigten Flüchtlinge deutlich gestiegen – aber gab es tatsächlich mehr Übergriffe?

Fakt ist: Im Jahr 2015 registrierte die Polizei hierzulande laut Bundeskriminalamt 46.081 Straftaten gegen die sexuelle Selbstbestimmung – hierbei sind auch erfolglose Versuche erfasst. Im vergangenen Jahr waren es 47.401. Dies entspricht einem Plus von 2,9 Prozent.

Die Zahl der angezeigten Vergewaltigungen und sexuellen Nötigungen stieg sogar von rund 7000 um 12,8 Prozent auf rund 7900 im vergangenen Jahr – allerdings gab es mit 1132 erfassten Fällen geringfügig weniger gemeldete ""überfallartige Vergewaltigungen"" als noch 2015.

Über 37.400 Sexualdelikte, also mehr als vier Fünftel, wurden im vergangenen Jahr von der Polizei aufgeklärt. In 3404 dieser Straftaten wurde laut BKA mindestens ein Zuwanderer als Tatverdächtiger ermittelt – das sind 9,1 Prozent aller Verdächtigen und damit doppelt so viele als noch 2015.

Im Jahr 2012 war nicht einmal jeder zwanzigste Verdächtige ein Zuwanderer (1,8 Prozent). Als Zuwanderer definiert das BKA Asylbewerber, Geduldete, Bürgerkriegsflüchtlinge oder illegal in Deutschland lebende Migranten. Ihre Zahl nahm seit 2014 rasant zu. Alleine schon deshalb spielen sie in der Kriminalitätsstatistik eine zunehmend größere Rolle.

Bei den angezeigten Fällen von Vergewaltigung und schwerer sexueller Nötigung war in mehr als jedem siebten Fall (14,9 Prozent) ein Zuwanderer der Tatverdächtige – damit sind sie bei diesen Delikten im Vergleich zur Durchschnittsbevölkerung stark überrepräsentiert.

Bei den Tatverdächtigen für überfallartige Gruppen-Vergewaltigung, deren Zahl von 80 im Jahr 2015 auf 90 im vergangenen Jahr zulegte, machten Zuwanderer zuletzt sogar die Hälfte aller Verdächtigen aus.

""Verzerrte Statistik“ - Mehmet wird häufiger angezeigt als Max

Experten raten jedoch zur Vorsicht: Die BKA-Zahlen sagen nichts darüber aus, ob Flüchtlinge tatsächlich mehr Sexualstraftaten begehen.

Unklar bleibt etwa, ob ein Verdächtiger später auch verurteilt wurde, also seine Schuld zweifelsfrei erwiesen wurde. Die Zahlen sind Sicherheitsexperten zufolge stark abhängig von Ermittlungsschwerpunkten und Anzeigeverhalten. Sie sind keineswegs ein Abbild der tatsächlichen Kriminalität im Land.

""Nach den Silvester-Übergriffen von Köln ist die Sensibilität für Sexattacken gestiegen"", sagt Rettenberger. Er geht davon aus, ""dass seitdem Taten bei der Polizei angezeigt werden, die Frauen vorher gar nicht gemeldet hätten"".

Der Deliktanstieg könne demnach statt eines echten Zuwachses ""eine Verschiebung aus dem Dunkelfeld ins Licht der Öffentlichkeit sein"".

Für Pfeiffer, der viele Jahre Direktor des KFN war, ist jedenfalls klar: ""Man kann aufgrund der Polizeistatistik nicht einfach sagen, dass Flüchtlinge mehr Sexualdelikte begehen als Deutsche."" Es gebe ""viele Verzerrungsfaktoren"".

Der wohl Wichtigste: ""Fremde werden weit häufiger angezeigt als Einheimische"", betont Pfeiffer. Er verweist auf Studien des KFN: Wenn Max ein Sexualdelikt begehe, werde er von Anna zu 18 Prozent angezeigt – ist Mehmet der Täter liege die Wahrscheinlichkeit bei 44 Prozent, also gut zweieinhalbmal so hoch.

""Bei Flüchtlingen dürfte dieser Wert noch viel höher sein"", sagt er. In der Kriminalstatistik seien Zuwanderer alleine schon deshalb überrepräsentiert. Rettenberger geht ebenfalls davon aus, ""dass Flüchtlinge, weil sie Fremde sind, häufiger angezeigt werden"".

""Junge Männer sind überall auf der Welt krimineller""

Zudem sind besonders viele junge Männer als Flüchtlinge nach Deutschland gekommen. ""Und diese Altersgruppe ist auch unter den Deutschen – wie wohl in jedem anderen Land – für überproportional viele Straftaten verantwortlich"", erläutert Pfeiffer.

So stellte dem Kriminologie-Professor zufolge die Gruppe der 14- bis 30-Jährigen bundesweit im Jahr 2014 gerade einmal 9,3 Prozent der Bevölkerung. Sie war jedoch für mehr als jede zweite Gewaltstraftat (51 Prozent) verantwortlich. Demnach begingen junge Männer bereits vor der Flüchtlingskrise fünfmal so viele Gewaltdelikte wie der Durchschnitts-Bürger.

Bei Sexualdelikten seien die Zahlen ähnlich hoch, weiß der Forscher, der von 2000 bis 2003 für die SPD niedersächsischer Justizminister war.

Hier rächt sich offenbar der erschwerte Familiennachzug. ""Wer Frau und Kinder bei sich hat, begeht weniger Straftaten"", so Pfeiffer.

Zwar ist es Pfeiffer und Rettenberger zufolge ein Problem, dass viele Flüchtlinge aus Macho-Kulturen kämen. Doch klar ist den Experten zufolge auch: Die weit überwiegende Mehrheit der Menschen mit einem traditionellen oder gar mittelalterlichen Frauenbild wird nicht gewalttätig.

Pfeiffer gibt zu bedenken: Die große Zahl der Zuwanderer mit Bleibeperspektive wisse genau, dass jede Straftat ihre Chance, ""sich hier dauerhaft etwas aufzubauen, zerstören kann"". Dies vermindere bei vielen de Bereitschaft, Straftaten zu begehen.

Aus Sicht Rettenbergers machen auch die Lebensumstände manche Flüchtlinge zu Tätern. Denn vielen Asylsuchenden fehlen zunächst in den Erstaufnahme-Einrichtungen die soziale Integration, ein geregelter Tagesablauf und eine Arbeitsstelle. ""Unmut und Frustration sind die entscheidenden Quellen für Aggressivität und sexuelle Gewalt"", sagt der Kriminalpsychologe.

Die bayerische Mär von der massenhaften Zunahme an Vergewaltigungen

Ein Problem ist Experten zufolge die schlechte Kommunikation vieler Politiker, die glauben mit Zuspitzungen zur Flüchtlingskriminalität punkten zu können.

Selbst Polizeigewerkschafts-Chef Wendt sagt: ""Mit Kriminalstatistiken sollte man keinen Wahlkampf machen.""

So musste Landesinnenminister Joachim Herrmann die bayerische Vergewaltigungs-Statistik bereits kurz nach deren Vorstellung relativieren. Der CSU-Mann hatte behauptet, bayernweit habe im ersten Halbjahr mit 685 im Vergleich zum Vorjahr 48 Prozent mehr Vergewaltigungen gegeben.

Allerdings handelte es sich, wie das Ministerium später einräumen musste, um eine nicht einfach mit dem Vorjahr vergleichbare Zahl. Denn in der Statistik tauchen nach einer Gesetzesverschärfung seit diesem Jahr anders als noch 2016 nun auch sexuelle Nötigungen auf. Dies sowie ein verändertes Anzeigenverhalten sind nach Ansicht von Fachleuten wesentliche Ursachen für den Anstieg – doch bei der ersten Vorstellung der Zahlen war davon keine Rede.

Doch was kann der Staat gegen die vorhandenen Probleme unternehmen?

Pfeiffer empfiehlt, diejenigen Flüchtlinge, die wie etwa viele Nordafrikaner keine Bleibeperspektive haben, noch deutlich stärker als bislang mit freiwilligen Rückkehrprogrammen zur Ausreise zu bewegen. Wendt präferiert dagegen eine ""konsequente Abschiebung von Sexualstraftätern unter den Flüchtlingen"".

Diese schadeten ja auch den ""tatsächlich Verfolgten“, da das Misstrauen in der Bevölkerung sonst weiter zunehme. Klar ist aber auch: Bei manchen Bewohnern von Höhenkirchen-Siegertsbrunn wird es dauern, bis ihre Angst vergeht.

But as Weinstein faced new claims of serial rape, Theresa May’s spokesman signalled on Wednesday that he could lose the honour if found to have brought the system “into disrepute”.

In No.10′s strongest intervention yet in the controversy, the Prime Minister’s official spokesman stressed just how “unacceptable” she viewed the allegations against Weinstein and praised the “courage” of women who had come forward.

Downing Street’s words came as a group of senior Labour politicians urged the Honours Forfeiture Committee to act swiftly to start the process of stripping away the CBE.

BAFTA, the British equivalent of the Oscars, also announced it was suspending Weinstein from its membership.

Later, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences - which hosts the Oscars - said the sexual abuse allegations against Weinstein are “repugnant” and “abhorrent” and it will be holding a meeting on Saturday to discuss any action to be taken.

Barack and Michelle Obama became the latest high profile political figures to condemn the former movie producer, saying that they were “disgusted” by the reports.

The disgraced Hollywood producer faced new claims on Tuesday night that he had sexually harassed actresses Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie, along with many other women.

Weinstein has denied the charges of non-consensual sex “unequivocally”. In a statement, his spokeswoman said: “Mr Weinstein obviously can’t speak to anonymous allegations, but with respect to any women who have made allegations on the record, Mr Weinstein believes that all of these relationships were consensual.”

The PM’s official spokesman said that May found the latest reports “deeply concerning”.

“Any unwanted sexual activity is completely unacceptable and any allegations should be fully investigated.

“Anyone who comes forward to report these kind of allegations should be praised for their courage.”

He added: “The independent Honours Forfeiture Committee considers cases when the honours system is brought into disrepute. Their discussions are confidential. It’s right that we let them get on with their work.”

British MPs from all parties have urged the committee to take action.

도널드 트럼프가 국무장관 렉스 틸러슨에게 '나와 IQ 테스트를 해야 할 것'이라고 발언한 데 이어 고(高)지능인들의 국제단체 멘사 미국 지부가 중재에 나섰다.

지난 7월부터 시작된 '멍청이와 IQ 테스트의 전쟁'에 대해서 살펴보자.

지난 10월 4일(현지시간) 미국 NBC는 복수의 관계자를 인용해 렉스 틸러슨 미 국무장관이 7월 20일 국방부 회의에서 트럼프 대통령에게 '멍청이(moron)'라고 부르며 격분했다고 전했다.

이 보도가 나가자마자 틸러슨 국무장관은 '긴급' 기자회견을 열고 '그(트럼프)는 영리하다'라고 추켜세우며 이러한 보도를 부인했다.

그러나 트럼프에겐 응어리가 남았다. 10일(현지시간) 포브스가 발행한 인터뷰에서 트럼프는 렉스 틸러슨이 자신을 가리켜 '멍청이'라고 말했다는 보도에 대해 이렇게 말했다.

""난 그게 가짜뉴스라고 생각한다. 그러나 만약 그렇게 말했다면 (틸러슨은) 나랑 IQ 테스트를 해봐야 할 것이다. 그리고 누가 이길지는 뻔하다.""

두 거물의 지능 싸움이 성사될지 모른다는 기대감에 미국 멘사는 더힐에 이렇게 밝혔다.

""미국 멘사는 기쁜 마음으로 트럼프 대통령과 틸러슨은 장관을 위한 테스팅 세션을 마련할 수 있습니다.""

또한 미국 멘사는 공식 트위터 계정에 아래와 같은 글을 남기기도 했다.

Am 15. Oktober wählt Österreich einen neuen Kanzler

Die Spitzenkandidaten der fremdenfeindlichen FPÖ und der konservativen ÖVP trafen am Sonntag in einem TV-Duell aufeinander

Die Harmonie zwischen Kurz und Strache deutet auf eine mögliche schwarz-blaue Koalition hin

Am kommenden Sonntag wählen die Österreicher ein neues Parlament – und schon jetzt deutet sich eine beunruhigende Regierungskonstellation an. Eine so genannte schwarz-blaue Koalition aus der regierungserfahrenen ÖVP und der rechtspopulistischen FPÖ gilt als immer wahrscheinlicher.

Beim TV-Duell am Sonntag zeigten FPÖ-Chef Heinz-Christian Strache und der konservative ÖVP-Obmann Sebastian Kurz, wie wohlgesonnen sie sich sind.

Gleich zu Beginn der Diskussionsrunde auf dem Sender Puls4 kam es zu einer bemerkenswerten Szene.

FPÖ-Mann Strache schenkte dem 31-jährigen ÖVP-Chef eine Ausgabe des beliebten Detektivspiels ‘Cluedo‘. “Vielleicht könnt mer das mit dem Herrn Kern spielen, vielleicht kommt man da drauf wer wirklich die Verantwortung hat,” schlug Strache vor.

Er bezog sich damit auf die Facebook-Hetzkampagne gegen den Außenminister, hinter der die sozialdemokratische Partei von Kanzler Christian Kern stecken soll.

Der Feind meines Feindes

Kurz und Kern hatten ihre Differenzen bereits in einem vorangegangenen Duell ausgetragen. Das sogenannte “Dirty Campaigning” war das am heftigsten diskutierte Thema. Kurz’ Partei ÖVP hatte am Freitag sogar eine Klage wegen Verhetzung gegen die Sozialdemokraten angekündigt.

Auf Facebook-Seiten mit den Namen ""Wir für Sebastian Kurz"" und die ""Wahrheit über Sebastian Kurz"" waren rassistische Inhalte im Namen des ÖVP-Chefs verbreitet worden. Laut einer Recherche des österreichischen Magazins ""Profil"" und der Zeitung ""Die Presse"" soll der in Israel festgenommene Ex-Kern-Berater Tal Silberstein hinter der Kampagne stecken.

Zunächst war jedoch die fremdenfeindliche FPÖ in den Verdacht geraten, hinter den Fake-Profilen zu stecken. Ob tatsächlich die SPÖ den Auftrag zur Silberstein-Kampagne gegeben hat, ist zwar noch unklar. Klar ist jedoch, dass ÖVP und FPÖ in der Reaktion zusammengerückt sind.

""Geschenksackerl für den Hund""

Während sich Kurz und Kern zankend in den Haaren lagen, verlief das Duell zwischen Strache und Kurz so weitaus harmonischer. Fast freundschaftlich.

Auch Kurz’ machte dem FPÖ-Mann – so sah es die Sendung vor – ein Geschenk – und auch sein Präsent hatte einen starken symbolischen Wert. Er überreichte dem Kontrahenten ein “Geschenksackerl” für dessen Hund – bekanntlich der billigste Trick um sich Freunde zu machen. “Sie haben einen wirklich coolen Hund, den ich immer wieder auf Facebook bewundern darf”, legte der Shootingstar der österreichischen Politik nach.

Koalition is in the air

Die Debatte verlief dann auch weiter ohne große Reibungen. In vielen Punkten pflichteten sich die Gegner bei.

Etwa was die militärische Neutralität Österreichs anbelangt: Strache bekräftigte seine Überzeugung, Österreich solle niemals Teil eines internationalen Verteidigungsbündnisses werden. “Das wollen wir unseren Kindern und Kindeskindern ersparen, dass wir nie wieder in einen Offensivkrieg oder Konflikt hinein gezogen werden”.

Kurz widersprach nicht, hielt jedoch fest, dass er sich eine stärkere Zusammenarbeit auf europäischer Ebene im Kampf gegen den Terror wünsche. Das hieße aber keineswegs, dass dies auf Basis einer europäischen Armee oder eines NATO-Beitritts geschehen müsse.

Und selbst wenn Uneinigkeit herrschte, legten die beiden einen bemerkenswert respektvollen Umgangston an den Tag, etwa im Punkt Migration.

Auf die Kritik des FPÖ-Mannes an seinem späten Umschwung in der Migrationspolitik (“2015 sind sie noch auf dem Schoß von Frau Merkel gesessen"") reagierte Kurz mit einem Verweis auf das Koalitionsabkommen mit der SPÖ, die er nicht überstimmen wollte.

""Ich hätte liebend gerne mit ihnen gestimmt, dass keine Familienbeihilfe ins Ausland geht, und vieles andere“, erklärte Kurz. Der Außenminister machte keinen Hehl daraus, dass er bereit ist, Politik mit den Rechten zu machen.

Er sprach von den großen Fortschritten, die man seit 2015 gemacht habe. Die illegale Migration konnte “massiv begrenzt werden”, stellte der Außenminister fest und fügte hinzu: “Ich lad’ Sie ein, unterstützen Sie mich dabei, diesen Kurs weiter fortzusetzen”.

Darf man das schon als Koalitionswunsch verstehen?



“Duett mit wenig Misstönen”

Der österreichische “Kurier” glaubt genau das: ""Man merkt, dass da zwei mögliche Partner miteinander diskutiert haben,” wird der ehemalige österreichische Moderator Gerald Groß in der Analyse des Duells zitiert. Weiterhin kommt die Zeitung zu dem Schluß: Manchmal hatte man den Eindruck, dass die beiden sich geradezu überwinden müssen, einander zu kritisieren.



Auch das Boulevardmedium “OE24” findet, dass sich beide inhaltlich über weite Strecken einig waren. “Die Presse” schreibt von einem “Duett mit wenigen Misstönen”.

Am Ende gab es nochmal Geschenke: Shootingstar Kurz überreichte Strache ein Buch über ÖVP-Stammvater Alois Mock, “das daran erinnern soll, dass wir Österreicher, wenn wir wollen, die Kraft haben in Europa wirklich etwas zu bewirken.”

Ob Kurz und Strache dieses Projekt tatsächlich gemeinsam angehen, wird die Wahl am 15. Oktober zeigen.","TV-Duell in Österreich: Eine Szene zeigt, was dem Land nach der Wahl blühen könnte",http://www.huffingtonpost.de/2017/10/09/tv-duell-in-osterreich-ei_n_18222682.html?utm_hp_ref=germany#comments

Ce jeu de Monopoly alimentaire mondial est fou. Il tue l'emploi chez nous et chez les autres, il détruit la vie rurale de nos campagnes, il accélère la déforestation de la forêt amazonienne, il sacrifie notre souveraineté alimentaire.

Hier, la Commission européenne a rendu compte des négociations en cours devant la Commission de l'Agriculture du Parlement européen. Cette réunion se déroulait à huis-clos devant les députés.

Le négociateur en chef a annoncé que le dossier était pratiquement finalisé et qu'il espérait conclure dans quelques semaines, en décembre 2017.

En octobre 2016, l'Union européenne a fait une offre qui permettra, selon elle, de gagner des marchés pour les secteurs européens de l'automobile, de l'équipement, de la chimie et de la pharmacie. Les assurances et les banques seront également bien servies, sans oublier bien entendu les services environnementaux et les grandes entreprises de l'alimentation et de la distribution.

This year India went through one of the single biggest tax reforms since Independence. Designed to unify the country into a common market, the Goods and Services Tax promises to transform India's economy. But only a few months in, the cracks are beginning to show.

The GST is crippling India's craft communities and as always, it's the poor that suffer the most.

So why does this news bother me? Well, as a retailer of fair trade handloom accessories crafted by artisans in India, it makes sense for me to keep my ear to the ground. But it's more than that. I have a huge respect for those artisans who create such beautiful textiles.

Scouring the news online, I click through sad images of skinny artisans sat by idle handlooms. Handlooms that once filled the room with their clattering sounds, now lie silent. I see protests taking place all over India. Angry fists punching the air. Orchestrated strikes rising up from as far as Andhra Pradesh to Bengal. I read about Kashmiri carpet weavers with no work and sweet shops in Kolkota staging strikes.

It's affected a lot of people in the craft industry. In particular, rural self employed handloom weavers. Previously taxed at 0%, they now have to pay a 5% tax on raw materials. Manufacturing costs have gone up, orders have stopped coming in and rigorous paperwork mixed with confusing processes has disabled the illiterate.



Photo by Igor Ovsyannykov on Unsplash

Eleven million people work in the craft industry and many are either semi-literate or illiterate. They don't have registered businesses or accountants to help file their online returns, which now have to be completed three times a month. With no access to a computer, an accountant or an essential GST number to sell and ship their products, the future looks grim.

Wanting to find out more, I contacted House of Wandering Silk founder Katherine Neumann. As a social enterprise partner, I was keen to find out her thoughts;

The VAT tax system before was a big mess - full of loopholes and different across states and with so many tax brackets. GST helps to streamline and standardise the tax system here and has closed out a lot of the loopholes. But I think it was a mistake to raise taxes on the handloom sector. Some of our partners have had their textiles stuck with them, unable to post, as the couriers are demanding GST numbers to ship their goods. These people shouldn't be required to pay taxes. India has a very low rate of taxpayers, in other words most people and businesses are evading taxes. I think it would make more sense to focus on those who should be paying lots of taxes and make sure they do.

The harsh realities are that many artisans live below the poverty line in sub-standard mud brick housing. The majority are women, which in India brings with it huge challenges of gender, caste and social inequality. Though not reported widely, many weavers have succumbed to suicide, as increasing debt, rising prices of raw materials and shrinking markets push them over the edge. With little access to infrastructure, competition from cheaper machine-made textiles and profiteering middlemen - the GST just seems to be another blow to the already hard life of an artisan.



Photo by Igor Ovsyannykov on Unsplash

The issues haven't affected my business - yet. However I'm concerned about the future of handloom. The handloom sector is the second largest economy in India. Almost 95% of the world's hand-woven cloth is from here. Taking influence from the diverse cultures and regions of India, it's labour intensive methods and skills passed down through generations, has earned the respect of the world. So why isn't it celebrated in India like it is in the luxury market overseas? To see the decline of this industry would be a huge cultural blow to India and to us. As one of the most sustainable and green economies, the Indian government should be pushing this industry globally. It seems ironic that they are not doing more, considering there are many government funded fairs and events promoting weavers and textiles. There's even a National Handloom Day.

On one hand the Indian government champions its craft industry but on the other, it's taxing the very means by which the industry can prosper. It's preventing the poor from even earning enough to survive. By inadvertently targeting the vulnerable, they are alienating talent and potentially contributing to the exodus of rural workers, who would be forced to close their businesses and seek alternative employment in towns and cities.

As a brand that promotes the beauty of textiles and skills of artisans to a global market, I hope the protests don't fall on deaf ears and the movement to bring tax relief to the handloom industry succeeds.

Speaking to The Indian Express, Krishnan, who hails from the C Pulaya community in Thrissur, said, ""I never felt any discrimination over caste. For the past five years, I was working as a priest at Devi Temple at Valiyakulangara in Ernakulam district. Today, when I left, many non-Dalit visitors to the temple turned emotional.""

Krishnan, who was born to daily-wage laborers Ravi PK and Leela, told The Times of India that he was fascinated with temples since age six and that he had started learning Sanskrit from Class V. The young priest is presently pursuing his MA in Sanskrit Literature.

Krishnan told TOI, ""This is the culture of Kerala. The nation should follow this.""

The new Dalit recruits have reportedly been told to join their allotted temples in 15 days.

Kerala Hindu Aikya Vedi general secretary E S Biju told The Indian Express that there have been protests against the appointment of Dalits as priests in the past. ""However, now there is a change in the mindset of people. The concern of the faithful is that the priests should be well-versed in temple matters and should lead a life becoming of a priest,"" he said.

The recruitment of the Dalit priests comes ahead of the 81st anniversary of the historic Temple Entry proclamation on November 12. PTI pointed out that the royal decree opened temples in the erstwhile state of Travancore to those who were regarded as lower caste Hindus.

""Eine schrecklich nette Familie "" mit Christina Applegate können Sie sich bei Amazon Prime ansehen

Christina Applegate

Als Kelly ""Dumpfbacke"" Bundy wurde sie mit der Erfolgssitcom ""Eine schrecklich nette Familie"" (1987-1997) bekannt. Alles andere als dumm war dagegen ihre Entscheidung für das Leben: 2008 ließ sich Christina Applegate nach einer Brustkrebs-Diagnose die Original-Brüste entfernen. Vor zwei Wochen wurden ihr auch Eierstöcke und Eileiter entfernt.

Angelina Jolie

Eine riesige Welle schlug auch das öffentliche Bekenntnis zur Brust-OP von Hollywood-Superstar und Sex-Symbol Angelina Jolie. Sie hatte sich 2013 die Brüste entfernen lassen, ein Jahr später folgten die Eierstöcke - ""Meine Kinder werden nicht sagen müssen: 'Meine Mutter ist an Eierstockkrebs gestorben'.""

Anastacia

Sängerin Anastacia (49) wählte ebenfalls die drastische Variante, nachdem sie seit der Diagnose 2003 jahrelang gegen den Brustkrebs angekämpft hatte. Als der Krebs 2013 wiederkam, unterzog sie sich einer beidseitigen Mastektomie.

Rita Wilson

Das Thema erneut auf den Tisch gebracht hat Filmemacherin Rita Wilson (60, ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding""). Wie sie 2015 bekanntgab, war bei ihr Brustkrebs diagnostiziert worden, woraufhin sie sich zur OP entschloss.

Olivia Newton-John

Bei dem britisch-australischen ""Grease""-Star Olivia Newton-John (69) wurde 1992 Brustkrebs diagnostiziert. Sie unterzog sich einer Mastektomie. 25 Jahre lang hörte man nichts mehr zum Thema. Tolle Aussichten eigentlich, doch leider gab die Künstlerin im Mai 2017 bekannt, erneut gegen die heimtückische Krankheit ankämpfen zu müssen.

Sharon Osbourne

Reality-Star und Schockrocker-Gattin Sharon Osbourne (65) erhoffte sich ebenfalls viel von der drastischen Operation. Die Angst vor einem möglichen Brustkrebs veranlasste auch sie dazu, sich beide Brüste abnehmen zu lassen, wie sie 2012 bekanntgab.

Kathy Bates

Auch Kathy Bates (69, ""Misery"") veröffentlichte 2012, dass sie sich wegen Brustkrebs ihre beiden Brüste abnehmen ließ. ""Nach langer Überlegung habe ich eine doppelte Mastektomie vornehmen lassen. Zum Glück muss ich mich keiner Strahlen- oder Chemotherapie unterziehen"", erklärte sie damals in einem Interview. Zuvor hatte sie bereits ihren Eierstockkrebs überstanden.

Patricia Kelly

Kurz vor ihrem 40. Geburtstag wurde bei Patricia Kelly (47) Brustkrebs diagnostiziert. Daraufhin ließ sie sich im Oktober 2010 das Gewebe in ihrer Brust herausoperieren. ""Es hat unmenschlich wehgetan. Man hatte das Gefühl, als wenn tausend Messer die Brust zerschneiden. Es brannte alles wie Feuer"", schilderte die Sängerin die Operation später im Interview mit ""Stern TV"". Seitdem trägt sie eine Prothese.

Wie genau die OP abläuft, erklärte der einstige Kelly-Family-Star im Interview auch: ""Der Innenbereich, also das Gewebe wurde entfernt, die Haut bleibt bestehen und die Prothese ersetzt das Gewebe."" Sie sei dankbar, dass sie sich trotz der Prothese weiblich fühlen könne und freut sich: ""Ich hätte vor der OP nie gedacht, dass es so schön ist.

Das TV-Duell vor der Niedersachsenwahl wurde zu einem hitzigen Wettstreit

SPD-Ministerpräsident Weil präsentierte sich gut aufgelegt – bei einer Frage verlor er den Faden

Gewissermaßen ist die Landtagswahl in Niedersachsen schon jetzt die bessere Bundestagswahl. Wenige Tage bevor die Wähler über das neue Parlament in Hannover abstimmen, bewegen sich CDU und SPD in Umfragen auf Augenhöhe.

Auch beim TV-Duell der Spitzenkandidaten Stephan Weil (SPD) und Bernd Althusmann (CDU) am Dienstagabend mussten Zuschauer die Differenzen der Volksparteien nicht mit der Lupe suchen.

Stattdessen lieferten sich Ministerpräsident Weil und sein konservativer Herausforderer ein leidenschaftliches Duell.

Der SPD-Kandidat, den viele nach dem plötzlichen Verlust der Regierungsmehrheit nach dem Fraktionsübertritt der Grünen Elke Twesten bereits angezählt hatten, konnte Althusmanns Angriffe über weite Strecken abwehren.

Sonntagsfrage #LTWNds Niedersachsen • INSA/BILD: SPD 33 %, CDU 32 %, GRÜ 10 %, FDP 10 %, AfD 7 %, LIN 5 %, Son 3 % – https://t.co/3YZHdks9fW pic.twitter.com/7MkZqClZtU — Wahlrecht.de (@Wahlrecht_de) 9. Oktober 2017

Nur bei einer entscheidenden Frage kam der SPD-Mann ins Schwimmen. Dabei hätte er es besser wissen müssen.

Weil will sich nicht zu Rot-Rot-Grün äußern

Als die Frage nach möglichen Koalitionen nach dem Urnengang der Niedersachsen am Sonntag aufkam, schaltete Althusmann auf Angriff. Auch der CDU-Kandidat weiß, dass ein rot-rot-grünes Bündnis – anders als im Bund – in Niedersachsen in Reichweite ist.

""Vielleicht äußern Sie sich dazu heute mal"", forderte der CDU-Mann in Bezug auf die Linkspartei. ""Sie eiern herum.""

Für die Konservativen ist das links-grün-sozialdemokratische Miteinander ein Schreckgespenst. Und auch Weil schien sich nicht offensiv zu einer solchen Option positionieren zu wollen.

Der Sozialdemokrat blockte recht ungeschickt ab: Man befasse sich natürlich äußerst kritisch mit den Linken. ""Das ist eine ganz klare Aussage."" War es nicht.

Fast war es, als habe der Ministerpräsident das Bundes-Desaster der SPD gar nicht mitbekommen, als die Sozialdemokraten den Wahlkampf mit der Ambition den Kanzler zu stellen bestritten, aber keine Regierungsoption präsentieren konnten. Viele SPDler an der Basis hatten sich ein frühes Bekenntnis zu Rot-Rot-Grün gewünscht.

Im Fall Twesten kann Weil punkten

Bei anderen Themen sah der SPD-Mann aus Hamburg besser aus. Die CDU habe sich im Fall Twesten unanständig verhalten, polterte Weil. ""Das bleibt in den Hinterköpfen der Menschen, weit über SPD-geneigte Kreise hinaus"", erklärte er und sprach damit ein für den CDU-Herausforderer kritisches Thema an.

Auch der Ministerpräsident merkte, dass er einen Treffer gelandet hatte. Er verstehe ja, dass Althusmann nicht über den Parteiwechsel der Grünen-Abgeordneten reden wolle, der die Wahl erst nötig gemacht hatte, legte er nach. ""Das war ein schwerer Fehler – ich glaube, das hängt Ihnen wie ein Mühlstein um den Hals, Herr Althusmann.“

Der konterte eher halbherzig: ""Sie hat sich entschieden, in die CDU-Fraktion zu kommen.""

Bildungspolitik und Dieselskandal

Das im zweitgrößten Bundesland wichtigste Wahlkampfthema ist die Bildungspolitik. Für Althusmann boten sich hier im TV-Duell des NDR die besten Chancen zur Attacke. Der CDU-Mann war bis 2013 selbst Kultusminister, der rot-grünen Schulpolitik wird derweil zumeist ein eher bescheidenes Zeugnis ausgestellt.

""Nicht versetzt"", urteilte Althusmann daher. Besonders am Konzept der Inklusion machte er sich zu Schaffen. Die SPD habe bei der Integration von Kindern mit Behinderung in den Schulalltag zu viel gewollt: ""Wir brauchen dringend eine Atempause."" Weil vertrat den gegensätzlichen Standpunkt: Inklusion sei nunmal ein Menschenrecht.

Der ambitionierte Plan sei umsetzbar, auch weil seine Regierung mehr Pädagogen und Betreuer eingestellt habe. Ohnehin habe auch Althusmann in seiner Zeit als Kultusminister viele Fehler gemacht, die es nun auszubaden gelte, so die Meinung des Ministerpräsidenten.

Bei einem anderen Thema wollte Weil dagegen lieber auf die Bremse treten. Das Thema VW sei ""zu wichtig, um damit Wahlkampf zu machen"". Althusmann dagegen ätzte, Weil lasse sich von den Konzernchefs vorführen. Vom Dieselskandal habe der VW-Aufsichtsrat aus den Medien erfahren.

Weil muss sich noch immer vorwerfen lassen, eine Regierungserklärung nach dem Abgas-Skandal vorher mit dem Konzern abgestimmt zu haben.

So war es der CDU-Mann, der wohl den empfindlichsten Treffer landete: ""Sie sind am Ende vom Konzern-Vorstand durch die Manege gezogen worden.""

It's no wonder that some boys grow up to sexually assault women and others grow up wanting to protect them.","""As someone who knows fans of country music, I was horrified by the mass shooting at a concert in Las Vegas"" ― said no one ever. That's because you only need to be human to understand that fatally gunning down 58 people and wounding hundreds of others is a heinous, immoral act.

In the same vein, you should only need to be human to understand that it's wrong when a man sexually harasses and assaults a woman, grabbing her body without her permission, demanding she put her hands on his naked flesh, blocking her from leaving a room, or pushing her head down to his crotch.

These are all things that Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein did to young women who were looking to him as a potential mentor and boss, according to accounts in The New York Times and The New Yorker. If they didn't comply, Weinstein reportedly threatened that he'd end their careers.

Clearly bad stuff.

Yet at least a couple of celebrity men put out statements or gave interviews about these revelations with a qualifier ― emphasizing that as fathers of daughters, they found this behavior abhorrent.

""Look, even before I was famous, I didn't abide this kind of behavior,"" mega-star Matt Damon said in an interview with Deadline Hollywood in which he condemned Weinstein's behavior and denied reports that he had helped cover it up. ""But now, as the father of four daughters, this is the kind of sexual predation that keeps me up at night. This is the great fear for all of us.""

Later in the interview, Damon says, ""We have to be vigilant and we have to help protect and call this stuff out, because we have our sisters and our daughters and our mothers.""

Ben Affleck also took care to mention that we need to do better in ""protecting our sisters, friends, coworkers and daughters."" (Weinstein has several daughters, and that doesn't seem to have checked his behavior in any way.)

Singer Vanessa Carlton urged actress Gwyneth Paltrow to speak out because she has a daughter ― as if the pain of Weinstein's other victims and possible future victims wasn't enough.

Daughter qualifiers played an even bigger role in Pussygate one year ago, when Republicans rushed to condemn Donald Trump's statements on the now-infamous ""Access Hollywood"" tape.

""Such vile degradations demean our wives and daughters,"" tweeted former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney at the time.

""As the grandfather of two precious girls,"" Jeb Bush said, ""I find that no apology can excuse away Donald Trump's reprehensible comments degrading women.""

As I wrote back then, the implication behind these kinds of statements is that women are only worthy of basic respect in relation to men.

If a man is killed or murdered, it's much harder to find similar quotes from politicians talking about their sons and fathers and grandsons.

That's because men see each other as humans. And a lot of men still don't view girls or women that way. Indeed, almost from birth, boys and girls are taught that they're very different from each other. And stereotypes about how girls are weak and boys are strong are drilled into kids. It's no wonder that some boys grow up to sexually assault women and others grow up wanting to protect them.

In a sense, sexual assault is the flip side of the ""daughter statement."" In both situations, a woman is an object ― to grope or to protect from groping. She's not a person, but a thing that men have power over.

Of course, having children is extremely meaningful. And, yes, some parents feel a heightened urge to guard their offspring that also leads them to feel heightened empathy for other kids. At least, that's been the case for me personally. And the truth is, for men, having a daughter can be somewhat transformative.

But that's simply not a prerequisite for feeling empathy for victims of sexual assault.

Not everyone felt compelled to mention their offspring in their recent statements about Weinstein. Former President Barack Obama, whose own daughter interned for the producer, made no mention of the fact that he is the father of girls in his statement on Tuesday.

""Michelle and I have been disgusted by the recent reports of Harvey Weinstein. Any man who demeans and degrades women in such fashion needs to be condemned and held accountable, regardless of wealth or status,"" Obama wrote.

""We should celebrate the courage of women who have come forward to tell these painful stories,"" he added. ""And we all need to build a culture, including by empowering our girls and teaching our boys decency and respect, so we can make such behavior less prevalent in the future.""

ANALYSIS

The numbers don't seem to add up for Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa in his bid to succeed President Jacob Zuma as leader of the governing ANC. That's if a first glance at the provincial voting allocations are anything to go by.

And David Mabuza, the ANC strongman in Mpumalanga and its provincial chairperson there, is now the kingmaker. He has recently advanced the candidature of Zweli Mklhize, the ANC's treasurer general, as a unity candidate.

There has been a surge in voting delegates in Mpumalanga and North West. This is bad news for Ramaphosa.

Gwede Mantashe, the ANC's secretary general, forwarded the final tally for voting delegates to all nine provincial secretaries on Friday, and it seems to indicate that Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, President Zuma's preferred candidate, to be in a very strong position ahead of the party's elective conference in December.

According to the letter by Mantashe 4 723 branch delegates will have the right to vote. The calculation is based on one voting delegate per branch that has 100 paid-up members. For every 250 paid-up members extra, branches receive one extra voting delegates. The branch delegates will be joined by representatives from the leagues, who also have voting rights. Provinces' voting size is based on proportional representation given the number of members in ""good standing"", or paid-up.

First thoughts

1. KwaZulu-Natal is still the biggest and most influential voting bloc, with 870 voting delegates for a share of 18,4%. No wonder Zuma is pushing for the provincial executive committee to appeal the ruling which disbanded it.

2. There has been a surge in voting delegates in Mpumalanga and North West. This is bad news for Ramaphosa.

3. The Eastern Cape has relinquished its position as the second biggest province in the ANC -- and that's even worse news for Ramaphosa.

4. Mabuza, Mpumalanga's premier, is now a kingmaker. His province's share of voting delegates jumped by 57,6% from 2012, from 467 delegates to 736 delegates and is now the second biggest voting bloc.

4. North West, where Supra Mahumapelo holds sway, more than doubled its share of voting delegates, jumping by 130%.

5. The erstwhile ""premier league"" (Free State, North West and Mpumalanga) command 35% of the vote, although Mabuza has since denounced its existence.

6. Limpopo, his place of birth, might be ray of light for Ramaphosa. (He has won the endorsement of the provincial chairperson as well as its biggest region.) It will be the fourth largest voting bloc at Nasrec with 13,6% of the voting delegates.

7. Dlamini-Zuma's path to the presidency: She needs KwaZulu-Natal, plus North West, Free State and Mpumalanga.

8. Ramaphosa's path to the presidency: He seemingly has the Eastern Cape, Western and Northern Cape, Gauteng and Limpopo. He needs Mpumalanga.

9. Dlamini-Zuma will win if she gets Mpumalanga, even if Limpopo goes to Ramaphosa.

10. The leagues (women, youth and veterans) will vote as provinces. Their share has yet to be determined, but all have pledged loyalty to Dlamini-Zuma.

Provincial voting allocations (Mangaung 2012 in brackets):

KwaZulu-Natal 870 (974) 18,4%

This morning, conservative radio host Erick Erickson wrote a piece asking everyone to “revisit Mike Pence’s rule about meeting with women alone” in light of the Weinstein allegations. “Mike Pence could never be accused of wanting to have sex with someone other than his wife in these sorts of situations because he avoids putting himself and the other person into these situations,” he wrote. There are a few obvious problems with the suggestion that men must avoid being alone in a room (or at a restaurant table) with a woman in order to avoid committing sexual harassment ― or at least avoid charges of harassment. First, it implies that men are unable to control their own behavior when in the presence of a woman, and that men have no way of gauging the difference between a professional relationship and a sexual or sexually violating one. (Men, you deserve better than that! I believe in your ability to interact with a woman and not harass or assault her!) It also implies that when women agree to a one-on-one professional meeting with a man, they are putting themselves in harm’s way ― just a hop, skip and a jump away from “asking for it.”

Additionally, when men, who tend to still be the gatekeepers of any industry, decide that they must roll back spending time with their woman colleagues or employees, it can have real, lasting impact on those women’s careers. A recent New York Times report looked at the ways powerful men across industries have begun scaling back their interactions with female colleagues because of a fear that they might end up facing harassment allegations. “In Silicon Valley, some male investors have declined one-on-one meetings with women, or rescheduled them from restaurants to conference rooms,” reported Claire Cain Miller. “On Wall Street, certain senior men have tried to avoid closed-door meetings with junior women. And in TV news, some male executives have scrupulously minded their words in conversations with female talent.” Professional intimacy and relationship-building are key to advancing in any industry. That’s how lower-level employees find mentors or sponsors, or find out about new professional challenges. People give opportunities and recognition to people they trust, and that trust is built through person-to-person interaction ― both at the office and outside of it. When men decide to limit their interactions with women in order to “protect” women (and themselves), the only people who lose out are those women. Ultimately, the problem isn’t that a woman might be asked to meet a film executive or an investor or her male boss at [insert any company here] for coffee; the problem is that the film executive/investor/boss might use that meeting to exploit her. Let’s put the onus for professional behavior where it belongs ― on the male power-brokers ― rather than punishing the women who have to deal with their predatory behavior.",Men Argue Sexual Assault Is Just What Happens When Men Meet With Women,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/10/12/men-argue-sexual-assault-is-just-what-happens-when-men-meet-with-women_a_23241006/?utm_hp_ref=au-homepage

A committee set up by the University Grants Commission (UGC) has suggested removing the words ""Muslim"" from Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) and ""Hindu"" from Banaras Hindu University (BHU) to reflect the secular character of these central universities.

The Indian Express reported today that the suggestion was made by one of the five committees set up by the UGC to probe complaints of irregularities against ten central universities. While BHU was not in the audit, ordered by the Ministry of Human Resource Development (HRD), the committee mentioned the Varanasi-based university in its observations about AMU.

The committee suggested that Aligarh Muslim University be called Aligarh University or be named after its founder, Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, the newspaper further reported.

Speaking on the condition of anonymity, panel members told IE that AMU is a centrally funded university and its name should reflect it being a secular institution.

The committee has also described AMU as a ""feudal"" institution and called for measures to improve the circumstances of poor Muslims enrolled in the campus.

While underlining the problem of ""inbreeding"" at the campus, the committee pointed out that the majority of its faculty members were former students of AMU. It suggested a five-year gap before former students could be recruited in the faculty.

In its observation about AMU, the committee does not mention that the Bharatiya Janata Party government at the Centre is opposed to the minority status of the university and the matter is pending in the Supreme Court.

The BBC station first broadcast Douglas Adams’ sci-fi comedy in 1978. A further four series followed between 1980 and 2005, as well as a hit TV version in 1981.

‘Hexagonal Phase’ has been adapted from Eoin Colfer’s spin-off novel ‘And Another Thing…’, which was commissioned to mark the 30th anniversary of the first novel.

Simon Jones will again play the quintessentially English Arthur Dent, who travels through space and time following the destruction of Earth.

Rex Martin Freeman starred in the 2005 big screen adaption of the classic cult sci-fi comedy.

Speaking about reprising his role, Simon Jones said: “It seems extraordinary that it’s been forty years since we recorded the first pilot episode for BBC Radio; how modest were our expectations then, and how amazing a worldwide phenomenon it became, and continues to be.

“I never expected to still be searching for a decent cup of tea and some kind of answer to Life, the Universe and Everything almost a lifetime later.

“Still, the dressing-gown and towel may be a little threadbare, like my hair, but my voice, much to my surprise, hasn’t changed a decibel, and despite years in America, I can still talk Arthur’s ‘indignant-posh’.”

“‘GODDAMNIT! I TOLD HIM TO STOP DOING THAT’ you said that to my face. The press [conference] I was made to go to after assault. You lie,” she wrote to him.

The assault McGowan is referring to is most likely included in a bombshell New York Times report that said McGowan was one of at least eight women who had reached settlements with Weinstein over sexual harassment allegations. According to the Times, McGowan received a $100,000 settlement from Weinstein in 1997 after “an episode in a hotel room during the Sundance Film Festival.”

McGowan declined to comment for the Times (some speculated that she has kept quiet because her settlement may have involved a non-disclosure agreement). But that hasn’t stopped the 44-year-old from being vocal on Twitter since the Times report was published.

On Monday she tweeted the following to Affleck’s “Good Will Hunting” co-star and Weinstein friend Matt Damon, during her very public petitioning to dissolve The Weinstein Company board:

Hey @mattdamon what’s it like to be a spineless profiteer who stays silent? pic.twitter.com/rp0OrRrpqJ — rose mcgowan (@rosemcgowan) October 9, 2017

TheWrap founder Sharon Waxman also named Damon in a piece in which she claimed that while she was working for The New York Times, the paper killed a 2004 article she wrote on Weinstein’s sexual misconduct due in part to a phone call from Damon.

It looks like McGowan is going to keep speaking out. In the past day she has tweeted support for actress Asia Argento, who came forward about Weinstein assaulting her.

Representatives for McGowan and Affleck did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment on the situation.

McGowan also hit back and Michael Eisner, former CEO of Disney and president of Paramount Pictures, who tweeted Tuesday that he had fired the Weinstein brothers because they were “irresponsible.” Weinstein, he added, was an “incorrigible bully” but he “had no idea he was capable of these horrible actions.”

This year India went through one of the single biggest tax reforms since Independence. Designed to unify the country into a common market, the Goods and Services Tax promises to transform India's economy. But only a few months in, the cracks are beginning to show.

The GST is crippling India's craft communities and as always, it's the poor that suffer the most.

So why does this news bother me? Well, as a retailer of fair trade handloom accessories crafted by artisans in India, it makes sense for me to keep my ear to the ground. But it's more than that. I have a huge respect for those artisans who create such beautiful textiles.

Scouring the news online, I click through sad images of skinny artisans sat by idle handlooms. Handlooms that once filled the room with their clattering sounds, now lie silent. I see protests taking place all over India. Angry fists punching the air. Orchestrated strikes rising up from as far as Andhra Pradesh to Bengal. I read about Kashmiri carpet weavers with no work and sweet shops in Kolkota staging strikes.

It's affected a lot of people in the craft industry. In particular, rural self employed handloom weavers. Previously taxed at 0%, they now have to pay a 5% tax on raw materials. Manufacturing costs have gone up, orders have stopped coming in and rigorous paperwork mixed with confusing processes has disabled the illiterate.

Eleven million people work in the craft industry and many are either semi-literate or illiterate. They don't have registered businesses or accountants to help file their online returns, which now have to be completed three times a month. With no access to a computer, an accountant or an essential GST number to sell and ship their products, the future looks grim.

Wanting to find out more, I contacted House of Wandering Silk founder Katherine Neumann. As a social enterprise partner, I was keen to find out her thoughts;

The VAT tax system before was a big mess - full of loopholes and different across states and with so many tax brackets. GST helps to streamline and standardise the tax system here and has closed out a lot of the loopholes. But I think it was a mistake to raise taxes on the handloom sector. Some of our partners have had their textiles stuck with them, unable to post, as the couriers are demanding GST numbers to ship their goods. These people shouldn't be required to pay taxes. India has a very low rate of taxpayers, in other words most people and businesses are evading taxes. I think it would make more sense to focus on those who should be paying lots of taxes and make sure they do.

The harsh realities are that many artisans live below the poverty line in sub-standard mud brick housing. The majority are women, which in India brings with it huge challenges of gender, caste and social inequality. Though not reported widely, many weavers have succumbed to suicide, as increasing debt, rising prices of raw materials and shrinking markets push them over the edge. With little access to infrastructure, competition from cheaper machine-made textiles and profiteering middlemen - the GST just seems to be another blow to the already hard life of an artisan.

The issues haven't affected my business - yet. However I'm concerned about the future of handloom. The handloom sector is the second largest economy in India. Almost 95% of the world's hand-woven cloth is from here. Taking influence from the diverse cultures and regions of India, it's labour intensive methods and skills passed down through generations, has earned the respect of the world. So why isn't it celebrated in India like it is in the luxury market overseas? To see the decline of this industry would be a huge cultural blow to India and to us. As one of the most sustainable and green economies, the Indian government should be pushing this industry globally. It seems ironic that they are not doing more, considering there are many government funded fairs and events promoting weavers and textiles. There's even a National Handloom Day.

On one hand the Indian government champions its craft industry but on the other, it's taxing the very means by which the industry can prosper. It's preventing the poor from even earning enough to survive. By inadvertently targeting the vulnerable, they are alienating talent and potentially contributing to the exodus of rural workers, who would be forced to close their businesses and seek alternative employment in towns and cities.

As a brand that promotes the beauty of textiles and skills of artisans to a global market, I hope the protests don't fall on deaf ears and the movement to bring tax relief to the handloom industry succeeds.

After all, it's part of India's history and heritage. It's part of its DNA.",Hanging By A Thread: Why The Introduction Of India's Tax Reforms Is Crippling Craft Communities,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/harjit-sohoteykhan/hanging-by-a-thread-why-t_b_18219508.html?utm_hp_ref=uk&amp;ir=UK

Barnier told reporters in Brussels on Thursday that on the issue of the financial settlement, there have “been no negotiations on this subject”.

“On this question we have reached a state of deadlock which is very disturbing for thousands of project promoters in Europe and it’s disturbing also for taxpayers,” he added.

Barnier told a news conference that negotiators “worked in a constructive spirit” and clarified points, but were unable to make “any great steps forward”.

He added: “There is a new momentum and I remain convinced today that with political will, decisive progress is within our grasp in the next two months.”

The amount of money the UK will pay to meet financial commitments it made while still a member has been one of the main stumbling blocks in the negotiations.

Barnier said Britain had told the EU that it was not ready to specify how much it believed it should pay.

“Regarding that question we are at an impasse, which is very worrying for thousands of projects everywhere in Europe and also worrying for those who contribute,” Reuters reports.

In a gruesome incident that has come to light on Monday, a Nigerian national was allegedly tied to a post and beaten mercilessly in South Delhi's Malviya Nagar and all of it was caught on camera.

Reports suggest residents in the area claiming that he was caught trying to rob a house in the area, after which he was beaten up by residents of the area.

A video of the incident shows the man pleading for forgiveness as a he is beaten with what looks like a rod.

At one point in the video one can see a man holding up the man's feet while another person hits him on his feet with a rod.

NDTV reports that the victim was allegedly caught inside the home of Krishna Kumar and Kumar's neighbours claimed that he fell while trying to escape.

The report says that he was handed over to the police in a badly wounded state.

The police have told the news channel that action will be taken against the attackers based on evidence from the video.

The video posted by NDTV India shows how badly the man was attacked:

There have been several such incidents against people from African nations in the national capital region.

Students, belonging from African countries, were beaten up in several areas of NCR in March after residents of a Greater Noida society had alleged that a group of African student living there had kidnapped and drugged a teenager who later died.

A raging mob had beaten up helpless students in Greater Noida's Ansal Plaza mall.

The African Heads of Mission posted in New Delhi had strongly condemned the attacks and had called them ""xenophobic and racial in nature"".

A statement issued after a meeting of the envoys following the incident and dated March 31 said: ""As regards the recent unfortunate incident in Greater Noida, the African Heads of Mission strongly condemn the incident and express their deep concern and also take note that these reprehensible events both outstanding and unresolved cases against Africans, were not sufficiently condemned by the Indian authorities.

EU-Unterhändler Barnier beklagt eine ""Blockade"" der Gespräche durch die Briten

Der angestrebte Zeitplan gerät in Gefahr

Die Brexit-Verhandlungen haben ihr erstes Etappenziel klar verfehlt. Es gebe nicht genug Fortschritt, um die wichtige zweite Phase der Gespräche zu starten, stellte EU-Unterhändler Michel Barnier am Donnerstag fest.

Im Streit über die Schlussrechnung beim EU-Austritt Großbritanniens sprach Barnier gar von einer ""Blockade"". Brexit-Minister David Davis betonte hingegen, es gebe ""erhebliche Fortschritte"". Er appellierte an die EU, die Verhandlungen jetzt auszuweiten.

Der endgültige EU-Austritt der Briten steht bereits fest: Ende März 2019 will das Land die Europäischen Union verlassen. Ursprünglich wollten die Unterhändler wichtige Fragen der Trennung bis Mitte Oktober klären und danach über die künftigen Beziehungen sprechen. In nun mehr fünf Verhandlungsrunden gelang das aber nicht.

Barnier hofft auf Fortschritte

EU-Chefunterhändler Michel Barnier. Quelle: dpa

EU-Unterhändler Barnier sagte, er hoffe auf entscheidende Fortschritte in den kommenden zwei Monaten. Gelingt dies nicht, würde ein umfassendes Austrittsabkommen immer unwahrscheinlicher - ein Szenario, das vor allem die Wirtschaft auf beiden Seiten fürchtet.

Knackpunkt sind finanzielle Forderungen der EU für gemeinsam eingegangene Verpflichtungen in der mehr als 40-jährigen Mitgliedschaft des Vereinigten Königreichs.

Die britische Premierministerin Theresa May habe zwar versprochen, finanzielle Zusagen einzuhalten, sagte Barnier. In der fünften Verhandlungsrunde sei dies seit Montag aber nicht konkret unterfüttert worden. ""In dieser Frage stecken wir in einer Blockade"", kritisierte der EU-Vertreter.

Brexit-Minister Davis stellte klar, dass Großbritannien die finanziellen Zusagen erst im Zusammenhang mit den künftigen Beziehungen verhandeln wolle. In diesem Punkt sind sich beide Seiten also noch nicht einmal über die Abfolge einig.

Rechte der EU-Bürger in Großbritannien

Brexit-Minister David Davis. Quelle: dpa

Darüber hinaus ging es auch in dieser Runde um die künftigen Rechte der rund 3,2 Millionen EU-Bürger in Großbritannien und der 1,2 Millionen Briten in der übrigen EU. Hier stellten beide Seiten Fortschritte fest, aber auch noch viele Unstimmigkeiten.

Das gleiche gilt nach Darstellung von Davis und Barnier bei der Frage, wie die künftige EU-Grenze zwischen Irland und dem britischen Nordirland durchlässig gestaltet werden kann.

Davis machte deutlich, dass er die von der EU gewünschte Aufteilung in zwei Phasen nicht mehr akzeptiert. Der EU-Gipfel solle nächste Woche beschließen, Barniers Verhandlungsmandat auszuweiten, sagte er. Dass dies geschieht, gilt als sehr unwahrscheinlich.

Die 27 bleibenden EU-Länder geben sich bisher nach außen sehr einig. Sie sehen die Abfolge vor allem als Hebel, die Finanzforderungen durchzusetzen. Andernfalls würden sofort Milliardenlöcher im noch bis 2020 laufenden EU-Finanzrahmen klaffen.

""Kein Deal wäre ein sehr schlechter Deal""

Die zweite Phase der Verhandlungen dürfte dann aber noch komplizierter werden - deshalb will man sich dafür auch mehr Zeit nehmen. Dabei geht es um die von Großbritannien gewünschte ""tiefe und besondere Partnerschaft"" - also vor allem ein Handelsabkommen, aber auch die Zusammenarbeit in Sicherheits- und anderen Fragen.

Darüber hinaus soll über eine Übergangszeit gesprochen werden, um den Bruch für die Wirtschaft, aber auch für Bürger und Behörden sanfter zu gestalten.

Bis Oktober 2018 soll eigentlich alles in einem umfassenden Austrittsabkommen geregelt sein, das rechtzeitig vor dem Brexit Ende März 2019 ratifiziert und in Kraft gesetzt werden soll. Gelingt der Übergang in Phase zwei nicht bald, wird dieser Zeitplan zunehmend unrealistisch. Die britische Premierministerin Theresa May vertritt öffentlich die Ansicht, kein Abkommen sei besser als ein schlechtes.

Die EU verweist hingegen auf mögliche chaotische Folgen - von langen Staus an den Grenzen bis zu hohen Einfuhrzöllen auf beiden Seiten.

In der Schule scheinen nachts unerklärliche Dinge zu geschehen

Was die Kamera aufgezeichnet hat, seht ihr oben im Video

Was eine Überwachungskamera nachts in einer Schule aufgenommen hat, erinnert auf den ersten Blick an einen Horrorfilm. Die Aufnahmen stammen aus der Deerpark Christian Brothers School im irischen Cork. In dem Überwachungsvideo ist zu sehen, wie eine Tür plötzlich zuknallt.

Dann fängt einer der Spinde an, sich zu bewegen und wackelt wild hin und her

Bei einem anderen Spind springt die Tür auf und Blätter fliegen heraus. Zuletzt fällt wie von Geisterhand noch ein Warnschild um. Der stellvertretende Schulleiter Aaron Wolfe sagte dem TV-Sender “Fox 13 News“, dass er nicht glaube, dass es in der Schule spuke. Er könne sich aber auch nicht erklären, wie die seltsamen Ereignisse von statten gehen konnten.

Der Vize-Direktor glaubt nicht, dass es in der Schule spukt

Seiner Meinung nach sei die Schule ein gruseliger Ort. Einige Schüler berichten, dass Gegenstände verschwinden würden und sie angeblich ab und zu komische Geräusche hören würden. Dass es in der Schule jedoch tatsächlich spukt, darf angezweifelt werden. Viel wahrscheinlicher ist, dass sich ein paar Schüler einige Scherze erlaubt haben.

Das gilt auch für das Überwachungsvideo. Entweder handelt es sich hier um einen gut inszenierten Scherz oder jemand, der sich gut mit Spezialeffekten auskennt, hat seiner Kreativität freien Lauf gelassen.

The BBC station first broadcast Douglas Adams’ sci-fi comedy in 1978. A further four series followed between 1980 and 2005, as well as a hit TV version in 1981.

‘Hexagonal Phase’ has been adapted from Eoin Colfer’s spin-off novel ‘And Another Thing…’, which was commissioned to mark the 30th anniversary of the first novel.

Simon Jones will again play the quintessentially English Arthur Dent, who travels through space and time following the destruction of Earth.

Rex Martin Freeman starred in the 2005 big screen adaption of the classic cult sci-fi comedy.

Speaking about reprising his role, Simon Jones said: “It seems extraordinary that it’s been forty years since we recorded the first pilot episode for BBC Radio; how modest were our expectations then, and how amazing a worldwide phenomenon it became, and continues to be.

“I never expected to still be searching for a decent cup of tea and some kind of answer to Life, the Universe and Everything almost a lifetime later.

“Still, the dressing-gown and towel may be a little threadbare, like my hair, but my voice, much to my surprise, hasn’t changed a decibel, and despite years in America, I can still talk Arthur’s ‘indignant-posh’.”

Er warnte vor einer inhaltslosen Politik und dem Abstieg der Volksparteien

Nun droht dem einstigen Hoffnungsträger ein Debakel bei der Wahl - auch, weil er seine eigenen Warnungen ignorierte

Als die Kameras aus sind, ziehen sich die beiden Konkurrenten auf den Studiobalkon zurück.

Gerade eben hatte der österreichische Kanzler Christian Kern im TV-Duell noch bekräftigt, seinen Konkurrenten von der rechten FPÖ, Heinz-Christian Strache, und ihn würden ""Welten trennen"".

Nun rauchen beide zusammen und plaudern. Die Szene beschreibt der deutsche Journalist Philip Oltermann für den britischen ""Guardian"" - und sie steht symbolisch für das, was nach diesem Sonntag in Österreich geschehen könnte:

Die rechte FPÖ könnte Teil einer neuen Regierung werden - auch dank der sozialdemokratischen SPÖ von Kanzler Kern. Explizit ausgeschlossen hat Kern eine Koalition mit den Rechtspopulisten nämlich nicht.

Vor rund eineinhalb Jahren, als der Österreicher die Kanzlerschaft übernahm, waren sein Anspruch in der Politik und sein Verhältnis zu den rechten und radikalen Kräften im Land noch anders.

Ein Abgleich seiner Antrittsrede von damals und dem Stand jetzt, wenige Tage vor der Wahl des Nationalrats, zeigt, wie sehr die österreichische Bundesregierung versagt hat.

”Der schrecklich fesche Herr Kern”

Im Mai 2016 trat Kern die Nachfolge seines Parteikollegen Werner Faymann an, der nach sinkenden Umfragewerten und innerparteilicher Kritik am restriktiven Kurs in der Flüchtlingspolitik Konsequenzen zog.

Kern versprach einen Neustart der Beziehungen in der Regierungskoalition und in der Politik allgemein. Der 51-Jährige schien der richtige Typ dafür zu sein.

Als Quereinsteiger aus der Wirtschaft - von 2010 bis 2016 war Kern Chef der österreichischen Bahn - galt er als Hoffnungsträger und als einer, der Dinge anpackt. Der ""schrecklich fesche Herr Kern"", sei ein ""Macher, den die Menschen mögen"", kommentierte ""Spiegel Online"" wenige Monate nach Antritt des Politikers.

Für viel Aufsehen sorgte schon seine Antrittsrede am 17. Mai 2017. Darin rechnete Kern nicht nur mit den Eliten des Landes ab, sondern formulierte auch eine optimistische Vision für die Zukunft Österreichs.

Eine deutliche Warnung

Kern prangerte die ""Inhaltslosigkeit"" der Politik an. Und warnte deutlich:

Wenn wir so weitermachen – und ich habe dabei besonders die Bundesregierung (in Österreich, Anm. d. Red.) im Auge – wenn wir dieses Schauspiel weiter liefern, ein Schauspiel der Machtversessenheit und der Zukunftsvergessenheit, dann haben wir nur noch wenige Monate bis zum endgültigen Aufprall. Wenige Monate, bis das Vertrauen und die Zustimmung in der Bevölkerung restlos verbraucht sind.

Dazu gelte es, kurzfristige und langfristige Trendwenden einzuleiten, damit Österreich wieder ein Land werde, in dem ""Aufstieg in der Gesellschaft nicht nur ein leeres Wort ist, und nicht nur wenigen vorbehalten bleibt.""

Kern mahnte auch an, dass die Art und Weise der Zusammenarbeit der verkrachten Großen Koalition aus seiner SPÖ und der ÖVP sich dringend ändern müsse.

Denn er sei davon überzeugt: ""Wenn wir jetzt nicht kapiert haben, dass das unsere letzte Chance ist, dann werden die beiden Großparteien nach dieser Regierung von der Bildfläche verschwinden - und wahrscheinlich völlig zurecht.""

17 Monate später ist vieles von dem eingetreten, vor dem Kern noch so energisch gewarnt hatte.

Der Schmutzkübel

Zwar sind die Volksparteien nicht von der Bildfläche verschwunden. Die konservative ÖVP führt in den Umfragen deutlich mit 33 Prozent. Dahinter folgen jedoch gleich die Rechtspopulisten der FPÖ mit 27 Prozent.

Kerns SPÖ ist nach einem Höhenflug nach Amtsantritt des ""feschen Kanzlers"" auf 23 Prozent abgestürzt.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: TV-Duell in Österreich: Eine Szene zeigt, was dem Land nach der Wahl blühen könnt

Ein Grund ist auch: Die Inhaltslosigkeit der Politik, vor der Kern so eindringlich warnte, beherrscht den Wahlkampf in Österreich.



Der Wettstreit der Parteien gleicht einer Schlammschlacht.

Die sogenannte Schmutzkübel-Affäre überdeckt alle Inhalte. Facebook-Seiten überzogen den ÖVP-Kandidaten Kurz mit falschen Anklagen, verbreiteten rassistische und antisemitische Hetze. Kerns Ex-Berater im Wahlkampf, der Israeli Tal Silberstein, soll die Seiten ohne Wissen der SPÖ organisiert haben.

Ein persönlicher Mitarbeiter von Kurz wiederum soll SPÖ-Zirkeln Geld angeboten haben, um Informationen über die Fake-Facebook-Seiten zu bekommen.

Die Atmosphäre zwischen der SPÖ und ÖVP in der Großen Koalition in Wien ist vergiftet - und das nicht erst, seit der Schmutz an die Öffentlichkeit dringt. Die Neuwahlen am Sonntag sind das Ergebnis eines monatelangen Streits.

Für Eskapaden sorgte etwa immer wieder ÖVP-Innenminister Wolfgang Sobotka, der Bundeskanzler Kern attackierte - und zusammen mit Kurz für einen Eklat sorgte, als er im Mai eine Sitzung des Ministerrats schwänzte.

Aber auch Kern selbst soll an dem schlechten Klima in Österreichs GroKo seinen Anteil gehabt haben - sagen zumindest seine Kritiker von der ÖVP. Sie unterstellen ihm einen Dauerwahlkampf und eine ständige Selbstinszenierung.

Und so attestierte die liberale österreichische Tageszeitung ""Kurier"" Kern nach einem Jahr im Amt im Mai 2017 eine gemischte Bilanz: Der Neustart der eigenen Partei sei ihm gelungen, er habe der SPÖ wieder ein schärferes Profil verschafft.

Doch: ""Die 'Stimmung im Land', die Kern vor einem noch 'drehen' wollte, ist am Boden.""

Österreichs ""New Deal""

Dabei hat die österreichische Bundesregierung unter Kern durchaus politische Erfolge vorzuweisen. Kern rief in Österreich einen ""New Deal"" aus, in Anlehnung an die Wirtschafts- und Sozialreformen von US-Präsident Franklin D. Roosevelt in den 1930er Jahren.

Dazu gehörte etwa die sogenannte ""Aktion 20.000"". Mit dem Projekt sollten Langzeitarbeitslose in (gemeinnützige) Jobs gebracht werden. Der Anstieg der Arbeitslosigkeit der Generation über 50 sei dadurch aufgehalten worden, sagte Sozialminister Alois Stöger (SPÖ).

Tatsächlich sinkt die Arbeitslosigkeit in Österreich seit März 2017 kontinuierlich. Kerns hat also innenpolitisch Zeichen gesetzt - und Erfolge gefeiert. Doch, dass die Stimmung in Österreich ""am Boden ist"", liegt ebenso an ihm.

Denn der ""Slim-fit-Kanzler"", wie Kern wegen seiner Vorliebe für maßgeschneiderte Anzüge genannt wird, hat sich die Themen von der FPÖ diktieren lassen.

Das rechte Diktat

Der österreichische Politologe Anton Pelinka bezeichnet Kerns Kurs gegenüber der österreichischen Zeitung ""Der Standard"" als ""FPÖ light"".

Als Beispiel nennt Pelinka auch die von Kern unterstützte Forderung, Kindern im EU-Ausland die Familienbeihilfe zu kürzen.

Oder den Brief des Kanzlers an Kommissionspräsident Jean-Claude Juncker im April, in dem er forderte, Österreich vom EU-Umsiedlungsprogramm von Asylbewerbern auszunehmen.

Der österreichische Journalist und Kern-Biograf Robert Misik erklärt gegenüber dem ""Standard"": Der Kanzler habe sich von Umfragen beeindrucken lassen, die ihn als zu weit links der Mitte verorteten.

Klar ist auch: Kern ist mit hohen Erwartungen gestartet, womöglich mit zu hohen. Schwierigkeiten bereitet ihm nun allerdings vor allem ein selbstgeschaffenes Problem: Den umstrittenen Berater Tal Silberstein heuerte Kern selbst als Wahlkampfhelfer an.

Laut Recherchen des österreichischen Magazins ""Profil"" und der Tageszeitung ""Presse"" soll Silberstein eine viel zentraler Rolle im Wahlkampf eingenommen haben, als Kern nun im Nachhinein gestehen wolle.

Silberstein habe den Wahlkampf zu einem Zweikampf zwischen Kern und ÖVP-Herausforder Kurz stilisieren wollen - auch mit schmutzigen Mitteln.

Sollten die Recherchen stimmen, Kern hätte Verrat an sich selbst begangen. So oder so: Statt auf seine Inhalte und seinen ""Plan für Österreich"" zu setzen, wie er vor eineinhalb Jahren ankündigte, hat er sich auf den österreichischen Intrigantenstadls eingelassen, der die Wiener Politik schon seit Jahren beherrscht.

Den Aufstieg des FPÖ-Politikers Strache hat er dennoch nicht verhindern können - und so seine eigene Macht verspielt.

Desde hace unos días leo los diarios de Sylvia Plath, publicados por Alianza Editorial tiempo atrás, y esta idea se confirma con una recurrencia pasmosa: si su poesía es como un hermoso charco de tristezas y desequilibrios que resulta indispensable contemplar, sus reflexiones más o menos periódicas, que van desde 1950 hasta 1962, son un mar inabarcable de sensibilidades en el que merece la pena ahogarse para respirar.

En el imaginario popular, Sylvia Plath está más bien acosada por su suicidio, pues, como suele suceder en estos casos, es más fácil tomar la parte por el todo, olvidando así que su obra no es sólo lo que ella hizo hasta que se suicidó, o simplemente un camino de metáforas para seguir los pasos de su dolor, sino el motivo fundamental de su existencia, su razón de ser. Sylvia Plath vivió intensamente en el papel y murió como quiso en su cuerpo. Esto no significa que de haberse dado circunstancias más propicias lo hubiese hecho igual, sino tan sólo que su sensibilidad, su forma de estar en el mundo, no le permitió soportar más lo que ella misma era: una herida creadora.

En la belleza de su prosa íntima podemos descubrir, aquellos y aquellas en los que la sensibilidad es también una herida, que no estamos solos en la batalla contra la desesperanza y la desilusión. Porque si su forma de pensar y su imaginación bastan para obnubilar y atraer, para querer situarnos junto a su sombra, la manera en la que se muestra aquí carnal y humana la hace más completa, más táctil. Si no pensara, escribe, sería mucho más feliz; si no tuviera órganos sexuales, no me encontraría todo el tiempo en el límite mismo de la exaltación nerviosa y de las lágrimas. Si estas frases no son el esbozo de cualquier alma que intenta desarrollarse y crecer, difícilmente podrán serlo otras. Pero este es un fragmento que apenas contiene el poderoso sabor de los cientos de páginas en los que vemos cómo se desenvuelve, entre el dolor y la nada, entre la duda y la angustia, la poeta.

Por eso estos diarios tiene una fuerza especial y devastadora. Porque en ellos se encuentra una vida que aún sigue existiendo con toda su intensidad: la de Sylvia Plath intentando coserse con palabras su profunda herida.

Son muchos los acontecimientos, ideas y preocupaciones que recoge en estos diarios, que son una selección de la amplia cantidad de papeles que dejó tras su muerte. Funcionan como el complemento perfecto para los que ya están enamorados y entregados a su poesía: me atrevería a decir, incluso, que son el canal esencial para comprender sin artificios poéticos sus ansiedades, el miedo enorme, feo y llorón, que la obligaba a replantearse un día sí y otro también cuál es el núcleo de la vida, lo que la hace completa o no. Porque cuando ella se decía tu celda no es tu habitación, sino tú misma o tienes miedo de quedarte a solas con tu propio cerebro, estaba mostrando las expansiones y repliegues de su guerra personal con ella misma.

Aunque a veces sea difícil, es importante acercarse a las personas que se han tomado la molestia de querer ser ellas mismas, porque en sus aciertos y fracasos podemos reconocer los valores y la complejidad que supone intentar dar cumplimiento a las aspiraciones personales; sobre todo a las más profundas y creativas.

Φέτος μάλιστα, έπειτα από τις εκατοντάδες αιτήσεις συμμετοχής των προηγούμενων ετών, ο αριθμός των θέσεων απασχόλησης αυξάνεται σε 15 από 10.

Διαδικασία επιλογής

«Αναζητούμε άτομα που μπορούν να κάνουν τη διαφορά. Που θα επιδείξουν πάθος, παρακίνηση και δέσμευση. Που θα δείξουν ότι διαθέτουν τις κατάλληλες ικανότητες, την εμπειρία και τη γνώση που απαιτεί το έργο που έχουν επιλέξει και ο συγκεκριμένος ρόλος που θα αναλάβουν» σημειώνει η κυρία Ρούλη Χριστοπούλου, Υπεύθυνη Τμήματος Βιώσιμης Ανάπτυξης και Κοινωνικής Συνεισφοράς της Vodafone. Προκειμένου να συμμετάσχουν στο πρόγραμμα, οι ενδιαφερόμενοι θα πρέπει πρώτα να έχουν έρθει σε επαφή με τον οργανισμό στον οποίο θέλουν να εργαστούν και να συμφωνήσουν σε ένα συγκεκριμένο έργο για την περίοδο απασχόλησής τους. Στη συνέχεια θα πρέπει να υποβάλουν την αίτησή τους ηλεκτρονικά στην ιστοσελίδα της Vodafone στο www.vodafone.gr/worldofdifference μέχρι και τις 15 Οκτωβρίου.

Όλες οι αιτήσεις που λαμβάνει το Ίδρυμα Vodafone περνούν από μία συγκεκριμένη διαδικασία αξιολόγησης που περιλαμβάνει διάφορα στάδια, όπως τηλεφωνικές συνεντεύξεις με τους οργανισμούς, προσωπικές συνεντεύξεις με τους υποψηφίους κ.λπ. Εκτός από τους υποψήφιους και τους οργανισμούς, αξιολογούνται και τα προτεινόμενα έργα με τα οποία θα ασχοληθούν με βασικό κριτήριο την ανθρωπιστική και κοινωφελή αξία τους, το κατά πόσο είναι εφικτό να υλοποιηθούν σε διάστημα έξι μηνών και τα μετρήσιμα αποτελέσματα.

Το Ίδρυμα Vodafone αρωγός στους νέους και στην κοινωνία

«Ως Ίδρυμα Vodafone, θέλουμε να επενδύουμε με ένταση στους νέους ανθρώπους και να δημιουργούμε ευκαιρίες για την απόκτηση εργασιακής εμπειρίας, καθώς αναγνωρίζουμε τον μοναδικό ρόλο που μπορούν να διαδραματίσουν οι γνώσεις, οι ιδέες και το όραμα των νέων ανθρώπων στην ελληνική πραγματικότητα» επισημαίνει η κ. Χριστοπούλου, αναφέροντας πως το “World of Difference” έχει διττό στόχο: δημιουργεί θέσεις απασχόλησης, ενώ ταυτόχρονα ενισχύει το έργο Μη Κερδοσκοπικών Οργανισμών, συμβάλλοντας στην ανακούφιση ευαίσθητων κοινωνικών ομάδων.

Έτσι, όσοι συμμετάσχουν στο πρόγραμμα, θα έχουν την ευκαιρία να ενισχύσουν έμπρακτα το έργο κοινωφελών οργανισμών, θα αμείβονται για τις υπηρεσίες που θα παρέχουν και θα έχουν τη δυνατότητα να αναπτύξουν τις δεξιότητές τους και να αποκτήσουν εργασιακή εμπειρία, εφόδια πολύτιμα για τη μελλοντική σταδιοδρομία τους. Παράλληλα, μέσα από το πρόγραμμα, οι οργανισμοί ωφελούνται από τις ικανότητες και την εμπειρία εκείνων των νέων που θέλουν να κάνουν τη διαφορά.

Μια εμπειρία ζωής

«Ένας διαγωνισμός που σου δίνει την ευκαιρία να δουλέψεις έμμισθα για 6 μήνες σε έναν οργανισμό που σ’ ενδιαφέρει, καλύπτοντας μια θέση που μπορείς να σχεδιάσεις εσύ, είναι εξ ορισμού κάτι πάρα πολύ ελκυστικό. Αποκτάς εργασιακή εμπειρία, καλλιεργείς δεξιότητες και αναβαθμίζεις το βιογραφικό σου» εξηγεί η κ. Χριστοπούλου και συνεχίζει: «Το γεγονός, δε, ότι ταυτόχρονα ο οργανισμός αυτός έχει κοινωφελή χαρακτήρα και σου δίνει τη δυνατότητα να υποστηρίξεις αληθινές ανάγκες της κοινωνίας ή ευάλωτες κοινωνικές ομάδες και ν’ αφήσεις το δικό σου αποτύπωμα, νομίζω θα μ’ έκανε να δηλώσω συμμετοχή χωρίς δεύτερη σκέψη και να βάλω τα δυνατά μου να πείσω τους ανθρώπους που θα με αξιολογούσαν ότι είμαι ικανή να κάνω τη διαφορά. Έχοντας έρθει πολύ κοντά αυτά τα χρόνια με ανθρώπους που εργάζονται σε ΜΚΟ, έχω διακρίνει σ’ αυτούς μοναδικές δεξιότητες και ταλέντα, τα οποία σε κάποιο άλλο περιβάλλον μπορεί να μην είχαν καλλιεργήσει. Το να προσπαθείς, συχνά με ελάχιστούς πόρους, να κάνεις το καλύτερο δυνατό, σε κάνει δημιουργικό, εφευρετικό, τολμηρό και αποτελεσματικό. Σε κάνει να σκέφτεσαι χωρίς περιορισμούς και να βρίσκεις λύσεις. Κι αν συνυπολογίσει κανείς την προσωπική ικανοποίηση που παίρνεις υποστηρίζοντας δύσκολες καταστάσεις, βοηθώντας ευάλωτους συνανθρώπους μας ή βρίσκοντας λύση σε κοινωνικά ή περιβαλλοντικά προβλήματα, η συμμετοχή σ ένα τέτοιο πρόγραμμα γίνεται όχι απλά επαγγελματική εμπειρία, αλλά εμπειρία ζωής».

Η ιστορία του προγράμματος “World of Difference”

Το “World of Difference” του Ιδρύματος Vodafone ξεκίνησε στην Ελλάδα τον Σεπτέμβριο του 2010 και μέχρι σήμερα έχει αναδείξει 54 άτομα τα οποία εργάστηκαν σε 49 Μη Κερδοσκοπικούς Οργανισμούς της επιλογής τους. Οι νέοι που συμμετείχαν στο πρόγραμμα εργάστηκαν σε διάφορες πόλεις και περιοχές της χώρας, συγκεκριμένα, σε 11 διαφορετικές περιοχές της Ελλάδας (Αθήνα, Θεσσαλονίκη, Δράμα, Καστοριά, Κέρκυρα, Κοζάνη, Κομοτηνή, Κρήτη, Μυτιλήνη, Πάτρα, Πάρος, Πρέσπες), προσφέροντας σημαντικό έργο στην τοπική κοινωνία. Τα άτομα που έχουν επιλεγεί ως νικητές έχουν προσφέρει έργο -μεταξύ άλλων- σε οργανισμούς όπως η Κιβωτός του Κόσμου, ο Σύλλογος Συνδρόμου Down Ελλάδος, το Δίκτυο για τα Δικαιώματα του Παιδιού, η ΕΛΕΠΑΠ, το Ινστιτούτο Οδικής Ασφάλειας «Πάνος Μυλωνάς», η Εταιρεία Προστασίας Πρεσπών, το Σώμα Ελλήνων Προσκόπων, η Equal Society, το Make a Wish Ελλάδας και σε άλλους φορείς.

Η κ. Χριστοπούλου περιγράφει, καθώς θυμάται την επιτυχία του περσινού προγράμματος: «Είναι υπέροχο να βλέπεις τόσους νέους ανθρώπους να παθιάζονται με κάτι που αφορά τον συνάνθρωπό τους, την κοινωνία, τη βιώσιμη ανάπτυξη, το περιβάλλον, και οργανισμούς που αφοσιώνονται στους σκοπούς και στις αξίες τους με πείσμα και σοβαρότητα. Επειδή τελικά τα κοινωνικά προγράμματα αξιολογούνται με τον αντίκτυπό τους, αυτό που δεν θα ξεχάσω ποτέ από το “World of Difference” του 2017 είναι τα 118 άτομα με κινητική αναπηρία και τους 542 φροντιστές που εκπαίδευσε ο Φάνης για τη βελτίωση της ποιότητας ζωής και την εργασιακή τους επανένταξη, τους 4.000 μαθητές δημοτικού που η Ειρήνη εκπαίδευσε και ευαισθητοποίησε για το θέμα της σπατάλης του φαγητού, τους 370 ελέγχους μνήμης που η Μικαέλα πραγματοποίησε σε συνανθρώπους μας τρίτης ηλικίας για τη διάγνωση και αντιμετώπισης της άνοιας, τους 8 σπουδαστές με νοητική αναπηρία που η Ρόζμαρι εκπαίδευσε με σκοπό την κοινωνική και επαγγελματική τους ενσωμάτωση και αυτονομία, τα 1.354 κουτιά φαρμάκων που ο Ηλίας εξοικονόμησε για μηνιαία φαρμακευτική περίθαλψη σε 450 άτομα, τους 3000 μαθητές και τους 500 εκπαιδευτικούς που συμμετείχαν στο εκπαιδευτικό πρόγραμμα της Ειρήνης για τις προσφυγικές ροές και τα ανθρώπινα δικαιώματα, τα 330 παιδιά και ενήλικες που επωφελήθηκαν από το Mobile School σε περιοχές της Δράμας που υλοποίησε η Ελένη, τους 2.100 πρόσφυγες που ενημέρωσε ο Παύλος για θέματα ασφάλειας και ατομικής υγιεινής, τα 12.000 άτομα που επωφελήθηκαν από τα παιχνίδια για τυφλούς και δράσεις που σχεδίασε και υλοποίησε η Αντιγόνη, τις δράσεις που συντόνισε ο Κώστας για τη βελτίωση της ζωής χιλιάδων οροθετικών ατόμων».","15 Μη Κερδοσκοπικοί Οργανισμοί, 6 μήνες απασχόλησης, ένας κοινός στόχος για 15 νέους: Να κάνουν τη διαφορά",http://www.huffingtonpost.gr/2017/10/12/life-world-of-difference-vodafone_n_18170072.html

How Tech Can Secure The NHS' Place In Our Society And Bring Services Into The Digital Age It's now a little over a decade since Steve Jobs stepped confidently onto a stage in California and projected the world into the smartphone era. Ever since, there's been no shortage of debate about the implications of our ever more connected, always-on digital lifestyles. Technology now governs every aspect of our lives: how we shop, how we work, how we play, even how we vote, have all been transformed by the march of digital. It's brought risk, as well as benefits, not least in its impact on our mental health. But what can't be disputed is its overwhelming power to disrupt traditional ways of working and create new possibilities for consumers. Secretary of State for Health

Petit à petit, depuis une quarantaine années, les composantes de ce mécanisme émergent au grand jour. On entend de plus en plus souvent parler de ""manipulation mentale"", de ""harcèlement"", de ""manipulateur"" ou de ""pervers narcissique"" et même de ""manipulateur destructeur"". Ces agissements sont décrits, dénoncés dans des contextes de plus en plus variés. Autrefois, les médias ne relayaient que les grandes escroqueries financières ou les drames sectaires. Aujourd'hui, on se rend compte que la manipulation existe aussi dans d'autres domaines plus individuels: la famille, le travail, l'école ou le voisinage. On commence aussi à découvrir que le harcèlement moral tue, qu'il pousse au suicide et qu'il a un coût caché énorme pour la société, tant en matière de santé, que de productivité.

Le nuage d'encre de la pieuvre

Mais les manipulateurs ne se laisseront pas faire sans réagir. C'est pourquoi au fur et à mesure qu'on avance dans la découverte du phénomène, des contre-vérités commencent à être distillées avec l'espoir de recréer la confusion dans laquelle ils sont à l'abri. Comme une pieuvre masque sa présence par son jet d'encre, le manipulateur embrouille les données et crée délibérément un brouillard mental dans lequel on ne sait plus ce qui est vrai ou faux, ce qui appartient à l'un et ce qui appartient à l'autre. Par exemple, vous avez surement déjà entendu –et peut-être même relayé- l'argument suivant: ""Bah, on est bien tous un peu manipulateur!"" C'est totalement faux. Si les humains sont évidemment dans une inter-influence, ce n'est pas de la manipulation, tant qu'on n'a pas l'intention d'utiliser l'autre cyniquement pour arriver à ses fins ou qu'on ne ressent pas un plaisir sadique à voir l'autre souffrir. Alors, je vous propose quelques éléments importants pour dissiper le brouillard et de démêler le vrai du faux.

Un profil étonnamment standard

Ce qui m'a le plus surprise dans ma pratique de coaching, c'est que depuis 24 ans, mes clients me parlent de la même personne. Qu'il s'agisse d'un homme ou d'une femme, la personne manipulatrice a toujours les caractéristiques suivantes:

- Deux visages:

Les manipulateurs ont deux visages. Le premier, très sympathique, affiché pour la galerie et adressé aux gens qu'ils souhaitent endormir, l'autre morose et haineux, réservé à leur victime et aux gens qu'ils méprisent ou qu'ils veulent écarter. Le visage sympathique n'est qu'un masque. Quand vous l'aurez compris, vous ne vous laisserez plus rendormir par cette gentillesse de pacotille.

- Quatre ficelles:

La séduction: Les manipulateurs se montreront charmants et sympathiques jusqu'à ce que vous soyez piégés. Ensuite, ils tomberont le masque. Ils peuvent redevenir adorables, ponctuellement, par calcul, pour vous rendormir.

La victimisation: Les manipulateurs sont les gens les plus malheureux de la terre. Ils ont plus souffert que tout le monde et tout le monde est méchant avec eux. Tant que vous serez sensibles à leurs pleurnicheries théâtrales et que vous les prendrez en pitié, vous serez piégé.

L'intimidation: Irritables, impatients, stressés et stressant, les manipulateurs vous font vivre sous la pression de l'urgence et la peur de leurs crises de rage. Sournoisement revanchards, ils maitrisent l'art des représailles. Vous apprendrez vite à vous soumettre en croyant ainsi éviter les ennuis.

La culpabilisation: Un manipulateur est une personne totalement immature et irresponsable. Il est donc évident pour lui que c'est vous qui êtes responsable de tout et que lui-même est toujours innocent. Quoi qu'il se passe se sera de votre faute. Et comme il est aussi capricieux que versatile, quoi que vous fassiez, ça n'ira jamais. Si vous êtes du genre à vouloir bien faire et à vous remettre facilement en question, vous allez sombrer dans une culpabilité aussi généralisée qu'irrationnelle.

Une destruction en trois temps

De la rencontre à la fin de la relation, le procéder est également incroyablement standard et fonctionne en trois périodes. Une lune de miel, une descente aux enfers, une mise à mort. Ce récit, je l'ai entendu plus de mille fois. Toutes les victimes que j'ai rencontrées, et je dis bien TOUTES, m'ont dit ces mots étranges: ""J'allais y laisser ma peau!""

Période de séduction: Au début de la relation, qu'elle soit amoureuse, amicale ou même professionnelle, vous avez l'impression d'avoir rencontré la personne parfaite. (Je mets d'ailleurs en garde les recruteurs sur le piège du candidat parfait.) Comme le manipulateur vous dit exactement ce que vous avez envie d'entendre, vous vivez une période d'euphorie: vous avez toujours su au fond de vous qu'une telle personne existait! Hélas, non, elle joue avec vos rêves.

Harcèlement: Un jour, le masque tombe brusquement. Le manipulateur estime qu'il est dans la place et qu'il n'a plus d'effort à faire. Toutes les victimes se souviennent avec précision du jour où il a tombé le masque. Elles ont eu l'impression de ne plus avoir affaire à la même personne. Et évidement, le masque est tombé le dernier jour de la période d'essai, le jour du mariage, parfois hélas, le jour du test de grossesse. Alors, les scènes, les critiques, les méchancetés vont s'intensifier et deviendront le lot quotidien. A la fin de cette période, la victime est épuisée, hébétée, dans un état de stress permanent. Sa santé commence sérieusement à se dégrader. Elle se croit folle et déprime dangereusement.

Destruction: Le manipulateur s'enivre de sa toute-puissance, se grise de ses abus, se drogue de son harcèlement. Sa victime devient sa came. Comme tous les drogués, il lui faut une dose de plus en plus forte. Déverser sur vous toute la haine et toute la frustration qu'il porte en lui le soulage passagèrement. C'est pourquoi un harcèlement ne s'arrête jamais et ne peut aller qu'en s'aggravant. Vous seul aurez le pouvoir de dire stop... pour sauver votre peau.

Plus jamais victime?

Apprendre à reconnaitre ces éléments n'est pas facile. C'est souvent lorsqu'on est sorti d'une telle relation qu'on se rend compte qu'elle était profondément destructrice. Alors, en faisant le bilan, on se rend compte que tout ce que je viens de décrire y était. La démonstration devient implacable. Mais comment ne pas replonger? Il reste un énorme sujet à controverse et qui est pourtant déterminant dans la sortie d'emprise. C'est le niveau de conscience qu'ont les manipulateurs de ce qu'ils font. Tant que vous croirez qu'ils sont inconscients de ce qu'ils font, vous resterez des proies potentielles et leur meilleur avocat, au grand détriment des autres victimes. Quand vous aurez compris qu'ils sont parfaitement lucides et qu'ils abusent cyniquement de votre humanité, vous serez définitivement libéré.

Gross gambling yield - the amount gambling firms win from customers - was £8.36bn in the year beginning April 2008.","It's a scandal - and yet again those nasty interweb companies are to blame. Children are being encouraged to download apps that encourage them to gamble. Trivial amounts at first but, like the most addictive of drugs, it only takes a little to encourage dependency.

Except this is a rather convenient story for the newspapers to tell and allows them to ignore their own role in the UK's gambling epidemic and the child victims caught up in it.

Lack of transparency is one of the most troubling traits of today's media. It's why that no matter how good the product, levels of trust among the public are lower than ever.

It's something I first considered a few weeks ago when The Times newspaper ran the latest in an occasional - and excellent - series highlighting Britain's gambling epidemic. (The recent Sunday Times 'scoop' about digital downloads is part of this campaign.) Here is the introduction to that Times story about the dangers posed to children:

'Figures show that the industry has spent £1.4 billion on advertising since 2012, with online casinos doubling their marketing budgets over the past five years. Britain's biggest charity to help addicts is so concerned about the increasing volume of advertising that it is urging ministers to introduce stricter rules. Kate Lampard, the chairwoman of gambling watchdog GambleAware, says: ""With the average age at which children start to watch post-watershed TV unsupervised being 11¾, restrictions based on a 9pm watershed may offer little protection.""'

Except that there is an advertising issue more troubling than either the watershed or online casinos, as GambleAware and The Times know. It is daytime television, particularly during live sports events, where children are targeted by an astonishing array of advertisements persuading them to use phones, tablets and PCs to gamble away their (and their parents') money.

Just a few days ago, the Local Government Association issued an alarming report which revealed that one in 10 children aged 11-15 follow gambling companies on social media, having been heavily influenced by TV ads during sports broadcasts. Try Googling the newspapers' reporting of that study - the silence is rather deafening.

I conducted a small experiment myself on a recent Saturday afternoon and watched Sky Sports - whose major shareholder Rupert Murdoch also controls NewsUK, the publisher of The Times.

During Sky's live football coverage between noon and 5pm, I counted 64 advertisements that sought to part the consumer from their cash (I ignored plugs for Sky TV). Thirty seven of these were for consumer goods and the other 27 urged people to 'bet now', 'cash out' and, inevitably, 'win'. So more than 42% of adverts selling me a product before the watershed were encouraging me to gamble.

The companies that paid Sky a hefty sum to run these ads - money that will no doubt contribute to the financial health of all of Mr Murdoch's companies - were: Paddy Power, BetFair, Coral, Ladbrokes, Betway, 365, Betstars, William Hill, Sky Bet and Lotto. There was also a 10-minute interview with a footballer wearing a t-shirt emblazoned with Bet Victor, together with the inevitable in-programme logos on clothes, billboards and studio walls.

I didn't time the length of the ads but if we assume each was about 30 seconds, then there was close to a quarter of an hour of gambling adverts that went out in the middle of Saturday afternoon, at a time when children are most likely to be watching television.

Other countries have woken up to the problem and earlier this year the Australian government pledged to end gambling advertising during live sports events before 8.30pm. Instead, the UK's media industry (dependent upon gambling advertising) is focusing on equally-destructive aspects such as fixed odds betting terminals. Pre-watershed advertising is, largely, ignored.

GambleAware's argument which The Times publicised - that the advertising industry must do more to protect society's most vulnerable when they watch TV in the evening - represents only a small part of the story.

Presumably, the watchdog, whose trustees include the bosses of Ladbrokes Coral and Rank - two of Britain's most powerful gambling organisations - has its own interests to protect as well as the consumers'.

Likewise, the Times rather conveniently omits to mention the astonishing success of the Sun Bets gambling website and app, a heavily-publicised off-shoot of its sister paper, The Sun.

Excessive gambling is as great a danger to people's lives as excessive drinking and smoking. When I was growing up in the 1970s and 80s, cigarette companies like Benson & Hedges, Dunhill and Silk Cut were being eased out of sponsoring live events because their glossy products hastened death. I don't know whether I bought cigarettes because of such highly visible daytime advertising but I'm sure it was a contributory factor. I don't know whether my son and his friends think betting is a laugh because people like 'I-gamble-responsibly' Ray Winstone advocate it, but I wouldn't be surprised if watching TV on a Saturday afternoon was also a contributory factor.

Recent figures compiled by Nielsen indicate the gambling industry spent £312m in 2016 on ads, a 63% rise on the comparable figure for 2012. Roughly half of this was for television. Ever since 2005's gambling act, the British gambling industry has been growing at a frightening rate. Gross gambling yield - the amount gambling firms win from customers - was £8.36bn in the year beginning April 2008. In the year to September 2016, it reached a record £13.8bn.

No wonder the Gambling Commission recently revealed that 69% of people think betting is dangerous for family life and that there are now more than 400,000 'problem' gamblers, one in five of whom attempt to kill themselves.

The media - print, advertising, marketing - has an enormous role to play in reporting how gambling affects the fabric of society and real people's lives. But it must do so in a transparent way and look to itself if it wants to uncover the truth, rather than just attack digital media. It's not just The Times - on a recent Friday, I counted 14 adverts on the sports pages of London's Evening Standard, 13 of which promoted gambling.

As for the gambling companies, since they have purloined the word 'responsible' to reshape their consumer narratives, I wonder what would happen if one of the brands took the moral high ground by pledging not to advertise on television before 6pm. Yes, it would lose some penetration in the teenage market but it might also win some respect from the media, politicians and the general public. And, in taking a stand, persuade us that the brand represents something more important than profit. Societal responsibility, for instance.

It would be a gamble but perhaps one worth taking.",The Media's Role In Our Gambling Epidemic,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/grant-feller/the-medias-role-in-our-ga_b_18222074.html?utm_hp_ref=uk

Dr Samina Khan, director of admissions and outreach at the university said: “Interviews will be an entirely new experience for most students, and we know many prospective applicants are already worried about being in an unfamiliar place and being questioned by people they have not met – so to help students to become familiar with the type of questions they might get asked we release these real examples.

“We want to underscore that every question asked by our tutors has a purpose, and that purpose is to assess how students think about their subject and respond to new information or unfamiliar ideas.”

Khan added: “No matter what kind of educational background or opportunities you have had, the interview should be an opportunity to present your interest and ability in your chosen subject, since they are not just about reciting what you already know.”

Subject: Law

Q: Should it be illegal to run a red light in the middle of the night on an empty road?

Exeter College lecturer Jon Herring said: “The ability to think normatively is important to the study of law, so we are interested in what candidates think the law ought to be, but more important is their capacity to justify their position.

“This involves being able analyse concepts, critically appraise arguments and the reasoning behind a position, as well as to consider objections and to offer rebuttals to those objections. There isn’t a right or wrong answer to this question; we would be using the example to see how well the candidate could justify their stance.

“For example, a candidate might say that if no one was harmed by running the light, then it wouldn’t hurt to run it so it shouldn’t be illegal. This would be suggesting that the law is based on preventing harm. We might then explore whether this is the only purpose or the dominant purpose of the law, and how that might shape how legal rules need to be constructed, when exceptions might be valid and how effective exceptions could be created.”

He continued: “Here, we would be looking to see how well they can see the problems with their approach, the difficulties inherent in drafting a rule that works in every situation without being too broad. This line of discussion would draw out their capacity to respond to challenges to their position, their mental flexibility, and their ability to think precisely.

“Another candidate might suggest that even if no one is harmed, it is important that laws are respected and we could examine why this is the case. For example, if running lights was only illegal when it was dangerous, this would leave it to each person’s assessment of ‘dangerous’, so we could never be sure when someone would run a light, leading to chaotic traffic.”

Herring added: “This question also picks up on ideas about what it means for something to be illegal and citizens’ relationship with the law, whether it can ever be justified to break the law and what might be a sufficient justification. This could lead into more philosophical discussions of what it means for a law to be binding and how legal rules might differ from moral rules or guidelines.

“A candidate might begin to consider whether there is something special about ‘law’, and we could use this as a way into exploring with them whether the fact that something is illegal is itself a reason not to do something, over and above, perhaps, the harm the rule is aiming to prevent. Candidates might then think about how law makes other people’s behaviour more predictable so that we can plan our own actions, or how the law might serve functions like punishing wrongdoing.

“An example might be that because the law makes murder illegal and those who kill are punished, I can expect that I can leave my house and generally not expect to be killed, so this allows me to decide it’s safe to go outside.”

Subject: Philosophy (Philosophy, Politics and Economics)

Q: ‘I agree that air transport contributes to harmful climate change. But whether or not I make a given plane journey, the plane will fly anyway. So there is no moral reason for me to not travel by plane.’ Is this a convincing argument?

Interviewer Cecile Fabre of Lincoln College said: “The interview is not meant to test candidates’ knowledge of Philosophy, since more often than not, they have not studied this subject before. Moreover, we are not trying to get them to guess or arrive at ‘the right answer’.

“Rather, the interview is about candidates’ ability to think critically, to deal with counter-examples to the views they put forward, and to draw distinctions between important concepts.”

She continued: “This answer raises the difficult question of individuals’ responsibility, as individuals, for harmful collective actions. Some candidates might be inclined to dispute the premise that air transport contributes to climate change: that’s fine, but we would then ask them to accept that premise for the sake of argument. Whether they are able to do that is in itself an important test, since much of philosophical thinking proceeds in this way.

“Some candidates might say that the argument is a good one: given that what I do makes no difference, I have no moral reason not to do it. At this point, I would want to know what they consider a moral reason to be (as distinct from or similar to, for example, a practical or prudential reason).”

Fabre added: “I would also push them to think about other cases: for example, the bombing of Dresden (one jet fighter less makes no difference to the collective outcome – so why not go and fight); or voting (why should I vote in a general election, given that my vote makes no difference)?

“Are the cases the same? Are they different? If so, are the differences or similarities relevant? That is to say, do those differences and similarities help us think about the original case? Do they help us to work out a view about individual responsibility in those cases?

“For example, in the Dresden case, the individual jet fighters act together as part of an organisation – the air force – whose aim is to bomb Dresden. But we cannot say of companies such as British Airways that they aim to cause climate change. And the air passengers cannot really be described as acting together. Does this make a difference?”

Subject: Medicine

Q: Put these countries in order by their crude mortality (deaths per thousand of the population): Bangladesh, Japan, South Africa, the UK.

Exeter College interviewer Andrew King, said: “Interviews for Medicine aim to gauge candidates’ understanding of the science underpinning the study of medicine, as well as skills in scientific enquiry. This question invites candidates to think about a public health question and epidemiology that can be approached in many different ways, without necessarily knowing anything about specific mortality rates around the world.

“We would expect the initial discussion to probe the differing causes of death that contribute to mortality rates – such as those ‘Western diseases’ heart disease and cancer – and how they compare to those found in developing countries (high infant mortality, infectious diseases, poor nutrition, high rates of HIV etc.).”

He continued: “The majority of candidates will expect Bangladesh or South Africa to have the highest crude mortality rate, and will be surprised to find that it is in fact Japan.

“The other part of the mortality rate calculation is of course the age of the population: we would ideally steer the conversation towards a discussion of why a wealthy but older country like Japan might have a higher mortality rate, while a country like Bangladesh – which many people might initially expect to have a high mortality rate due to relative poverty as a country – actually has a relatively lower mortality rate because of its young population.

“Similarly, Britain actually has the second-highest mortality rate because of the age structure of its population: we are a relatively old country and a majority of deaths occur in older people. We wouldn’t expect students to get the right answer on their own, and in fact that’s not the point: the point is to see how they apply their understanding of social and cultural factors in health and illness to a problem of epidemiology.

“Some students might already have a detailed knowledge of demography, others might need to be given more relevant information – the point isn’t what they know, it’s what questions they ask to make their conclusions, and how they interpret information to draw those conclusions. We might then go on to discuss how you could make a valid comparison between mortality rates in different countries.”

Subject: Modern Languages (French)

Q: What do we lose if we only read a foreign work of literature in translation?

Interviewer Jane Hiddleston, of Exeter College, said: “This is a good question as it helps us to see how candidates think about both languages and literature.

“They might be able to tell us about the challenges of translation, about what sorts of things resist literal or straightforward translation from one language to another, and this would give us an indication of how aware they are of how languages work.”

She continued: “They might also tell us about literary language, and why literary texts in particular use language in ways that make translation problematic. This might lead to a discussion of what is distinct about literary works, and this helps us to see what kind of reader they are more broadly.

“We don’t do this with the expectation that they have already read any particular works, however, but in order to get a sense of why they think it is worth studying literatures in foreign languages.”

Hiddleston added: “This is an important issue, given that Modern Languages students at Oxford read a lot of literature in the language as part of their course.",Oxford University Sample Interview Questions: Would You Make The Cut At Britain's Top Uni?,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2017/10/12/oxford-university-sample-interview_n_18246648.html?utm_hp_ref=uk

The unit pack -- which comes with the GPS hardware, a torso vest and access to online SPT software -- tracks the running distances, top speeds, heat maps and intensity of a person during a sporting match and allows them to analyse post-match data and compare it to other people, making it useful in custom designing training regimes and avoiding injury due to excessive fatigue.

You simply pop this device into your vest, play in a sporting match and the rest is done for you.

Swan Hill College, which is based just south of the Victoria-New South Wales border, is one of those schools currently using the technology to get students interested in their own physical activity.

Whitney Kennedy, the head of the physical education and health department at Swan Hill, told HuffPost Australia the GameTraka device has seen a boost to students' motivation towards sport and lets them compare their own exercise to the elite results of professional athletes.

""[Students] do like to compare their data to that of professional athletes so they can develop an appreciation for just how good some athletes are,"" she said.

""I would say that there's also definitely been a significant improvement in motivation levels to learn about how GPS devices can be used in sport to prepare, train, and prevent injuries.

""It creates a bigger scope for our learning and it's raised their awareness for the fact that this is the way that sport is going and this is what we can achieve by using this device and in the future, this is how the device might change so that we can apply it to different sports.""

The data analysis of performances lets students see where and how they were pushed physically, so they can improve in the future.

She also said that many of the students from the Swan Hill area ""live and breathe their sport"" and the device supports teachers to prepare students for their Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE) studies while also placing a focus on improving sporting results.

""It is really important in terms of the development of our kids that we stay up to date with current trends and things that are happening within the sport and recreation industry,"" she said.

""We try and adopt those sorts of concepts in schools so that when [students] move into careers... they're not unfamiliar with some of these concepts that are being brought into the industry.

""We have a couple of classes that prepare our students for VCE in Years 11 and 12 in teaching things like energy systems and training methods and principles -- the data that we have received from those devices assists in that and makes it easier for those kids who learn in different ways to understand those sorts of concepts.""

And according to SPT's community manager, Mack Rivett, it's this technology that allows for anyone from young people to adults who consider themselves a grassroots, amateur or semi-professional sports person to engage with their own physical development.

""Kids will go out and play a game and, through the GPS with GameTraka, they can see which energy systems are being used the most and can see all these things and then can create training programs that would best suit for certain sports,"" he told HuffPost Australia.

""Kids will want to take it away to their games and use it for that competitive side and see how far they're actually running but at the same time, kids who want to develop a background in sports science or a more professional sporting arena can be more inclined to monitor their progress because they can see the benefits from it.

""It puts a bit of ownership on the kids as well -- they can really start to develop and keep tabs on their own personal development and health. We've seen this technology is really helping kids keep that competitive edge.""

Despite this Rivett also said that, while there are parents that might push their children too hard, too early when it comes to sporting performances, that has not been an issue so far and the learning benefits of GameTraka outweigh the negatives.

""Anywhere you go there's going to be competitive parents. I think that's just going to be a given factor -- you get those parents most weekends,"" he said.

""[But] you're only going to be kidding yourself if you're trying to guess what muscles you're using, what distances you've run, what speed zones you've hit -- you need facts behind what you're trying to say.

""It needs to become part of the actual [schooling] curriculum because at the moment, people are writing down movement patterns. Now with our heat map and GPS technology, they can use these stats they've recorded themselves and use it as part of their school units.""

As for Kennedy, she told HuffPost Australia the GPS technology is a sign of ""the way that PE (physical education) is going with sports analysis"" and that she can see it becoming a mainstream part of Australian students' learning.

""With these GPS devices, there is a lot more that you can access. Moving forward, it's the way that PE is going with sports analysis, training principles and training programs and injury prevention,"" she said.

""There's so many more injuries with younger people now that schools are going to want to know what that means for training loads and those sorts of things.

""There's no question moving forward that it won't be used within classrooms -- not when the data is readily available to us.""",Aussie Schools Adopt Same Sports Technology As Pro-Athletes,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/10/11/aussie-schools-adopt-same-sports-technology-as-pro-athletes_a_23239427/

While the UK might seem far removed from this, the reality is that prescription drug addiction is becoming an increasing issue this side of the pond. UK Addiction and Treatment Centres (UKAT) tells HuffPost UK that in the past two years alone it has witnessed a 17% increase in admissions of people reliant on over-the-counter painkillers and benzodiazepines (prescribed to treat anxiety attacks).

Figures from NHS Digital released earlier this year found prescriptions for opioid painkillers, such as codeine, had doubled from 12 million to 24 million in the past decade. The findings prompted leading doctors to air concerns that the addictive drugs were being handed out too readily.

Revealing the gravity of the situation, UKAT says it’s not unusual for addicts to take a staggering 100 co-codamol tablets a day - that’s 50 grams of paracetamol, of which the safe daily amount is 4 grams. (It’s worth noting that you can buy the lowest strength of the drug from pharmacies while higher strengths are available on prescription.)

At current rates, UKAT estimates treatment for prescription drug addiction will soon overtake admissions for alcohol and ‘harder’ drugs.

The dangers of prescription drug addiction

Prescription drug abuse is very dangerous for the body, particularly the liver which has to constantly overwork to break down whichever drug is being abused. It can also cause problems for the digestive system and kidneys.

Bowel problems and constipation are common, particularly with addiction to opioids. In severe cases, this can cause blockage and need surgical intervention, explains Dr Paul McLaren, leading addiction psychiatrist at Priory’s new Wellbeing Centre in Harley Street and medical director of the Priory’s Hospital in Kent.

Sleep apnoea, sexual dysfunction, infertility and fractures caused by falling as a result of dizziness and sedation are also issues related to this type of addiction.

Ultimately, the biggest concern is that if a person slowly becomes immune to the levels of prescription drugs they take each day, there is a high risk of fatal overdose.

How do people become addicted?

According to UKAT, the prescription medications that are often abused in the UK include opioid painkillers, sleeping pills, weight loss pills, anti-depressants, anti-anxiety meds and ADHD medication.

Dr McLaren says the types which people are most commonly addicted to are sedatives or sleeping tablets, and opioid painkillers.

These drugs create dependence in roughly the same way: by causing long-lasting changes to the brain’s ‘reward system’.

“The common factor is that they produce an alteration in your mental state shortly after you take one, that is usually a positive feeling or the relief of distress,” Dr McLaren tells HuffPost UK.

“There are many pathways to addiction with prescription drugs. For some people, they will have been prescribed the drugs appropriately but then their use switches from managing pain, in the case of opioids, to managing other distressing emotions.

“Repeated use can lead to tolerance, needing to use more to get the same effect, and then withdrawal symptoms - feeling ill because you don’t have the drug.”

There’s a very real worry that people who have become addicted to these drugs will seek out ‘black market’ alternatives like heroin if their GP cuts their prescription short.

What’s perhaps even more concerning is that drugs such as heroin are being mixed with other substances, like fentanyl (a synthetic opioid that’s 50 times stronger than heroin), which are very deadly. The substance has been linked to 60 deaths in Britain this year alone.

Signs of addiction

It is important for friends and relatives to be vigilant about recognising potential symptoms in a loved one they are concerned about, as it can be difficult for professionals to recognise when prescription drugs are being abused, Dr McLaren explains.

“This is not clear cut,” he says. “There is often not a clear demarcation between appropriate long term use and addiction.”

According to UKAT, if a person runs out of painkillers, they might display erratic behaviour or their mood might change dramatically. They may also sweat profusely and struggle to sleep.

A change in a person’s emotional state, “with a flattening of emotions and withdrawal from interests or activities which were previously important to them”, is also a sign to be vigilant of.

Other symptoms include: frequent visits to the GP, a tendency to shop online for prescription drugs, regular complaints about medical conditions that justify drug use, a gradual change in school or work performance, disinterest in personal appearance and becoming defensive when talking about prescription medications.

Speaking specifically about abuse of benzodiazepines, which are prescribed for anxiety and panic attacks, UKAT’s spokesperson advises to look out for symptoms including: confusion, drowsiness, weakness, slurred speech, lack of coordination, psychomotor impairment (an increase in falling over and having accidents) and dizziness.

Another symptom to be mindful of is that when someone is hooked on prescription medication and can’t maintain their addiction, they will go into withdrawal, experiencing similar effects to someone withdrawing from a substance like heroin.

How to get help

Seeking help, or encouraging a loved one to seek help, can be extremely difficult - but it can be done.

“The key step [to recovery] is recognition that you have lost control of the drug use and that it has come to control you,” Dr McLaren explains. “Help is at hand, and the two main stages in treatment are getting clean from the drug and then staying off it.

“If the patient is still suffering from pain then an important part of the treatment is to agree an alternative plan for managing the pain without opioids.”

The first stage of treatment, known as detox, is where a patient gradually takes fewer drugs over an agreed timeframe, or they might be given a substitute drug which they will then take in smaller amounts and gradually withdraw from.

UKAT explains that with benzodiazepines specifically, there’s a high risk of seizure during detoxification so this stage should always be undertaken in a medical environment. The detox stage can last for 28 days.

With painkiller addiction, on the other hand, detoxification can take anywhere between 14 and 32 days.

It’s important to remember that the length of time to detox and the method of treatment will depend on the amount of drugs a person is taking, as well as their physical state.

The second stage of treatment involves attending relapse prevention programmes, such as Narcotics Anonymous.

“Managing the second stage can be more difficult,” explains Dr McLaren. “People addicted to opioids can struggle to see themselves as ‘addicts’ and may not want to be associated with people who have been addicted to drugs such as heroin, although the challenges they face are very similar.

“If a person has an underlying mental illness, or personality dysfunction, then that should be treated once they have detoxed and stabilised, to reduce the risk of relapse.”

Treating prescription drug addiction can be likened to treating heroin addiction, however Dr McLaren explains that it has more to do with the person than the substance.

“The physical withdrawal is very similar and managed in similar ways,” he says.

“A key factor predicting treatment outcome is how motivated they are to address the problem.”

If you’re worried about a loved one, Action on Addiction advises that you should give them “honest, straightforward feedback in a caring way”. It’s also important to offer that person help, or tell them how to get help, and provide ongoing support. The support group adds that it’s important for loved ones of people with drug addiction to recognise that they cannot make someone change.

The future of prescription drug addiction

Eytan Alexander, founder of UKAT, believes that until people’s mindset about prescription and over-the-counter drugs changes, the number of those struggling with this form of addiction will continue to rise.

“People believe that if they’re prescribed a drug or if they can buy it in their local corner shop, then they’re not an addict,” he tells HuffPost UK.

“We still admit people into our treatment centres who remain completely unaware that they have an addiction problem to codeine or benzo drugs, because they get them from their doctor, making it completely legal.

“The fact of the matter is that in most cases, the recommended dosage and length of time of consumption is exceeded, meaning that person is now a drug abuser, regardless of the ‘legality’ of the drug in question.”

He says a lot of addicts are forced to continue taking prescription drugs to avoid the “horrific side effects of going cold turkey”. Then, when these people ask for more prescriptions, they aren’t challenged or asked more about the problem by doctors “as their pain is subjective”, he adds.

“That ‘addict’ now continues to fly underneath the radar,” he explains. “It’s a hugely vicious cycle, but one that we can break with better education, advice and support.”",Prescription Drug Addiction: How To Spot The Signs And Seek Treatment,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/signs-of-prescription-drug-addiction-and-how-to-get-help_uk_59db8449e4b072637c457cf3

While a crystal-covered tree may be stretching the budget for some, Bibby maintained Christmas decorations don't have to be expensive.
Given Christmas falls in the Australian summer, Bibby also said it can be fun to play around with beachy themes.
""Candles are a beautiful thing at Christmas time, as well as being massive gifts at Christmas.
They are just not dying... a candle is still a beautiful, beautiful gift,"" she said.","We know, we know. It's still only October. But you'd be surprised how quickly this end of the year seems to slip away.

October turns into November and then all of a sudden it's Christmas Eve and you're at K-Mart playing tug-o-war with another shopper for the last set of fairy lights.

So to save you the hassle of trying to decorate last minute (and having to resort to the leftover red and green tinsel), HuffPost Australia spoke to Deb Bibby, editor-in-chief of JONES Magazine for a sneak-peek into the must-have Christmas trends of 2017.

But wait. Before we start, we have to ask. Do Christmas trends actually exist? Or is it pretty much also Santa and Rudolph every year?

""Yes, I think they do,"" Bibby said. ""And I think they are kind of dictated a little bit by fashion. This year we are seeing trends such as all white... just beautiful layers of crisp white all in different textures.

""And you can do that beautifully on a tree. It can be really elegant and chic. Though I would say if you are going for all white look, make sure you get baubles that are different textures to create some interest.""

As for other trends to watch out for, Bibby said organics, crystals and even underwater, beachy themes will be appearing in stores, as well as more traditional fare.

Pinterest

""There is a lovely trend for all the organics and more natural decorations. So for instance in the upcoming issue we have this gorgeous tree with earthy colours and gold baubles.

""This style really lends itself to home-made decorations as well. That natural thing is very on trend. You could pick a dull gold bauble and then make some things with the kids using cardboard or brown paper, such as little origami pieces tied with a bit of gold thread. You'd be surprised how much fun the kids have making these things. They just love the process.""

Preeeettty.

For those wanting something less earthy, Bibby said filling the tree with crystals can make for an eye-catching look.

""Then there is slick crystal, and you can use real crystal or a more affordable crystal style decoration, depending on your budget. Mass decoration looks beautiful if you can do it. You know, really filling the tree.""

While a crystal-covered tree may be stretching the budget for some, Bibby maintained Christmas decorations don't have to be expensive.

An earthy, organic look bodes well for the budget-conscious.

""I mentioned before the earthy organic tree, with all those beautiful homemade pieces. Or if you wanted to invest in one thing a year, David Jones does beautiful limited edition hand blown baubles. I think that's a really lovely thing for a young family to do, to start a tradition. Every year you could buy one of those to add to your tree.

""If all else fails, resort to fairy lights. Even if you took a branch -- like a white branch -- if you took a branch out of the garden and hung a simple selection of baubles on it, or threaded some fairy lights through the tree, even simple touches like that can look magical. Especially for kids, too. If you can't afford lots of baubles, my advice would be to go for fairy lights.""

Pinterest



If in doubt, use fairy lights.

Given Christmas falls in the Australian summer, Bibby also said it can be fun to play around with beachy themes.

""I think underwater themes are really fun. You can get little decorative characters and little fish -- it's just beautiful for kids,"" she said.

""You can have a lot of fun with little fish, little mermaids, starfish, beautiful blues... I think there's something to be said for just having fun with the tree and not taking it too seriously. Let the kids contribute by decorating the tree with you.""

Pinterest

For those with more traditional tastes, Bibby said it's fine to embrace the old red, green and gold but warns not to overdo it.

""If you are more for a traditionalist going for the greens and the reds, tone it back a little bit,"" she said. ""I wouldn't go full on green and red. Perhaps the odd red through a green tree but not a full on multi-colour extravaganza.""

She also notes there are other ways to embrace Christmas traditions such as getting into candles, wreaths and pine cones.

""Candles are a beautiful thing at Christmas time, as well as being massive gifts at Christmas. They are just not dying... a candle is still a beautiful, beautiful gift,"" she said.

""Even the scent of a particular candle at Christmas can really be special. Pick a particular 'Christmas scent' so that's a memory for your children.

""Speaking of scents, using pine somehow on the table is lovely if you don't have an authentic tree. And I love a good wreath. It's a really nice welcome to Christmas.

""If you are having people over to your house, you want to make it feel special, and having something on the door to announce Christmas is a great way to do that.""

As for Christmas decoration no-nos?

""I think tinsel... if you were stuck with tinsel, stick to one colour you might be able to get away with it,"" Bibby said. ""I wouldn't add different colours of tinsel. Look, it's not my favourite decoration.""

Mardi 4 octobre, Farida Amrani et son suppléant (Ulysse Rabaté) ont déposé plainte contre X pour ""fraude électorale"", rapporte ce jeudi Buzzfeed, documents à l'appui. Interrogé par Le HuffPost sur la raison de cette procédure parallèle à celle menée par le Conseil constitutionnel, la candidate insoumise s'est refusée à tout commentaire.

Dans sa plainte, l'avocat de Farida Amrani et Ulysse Rabaté reprend les éléments qui ont été présentés aux Sages, à savoir des anomalies constatées sur les cahiers d'émargement. Maître Hervé Tourniquet souligne ainsi ""des différences très sensibles de signatures entre les premier et second tours"", constatées chez ""un nombre important d'électeurs"".

Cette plainte déposée devant le tribunal de grande instance d'Evry à, a priori, de quoi surprendre. Car au mois de juin, l'équipe de la candidate exprimait auprès du HuffPost sa ""confiance"" quant à l'issue du recours déposé devant le Conseil constitutionnel. ""Il n'y a que 139 voix d'écart, il suffit d'en contester 70 pour cause d'irrégularités pour que le scrutin soit annulé"", nous indiquait l'entourage de Farida Amrani.

Au HuffPost, un avocat spécialiste du droit électoral, Donatien de Bailliencourt, rappelle qu'""une fraude est une infraction"" et donc, que cette procédure vise à la faire ""constater pénalement"". ""Le juge saisi va examiner si l'infraction est avérée et, dans le cas où il disposera d'éléments intentionnels et matériels suffisants, pourra condamner le prévenu"", poursuit-il.

En résumé, alors que le Conseil constitutionnel statuera sur la validité de l'élection de Manuel Valls (à savoir si le nombre d'irrégularités constatées suffit à contester la sincérité du scrutin), la plainte déposée au tribunal de grande instance a pour vocation de faire reconnaître la fraude commise (ou non) lors des élections législatives. Avec, in fine, la possibilité d'une condamnation pénale pour Manuel Valls.

Marthe-sur-le-Lac, Quebec, Wednesday, Sept. 27. Metro Inc. says it will eliminate about 280 jobs starting in 2021 as part of a $400-million overhaul of its Ontario distribution network.

TORONTO — Grocery store chain Metro Inc. says it will eliminate about 280 jobs starting in 2021 as part of a $400-million overhaul of its Ontario distribution network.

The company says the move to modernize and automate its network will mean the loss of about 180 full-time and 100 part-time positions.

The announcement follows comments by Metro in August that it would study automation as it looked to cut costs in the face of the Ontario government's plan to raise the minimum wage next year.

Metro has six distribution centres in Ontario including four in Toronto and two in Ottawa that employ a total of more than 1,500 workers.

It says its existing distribution network in Toronto no longer meets the needs of its business.

The company plans to modernize the operations in Toronto between 2018 and 2023 with the building of a new fresh distribution facility and a new frozen distribution centre.

""This investment will enable Metro to continue its growth and expansion in the Ontario market,"" Metro chief executive Eric La Fleche said in a statement.

""With a new and modernized supply chain infrastructure, we will be even more responsive to the needs of our customers.""

""Teen Wolf"", ""Maze Runner"" und der Unfall

Nach dem Highschool-Abschluss ergatterte Dylan O'Brien seine erste größere Rolle: In der MTV-Serie ""Teen Wolf"" übernahm er 2011 die Rolle des Stiles. Stiles ist der beste Freund von Werwolf Scott McCall (Tyler Posey), der für jede Menge Lacher sorgt. Der Serie blieb O'Brien bis zur finalen, sechsten Staffel treu. Erst im September 2017 flimmerte die letzte Folge über die US-Bildschirme. Neben der Show bekam er kleinere Rollen, zum Beispiel in der Komödie ""Prakti.com"" an der Seite von Vince Vaughn und Owen Wilson oder in ""Deepwater Horizon"" mit Mark Wahlberg.

Erste Qualitäten als Leading Man konnte er in ""Maze Runner - Die Auserwählten im Labyrinth"" unter Beweis stellen. Er übernahm in der Buchadaption die Hauptrolle des Thomas. Die Sci-Fi-Filme basieren auf der Roman-Trilogie von James Dashner. Der erste Teil spielte im Jahr 2014 über 345 Millionen Dollar ein, ""Maze Runner - Die Auserwählten in der Brandwüste"" schaffte 2015 ebenfalls über 300 Millionen Dollar weltweit. Der dritte und letzte Teil, ""Maze Runner: Die Auserwählten in der Todeszone"", sollte 2017 erscheinen. Doch O'Brien wurde im März 2016 bei den Dreharbeiten schwer verletzt.

Lange Zeit war unklar, ob und wie es mit dem Film und dem Schauspieler weitergehen würde. Der Filmstart wurde in Deutschland schließlich auf 01. Februar 2018 verschoben. Das erste offizielle Foto von O'Brien gab es im September 2016, als er bereits für ""American Assassin"" vor der Kamera stand. In dem Streifen ist er ab 12. Oktober als die beliebte Buch-Figur Mitch Rapp zu sehen. Im Zuge der Pressetour sprach er erstmals öffentlich in Interviews über seinen Horror-Unfall, den Panikattacken, von denen er heimgesucht wurde und dass er beinahe alles hingeschmissen hätte.

Sein privates Glück

Doch der 26-Jährige hat sich erholt - körperlich und seelisch. Neben seinen Eltern wich auch seine Freundin Britt Robertson (27, ""Kein Ort ohne Dich"") in dieser schweren Zeit nicht von seiner Seite. ""Sie ist eine Heilige"", schwärmte er jüngst in einem Interview über die Unterstützung seiner Liebsten. Die beiden Schauspieler lernten sich bei den Dreharbeiten zum Teenie-Film ""The First Time - Dein erstes Mal vergisst du nie!"" (2012) kennen und lieben. Doch Robertson muss ihren Freund teilen...

Sumra Muslim potters return every year to Sarkhej Roza, where their goods are bought by Hindu wholesale traders, evoking secular unity

By Gajanan Khergamker*, Ahmedabad, Gujarat

Every morning, Rehman Sumra of Kheralu village in Mehsana district rummages through his wares, salvaging whatever he can, packing them for his annual journey to work. Each passing day brings increased anxiety to the Muslim potter who, like his fellow craftsmen, was hit the worst by the most recent floods in Gujarat. ""The rains have stopped, and it's time to go to Ahmedabad and start work,"" he says, looking at the cloudy skies.

Each year in September, more than a hundred potters belonging to the Sumra community head for Ahmedabad's Sarkhej Roza from their villages in Mehsana. In Sarkhej Roza, they set up makaan and karkhana, (home and workshop) at spaces they take on a five-year lease.

Running out of money as their work had been delayed, Rehman incurred unexpected additional expenditures in repairing his flood-hit village home. While the government forces rescued stranded citizens from Banaskantha, Patan and Mehsana districts in north Gujarat, the badly affected potter community waited out the monsoons. ""We have gone through with our savings, there's no work in the village, and to top it, we suffered financial loss owing to the rains,"" Mariam, Rehman's wife, told VillageSquare.in. Having lived off their earnings during the heavy monsoon, the Sumras are keen to get back to work.

Strengthening secular ties

In spite of the hardships and hand-to-mouth existence, the Sumras look forward to their work. For the economic activity has carved out a beautiful socio-cultural association as the Muslim Sumra families make pots for the predominantly Hindu Kumbhar community in Gujarat, Rajasthan and Maharashtra, strengthening secular ties, especially in troubled times.

With the rain clouds receding and humidity decreasing, Rehman and his wife Mariam are set to return to Sarkhej Roza to start their work once again. For the next eight months, the Sarkhej Roza suburb of Ahmedabad will be home to Rehman and hundreds of other Muslim potters.

From Diwali until the next chaumasa, as they call the monsoons, they will make thousands of pots that would be bought by both wholesalers and retailers. The Sumras specialise in making pots of different shapes and sizes for storing water and keeping it cool during summers.

Each kumbharwada, as a settlement of potters is known, has approximately 20 potter families residing and working together. The potter families in a kumbharwada are mostly from the same village. The shanties are lined next to each other and covered with huge plastic sheets. Pots are placed in beautiful symmetrical patterns, in rows and stacked vertically, to be sold in the wholesale market.

The families in a kumbharwada pay a landlord who owns the entire plot and rents out each shanty for Rs 1,200 per month. With an additional expenditure on electricity, the charges add up to Rs 2,000 per month, and the potters do not pay any deposit. They make five-year agreements and work entirely on trust.

The potter families who come to Sarkhej Roza have been doing so regularly for the past 15 years. Some like Noori have been coming for 20 years. ""In fact, I live here and go to my village only when I have to attend a family function,"" said the 50-year-old from Sidhpur in Patan district For many, the temporary homes seem more permanent to them than the houses in their native villages.

Making pots, not money

The pottery process isn't exactly an easy one. According to Sumra, getting the clay or chikni mitti is tough. Clay is sourced from the beds of lakes of Sanand and a tractor load of clay for making about 500 pots costs Rs 2,000. Once the pots are made, they need to be coloured with geru (earthen ochre ), which is ordered from Thaan, a village about 120 km from Sarkhej Roza.

Rehman's brother-in-law, 20-year-old Imran Haji Sumra, lives in an adjacent shanty with his family and transports the pots to cities such as Surat and Valsad in South Gujarat. Within a few years of starting work, he has been able to buy a mini truck that can transport 700 pots. On delivering pots in Surat, 350 km from Ahmedabad, Imran earns Rs 7,000.

Making ends meet until there is enough demand for pots is tricky for the potters. Sometimes the pots don't sell as expected. Then the Sumras leave the pots in their karkhanas and return to their village; they come back next year and sell the same during Diwali.

Family effort

Contrary to the stereotyping associated with the community, men and women work shoulder-to-shoulder. While Rehman does arduous physical tasks, Mariam too handles those that are equally backbreaking. Lifting heavy pots, bags of clay and creating artistic pots are gender-neutral activities for the community.

Shahida, one of Noori's daughters, comes to Sarkhej Roza every year to help her mother in the family business and then returns to her marital family in Mandali village in Mehsana district. ""I help my mother in colouring and baking the pots,"" said Shahida even as she continued cooking the family's meal.

Noori's parents-in-law Ibrahim Sumra and Ruksana rest on the makeshift bed as Noori ducks below the low ceiling fan to sit next to them. ""It is important to keep the fan low so the pots can dry quickly,"" she explains.

This year Noori, Imran's mother, has brought three goats to ensure milk for her grandchildren. ""Lekin, inko rakhna bhi toh mehenga padta hai (But rearing goats too is a costly affair),"" she says. Every day she spends Rs 100 on fodder for the goats.

All the members of the potter family pitch in to make a collective earning. If the man of the house is busy with the pottery business, the woman sets up shop selling everyday items in her makaan. Mariam runs a makeshift store selling grocery to the other potters. The children take care of the goats.

A secular network

While the potters are all Muslims, they deal primarily with Hindu wholesale dealers who buy the pots in bulk. Ahmedabad's Vejalpur-based Girish Prajapati, a regular wholesale dealer says he feels at home when he comes to Sarkhej Roza to buy pots. ""I am a Prajapati, a Hindu potter and I always buy my wares from a Sumra, a Muslim potter. We have been doing business for many years now, without a single problem,"" he says.

Brexit minister Steve Baker said on Wednesday all of Whitehall was preparing for “all potential outcomes” including “the unlikely eventuality of not securing a deal”.

Baker made the claim in a letter to Labour MP Chuka Umunna, a leading supporter of the pro-Remain Open Britain campaign.

Umunna had written to the Brexit department to demand clarity after Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said his department was “not planning for no deal”.

Earlier today, Chancellor Philip Hammond went as far to suggest it was “theoretically conceivable” flights could be grounded on the day the UK leaves the EU if no Brexit deal is reached.

Umunna said trying to pin down whether contingency planning was being done inside government for a no deal out come was like “trying to nail jelly to the wall”.

“Once again, this government is more interested in fighting amongst themselves and making contradictory statements than making sure we avoid crashing out of the EU with no deal,” he said.

“One day one minister says there’s no plan for no deal, the next day another minister says there is. But evidence from the head of the NHS proves that actual concrete preparations for a disastrous no-deal Brexit are woefully lacking.”

On Tuesday, Simon Stevens, the head of the NHS in England, told MPs the health service has not been asked to examine what the impact of a no deal scenario would be.

In his letter, seen by HuffPost UK, Baker said: “We recognise that a responsible government should prepare for all potential outcomes. Over the past year. every department has been working at pace to build a detailed understanding of how withdrawing from the EU will affect its existing policies and services in a wide range of outcomes and are developing plans for multiple scenarios.

“Over the next few months the extent of this planning will become clear. some plans have sufficiently long lead times that we need to begin now for them to remain viable. even though we hope not to need all their provisions once we have achieved a deal with the EU.

“The plans have been carefully developed to provide the flexibility to respond to a wide range of negotiated outcomes in addition to preparing us for the unlikely eventuality of not securing a deal.

“We are undertaking a significant amount of work to assess the economic impacts of a no deal scenario across the whole of government, to ensure that departments are prepared for a negotiated settlement and for the unlikely scenario in which no mutually satisfactory agreement can ha reached. This is part of the Government’s continued programme of rigorous and extensive analytical work, looking across a range of scenarios on a sector by sector basis.”",DexEU Disputes NHS Claim It Has Not Been Asked To Plan For No Brexit Deal,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2017/10/11/dexeu-disputes-nhs-claim-it-has-not-been-asked-to-plan-for-no-brexit-deal_n_18236888.html?utm_hp_ref=uk

Andy Burnham's First 100 Days A politician can issue as many mission statements as they like. They can write a comprehensive manifesto that sets out a plan of action. And they can make as many promises as they think they can keep. But ultimately, as history shows time and time again, the true measure of their success, their effectiveness and their authority comes from how they react to the unforeseen. Events, dear boy, as Harold Macmillan put it. So it has proved with Andy Burnham's first 100 days as Greater Manchester's first directly elected metro Mayor. Works in external affairs at Manchester Metropolitan University. Suffers an excess of civic pride. Arte et Labore.

The Grenfell Inquiry Must Say That Everyone - Whatever Their Background - Has The Right To Life For this inquiry to serve its purpose and to attract our confidence, it must listen to what we say. The terms of references have been the talk of the community for weeks. It is important to us. A group of residents, race equality organisations, academics, lawyers and experts have put in a submission to the panel and may ask to become core participants. Our community is bruised, confidence in public authorities is at its lowest and we cannot cope with any further disappointment, any further rejection.

Grenfell Tower Reveals It's Really The Middle-Class Who're Guilty Of The Politics Of Envy The residents of South Kensington complaining about rehousing Grenfell Tower victims in their neighbourhood need a reality check. Be grateful that nothing like this has happened to you. Not just the fire, but the sheer poverty that comes with living on a council estate. Instead of moaning that these people are getting help you've never needed, try being grateful for the fact that you have, in fact, never needed that help. Contributing Editor, The Gay UK Magazine

After Grenfell, Tenants Must Take Control Of Their Housing The most uncomfortable truth lurking within this tragedy is that there is a stigma attached to people who live in social housing. Narrowly, this means that a discount is applied to their views when they are expressed to the relevant authorities. Broadly it also means that the lives and wellbeing of people who live in council blocks are seen as having less value than home owners.

I am a much bigger fan of building a life while working a fulfilling career.","Since I turned 50, I have to use size 16 font just to read my own thoughts. It's kind of frustrating because if I sit a comfortable distance from my computer, I can't see it with my reading glasses on or off. I am contemplating getting three sets of glasses — something that seems ridiculous to me. I honour the idea that there is a lot to celebrate about aging, but there are still things that piss me off.

Fifty is a lot different than turning 40. To say you are 48, well that's still solidly 40-something. And 40-anything is not so far from 30, so in a way, almost anyone can relate to you. Somehow turning 50 is different, maybe because the next big birthday starts with a six. Anything starting with a six is old, or at least it seemed that way when my dad turned 60 and aging was the furthest thing from my mind.

Each one of my friends are going through this time in life differently.

I just want to clarify, here: I am a lot closer to 40 than 60, A LOT. I have a tendency to get ahead of myself. I wrestle with life changes before they really happen. (I psyched myself up about turning 50 when I was 45.) I wrestle with how it will feel to lose my physical abilities before these losses are obviously apparent. I try to celebrate wrinkles with the first signs of laugh lines, somehow believing when the deep lines appear I will feel less alarmed. Maybe this is a kind of reverse optimism — if I accept things early when they happen, they won't be so bad. And, weirdly, this approach has worked well.

By the time I turned 40 I was totally excited — I had a blowout party that led to two babies being conceived (happily, not my own). When I saw my first grey hairs, I was delighted that my naturally straight and rather fine hair was getting coarser and wavier. My husband told me that one of the things he loved about me when he first met me at 42 were my laugh lines. Ha, he must be crazy about me now.

Each one of my friends are going through this time in life differently. Some of them are working harder to get in shape, determined to rock their 50s in terms of energy and appearances. A huge number of my girlfriends have taken on seriously big physical events like walking the Camino, running a marathon or — get this one — completing an Ironman.

(In case you didn't know, an Ironman comprises of a 4.2-kilometre swim, followed by a 184-kilometre bike ride, followed by... wait for it... a marathon!)

And do you know what age demographic this crazy physical event markets to? Forty and older. I am an Olympic athlete, but I still think that one is kind of excessive.

Why shouldn't our 50s be one of the most exciting decades, personally and professionally?

A surprising number of my friends are taking on bigger challenges professionally, something that I personally find inspiring. Why shouldn't our 50s be one of the most exciting decades, personally and professionally? If we have been paying attention, we know a lot of important stuff by now. We have often mastered multiple skills, we have seen all types of behaviours and we are more apt to call a spade a spade.

Many of us struggled through our early years, having to work so hard faking it until we were making it, that we failed to see we crossed the line and were now the expert. Our early insecurity navigating the politics of the male-dominated office environments may have become a habit that we are now eager and ready to shed.

It took me 25 years, but now, in my 50s, I want to spend all my time in my strengths, and I want to rock it there. I don't mind working hard, but I want to do the things I am really good at, while continuing to learn and expand my thinking. I am definitely at the place where I am interested in almost everything, but aware that I can only be really good at a handful of things. So why not take on a meatier project, something that really challenges us to use all our varied skills and learnings — maybe even something that creates a positive social impact?

I notice many of my friends becoming more involved as their child duties lessen and their schedules allow for more community involvement. This is an ideal time in life to join boards, head up fundraising initiatives and dial it up rather than dial it down.

I am a much bigger fan of building a life while working a fulfilling career.

I am not a big fan of dialing it down, but I get why people do it. They want more time, more time to travel, to read the paper in the morning, more time to putter in the garden, more time to get on with the business of living, to pay attention to our lives outside work.

In the decades I have spent speaking to corporate audiences all over this country, I have learned how much people give to their work. People are there for their jobs, they want to do good work, they want to pull their weight on their team, they get up early and rush out the door and put their head down and go all day. So it's natural that people want a break, they want some breathing space to enjoy other aspects of their lives, especially while they are still in good health.

I am a much bigger fan of building a life while working a fulfilling career. I believe that employees deserve to have lives, they deserve to have some flexibility, to have some time a few days a week to workout, to walk their kids to school, to take a sick day when they simply need a break. When we build these things into our working environments we are rewarded with people who love their jobs and value their life outside of work. In my years of working with people in my little company, I have gotten loyalty and commitment through offering my team flexibility and being genuinely interested in their lives. As one of our team members is nearing 60, we have restructured her job to allow for more travel with her husband, but I still need and want her, as she is an ace at her job and a delight to work with.

I think that women and men are redefining what it means to age. That doesn't mean we are ageless; that whole notion is stupid. My greys are coming in fast and furious, affording more frequent highlights that coincidently are working quite well with what my stylist calls my ""natural highlights."" We can age well, which in my opinion happens when we embrace where we are, honour our bodies, find meaning in our work, and choose to approach each day from a place of gratitude. Fifteen years of yoga and meditation practice has given me a more ageless attitude than injecting my forehead ever will. The bigger question is not ""How do we slow down the natural signs of aging?"" but ""How do we use these years of our lives wisely?""

Esto, luego de que el Tribunal Electoral descontó más de un millón de pesos al análisis de fiscalización de gastos de campaña realizado por el INE a la campaña del candidato del PRI, Miguel Riquelme, con lo cual, el tricolor habría rebasado el tope de gastos de campaña en un 5.09%. Un asunto que prácticamente evita la nulidad de la elección, luego de que la ley establece que la elección deberá declararse nula si algún candidato rebasa más del 5% el tope de campaña en una elección que se define con una diferencia menor al 5%.

Aunque la resolución representa un golpe para el INE en términos políticos, luego de que el TEPJF consideró ""que el análisis del material probatorio realizado por el Instituto fue deficiente"", con respecto a una serie de gastos no reportados por el PRI, Córdova indicó que acatará la determinación del Poder Judicial.

""Acatar la sentencia. Tenemos que replantear y llevar a Consejo General un nuevo dictamen atendiendo lo que son las modificaciones que nos instruye el Tribunal Electoral. Paralelamente, estamos desahogando las quejas que quedaron pendientes de procesos electorales pasados, todo eso impactará probablemente en esta nueva versión del dictamen. Si eso vuelve a ser impugnado, el Tribunal tendrá que volver a pronunciarse"", dijo Córdova a pregunta del HuffPost.

Al ser cuestionado por este medio si el recorte de 1 millón 043,163.97 pesos a los gastos de campaña del PRI deja al candidato Miguel Riquelme como el virtual vencedor de la contienda, Córdova señaló que esperará a que el INE realice un nuevo cálculo antes de emitir una opinión.

""Todavía no se ha hecho el cálculo, no voy a especular sobre el punto. Tenemos que volver a hacer los cálculos"", indicó Córdova.

""¿Aunque el recorte deja al PRI en los linderos de la legalidad?"", insistió el HuffPost.

""No voy a especular, porque no tenemos todavía, hasta que haya un dictamen y un análisis a partir de lo que el Tribunal Electoral mandató, pues no sabemos el punto. En todo caso, insisto, lo de los rebases de los topes de gasto de campaña pues es un asunto que se determina técnicamente por el INE y luego el Tribunal Electoral es el que tiene que, en su caso, pronunciarse en el contexto de la calificación de las elecciones"", respondió Córdova.

""Nos dieron 15 días para ser estas adecuaciones. Está ahora el análisis en el ámbito de la Unidad de Fiscalización y de la Comisión de Fiscalización, y en su momento se subirá al Consejo dentro del plazo que estableció el Tribunal"", agregó.

Sin embargo, reconoció que hubo omisiones, pero no del INE sino del Congreso, a la hora de establecer lineamientos claros sobre prohibiciones constitucionales. Esto, a raíz de que el TEPJF revocó el acuerdo de ""cancha pareja"" que emitió el INE para acotar a aspirantes a las candidaturas a puestos de elección popular.

""Hay desafortunadamente omisiones, que yo creo que es lo que se desprende de las resoluciones del Tribunal Electoral, y creo que es ahí donde deberíamos poner el énfasis. Estamos hablando de omisiones del poder legislativo que han incumplido con el mandato constitucional de emitir normas y criterios en las leyes correspondientes respecto de las prohibiciones constitucionales"", dijo Córdova.

Pero a pesar de que en los últimos meses el TEPJF desechó tanto la fiscalización de la elección en Coahuila como el acuerdo de ""cancha pareja"", Córdova aseguró que el INE no se confrontará con los magistrados del Poder Judicial, quienes tienen la última palabra a la hora de validar una elección.

Así lo reconoció el pasado 10 de octubre, en entrevista con Reforma. También descartó que el INE haya sido debilitado en sus tareas de fiscalización por la resolución del TEPJF.

""En el INE consideramos unánimemente que era mucho mejor tener esos criterios desde antes y que todo mundo lo conociera para que se supiera con claridad para una cuestión de certeza"", dijo.

Elan-Cane, who first contacted the UK passport office directly in 1995, sees the issue of “X” passports as a key focal point of the non-gendered campaign.

At a hearing in London on Wednesday, Justice Gilbart granted the campaigner, who was present in court, permission to bring a judicial review.

A full hearing of the challenge will now be held on a date to be fixed.

Lawyers for the Home Secretary opposed Elan-Cane’s application.

Granting permission, the judge emphasised that he was only ruling that the case was “arguable”.

In written submissions to the court, Kate Gallafent QC, for Elan-Cane, told the judge: “The claimant’s identity is that of a non-gendered person: someone who does not identify as either male or female.

“The claimant considers that obtaining and using a passport currently involves the claimant making a false declaration as to the nature of the claimant’s gender identity, which causes the claimant considerable distress.”

POLITIQUE - Emmanuel Macron reçoit ce jeudi 12 et vendredi 13 octobre patronat et syndicats pour attaquer la suite des réformes sociales -formation professionnelle, apprentissage et assurance chômage- dans un climat social alourdi par les premiers choix du quinquennat.

Plus de quatre mois après les premières rencontres sur les ordonnances réformant le droit du travail, l'exécutif reprend la même méthode: le président ouvre le bal de la concertation, avant de passer le relais à Matignon et à la ministre du Travail Muriel Pénicaud. Un projet de loi est attendu en avril.

Les ""trois chantiers"" sont ""liés et ""contribuent à protéger chacun"", a vanté mercredi sur BFMTV Muriel Pénicaud.

Reste que le climat social s'est un peu alourdi depuis l'été, entre le mécontentement des fonctionnaires qui ont défilé mardi, une discussion budgétaire qui s'annonce animée à l'Assemblée, et la CGT qui a appelé à manifester une troisième fois le 19 octobre pour le retrait des ordonnances. Publiées fin septembre, celles-ci sont déjà entrées en vigueur.

""On est tous d'accord pour dire qu'il y a de l'inquiétude sur ce qui va être fait en termes de formation professionnelle et d'assurance chômage, qu'il y a beaucoup d'incertitudes"", a indiqué Véronique Descacq (CFDT) à l'issue d'une intersyndicale lundi.

""On se demande ce qu'il y a de positif pour les salariés"", résume le leader de FO, Jean-Claude Mailly, dans un entretien à Paris-Match, voyant ""davantage de signes négatifs"", comme la ""suppression de l'ISF"".

Pour autant, les syndicats peinent à se mettre d'accord sur une riposte. Ils ont d'ailleurs prévu de tous se revoir le 24 octobre, après avoir rencontré l'exécutif sur ces nouveaux chantiers. Jeudi, Jean-Claude Mailly débutera la journée à 9h et sera suivi par Philippe Martinez de la CGT à 10h, François Hommeril (CFE-CGC) à 11h, Alain Griset de l'U2P à midi, Pierre Gattaz pour le Medef à 15h, Philippe Louis (CFTC) à 16h et François Asselin (CPME) à 17h. Laurent Berger, secrétaire général de la CFDT, indisponible jeudi, sera reçu vendredi à 09H00.

""Ouvrir l'assurance chômage à tous""

C'est la réforme de l'assurance chômage qui risque de cristalliser le plus l'attention. Il est prévu d'étendre le système aux indépendants et aux démissionnaires. ""L'objectif, c'est d'ouvrir l'assurance chômage à tous et c'est aussi qu'elle puisse se réformer pour lutter contre la précarité"", explique la ministre du travail. Car ""les contrats précaires"", c'est ""ce qui coûte le plus cher à l'assurance chômage"". Est prévu un ""bonus-malus"" pour les entreprises qui abusent des contrats courts.

Muriel Pénicaud a par ailleurs qualifié mercredi de ""fantaisiste"" le chiffre de 14 milliards d'euros avancé dans la presse comme coût des nouvelles indemnisations. Les syndicats, eux, craignent que ces nouveaux droits n'entraînent une baisse des allocations.

Autre sujet de friction: le financement et la gouvernance. Le régime ne serait plus uniquement financé par les cotisations, mais également par l'impôt (CSG), et il passerait d'une gestion paritaire par les partenaires sociaux à une gestion tripartite avec un pilotage de l'Etat.

S'agissant de la formation professionnelle, le gouvernement a déjà promis de mettre 15 milliards sur la table sur cinq ans dans le cadre du grand plan d'investissement, avec pour but de former un million de chômeurs de longue durée et un million de ""décrocheurs"". Comme d'autres avant lui, ce gouvernement veut simplifier un secteur difficilement lisible où se côtoient de nombreux acteurs.

Il compte ainsi réformer le CPF, compte personnel de formation. Dans un rapport publié mercredi soir, l'Igas (Inspection générale des affaires sociales) juge que ce dispositif mis en place en 2015 ""reste en-deçà des ambitions initiales"" et ce ""malgré un volontarisme incontestable dans son déploiement"".

""Ce que je souhaite faire c'est que chaque Français, chaque salarié, puisse avoir sur une 'appli', facile d'accès à tous, ses droits à la formation, combien d'heures, ça coûte combien (...), quel est le taux d'insertion dans l'emploi après"", promet la ministre. La réforme de l'apprentissage se fera, comme celle de la formation, en concertation avec les régions et devra rendre plus attractif ce dispositif.

Bis 2030 sollten 15 Prozent aller Neuwagen in Europa mit einem Elektromotor oder anderen emissionsfreien Antrieben ausgestattet sein, berichtet die Zeitung.

At long last, the Commons select committee system is twitching back to life, after its post-election dormancy.

With a number of new chairs and plenty of new members - and no shortage of big issues to talk about - expect plenty of interesting hearings, which will probably start resulting in major reports by Christmas, or maybe the new year. With a minority government nursing a fractious parliamentary party, and heavily focused on Brexit, there are plenty of opportunities for ambitious select committee chairs to shape the agenda, and even drive policy, if they can deploy the skills and the streetsmarts to use their influence effectively.

A few loose ends remain. There is still no sign of the Parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee, which is appointed by the PM, rather than elected by MPs.

With a series of major terror attacks earlier this year, and rising concern about the manipulation of social media by foreign powers, to influence the political process in Britain and elsewhere, members of the previous incarnation of the committee are keen to get to work.

Neither has the Commons Liaison Committee re-surfaced. This is the super-committee of all the main select committee chairs.

The Queensland Government will consider appealing the suspended sentence given to a man who pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of his four-year-old stepson and smiled and laughed as he walked free.

Scown was sentenced on Wednesday to a maximum four years' jail for the manslaughter of Tyrell Cobb, having already spent two years and eight months in custody.

He had initially been charged with murder but pleaded guilty to lesser charge ahead of sentence on Wednesday.

Justice Martin Burns said Scown was not responsible for the injuries that killed Tyrell, but had failed in his duty of care to the boy who died on the Gold Coast in May 2009.

He had 53 bruises and 17 abrasions from head to legs when he died, the court heard.

Junto a ella, más de una veintena de madres y padres víctimas de la violencia narran, con voz encendida por la furia o apagada de pronto por el nudo en la garganta que provoca la ausencia de uno de los suyos, la manera en que sus hijos fueron desapareciendo.

Lo hacen ante las organizaciones Brigadas Internacionales de Paz (PBI), Amnistía Internacional, Serapaz México y la Red Nacional de Organismos Civiles de Derechos Humanos (Red TDT), como parte de una Misión Civil de Observación realizada en Chilapa de Álvarez el pasado 19 de septiembre, a fin de visibilizar la escalada de violencia en la región.

Chilapa está entre los 50 municipios más violentos de México.

En Chilapa existe una macro criminalidad que deja al descubierto la complicidad del Estado y sus instituciones con los diferentes grupos o cárteles de la delincuencia organizada, garantizándoles una total impunidad para actuar"". Reporte del Centro Regional de Defensa de Derechos Humanos José Ma. Morelos y Pavón.

Todas las historias tienen en común que las víctimas son hombres, en edad productiva, y que, en la mayoría de los casos, son indígenas y de escasos recursos económicos.

Todos, además, no han sido investigados adecuadamente por las autoridades competentes y han sido las propias familias quienes han jalado los hilos de las averiguaciones de los hechos que ""uno nunca cree que le van a pasar a uno"".

UNO BUSCA CON 'LA MAÑA'

Jesús Pineda Mejía, de profesión optometrista, desapareció el 19 de julio de 2016. Salió de su casa para irse a trabajar en una de las campañas de visión que realizaba por distintos sitios del estado. Ese día acudiría a Chilpancingo, pero a las 9:42 de aquel día le envió a su novia Annie un inusual mensaje de whatsapp en el que le escribía que lo habían secuestrado y que lo buscara rumbo a Chichihualco, una población de Guerrero.

""Yo lo vi bañado, cambiado y todo, lo vi listo para irse a trabajar. Yo regreso como a las 10 am y mi trabajador me dice 'doña Rosa, están avisando que a Jesús su hijo lo levantaron' -- cuenta su madre Rosario Mejía y en un punto en que se le quiebra la voz--, le digo eso no es cierto, y seguí haciendo mis cosas, es algo que da miedo, nervios y son las cosas que uno no cree que le van a pasar a uno.

""Es una sensación de impotencia, qué hago, qué hago, dónde lo busco.""

Tras sobrepasar la incredulidad, Rosario empezó su indagatoria con personas que los mismos pobladores saben que tienen vínculos con ""la maña"", como se refieren al crimen organizado, ""porque sabemos que nos puede conectar y son a los primeros que recurrimos, por qué no sabemos con quién buscar"".

Fue hasta el tercer día que Rosario acudió a denunciar a la Fiscalía Especializada en Materia de Desaparición Forzada y Búsqueda de Personas Desaparecidas y lo que obtuvo por respuesta fue lo que casi todos los familiares de desaparecidos escuchan: que su hijo ""seguro andaba de borracho con sus amigos"".

LA DESAPARICIÓN FORZADA SE HACE EVIDENTE

El Centro Regional de Defensa de Derechos Humanos José Ma. Morelos y Pavón AC, el cual se ha dedicado a documentar el contexto violento de Chilapa y Zitlala Guerrero, señala que la desaparición forzada se hizo evidente tras la incursión de presuntos policías comunitarios que entre el 9 y 14 de mayo de 2015 detuvieron, y desaparecieron, a al menos 16 hombres pese a la presencia de la Gendarmería, el Ejército, la Policía Federal y municipal.

Fue tras estos hechos que las familias se unieron para comenzar la búsqueda de sus desaparecidos y se incentivó la visibilización y denuncia de otros casos ocurridos desde 2007.

Por su parte, la Comisión Ejecutiva de Atención a Víctimas (CEAV) ha dificultado la atención a las víctimas. En Chilapa, por ejemplo, desde principios de enero comenzaron a conformar un padrón de víctimas y, hasta ahora, los familiares de desaparecidos siguen sin recibir apoyo económico, denuncia el Centro Morelos.

NO SABEMOS NADA DE NINGUNO DE LOS DOS

Esmeralda Huaxtitlán Sixtos estudiaba la carrera de enfermería en el Conalep y tenía 35 años cuando desapareció al ir a buscar a su hijo Erick, del que tampoco se sabía su paradero. Erick Geovanni García Huaxtitlán tenía 18 años aquel 20 de octubre de un año atrás cuando ya no se supo más de ninguno de ellos.

""Él (Erick) iba a dejar normalmente a su mamá en la moto, pero de él ya no supimos en toda la tarde. Mi hermana regresa entre las 8 o 9 de la noche y pregunta a su otro hijo por su hermano, éste le dice que no lo había visto en todo el día. Le empezó a marcar a su teléfono y ya no le contestaba. Cerca de las 11 de la noche, salió a buscar a su hijo mayor, a esas horas ella salió y ya no regresó. Y hasta ahora, no sabemos nada de ninguno de los dos"", cuenta sin evitar el llanto la hermana de Esmeralda.

Fue hasta un mes después de la desaparición que la familia acudió a denunciar.

Andábamos dedicados a investigar con vecinos y familiares y no tuvimos respuesta y pues entre miedo y preocupación se nos pasaron los días; cuando denunciamos, nos daban largas y siguió transcurriendo el tiempo, hicimos la denuncia pero hasta después de un mes, por miedo, coraje, y la inseguridad, porque estando en una situación así, a veces la misma familia te dice que es tu problema y te las arregles como puedas.""

MÁS SEGURIDAD, MÁS VÍCTIMAS

El 27 de enero de 2016 en la región se implementó un megaoperativo con más de 3 mil elementos del Ejército, la Marina, la Policía Federal y la estatal, a fin de disminuir la cifra de secuestros y homicidios.

Si embargo, ese mismo año se contabilizaron sólo en Chilapa y Zitlala 205 asesinatos, 41 desaparecidos, 26 heridos en hechos violentos, ocho secuestros y se hallaron 56 cuerpos en fosas clandestinas.

De la cifra de muertos destaca que 23 fueron decapitados, 68 asesinados con arma de fuego, seis calcinados, 16 desmembrados y 33 perdieron la vida durante enfrentamientos.

TENÍA UNA SEMANA EN EL NUEVO TRABAJO Y LO MATARON CON OCHO TIROS

Kevin Castro Domínguez acabada de cumplir 18 años, era estudiante del Colegio de Bachilleres, hacía danza folclórica y recién había integrado un grupo de apoyo a personas con adicciones.

Tras dejar un empleo en una tienda Oxxo, entró a trabajar a un centro botanero. Llevaba tres días atendiendo el lugar cuando, por la noche, llegó una camioneta con hombres armados, se estacionó delante del negocio y dos hombres balearon el lugar.

""A dos clientes les dieron un balazo a cada uno, tomaron a mi hijo, lo agarraron de los cabellos –se deduce por la forma en que quedó el cuerpo— le dieron ocho balazos y no se moría, se murió en el hospital, yo creo esperaba a que yo llegara"", cuenta su padre Lamberto Castro.

INVESTIGACIÓN DE PROPIA MANO

La desaparición de su hijo Josúe Molina Rodríguez, de 30 años, llevó a María Guadalupe Rodríguez Narciso a convertirse en una obsesiva investigadora del caso de su hijo ante la omisión de las autoridades y en la aguerrida cabeza de una organización dedicada a la búsqueda de personas.

Hay una complicidad inmensa, grande, desde las altas autoridades hasta el último policía y la verdad sí estamos en una situación crítica y delicadísima."" María Guadalupe Rodríguez Narciso.

El colectivo que también comanda está investigando los casos de la gente viva, ""porque aquí todo mundo busca muertos, busca tumbas, pero de los vivos no nos preocupamos, cuando hay gente viva secuestrada, gente que está al servicio de la delincuencia.""

María cuenta que un joven que buscaba a su hermano en la sierra, encontró en una barranca de Chichihualco, muchos cadáveres, pero también gente viva en varios puntos de la sierra que presumiblemente es obligada a trabajar para grupos de la delincuencia organizada procesando la droga.

""Empiezo a rastrear esa información y la llevo a la PGR para investigar a esa gente, para bajar a esa gente viva, porque ahí podría estar mi hijo, los hijos de los compañeros. Me cerraron las puertas, recurro a mi Ministerio Público de PGR, para que también protegieran al muchacho, pero incluso ya nos estaban criminalizando diciendo que pertenecíamos al grupo de Los Rojos para que no nos hicieran caso.

""Él contó lo que sabía, habló sobre un autobús que no aparecía donde supuestamente irían los estudiantes normalistas de Ayotzinapa y que bajó de la sierra; por eso turnaron el caso a la Fiscalía de los 43, le tomaron su declaración, su denuncia, sin darle medidas de seguridad. La Fiscalía de los 43 declinó la competencia a SEIDO y ésta la regresó a la delegación PGR de Chilpancingo, donde están coludidos"", narra la activista.

El joven, que había declarado en mayo de este año, desapareció en julio. No se sabe nada de él.

De ahí lo que pasó es que el testigo desapareció, y estaba muy dispuesto a entrar a la sierra, a ir de guía y a señalar los puntos donde tenían a la gente."" María Guadalupe Rodríguez Narciso.

Así, continúan las narraciones de los familiares de los desaparecidos de Chilapa, con leves variantes y con el común denominador de investigaciones mal llevadas y la colusión de las autoridades. Y tras ellos, el sismo del 19 de septiembre de 2017 y, con él, otra vez el silencio sobre estas víctimas.","Chilapa, el municipio secuestrado: “Aquí todo mundo busca muertos, no gente viva”",http://www.huffingtonpost.com.mx/2017/10/11/chilapa-el-municipio-secuestrado-aqui-todo-mundo-busca-muertos-no-gente-viva_a_23239334/?utm_hp_ref=mx-homepage

“I think beauty shouldn’t have a definition,” she tells HuffPost UK. “As I see it, beauty is about being yourself, natural and authentic. It’s in our differences, we just have to open our eyes and see it.”

Travelling the world photographing women for the past few years, Noroc realised beauty is so much more than what we see in the mass media and she wanted to celebrate that.

“If you put the words ‘beautiful woman’ into Google, you’ll mostly see very similar images of seductive women. But on the streets of the world beauty has many more facets and I love to capture them,” she explains.

For Noroc, capturing beauty in this way is not simply about aesthetics but crucial to shaping the way we see other cultures and communities.

“We live in a time of hate and intolerance so it was important for me to send a message about love and diversity. I created many contrasting juxtapositions in the book to show that although we are so different, we are all part of the same beautiful family,” she says. “Beauty has no borders, so kindness and tolerance shouldn’t have either.”

When finding her subjects, most of the time Noroc approaches the women on the street, but she is also contacted by people on social media with suggestions for women to photograph.

When asked to define what makes a good subject, she explains that selecting the women is largely “instinctive”.

“I walk almost continuously on the streets of the world. And in all these crowded places you don’t have a lot of time to think. Everything is instinctive like when you’re driving a car,” she says. “The huge difference is that in photography you also put a lot of soul into the process, besides instinct.”

A perfect example of this is the woman who graces the cover of the book (below). Noroc was walking around the Ganga river, in Varanasi, India. It is a holy site for Hinduism, visited by thousands daily.

Noroc was drawn to one particular young woman who was preparing to make an offering.

“Her serene expression seemed to be from another world, and the morning light was great. I was so fascinated by this magic moment that I entered deep into the river and I even forgot that my phone was in my pocket. In such atemporal moments, objects don’t mean anything. I asked her permission to take a photo and after that I let her continue the ritual,” she recalls.

“Usually, I try to spend more time with the women that I photograph. I take a few photos and listen to their stories. But this time, I didn’t have the chance, so we spent only a few seconds together.”

While many women are happy to be approached about the project, Noroc says there are women who have refused to be photographed.

“I have been refused by women living in conservative environments, who were preoccupied by what the other members of the community will say about them being photographed. Other times, by women living in dangerous places where they didn’t feel secure,” she says.

“All these refusals made me realise that many women in the world feel a lot of pressure. This convinced me even more that our world really needs an Atlas of Beauty to represent the struggles and the dreams of women from all over the world.”

We were too, as the kids would say, shook AF to even begin to piece things together. That being said, so were the bachelors, as they mourned Luke's departure and most likely eventual appearance on 'Bachelor In Paradise'.

Uncle Sam deemed himself ""the next frontrunner"" which is like Abraham Lincoln calling himself the best audience member the theatre has ever seen. Don't get too ahead of yourself mate.

Thankfully the most handsome magician in the house, Apollo, nabbed the single date. Uncle Sam called the muscular, handsome and kind Apollo ""a dark horse"" which is fine if you think the definition of ""dark horse"" is ""perfect man"".

Excuse us we just have a lot of fanfic to write about this.

If Sophie and Apollo weren't attractive enough their date basically involved getting into a pen full of puppies. They decided to do ""Doga"" which, before you get too excited, is doggy yoga. A woman wandered over to Apollo and Sophie and spritzed them with ""love spray"", something that'll get you kicked out of a Coles.

The pair did yoga with two of the fluffiest, cutest dogs and we stress-ate an entire tub of ice cream because of all the feelings.

Sophie and Apollo shared stories about being creative types. ""I used to have a mouse costume and one time I just sat really still for hours,"" Sophie admitted. ""My best friend was a girl and we used to hunt fairies,"" Apollo told her.

Honestly this is why no one likes creative types.

Back at the house Blake, one of the few boys yet to have a single date with Sophie, was concerned he wasn't getting enough time with her. He greeted her on the group date by telling her she had a ""sick outfit"". Men are so strange.

Osher informed the bachelors that they were about to compete in a boat race. Jarrod, the most competitive bachelor in history, was ready to throw his own team into the ocean.

Jarrod is the first man to find a way to power a boat purely from sheer competitiveness and screaming.

""GO, GO, GO, GO"" Jarrod screamed at everything on the boat. ""GO, GO, GO"" he shouted at a pile of ropes. Meanwhile Blake decided to give Sophie a massage.

""I love competition,"" Jarrod said before noting that the ocean was wet and the sky was blue. ""I love competition,"" Jarrod said like Scrooge McDuck would admit to loving money.

Unfortunately, despite all his incessant screaming at a bunch of ropes, Jarrod didn't win the alone time, Blake did.

As they sipped champagne on the front of a boat in the gorgeous Sydney Harbour Blake looked at Sophie and said, ""I really want to kiss you now"". Then he turned back to the harbour and stared directly into the sun, searing his eyes as the awkwardness set in of not actually kissing her.

""Ha ha this is not awkward at all,"" Blake said before snapping his champagne glass in half and eating it.

It was awkward as hell and such a huge missed opportunity for ol' Blakey boy.

Surprisingly this episode featured a THIRD date, possibly because Blake's alone time was so awkward and boring (for both Sophie AND us) Sophie gave Sam his second date. Remember the ""double delight rose""? The one Sam wouldn't shut up about? Well he finally got his second single date.

""It's like so tacky it's awesome,"" Sophie said either describing the hummer limo she picked him up in or his hair.

As Sophie and Sam drove through the countryside in a stretch hummer he kept talking about all his actor friends, his voice over work and how he basically is the best music producer in Australia. Sophie was so impressed she could barely make a facial impression.

Then she took him to play some connect four in a field because Sam is basically what would happen if a teenager had fallen in a coma in the '90s and only just woke up. ""Radical, I am so good at Connect Four! Cowabunga dudette!""

Somewhere, Jarrod is screaming ""I'M VERY GOOD AT CONNECT FOUR, I LOVE COMPETITION"".

The date went on as Sophie tried to quiz Sam about his intentions and why he decided to be on the show. Was it for fame? Was it for her? Was it for the bromance between him and Blake? Whatever it was, Sophie wasn't feeling the vibe and DIDN'T give Sammy a rose on their games date.

As Sophie entered the cocktail party Jarrod described her as ""Black Swan all over,"" a film where Natalie Portman wants to be so good at ballet she goes crazy and dies. Okay mate.

We then had to talk about Jarrod's love plant for ANOTHER DAY. The good news, however, is that his little plant was finally growing. ""Oh, mine's like massive... mine's overtaken yours but it's still good,"" she said pitifully.

""It bodes well for me that Sophie is impressed by minimal growth,"" Jarrod thought.

Blake and Sam had a really weird chat where they both decided that they'd love to be the final two because they both believe Sophie would be ""safe"" in the other's hands. It was... kind of creepy and weird.

Speaking of weird: this rose ceremony was BONKERS.

Two bachelors weren't going to get roses and quickly Jarrod, Stu and James all joined Apollo in the rose brigade, leaving Blake, Sam and AJ behind. There were a few swear words (sorry Ryan, we know you don't like swears!) as she dropped an immense bombshell.

Sophie dismissed AJ because, like who cares. Then she approached Sam and Blake, the two remaining bachelors. ""Do I know the real you, Sam?"" ""Blake, most of our time together I didn't think you liked me,"" she said to both of them.

Excuse us we just have a lot of fanfic to write about this.

She then walked back to the rose and... gave it to Blake!!!!

Justo delante de mí hay un hombre de cuarenta y pico años con un refresco y un periódico. Delante de él, está una madre con su hija pequeña pagando. Cuando la madre y la niña se van, se adelanta el hombre para pagar.

""¿Dos dólares? ¡Aún recuerdo cuando solo valía uno!"", le oigo decir sorprendido. Se dirige a la salida después de pagar y decido coger yo también un periódico. No puedo evitar fijarme en la noticia que hay en portada sobre las crecientes consecuencias de la epidemia de obesidad que atenaza no solo a Estados Unidos, sino al mundo entero, y cómo los sistemas sanitario y económico ya están esforzándose por no quedarse rezagados.

Unos nubarrones de triste ironía se posan sobre mí mientras trato de encontrarle algún sentido a estos acontecimientos. Me siento frustrado, no por ese hombre en concreto, sino por el sistema que hemos creado entre todos, que excluye a los individuos de la ecuación del panorama económico, más allá del precio de su, según él, caro refresco (y eso que el verdadero precio es mucho mayor). A veces me parece inútil pensar que el pequeño precio que ha pagado hoy ha sido, de hecho, solo la punta de un iceberg fiscal mucho más grande y preocupante.

Mi frustración se convierte en concentración al tiempo que me reafirmo en mi creencia de que nuestros mayores problemas de salud y la consecuente carga económica que genera en nuestras sociedades –una preocupación compartida por mucha gente– no es un problema que se saquen de la manga los médicos o se solucione en los hospitales, es un asunto que incumbe a los economistas, gente de negocios, políticos y quienes regulan los mercados. Es un problema creado por la economía. Y hasta que no comprendamos estas realidades económicas, será complicado avanzar o encontrar soluciones.

¿Cuáles son estas realidades?

Cuando compramos un refresco o cualquier bebida azucarada (productos que todos asociamos con el aumento de peso, la obesidad y la diabetes), no pagamos una, sino tres veces. La primera, en caja con dinero. Las otras dos veces, más adelante, y son estos pagos diferidos los que causan casi todo el problema, ya que conducen al llamado ""fallo de mercado"". Sucede cuando las fuerzas del mercado normales, que indican qué cantidad se fabrica y, lo más importante, qué cantidad se consume, se desequilibran debido a manipulaciones externas.

Básicamente y parafraseando a Churchill, lo que muchos de nosotros pasamos por alto es que el precio que este hombre pagó en caja por su refresco no fue el final, sino solamente el final del principio.

He aquí la explicación:

El precio en caja:

El primer precio que pagamos por las bebidas azucaradas es el dinero que abonamos en caja. Para ser un producto hecho con algunas de las materias primas más baratas de nuestro entorno (plástico del petróleo, agua del cielo y azúcar subvencionado con nuestros impuestos), las pocas monedas que pagamos ya son bastante en sí mismas. Estas materias primas apenas cuestan unos céntimos por botella, de modo que el beneficio que obtienen por cada producto no es nada desdeñable. Es un dato importante, porque es este generoso margen de beneficios el que permite que las compañías de refrescos se puedan permitir gastar tantos millones cada año en publicitarse, ejercer presión a los políticos y hasta pagar a los distribuidores (en este caso, el supermercado) para engatusar a los niños, llenar de colores nuestros frigoríficos y regalar vasos promocionales a lo largo de toda la cadena de venta.

Caro, ¿verdad? Pues no hemos hecho más que empezar.

El precio que pagas después de beberte el refresco:

Claro y directo: las bebidas azucaradas, refrescos, bebidas gaseosas o como quieras llamarlas no son buenas para la salud. Son de los pocos ""alimentos"" que no aportan ningún nutriente, salvo gran parte de las calorías que necesitamos diariamente. La ciencia ha mostrado su vinculación directa con la obesidad, la obesidad infantil y la diabetes. Existe una clara inclinación en la mayoría de las sociedades: los miembros más pobres de los países más ricos son quienes más toman estas bebidas, y cada vez más gente de los países más pobres está adoptando este malsano hábito. Se sabe que el cerebro no detecta las calorías de las bebidas azucaradas del mismo modo que en alimentos sólidos, de modo que se convierten en calorías adicionales que se suman a las que ingerimos en nuestras comidas o incluso abren más el apetito. Sería falso insinuar que las bebidas azucaradas son la única causa de la epidemia mundial de obesidad, pero está demostrado que son un factor importante.

Si tenemos en cuenta todo lo anterior, los refrescos resultan muy caros a las personas, ya que la obesidad, la diabetes y las enfermedades cardíacas no son baratas. A nivel mundial, esas son las principales causas de muerte y contribuyentes clave de las muertes prematuras (evitables). Facturas médicas, bajas por enfermedad, discapacidades derivadas de estas enfermedades debilitadoras de largo plazo, pérdida de tiempo de vida productivo debido a muertes prematuras... Todo ello supone un precio incalculable en el individuo y su familia. No se trata de una exageración futurista ni fantasiosa. Es un problema actual que asola hogares de todo el mundo. Se estima que la epidemia de obesidad le cuesta a Australia más de 56.000 millones de dólares al año. En Estados Unidos, las personas con obesidad tienen un 150% más de gastos médicos en comparación con las personas con un peso adecuado.

El precio que sigues pagando mucho después de haber dejado de tomar refrescos:

El coste final está relacionado con el hecho de que es imposible volver a encerrar al genio (en este caso, las consecuencias fiscales de las bebidas azucaradas), en la lámpara (o la botella) una vez que lo has dejado salir. El coste colectivo a largo plazo que tiene en nuestra sociedad es la estadística más alarmante de todas por dos motivos, al menos:

El primero es la omnipresencia de estas bebidas. Décadas de campañas masivas de marketing han normalizado y hasta incrustado en nuestra cultura la idea de los refrescos como constituyentes preciados y básicos de nuestra dieta, indicadores de éxito e iconos de ""occidentalización"". Un ejemplo sencillo: da igual qué ciudad visites en cualquier país del mundo, tendrá letreros rojos y blancos de Coca-Cola por todas partes.

El segundo motivo se debe a la cantidad que consumimos de estos productos. En 2016, México, Estados Unidos y Australia consumieron 297, 270 y 145,3 litros de bebidas azucaradas per cápita, respectivamente. La envergadura de la relación que hay entre el consumo de refrescos y problemas de salud a gran escala es prácticamente indescriptible. Los costes sanitarios directos e indirectos entre la población de distintos países son insostenibles. Para muchos países de ingresos bajos y medios, lo que empieza como un problema sanitario acaba convirtiéndose en un obstáculo para la reducción de la pobreza e incluso el desarrollo económico. Ahora el precio ya está completo, y recae con frecuencia en quienes menos pueden afrontarlo.

La verdad amarga de las bebidas azucaradas

Aunque son tremendamente rentables para las compañías de refrescos y los accionistas que disfrutan de los beneficios que les caen del cielo, el tsunami de los costes sanitarios de las bebidas azucaradas está llegando a nuestras costas.

No se trata de prohibir o acusar. Se trata de trabajar por una economía justa y de asegurarse de que las familias, los padres y la sociedad en general entiendan el panorama completo del precio que pagamos por los refrescos y puedan tomar sus decisiones de forma realmente consciente.

Llevamos demasiado tiempo pagando sin saberlo un precio muy doloroso por las bebidas azucaradas que consumimos. Estos gastos, diferidos durante años o incluso décadas, serán una cosecha enorme y amarga que llegará cuando ya no notemos el sabor dulce en nuestras bocas.

The fact that a staggering number of Indian sportspersons around the country struggle to make ends meet and have a dignified life is common knowledge. Many of them, die in pitiful conditions, their legacy either ignored or forgotten.

One such sporting hero is Rajvir Singh, a double gold-medallist in cycling at the 2015 Los Angeles Special Olympics. In 2015, at the age of 15, Rajvir, son of a daily wage labourer from Ludhiana, Punjab, made the country proud with a double win — in 1km and 2km cycling races — at the Special Olympics World Games. He achieved this feat with only one month of training before the event, after a local businessman donated a professional cycle to him. Rajvir suffers from disability, with below-average intellectual and adaptive functioning.

Two years after his win, the family is yet to receive a bulk of the cash prize promised to Rajvir after his win, reported The Indian Express. The Punjab government had announced Rs 15 lakh for each of the gold medals he won, while the Central government promised the Singh family Rs 10 lakh.

""We received Rs 10 lakh from the Central government. But we never received Rs 30 lakh cash prize from the state government,"" Balbir Singh, Rajvir's father told The Indian Express.

Additionally, Parkash Singh Badal, the former chief minister of Punjab from the Shiromani Akali Dal, had announced a prize of Rs 1 lakh, of which the family has only received Rs 50,000, after a lot of effort. ""Some officials even demanded bribe for releasing [the] Rs 50,000 cheque,"" claims Singh.

With the state government reneging on its promise, the Singh family was left with no option but to seek alternate employment for their gold medallist son. Initially, Rajvir joined his father as a labourer, picking stones and bricks for money. Together, the duo earned Rs 400 a day, just enough to feed the family.

But due to Rajvir's vulnerable mental condition, his father has now placed him in Manukhta Di Sewa, a shelter for disabled and homeless elderly people. There, Rajvir pushes the wheelchairs of the disabled, gives them food, water, helps them bathe, and performs other odd jobs. He earns about Rs 5,000 a month as salary at the shelter.

Paramjit Sachdeva, the area director of the Punjab chapter of Special Olympics said no money could be paid to winners right now because the draft policy for Special Children Olympics medal winners is yet to be notified. Even though the policy was cleared by Sukhbir Singh Badal, the former deputy CM of Punjab, it is lying with the state's sports department, awaiting notification.

Abject poverty has forced the Singhs to stop Rajvir's training, since the family has barely any money for food. And so, cycling, which was once considered an escape that would help their disabled son live a self-reliant life, is now only a distant memory for them.

The list of sportspersons ignored by the Central and state governments, the sports ministry, their sports' federations and politicians who announce hefty cash rewards in the immediate aftermath of their achievements covers the length and breadth of the country and the entire gamut of sports played in India.

Shankar Laxman, India's star hockey goalkeeper who represented India in three successive Olympics and captained the team that won gold at the Asian Games in 1966 died in 2006 while suffering from gangrene and with no money for treatment. Despite his 13-year-long illustrious sports career, he received Rs 25,000 for treatment from the state government.

KD Jadhav, the man who won India its first individual Olympic medal in 1952 for wrestling, lived and died in obscurity. In July this year, his son threatened to auction off the medal Jadhav won to shame the Maharashtra government into building the wrestling academy it had promised to establish in Jadhav's name but had failed to do so.

Si les tendances observées ces dernières années se poursuivent, l'obésité juvénile surpassera l'insuffisance pondérale d'ici 2022, prédisent toutefois les auteurs de cette étude.

En 2016, 124 millions de jeunes de 5 à 19 ans étaient considérés comme obèses, contre seulement 11 millions en 1975, évalue l'étude, conduite par l'Imperial College de Londres et l'Organisation mondiale de la Santé (OMS).

Polynésie, États-Unis, Égypte très touchés

Le phénomène concerne toutes les régions du monde. Les pays les plus touchés sont certaines îles de Polynésie (plus de 30% des 5-19 ans touchés aux îles Cook, par exemple), tandis que ce taux atteint ou dépasse 20% aux États-Unis, en Égypte ou encore en Arabie saoudite.

Si cette prévalence semble plafonner depuis quelques années dans les pays riches, elle continue à grimper dans les pays à revenu faible ou moyen.

Le nombre d'enfants et d'adolescents en insuffisance pondérale diminue lui lentement depuis 2000 - sauf en Asie du Sud et du Sud-Est et en Afrique du centre, de l'Est et de l'Ouest.

L'an dernier, on comptait encore 192 millions d'entre eux en sous-poids modéré ou sévère, ajoutent les auteurs, qui ont analysé des données portant sur 31,5 millions de jeunes dans 200 pays. Les deux tiers de ces jeunes en sous-poids habitent en Asie du Sud-Est, notamment en Inde.

Un poids trop faible augmente notamment les risques de maladies infectieuses.

Transition de l'insuffisance pondérale vers le surpoids

""Il y a toujours besoin de politiques qui encouragent la sécurité alimentaire dans les pays et les foyers à faible revenu. (...) Mais nos données montrent que la transition de l'insuffisance pondérale vers le surpoids de l'obésité peut se produire rapidement"", avertit le professeur Majid Ezzati de l'Imperial College de Londres, qui a coordonné leurs travaux.

Le spécialiste de santé environnementale met en garde en particulier contre le risque de ""mauvaise transition alimentaire, avec une augmentation des aliments à forte teneur énergétique mais pauvres en nutriments"".

""Très peu de politiques et de programmes essayent de rendre accessibles aux familles pauvres les aliments sains, tels que les céréales complètes et les fruits et légumes frais"", a-t-il déploré, dans un communiqué accompagnant l'étude.

Cela entraîne des inégalités sociales face à l'obésité et limite les possibilités de réduire ce fardeau, souligne le chercheur.

En juin, une étude publiée dans la revue New England Journal of Medicine alertait déjà sur l'augmentation de l'obésité (le nombre de personnes touchées a doublé depuis 1980, selon celle-ci) dans le monde mais aussi sur l'accroissement des maladies liées au surpoids.

L'obésité provoque des risques accrus de maladies chroniques, telles que le diabète, et de maladies cardiovasculaires.

Every day I wake up at around 6am. I go downstairs, put the dog on his lead and take him for a walk. We go to the same park just around the corner. The one with the old oak tree by the lake where he does his business as he always does. He loves that tree. Then I walk him back home, have a bowl of cornflakes, read the news and check my emails.

After that, I leave the house and go to the tube station. On my way, I visit the local café where I order a latte from the same woman I order my latte from every single day, the one that always wears her hair in a bun and never wears lipstick. I don't even need to tell her my order, she usually has it ready as soon as I get there - which is ideal, as it means I don't have to speak to anyone in the morning before I've had my caffeine fix.

I'm a creature of habit. Most of us are and our behaviour is predictable. In fact - and you may find this uncomfortable to read - human behaviour is 93% predictable.

So recently one morning, when the woman handed me my coffee, I noticed that her hair was down and she was wearing bright red lipstick. I didn't think too much about it but I did fleetingly think it was strange. It suited her. I forgot about it and went back to my routine. I had a train to catch.

Then guess what? A week later I saw her chatting to a good-looking bar man. My memory kicked in and I put two and two together. There was a new relationship in the air. How lovely.

Of course, it was only by chance that I noticed this change in the woman from the café, but you know who would have noticed this change instantly? A computer.

Changes in mood and behaviour can be subtle, so subtle that the brain often cannot detect these changes or save them in our memory. They often don't stick and if they do, they only leave a slight trace. A computer however sees it as a big black binary mark. They have total memory recall and can be designed to retain information, analyse, compare, predict and interpret data. Computers can be taught to find patterns, learn from them and alert someone when something changes. In short, they can detect anomalies in behaviour patterns. They can spot the lipstick!

So, what are these patterns of behaviour? And can a computer really predict what we are going to do?

We are predictable

""Similarity breeds connection,"" according to sociologists Miller McPherson, Lynn Smith-Lovin and James Cook in their paper Birds of a Feather: Homophily in Social Networks. Homophily means the tendency within social groups for similar people to connect on some level, across various relationships including marriage, friendship and colleagues from work. People of different genders, races, ages, classes, education and ethnicities all have different characteristics that impact who they choose to socialise with. To paraphrase Aristotle in his Nicomachean Ethics: ""people love those who are like themselves.""

I'm specifically interested in how this principle can help us to safeguard children online. This principle, whereby similar people come together and form social groups helps machine learning systems to detect anomalies in patterns of behaviour and analyse when a discrepancy has occurred. For example, if your 14-year-old Zoella-obsessed daughter starts chatting to an 18-year-old punk metal fan or if your 12-year-old Chelsea Football Club supporter son suddenly connects with a 16-year-old boyband super-fan from Sydney, it could see that something was out of the ordinary and potentially not right. When these changes occur and they don't make sense, computers are able to flag the connection and look deeper into the data patterns to see why this behaviour is breaking the norm.

The cadence of communication is important too; children and young adults tend to brag and banter with each other, which is a very distinctive pattern of communication. It helps us to pick up when people are posing as children and attempting to conduct grooming. Similarly, this cadence is well established during the build-up to a sext: it's a 'go on, go on, go on, send it' style of exchange - very quickfire, much like children daring each other to do something they shouldn't offline. The patterns of behaviour are distinctive and when statistical and probability analytics are overlaid, they can start to provide accurate patterns that can lead to predictable outcomes. For example, sexting is more common between the ages of 13 and 17 and increases with age. Boys receive more images than girls, exchanges commonly happen in a one-to-one situation and 89% happen at the beginning of a new relationship. The application of statistical analysis significantly reduces false positive outcomes.

But isn't this all common sense? Well, not always. We are frequently too busy to pick up on these things, or are simply trying to give our children space online to explore, have fun and be themselves. With children on average sending and receiving over 200 messages a day, it becomes impossible for a human to spot delicate and intricate patterns. Not so in the world of AI and machine learning.

Mum and dad, for example, can drop the need to snoop, pry and spy on their children as the robots do all the hard work helping to safeguard children whilst also ensuring their privacy. It is this latter point that I get excited about. Children have rights too and apps that disclose to a parent what their children are sending and receiving are not only intrusive and invasive but do the safeguarding industry damage. Children simply find ways to avoid and bypass them.

The computer will see you now

This principle of automated discrete behavioural patterning is well-established in medicine. For example, Andrew Beck from Harvard Medical school conducted some research on women with breast cancer. He ran their details through a machine learning algorithm to see if the AI could identify whether the given biopsy he provided was cancerous or not. This would then determine what course of treatment the patient should go on. The only extra information he gave the AI was the longevity of the patient, whether they died within a week or are still alive etc. The AI was able to identify 11 signs that the given biopsy was cancerous. However, the medical community only knew around eight of them, the other three signs were unknown to the human eye, having never been picked up by a human before.

Similarly, when we look at behaviour and patterns of behaviour, we can see certain traits that crop up. Machine learning can spot a troll, predator, bully and a groomer by observing, patterning and analysing, it can then flag if it suspects a potential threat. We know that statistically, comments on YouTube that are between three and eight words have a 72% chance of being abusive and we know that an increased number of capital letters, exclamation marks and the use of first person pronouns is synonymous with the language of a troll.

By analysing these patterns of behaviour, machine learning algorithms can spot any changes that go against the grain. Regardless of whether they're typical or not.

Let the robots lend a hand

The ability to track and analyse human behaviour is vital when it comes to being able to detect harm or potential harm. Computers can make sense of the confusing, emotive and sometimes scary online world. The algorithms can understand chaotic human behaviour and find patterns in linguistic traits, social media content and even likes on Facebook.

Using these systems, personalities can be patterned online, allowing for proactive and pre-emptive action to be taken to help reduce abuse and hate online, to spot that the quiet and shy girl is suddenly loud and flamboyant, or to flag cancerous cells before a human can even see them.

We all love to people watch. We poke our heads out of the living room window because we heard some people on the street or we sit outside a café watching people aimlessly wander by. We may notice that a person is wearing a green hat or is eating an apple, but we won't observe much more. We need our computers to watch alongside us, to learn and analyse information in order to help us understand things we never would have seen - so that we can blithely get on with ignoring the majority of the world while enjoying a latte.

The unnamed 16-year-old, who has since recovered, went to hospital in Texas when she felt short of breath the next day.

A series of tests lead doctors to diagnose her with three separate conditions, which they believed could be linked to her overzealous cheering.

Her story recently appeared as a case study in the Journal of Emergency Medicine.

EMPICS Entertainment

The doctors noted that while the girl was breathing quickly, her breathing sounded normal.

However, they noticed signs of crepitus - a cracking or clicking sensation that occurs under the skin - when they pressed down around her neck and chest.

Speaking to Live Science, report author Dr J. Mack Slaughter Jr. described the sensation as “feeling Rice Krispies”.

Following x-rays the doctors diagnosed the girl with pneumothorax, which is the term given when air builds up between the outside of your lung and the inside of your ribcage. This is also known as a collapsed lung.

After further examination she was also diagnosed with pneumomediastinum, which is when abnormal gas or air is contained within the mediastinum (the space in the chest between the lung sacs).

Finally, doctors identified rogue air in a third place, near the back of the throat, and diagnosed her with pneumoretropharyngeum.

The team said there was no evidence to suggest an underlying lung condition caused the three problems and noted that shouting could have prompted the damage, although this was impossible to conclude for certain.

“Spontaneous pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and pneumoretropharyngeum are uncommon diagnoses individually, and furthermore, the combination of all three diagnoses has yet to be described in medical literature,” they said in the report.

Commenting on the case study, GP Dr Clare Morrison, from online doctor service MedExpress, said it’s important to remember the girl’s experience is extremely rare.

“I cannot think of another time when lungs have collapsed due to screaming at a pop concert - but there’s a first time for everything,” she told HuffPost UK.

“So it’s important not to panic and for parents to get too judicious.”

She said smokers and recreational drug users have a higher chance of a pneumothorax - or lung collapse - than the general popualation.

“Also, if you’re suffering from a condition like asthma or pneumonia, your chances increase,” she added.

She pointed out that symptoms of a collapsed lung include:

Chest tightness

Tiredness

Rapid heart rate

Nasal flaring

Blue-coloured skin

“A small pneumothorax will likely go away on its own - you could only need oxygen treatment and rest,” Dr Morrison added.

“Often a needle will be used to pull the air out from around the lung so it can expand fully. If the pneumothorax is large, a chest tube will be placed between the ribs into the space around the lungs to help with draining the air and allow the lung to re-expand.

“In such an instance, you could need to stay in hospital. In some more extreme cases, patients may need lung surgery.”

Are they right or are they reflecting an echo chamber of elites?

The majority of analysts did not correctly predict President Jacob Zuma's win over former president Thabo Mbeki at the party's Polokwane national conference in 2007. Similarly, leading American pundits got wrong United States President Donald Trump's triumph in the race for the White House.

Citibank economist Gina Schoeman has started a monthly poll of eight analysts to predict who is leading the seven-candidate race for the ANC presidency.

The analysts have indicated they think it is a two-horse race between Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa and ANC MP Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. Of the eight analysts, six have Ramaphosa leading with two casting their votes for Dlamini-Zuma.

The analysts have indicated they think it is a two-horse race between Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa and ANC MP Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma

The two analysts who think the ANC is going to tip its hat at a first woman president are University of the Witwatersrand vice-chancellor Adam Habib and leading political analyst Ralph Mathekga. A campaigner for Dlamini-Zuma says the six pundits are wrong. ""It's early days and the process of party branches nominating is just starting,"" says the strategist.

The strategist adds that Dlamini-Zuma is not a media darling and that very few of her events get coverage. Ultimately, this is a party race and the structures of the ANC make the decision, so Dlamini-Zuma is showing ample love to ANC branches, regional and district structures. She does up to five party engagements a day on Saturdays and Sundays.

The campaigner adds that Dlamini-Zuma has chosen not to campaign negatively and, as a result, her messages are not as media-resonant as those of other candidates. She is focusing on grassroots issues such as economic transformation, skills development, land reform and agricultural expansion.

This is not as sexy as being anti-corruption or anti-state capture. ""I think the media is underestimating her impact,"" says the Dlamini-Zuma aide.

In the Ramaphosa camp, a representative says he thinks the survey of analysts is accurate, but is cautious to emphasise that a true picture will only emerge by the middle of November, when all branch nominations for the ANC presidency are in.

Over the weekend, the ANC released its list of numbers in each provincial delegation to the December national conference and this seemed to favour Dlamini-Zuma.

KwaZulu-Natal is still the ANC's king (or queen) maker province and Dlamini-Zuma is strong on her home turf.

In addition, Mpumalanga premier and provincial ANC chair David Mabuza has boosted ANC numbers to stratospheric levels, making him a key powerbroker.

Mabuza has ambitions to be in the presidency and he is said to favour aligning with Dlamini-Zuma, which means the delegate numbers swung into her corner.

But Ramaphosa's strategist says there are no givens in any province because they are unlikely to vote as blocs. Ramaphosa has strong support in KwaZulu-Natal because sidelined former premier Senzo Mchunu has taken a position in the deputy president's tent.

The ANC race is tough to call because it has almost everything to do with the country, given the party's power and representation, but almost nothing to do with its people, because the 5,000-odd delegates to the conference make the decision.

Weil described her responsibilities as ""historic"" and said she would be consulting English-speaking communities, particularly outside the cities, to see what their needs were, particularly in terms of employment and health services.

""We want to ensure that people who ... chose to live here can flourish in Quebec society,"" she told reporters after the Liberal government's cabinet shuffle.

Fears of mass protests have led diplomats to discuss downgrading the US President’s plans from a full-blown State Visit, according to the London Evening Standard.

Instead of receiving a Royal banquet at Buckingham Palace, the revised programme would see Trump embark on a “working” trip as part of a tour of other European states.

Jeremy Corbyn’s office have welcomed the downgrade, and renewed the Labour leader’s offer to take Trump to a local mosque to help him understand Muslim culture.

Theresa May tried to underline her close relations with the US President at the White House in January, when she invited him to the UK on a State Visit as guest of the Queen.

PA Wire/PA Images The Queen and Barack Obam on his State Visit in 2011.

The intention was to repeat the success of Barack Obama’s own State Visit in 2011, but critics pointed out the convention was to wait for a President’s second term in office before being granted the honour.

The Trump trip had been expected this summer, but the UK snap general election as well as growing controversy over Trump’s foreign policy led to a rethink.

Some protestors had even planned to ‘moon’ the president en masse, as part of a campaign called ‘Show your rump to Trump’.

The newly stripped-down visit is expected to focus on global security issues.

Trump may be allowed cut the ribbon on the brand new US embassy which is close to completion at Nine Elms, near Battersea Power Station.

But he will not sleep at Buckingham Palace as the guest of the Queen, probably staying at the residence of the new US ambassador Woody Johnson instead.

Asked if the downgrade to a ‘working visit’ was a welcome move, a senior Labour source said: “We don’t think it’s appropriate or right for there to be a State Visit by the US President.

“If Donald Trump comes to the UK, Jeremy has said he’s prepared to meet him and would like to introduce him to different communities in Britain and make the case against many of the things Trump is doing domestically and internationally. He would take him to Finsbury Park Mosque and have a meeting there.”

A source close to Sadiq Khan confirmed to HuffPost UK that the Mayor of London, who led criticism of the State Visit invitation, “would not object” to a working visit.

Diplomatic sources suggested to The Times on Thursday that the trip could involve a short audience with the Queen to ‘mollify’ the President, but without the full trappings of a ceremonial visit.

Her Majesty usually lists all formal visits for the coming year, but pointedly did not include the US President’s trip.

The absence of Trump’s tour from her speech was a clear signal that no date had been agreed on his controversial visit. It followed claims that he was worried about mass street protests causing embarrassment to himself and the Royal Family.

“Take it out, take it out ― oh f**k!” she says in the painful video, before she looks like she’s going to cry and then starts laughing.

Ross’s followers loved the hilarious clip, but many cautioned her from removing her nose hairs again.

“Oh no it’s cold and flu season you need those babies,” one person wrote, while another added, “Oh no Tracy why??? You need those hairs to filter out germs dust etc!”

It turns out her fans are on to something. Most experts agree that you shouldn’t remove your nose hairs, because they act as a filtration system that keeps out germs, while also helping to trap dust and debris. There’s also an added risk when you pluck, wax or shave nose hairs.

“You do remove that level of protection into the nasal cavity whether it be particles or foreign objects getting in there,” Anthony Del Signore, MD, assistant professor in the department of otolaryngology and director of rhinology and endoscopic skull base surgery at Mount Sinai Beth Israel, told HuffPost. He added that by removing the hair, you also become more susceptible to an infection at the follicle level.

“The hairs emanate from follicles in the skin and sometimes bacteria can get in there, especially for people that shave their nose hairs or pluck them. It sort of leaves an entry for bacteria and for infection,” he said. “That usually manifests itself with increasing redness or tenderness and pain.”

He explained that the redness is a sign of cellulitis (a potentially serious bacterial skin infection) or folliculitis (a skin condition where hair follicles become inflamed). These conditions can lead to pus, the formation of abscesses and skin that is warm to the touch.

Del Signore said that doctors get particularly concerned about infections that happen in the triangle above the lip and around the outer edge of the nose, as the infection can then easily travel to the brain.

“You can get that extreme cellulitis around the nose that can sometimes spread to the eyes, the rest of the face, the brain or the brain covering,” he said. “But that’s if it gets out of control and doesn’t get treated appropriately with antibiotics.”",Tracee Ellis Ross Just Waxed A Body Part Experts Say Is A No-No,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tracee-ellis-ross-just-waxed-something-experts-say-you-shouldnt_us_59de2a8be4b04fc4e1ea673f

Vida Woodhull Stabler is the director of the Omaha (or “Umonhon” in the tribe’s language) culture center at Umonhon Nation Public Schools in Macy, Nebraska. She has been working for the past 18 years to painstakingly gather, record and pass on the cultural knowledge of tribal elders for future generations. Alongside other elders in the community, she has helped to developed a curriculum and lesson plans for Umonhon language classes, as well as other ways to infuse students’ day-to-day school experience with culturally relevant learnings, such as tribal songs and dance.

But she and her colleagues face an uphill battle: Only about a dozen Umonhon tribe members are believed to speak the language fluently today, Stabler told HuffPost.

“It is important for children” to learn the Umonhon language, Stabler told HuffPost. “I truly believe this: There is an innate need, want and love of our culture inside of them. They will become stronger as human beings when they know who they are, and can stand firm and strong against all the challenges that life will throw at them.”

Kyleigh Merrick, 15, who has attended Umonhon Nation schools since kindergarten, has chosen Umonhon language as an elective class.

“I hope to become one of the fluent speakers,” Merrick told HuffPost. “To me it is really important for everyone to learn the language and to teach our kids, because there aren’t that many fluent speakers. If I can become a fluent speaker, I can teach everyone else and help the language not die.”

In many Native communities across the U.S., tribal languages are endangered and are at risk of declining and even going extinct, as elder tribe members, who often are the ones who speak Native languages most fluently, die.

For Merrick, learning the Umonhon language as a teen today is important but also a challenge. She goes to language class every day, where she learns everything from verbs to animals to numbers ― but outside of class, opportunities to speak it are scarce. Her great-grandmother uses it at home, but among her peers, only a handful will sometimes greet each other in Umonhon, and that’s “just to joke around.” At school, she says only “a few” students are taking Umonhon language class and seem deeply interested in tribal language and culture.

“It’s just a few kids, not that many ― I think it all starts at home,” Merrick said. “The kids who choose movies over a ceremony or dance, it has to do with their parents and what they teach their kids ― if they pushed them to go to a ceremony or dances or social gatherings.”

In Stabler’s experience, parents and the larger Umonhon tribal community are invested in passing on cultural knowledge, and do so in myriad ways to their kids ― but not always through language instruction. In her view, the biggest barrier is simply kids’ assimilation into mainstream culture.

“There’s no doubt that our tribe, as well as many, are in a state of urgency. In our era, many of our remote places can have access to modern lure that take away our kids from cultural activity,” Stabler told HuffPost. “Instead of sitting and participating in a dance, they’d rather go to a movie. That’s youth, and that’s how assimilation happens.”

They will become stronger as human beings when they know who they are. Vida Woodhull Stabler

Another significant force that has worked against the passing of Native tribal languages over generations is the history of American Indian boarding schools ― which have left a painful legacy in Native communities. The federal government began sending Native students to boarding schools in the mid-1800s, and up through the 1960s students there were not allowed to express tribal cultures and were taught only English, in an effort to forcefully assimilate them.

“The boarding school experience beat the language out of them,” Mark Awakuni-Swetland, a former associate professor of anthropology at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln told the Omaha World-Herald in 2015, before his death. Awakuni-Swetland, who co-authored an Umonhon language dictionary, told the outlet that most boarding schools forced Native students to speak English, and the kids would be punished if they didn’t ― even beaten.

On the Umonhon reservation in Nebraska, the harmful legacy of boarding schools is still felt today.

“We’ve had to overcome a negative history with boarding schools to become more purposeful in teaching cultural values and norms of our community,” Stabler, who attended boarding school, told HuffPost. “Our community values our culture ― it was devalued in boarding school, but our community values it.”

Umonhon Nation Public Schools Stairs in Umonhon Nation Public School with words in English and Umonhon.

In Native communities nationwide, language revitalization efforts vary: In upstate New York, for instance, the Mohawk tribe offers its members deep language immersion programs, and in California, Native American Head Start preschools are teaching the youngest community members tribal languages from day one.

For Stabler in Nebraska, given the Umonhon tribe and school’s limited funding, passing on the language is a daily effort of making the most of the little she has.

“Our language does not have access to the same types of materials that Spanish or German do ― you can walk into any library and bookstore and find oodles of Spanish books to buy,” Stabler said. “Our community has had to develop materials, tangible stuff ― on our own. The first challenge is ensuring people want to learn and teach ― the second is making sure they have materials to learn from.”

If I can become a fluent speaker, I can teach everyone else and help the language not die. Kyleigh Merrick

Stabler provides the language and culture materials she and others have developed over the years to the larger Umonhon tribal community, including Native community members in Lincoln and Omaha, as well as Omaha Community College, which also teaches Umonhon language and tribal history.

At Umonhon Nation public schools, Stabler makes a point of incorporating tribal culture into students’ everyday school experience, which can mean something like hanging up a calendar with months in English and Umonhon, or working with the administration to infuse Umonhon culture into other classes. In biology class, for instance, kids might harvest corn to make traditional tribal foods, or in “family sciences” class, they might learn to do ribbon work or make moccasins.

One of the biggest challenges she faces is that while almost all of the students are Native, most teachers at the school are not. That’s why Stabler makes a point of bringing in tribal elders and others with expertise in cultural practices, like song and dance or poetry, to instruct kids. But both Stabler and Merrick insisted that even non-Native teachers, many of whom have been at the school for years and are certified to teach the Umonhon language, help to pass on tribal learnings.

For Stabler, the work of making sure Umonhon culture lives on into the next generations never stops ― in fact, it only grows more urgent with time, as some of the elders with the deepest cultural knowledge in the community have died in the last few years. But in her mind, nothing is more important.

“If [students] are rooted to our land, to our water and our earth, our air ― everything that’s around us ― they’ll be rooted as human beings,” Stabler said.

As the founder and CEO of The Remarkables, Lorraine Murphy is no stranger to meetings around the world. Each year she travels to either the U.S. or UK to gain fresh insights from global markets that she can share with her clients back in Australia.

Her most recent trip was pretty different because she brought along her 12-week-old baby Lexi. She met with several people -- none of whom had any issue with her bringing her baby with her.

Murphy, an expert in influencer marketing, told HuffPost Australia she set about booking in meetings with her existing UK contacts. She also reached out to some new people. She let everybody know that little Lexi would be coming too.

""One acquaintance replied to my LinkedIn Inmail saying she'd be very keen to meet, at which point we switched to email. We arranged a lunch date for the following week, and I let her know that I'd have my teeny sidekick with me. A few hours later, I received an email that was clearly destined for her assistant,"" Murphy said.

""Reading the email, I felt like I'd been kicked in the guts. I was deeply hurt. I was outraged on behalf of our little daughter.""

""And then I got angry. Really f***ing angry. I fired off an email response and ate some cake (a citron tart if you'd like specifics).""

Murphy then shared the exchange on her social channels, where she had hundreds of comments, shares and then 57,000 people saw her LinkedIn post.

Murphy believes there is an element of trust that needs to come into this, that your child won't be disruptive and prevent a productive, enjoyable discussion.

She would not expect anybody to attend a meeting if they're being distracted by a cranky baby.

""Of course, that would be a complete waste of their time, and, quite frankly, mine as well. But I don't believe that this should be a 'women's problem'. More and more parents are starting their own businesses, a life choice that I know from more than five years of experience places demands on every aspect of our lives,"" Murphy said.

""Today is my husband's day with Lexi. He is an entrepreneur as well, and I am so proud she is going to a meeting with daddy. In doing so, my husband is increasing visibility of men blending their businesses with their children.""

Lorraine Murphy believes the issue of having a baby at a meeting should not be seen as a 'women's problem.'

Murphy said the woman who wrote the email apologised and wanted to meet up to say 'Sorry' in person, but Murphy declined.

""The tone of the person who sent me that email was not, in my opinion, professional and sets the tone for the rest of their team,"" Murphy said.

""We each have responsibility for our communication, and how we manage that speaks volumes about our values; personally and professionally.

I was at a presentation on Saturday where the issue of housing affordability came up. It started me thinking about how does buying your first home in Sydney today, compare to when my wife and I bought our first home in the western suburbs of Sydney nearly 30 years ago in 1989.

So I went through some of my old paperwork and did some research and this is what I found.

If you directly compare the circumstances around Sydney house prices and interest rates that existed in 1989 with those that exist in 2017, you could come to the conclusion that homes in Sydney today are more affordable for first-home buyers than when my wife and I purchased our first home in 1989.

But what this does not take into consideration is what happened with interest rates in the period subsequent to 1989. When you take these substantial reductions in interest rates into effect, it becomes clear that purchasing a first home in Sydney today is less affordable than it was in 1989 -- a period you could previously argue was one of the least affordable times to buy a home in Sydney.

What was happening in the Sydney property market in 1989?

According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, between June 2012 and June 2017, house prices in Sydney increased by 74 percent.

Data compiled by Successful Ways shows that between:

June 2012 and June 2016, median house prices in Sydney grew by 75 percent; and,

June 1985 and June 1989, median house prices in Sydney grew by 127 percent.

Research published by Peter Abelson and Demi Chung, 'Housing Prices in Australia 1970 to 2003', shows that between June 1985 and June 1989, median house prices in Sydney grew by 93 percent.

It would be fair to say that the experience of first-home buyers in 1989 and 2017 are similar. They have both experienced significant increases in house prices in the years immediately prior to them wanting to buy their first home.

So, the circumstances that first-home buyers are facing in 2017 are not substantially different from what a first-home buyer (like myself and my wife) faced in 1989.

The other factor impacting on property was interest rates. In June 1985, interest rates for home loans were around 12 percent. By August 1989, they had climbed to 17 percent.

Contrast this with now where the RBA cash rate is 1.5 percent, as compared to June 2012 when it was 3.5 percent.

So the first-home buyer in 1989 had the double hit of significant house prices and interest rate increases. The first-home buyer of today has the hit of significant house price increases partially offset by the savings in interest costs.

Our first home purchase, and what it would cost today.

Back in 1989 we purchased our first home, a two-bedroom weatherboard home in the western suburbs of Sydney for $150,000. At 80 percent borrowing the loan was $120,000.

Roll forward to today -- I can't directly compare our old house, as after we sold it, it was knocked down and a child care centre built instead. But looking at similar two-bedroom homes in the area, it looks like they are selling today for around $700,000. At 80 percent borrowing the loan would be $560,000.

This is a 367 percent increase in the value of the house and required loan.

If we look at our incomes, from our 1990 tax returns (which I still have), our combined income before tax was $77,095. I was an audit manager and my wife was a bank teller. Our after tax income was $52,515.

Today, based on what I can see online, the 2017 annual incomes would be around $150,000 for these two same roles. This is an increase of only 95 percent. My estimate of an after tax income would be $114,536.

Incomes after tax have gone up more than incomes before tax because there are lower income tax rates in 2017/2018 than there were in 1899/1990.

Our first home loan.

Now, in 1989 we were paying 17 percent interest compared to today where you can get a home loan for under four percent.

So with a 17 percent interest rate on a $120,000 loan, we were paying $20,400 dollars per year in interest and our loan repayment over 25 years was $20,704.

With a four percent interest rate on a $560,000 loan, first-home buyers today would be paying $22,400 per year in interest. The loan repayment over 25 years would be $35,471, obviously higher as they have more principal to repay.

So, if we compare the circumstances that existed in 1989 with those that exist in 2017, we would see that on a like for like basis -- after tax incomes are up 118 percent, with loan repayments up 71 percent.

In 1989, our loan repayments were more than 39 percent of our after tax income whereas in 2017 the amount would be 31 percent.

The above table only looks at what would happen in the first year.

If we stay with the same interest rates and grow annual incomes from 1989 to today, in line with the change in average weekly earnings and beyond at 2.5 percent per annum, here is how much of post-tax income you would need to repay the 1989 loan and the 2017 loan over the term of the loan.

As you can see, the 1989 loan (at 17 percent interest rate) would require more of the post-tax income than the 2017 loan would.

Hence why, if we compare directly the circumstances that existed in 1989 with those that exist today, you could say that Sydney houses are more affordable for first-home buyers today.

But what has happened since 1989?

As we all know, interest rates have decreased substantially from 1989 and you can get a loan today at four percent or less.

So, like my wife and I, anyone who purchased their first home in Sydney in 1989, and initially suffered a substantial financial drain to make loan repayments back then, has benefited from the interest rate drops thereafter.

If we factor in some of these interest rate drops, you will see what really happened.

The 1989 first-home buyer was spending more of their post-tax income than the 2017 first-home buyer for a couple of years. But as the interest rate reductions took effect, then very quickly, the 1989 first-home buyer ends up paying less of their post-tax income than the 2017 first-home buyer.

So you would have to say that buying your first home in Sydney today is more unaffordable than in 1989 when we paid 17 percent interest rates and were heading for the recession we had to have.

Could the 2017 first-home buyer benefit like the 1989 first-home buyer?

Given interest rates are already at a historical low, it seems hard to imagine that the 2017 first-home buyer could benefit like the 1989 first-home buyer from interest rate cuts.

Even if we assume rates do drop and these first-home owners can get their loan down to two percent, as the chart below shows, they are still spending more of their post-tax income than the 1989 borrower did on their lower interest rates.

And the likelihood is that interest rates will go up and not down over the next 25 years, so the real result will probably be worse, as the following chart demonstrates.

If you directly compare the circumstances around Sydney house prices and interest rates that existed in 1989 with those that exist in 2017, you could come to the conclusion that homes in Sydney today are more affordable for first-home buyers than when my wife and I purchased our first home in 1989.

But, what this does not take into consideration is what happened with interest rates in the period subsequent to 1989.

The Indian Penal Code (IPC) is a legacy of the British Raj that was brought into force in 1860 to consolidate various penal statutes that were spread far and wide, owing to the diversity of the nation. The IPC was based on the prevalent customs and norms as it existed in those days. However, it has failed to keep up with evolution of society that has resulted in certain archaic and socially abhorrent provisions used till date.

Section 377, which criminalises homosexual intercourse, is one, another being 'Exception 2' to Section 375 which criminalises rape. The exception provides that sexual intercourse with minor wife who is of or above the age of 15 would not qualify as rape. This became specially contradictory to the amendment made to Section 375 in 2013 raising the age of consent from 16 years to 18 years.

The result of the amendment was that there was now a category of women between the ages of 15 to 18 who could not enjoy the protection of law if they were forced into sexual intercourse, without their consent, by their husbands. This legal position was challenged before the Supreme Court by a NGO named 'Independent Thought' for being unconstitutional by virtue of being arbitrary, discriminatory and devoid of dignity as it would render the same violative of the fundamental rights under Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution of India. The petitioner also contended that such women could not even give informed consent due to lack of maturity.

Interestingly, the judgment as authored by Justice Lokur did not find it viable to declare Exception 2 to Section 375 as being in violation of the fundamental rights under Articles 14, 15 and 21 as the Petitioner had given up this relief during the course of arguments.

Interestingly, both the UPA government in 2013 and the current NDA government chose to oppose the petition by stating that since child marriages were still prevalent in the country it would be difficult to criminalise marital rape of minor wives. The government shied away from disturbing the social order despite the same being a social ill. This gave rise to a peculiar situation where the Government was reluctant to cure an evil which necessitated the Supreme Court's intervention.

The government's ambivalence was rendered even more peculiar as there are specific statutes protecting children below 18 years from sexual offences, but the government failed to amend Section 375 to bring it line with such statutes. Further, by enacting the Prevention of Child Marriages Act, 2006 the Government had already criminalized child marriage where any man above the age of 18 years marrying a minor girl was punishable by rigorous imprisonment. However, such marriages were considered voidable at the choice of either of the parties, but not void at inception. Even this enactment did not bring about an amendment to Section 375.

Child bride Krishna,11, sits during a marriage ceremony at her husband's home in a village near Kota in May, 2016.

Another dichotomy in the IPC, as noted by the Supreme Court, was that a man would be held liable for 'lesser offences' against his minor wife, like causing grievous hurt etc., but could not be held liable for marital rape of minor wife.

Taking note of the above, among various other factors, a bench comprising Justice Madan B. Lokur and Justice Deepak Gupta of the Supreme Court allowed the petition by striking down the exception as being unconstitutional and inconsistent with Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (POCSO). This inconsistency should have been cured at the inception of POCSO in 2012 itself by way of amendment to section 375 but the failure of the legislature forced the Supreme Court to state the obvious.

The SC did refute the stand taken by the government during course of arguments that criminalising marital rape would destroy the institution of marriage.

The court sought to harmoniously interpret special statutes enacted for the protection of the girl child with the provisions of the Indian Penal Code. Such an interpretation was found to be important to preserve and protect the human rights of the girl child. Interestingly, the judgment as authored by Justice Lokur did not find it viable to declare Exception 2 to Section 375 as being in violation of the fundamental rights under Articles 14, 15 and 21 as the Petitioner had given up this relief during the course of arguments. Justice Lokur however harmonised the various child protection laws read down Exception 2 to Section 375 of the IPC to now be meaningfully read as: ""Sexual intercourse or sexual acts by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under eighteen years of age, is not rape.""

Justice Deepak Gupta, on the other hand, while concurring with the judgment authored by Justice Lokur declared that the Exception 2 to Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code was unconstitutional for being arbitrary and discriminatory and thus in violation of Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution.

The Supreme Court refrained from giving any finding or opinion on marital rape of adult wife as the said issue was not in consideration in this case. However, it did refute the stand taken by the government during course of arguments that criminalising marital rape would destroy the institution of marriage. While this view has been taken in context of marital rape of girl child, the Petitioners before the Delhi High Court seeking criminalization of marital rape could use this to their advantage.

This judgment has been declared to be prospective in nature, which means that any prosecution for marital rape of girl child can only be initiated for such rape occurring after the date of the judgment, and no such act alleged to have occurred prior to the judgment can be treated as an offence.

Therefore the law as it stands now is that, notwithstanding consent, sexual intercourse with a minor girl would constitute the offence of rape under Section 375 of the IPC.",What The SC Ruling On Sex With Minor Wives Means For The Child Brides Of India,http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/10/11/what-the-sc-judgement-on-sex-with-minor-wives-means-for-the-child-brides-of-india_a_23239875/

Le président des villes contre les élus des territoires: ce serait donc la nouvelle ritournelle que tente d'installer le parti LR depuis quelques semaines. Regonflés par des sénatoriales mécaniquement favorables et en quête d'une nouvelle virginité en vue d'élections internes, les conservateurs surjouent la carte des enracinés contre les mondialisés. L'image paraît belle à nombre de commentateurs, s'engouffrant dans le simplisme des analyses post-Brexit ou post-Trump qui avaient exacerbé ce clivage. Sauf que cette image confère au fantasme. Tout le monde se rejoint pour constater les inégalités territoriales. Tout le monde perçoit ce décalage croissant entre les métropoles, la ruralité et les territoires intermédiaires, sans oublier l'outremer. Tout le monde constate la fracture numérique, les déserts médicaux, les difficultés de mobilité et d'accès aux services publics. L'exécutif et la majorité sont évidemment conscients de ces réalités. Lors de la campagne, rappelons que notre programme a été construit sur la base d'un diagnostic précis des réalités du pays – la Grande Marche -, qui n'avait pas manqué de mettre en lumière ces difficultés. Accuser le Président de vouloir les accentuer plutôt que les résorber est un non-sens.

Factuellement, regardons la carte électorale du 23 avril dernier: l'homogénéité du vote pour Emmanuel Macron est la plus importante parmi les principaux candidats. Son score est supérieur à 18% dans tous les départements. Il est plus élevé en Creuse qu'à Nice, il est plus élevé dans les Deux-Sèvres ou les Côtes d'Armor qu'à Lille ou Montpellier. Partout le discours progressiste a eu un écho. Passons aux actes.

La Conférence des Territoires lancée le 17 juillet dernier a fait émerger les grands axes de travail. Il y'a d'abord les investissements dédiés aux territoires : la couverture très haut débit fin 2020, le doublement des maisons de santé, les nouvelles pistes d'autonomie pour les collectivités territoriales. Ensuite, le grand plan d'investissement annoncé en septembre fait aussi la part belle aux territoires: 5 milliards pour l'agriculture, 5 milliards pour les transports au quotidien, 15 milliards pour la transition énergétique. Enfin, le tissu économique des territoires ruraux et des villes moyennes étant majoritairement composé d'indépendants, de TPE et de PME, celles-ci ont eu toute l'attention des premières réformes: rénovation du dialogue social, suppression du RSI, baisses de charges, choc de simplification avec l'arrêt de la sur-normalisation et la numérisation des services publics.

Il nous faut repenser les nouvelles relations à instaurer entre l'Etat et les collectivités territoriales mais aussi et surtout entre les collectivités territoriales entre elles. Nous voulons plus d'autonomie et de responsabilisation de celles-ci. Il faut changer la logique actuelle des dotations, trop souvent assimilées à de la perfusion et soumise à son corollaire délétère : le coup de rabot au gré des réductions de dépenses publiques. Il faut plus et mieux contractualiser ces relations, repenser un pacte girondin pérenne et stable au bénéfice de tous. Les économies demandées de 13 milliards d'euros aux collectivités territoriales ne seront pas imposées, elles seront à la main des collectivités en échange de plus grandes libertés: différentiation de la gestion de la fonction publique territoriale, nouveaux transferts de compétence, réflexion sur la recentralisation du financement du RSA... Le suivi de ces contrats sera accompagné d'un système de bonus/malus permettant de récompenser les efforts par un accès facilité aux financements pour investir. Bien entendu, cette nouvelle relation nécessite un dialogue permanent dans le cadre de la Conférence des Territoires pour rasséréner toutes les parties et développer une confiance mutuelle. L'Agence nationale de la cohésion des territoires sera le guichet unique d'accompagnement des territoires et de simplification.

Ces plans d'investissement et ces contrats de confiance sont deux piliers essentiels. Nous pensons qu'un troisième pilier est nécessaire pour que l'édifice ambitieux de l'équité territoriale que nous appelons de nos veux soit pleinement efficient et pérenne, il s'agit d'une nouvelle décentralisation. Le Président le 17 juillet nous en a donné l'objectif: ""Les villes moyennes ont, quant à elles, à inventer un nouveau modèle de croissance hors des métropoles, s'appuyant sur les avantages sectoriels à un niveau qu'elles peuvent établir mais aussi à construire en lien avec d'autres villes moyennes une politique culturelle, économique, éducative différente. Ainsi, elles construiront une attractivité renouvelée."" La première décentralisation a permis de décloisonner le diptyque Paris/Province vers un triptyque Paris/Métropoles/Ruralité. La création des métropoles régionales a permis de tirer la croissance économique des régions tout en accentuant certaines inégalités territoriales. L'erreur serait de penser l'aménagement du territoire uniquement sous l'angle de ce nouveau jacobinisme régional, asséchant les territoires au profit des métropoles. Nous voulons ainsi conjuguer l'unité de la République et la diversité de ces territoires, en droite ligne de l'article 1er de notre constitution : ""La France est une République indivisible, (...). Son organisation est décentralisée."" Le caractère ""indivisible"" ayant trop souvent été vu et vécu comme un devoir d'uniformité souvent contre-productif. C'est bien là le cœur de cette deuxième décentralisation à mener.

Dans cette perspective, nous souhaitons faciliter l'éclosion de ""métropoles diffuses"" associant des communautés territoriales sur des compétences transverses bien spécifiques mettant en évidence tout à la fois leur singularité et leur complémentarité avec les pôles métropolitains voisins. Il ne s'agit pas d'ajouter une couche au millefeuille territorial mais d'une liberté nouvelle de s'associer pour révéler, regrouper et optimiser les forces de nos territoires. Il nous faut admettre que chaque territoire ne pourra pas être bon en tout, partout, tout le temps. Ce n'est pas une faiblesse mais justement une opportunité pour sélectionner les domaines à développer, là où le territoire possède un avantage sectoriel. Il faut développer nos forces là où elles existent, sans se faire concurrence en interne au plan national. Le rôle de coordination de l'Etat via l'Agence de cohésion des territoires est ici important pour fédérer et optimiser toutes les initiatives. Ces associations dans le cadre de métropoles diffuses permettront également de compenser les faiblesses inhérentes aux territoires et d'agir avec équité et discernement plutôt qu'avec uniformité. On en revient ici à l'équité territoriale.

Aujourd'hui le numérique permet cette déconcentration. L'essor du télétravail, de l'économie circulaire et participative, de la télémédecine sont autant d'opportunités et de leviers de croissance pour n'importe quel territoire. L'économie des deux derniers siècles où l'on quittait son village pour aller à la grande ville manufacturer des objets est en profonde mutation. La Silicon Valley nous a montré que la taille des entreprises n'était plus liée à la taille de la ville dans laquelle elles sont. Cupertino ou Palo Alto sont des villages Américains qui ont engendré des multinationales. Les entrepreneurs d'avenir, l'innovation et les start-up sont déjà dans nos territoires intermédiaires, il nous faut créer des écosystèmes pour les aider et les maintenir sur ces territoires.

La droite a beau jeu de s'insurger contre la baisse des dotations (alors qu'elles augmentent dans le budget 2018!) ou des contrats aidés. Leur incohérence confère ici à la malhonnêteté intellectuelle: n'ont-ils pas eu de cesse de pourfendre les contrats aidés lors de leur mise en place? qu'ont-ils fait de 2002 à 2012 contre les inégalités territoriales? N'ont-ils pas soutenu il y'a quelques mois un programme supprimant 500.000 fonctionnaires et 100 milliards de dépenses publiques? Profitant des présidences des associations des maires, départements et régions de France, elle se drape dans des postures et des effets de manche, allant jusqu'à pratiquer la politique de la chaise vide, s'agissant des régions. Le sens des responsabilités est plutôt à chercher du côté de l'Association des Communautés de France qui voit bien le sens de l'intérêt général de ce nouveau pacte girondin de contractualisations. Malheureusement la droite a eu trop longtemps la culture des baronnies locales pour faire sa mutation. Faute d'idées nouvelles, elle ressuscite Maurice Barrès pour se faire le chantre de la France d'hier, du terroir idéalisé. Ne leur en déplaise, hier ne reviendra pas.

Le combat pour plus de justice sociale ne se jouera pas que dans les subtils équilibres à venir concernant notre modèle de protection sociale ou la redistribution de notre fiscalité, il se gagnera également, voire prioritairement dans une amélioration de l'équité territoriale. On ne peut se satisfaire de deux France, de ces deux vitesses, de ces deux électorats. A l'image des USA, où le président Barack Obama, avait atteint moins de 5% de chômage et 2 % de croissance, l'élection de Donald Trump a eu lieu du fait que les campagnes aient voté contre les grandes villes. La réussite du quinquennat et donc de la France passera par une réparation concertée de nos fractures territoriales.

Each year, 45,000 people apply for a place in the university’s hallowed halls, but only around 8,600 are successful.

Now, Oxford has released a set of sample interview questions to ease the minds of thousands of nervous applicants.

Dr Samina Khan, director of admissions and outreach at the university said: “Interviews will be an entirely new experience for most students, and we know many prospective applicants are already worried about being in an unfamiliar place and being questioned by people they have not met – so to help students to become familiar with the type of questions they might get asked we release these real examples.

“We want to underscore that every question asked by our tutors has a purpose, and that purpose is to assess how students think about their subject and respond to new information or unfamiliar ideas.”

Khan added: “No matter what kind of educational background or opportunities you have had, the interview should be an opportunity to present your interest and ability in your chosen subject, since they are not just about reciting what you already know.”

So, would you make the grade?

Subject: Law

Q: Should it be illegal to run a red light in the middle of the night on an empty road?

Exeter College lecturer Jon Herring said: “The ability to think normatively is important to the study of law, so we are interested in what candidates think the law ought to be, but more important is their capacity to justify their position.

“This involves being able analyse concepts, critically appraise arguments and the reasoning behind a position, as well as to consider objections and to offer rebuttals to those objections. There isn’t a right or wrong answer to this question; we would be using the example to see how well the candidate could justify their stance.

“For example, a candidate might say that if no one was harmed by running the light, then it wouldn’t hurt to run it so it shouldn’t be illegal. This would be suggesting that the law is based on preventing harm. We might then explore whether this is the only purpose or the dominant purpose of the law, and how that might shape how legal rules need to be constructed, when exceptions might be valid and how effective exceptions could be created.”

He continued: “Here, we would be looking to see how well they can see the problems with their approach, the difficulties inherent in drafting a rule that works in every situation without being too broad. This line of discussion would draw out their capacity to respond to challenges to their position, their mental flexibility, and their ability to think precisely.

“Another candidate might suggest that even if no one is harmed, it is important that laws are respected and we could examine why this is the case. For example, if running lights was only illegal when it was dangerous, this would leave it to each person’s assessment of ‘dangerous’, so we could never be sure when someone would run a light, leading to chaotic traffic.”

Herring added: “This question also picks up on ideas about what it means for something to be illegal and citizens’ relationship with the law, whether it can ever be justified to break the law and what might be a sufficient justification. This could lead into more philosophical discussions of what it means for a law to be binding and how legal rules might differ from moral rules or guidelines.

“A candidate might begin to consider whether there is something special about ‘law’, and we could use this as a way into exploring with them whether the fact that something is illegal is itself a reason not to do something, over and above, perhaps, the harm the rule is aiming to prevent. Candidates might then think about how law makes other people’s behaviour more predictable so that we can plan our own actions, or how the law might serve functions like punishing wrongdoing.

“An example might be that because the law makes murder illegal and those who kill are punished, I can expect that I can leave my house and generally not expect to be killed, so this allows me to decide it’s safe to go outside.”

Subject: Philosophy (Philosophy, Politics and Economics)

Q: ‘I agree that air transport contributes to harmful climate change. But whether or not I make a given plane journey, the plane will fly anyway. So there is no moral reason for me to not travel by plane.’ Is this a convincing argument?

Interviewer Cecile Fabre of Lincoln College said: “The interview is not meant to test candidates’ knowledge of Philosophy, since more often than not, they have not studied this subject before. Moreover, we are not trying to get them to guess or arrive at ‘the right answer’.

“Rather, the interview is about candidates’ ability to think critically, to deal with counter-examples to the views they put forward, and to draw distinctions between important concepts.”

She continued: “This answer raises the difficult question of individuals’ responsibility, as individuals, for harmful collective actions. Some candidates might be inclined to dispute the premise that air transport contributes to climate change: that’s fine, but we would then ask them to accept that premise for the sake of argument. Whether they are able to do that is in itself an important test, since much of philosophical thinking proceeds in this way.

“Some candidates might say that the argument is a good one: given that what I do makes no difference, I have no moral reason not to do it. At this point, I would want to know what they consider a moral reason to be (as distinct from or similar to, for example, a practical or prudential reason).”

Fabre added: “I would also push them to think about other cases: for example, the bombing of Dresden (one jet fighter less makes no difference to the collective outcome – so why not go and fight); or voting (why should I vote in a general election, given that my vote makes no difference)?

“Are the cases the same? Are they different? If so, are the differences or similarities relevant? That is to say, do those differences and similarities help us think about the original case? Do they help us to work out a view about individual responsibility in those cases?

“For example, in the Dresden case, the individual jet fighters act together as part of an organisation – the air force – whose aim is to bomb Dresden. But we cannot say of companies such as British Airways that they aim to cause climate change. And the air passengers cannot really be described as acting together. Does this make a difference?”

Subject: Medicine

Q: Put these countries in order by their crude mortality (deaths per thousand of the population): Bangladesh, Japan, South Africa, the UK.

Exeter College interviewer Andrew King, said: “Interviews for Medicine aim to gauge candidates’ understanding of the science underpinning the study of medicine, as well as skills in scientific enquiry. This question invites candidates to think about a public health question and epidemiology that can be approached in many different ways, without necessarily knowing anything about specific mortality rates around the world.

“We would expect the initial discussion to probe the differing causes of death that contribute to mortality rates – such as those ‘Western diseases’ heart disease and cancer – and how they compare to those found in developing countries (high infant mortality, infectious diseases, poor nutrition, high rates of HIV etc.).”

He continued: “The majority of candidates will expect Bangladesh or South Africa to have the highest crude mortality rate, and will be surprised to find that it is in fact Japan.

“The other part of the mortality rate calculation is of course the age of the population: we would ideally steer the conversation towards a discussion of why a wealthy but older country like Japan might have a higher mortality rate, while a country like Bangladesh – which many people might initially expect to have a high mortality rate due to relative poverty as a country – actually has a relatively lower mortality rate because of its young population.

“Similarly, Britain actually has the second-highest mortality rate because of the age structure of its population: we are a relatively old country and a majority of deaths occur in older people. We wouldn’t expect students to get the right answer on their own, and in fact that’s not the point: the point is to see how they apply their understanding of social and cultural factors in health and illness to a problem of epidemiology.

“Some students might already have a detailed knowledge of demography, others might need to be given more relevant information – the point isn’t what they know, it’s what questions they ask to make their conclusions, and how they interpret information to draw those conclusions. We might then go on to discuss how you could make a valid comparison between mortality rates in different countries.”

Subject: Modern Languages (French)

Q: What do we lose if we only read a foreign work of literature in translation?

Interviewer Jane Hiddleston, of Exeter College, said: “This is a good question as it helps us to see how candidates think about both languages and literature.

“They might be able to tell us about the challenges of translation, about what sorts of things resist literal or straightforward translation from one language to another, and this would give us an indication of how aware they are of how languages work.”

She continued: “They might also tell us about literary language, and why literary texts in particular use language in ways that make translation problematic. This might lead to a discussion of what is distinct about literary works, and this helps us to see what kind of reader they are more broadly.

“We don’t do this with the expectation that they have already read any particular works, however, but in order to get a sense of why they think it is worth studying literatures in foreign languages.”

Hiddleston added: “This is an important issue, given that Modern Languages students at Oxford read a lot of literature in the language as part of their course.",Oxford University Sample Interview Questions: Would You Make The Cut At Britain's Top Uni?,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2017/10/12/oxford-university-sample-interview_n_18246648.html?utm_hp_ref=uk&amp;ir=UK

'Married in a Flash'

On this show, couples who are in a long-term relationship or engaged are given R75,000 to plan and execute their wedding. The catch is they only have three days in which to plan their special day.

The cameras follow them from the day on which they are given the money. Viewers can watch the couples planning what they can and can't afford, what they can achieve in three days and drawing up the guest list: who makes it and who gets chopped. The couples are followed as they delegate from their to-do list and put together the final touches for the big day. The wedding day is also televised.

The first episode featured Sheila and Mark, who met on a dating app and fell in love at first swipe. Mark has been insisting on getting married in court, but Sheila wanted her dream wedding, ""Married In a Flash"" came through to make their dream come true.

If the reactions are anything to go by, the show, which is the brainchild of Connect TV, made its mark.

'The Wedding Bashers'

This show is an M-Net original co-produced by Gavin Wratten and Proverb, real name Tebogo Thekisho.

The show features 22 weddings over 12 episodes and has an all-star celebrity team of experts, the Bash(ers), who attend and secretly rate the weddings each week.

Celebrity chef Siba Mtongana is the food police. Media personality Denise Zimba judges the entertainment value of each wedding. Former Miss South Africa and businesswoman Cindy Nell is all about the fashion. And celebrity wedding planner Zavion Kotze checks out the decor.

The personalities rate each wedding and the scores are announced during the show. In addition, each of the Bash(ers) gives an overall experience score, which goes into the ultimate wedding gift. This will only be unwrapped at the end of the season to reveal the winner. The overall experience scores trump all other scores.

The couple whose wedding has the highest overall experience score wins the wedding of the season title and walks away with prizes worth more than R800,000, including a seven-night honeymoon in the Seychelles and jewellery to the value of more than R100,000.

'Our Perfect Wedding'

Also the brainchild of Connect TV, the show is popularly known among its fans as ""OPW"".

It is the longest-standing of all the shows with more than six seasons.

""OPW"" follows Mzansi couples in the days leading up to their wedding. Couples give the viewer a front-row seat to their perfect wedding -- all the tears, laughter, anxiety and love is captured as the big day draws near. They attempt to tick off every item on their wish list and have their perfect wedding.

'Married at First Sight'

Two strangers paired by experts meet each other for the first time at the altar. After a few weeks, which include a honeymoon and advice from financial experts, psychologists and relationship experts, they must decide whether they want to stay together or not.

You'd think the show would have a zero success rate, but some couples who were on the American version of the show are still together and having babies.

FOOTBALL - Le match Amiens-Bordeaux du 21 octobre a été délocalisé au Havre, ont annoncé ce jeudi 12 octobre la Ligue de Football Professionnel (LFP) et le club de Bordeaux, conséquence de l'accident ayant fait 29 blessés au stade amiénois de la Licorne le 30 septembre dernier.

La commission des compétitions de la Ligue de football professionnel (LFP) a invoqué les ""graves incidents survenus"" lors du match Amiens-Lille, pour justifier la délocalisation de ce match comptant pour la 10e journée de L1.

Le préfet de la Somme, le président du club d'Amiens et celui d'Amiens Métropole doivent tenir une conférence de presse à 14h ce jeudi en préfecture pour évoquer cette décision.

L'effondrement d'une barrière contre laquelle s'étaient pressés les supporters lillois à la 16e minute pour fêter le but de leur équipe avait fait 29 blessés.

Elle a conduit également à l'ouverture d'une enquête judiciaire par le parquet d'Amiens. Ses conclusions, qui s'appuieront notamment sur les travaux d'un expert en métallurgie, n'étaient pas encore connues jeudi matin. La commission de discipline de la Ligue de football professionnel a aussi ouvert une ""instruction"" le 5 octobre.

La polémique avait pris d'autant plus d'ampleur que le stade de la Licorne est en travaux pour rénovation de sa verrière et des sièges pour toute la saison, après sa montée historique. Mais le préfet de la Somme ""nous a confirmé qu'il n'y a aucun rapport entre les travaux menés actuellement dans le stade et l'effondrement de la barrière"", avait souligné le directeur général de la LFP Didier Quillot, au lendemain de l'incident.

Le stade Océane est l'antre du club du Havre AC, formation de Ligue 2. Inaugurée en 2012, l'enceinte compte plus de 25.000 places.

""We pulled the wedding together for $1000 and it was the most magical night ever.""

Since the tragic diagnosis, a GoFundMe page has been set up for the family, who have had to take time off work in order to spend time with their daughter.

France Télévisions a décidé d'organiser un grand concours de chant nommé ""Destination Eurovision"" pour trouver le représentant parfait et lui assurer l'appui des téléspectateurs. Ce mercredi 11 octobre, on apprend que c'est Garou qui présentera ce télé-crochet.

""Cela nous a paru évident de confier la présentation à Garou qui est un artiste exceptionnel qui est à la fois un interprète, un compositeur, un homme de scène et qui a suffisamment d'empathie pour accompagner les talents"", a expliqué France Télévisions à la presse ce mercredi. Le Québécois, ancien coach de ""The Voice"" sur TF1, connaît déjà la maison. Il a notamment collaboré avec le groupe pour la Fête de la musique ou le Téléthon.

""Je suis d'une neutralité totale. J'adore être touché par une chanson et j'ai des goûts très éclectiques"" a fait savoir l'interprète. Garou promet également qu'il n'influencera pas le public. ""L'intérêt de leur laisser la parole permet d'avoir un candidat qui met tout le monde d'accord. L'exemple de Salvador Sobral, vainqueur l'an dernier, montre que les professionnels et les téléspectateurs n'ont pas forcément les mêmes attentes.""

Sur les 10 derniers vainqueurs de l'Eurovision, 7 étaient issus d'une sélection par le public. ""Certains pays fonctionnent déjà de cette manière, comme la Suède par exemple, qui est l'une des références de cette compétition"", explique la chaîne.

Un représentant et une chanson inédite

Le but de ce grand concours de chant est donc de trouver le candidat de la prochaine édition de l'Eurovision dont la finale se tient le 12 mai prochain à Lisbonne au Portugal. Mais ""Destination Eurovision"" se met aussi à la recherche de la chanson parfaite, sans aucune barrière de style.

Ce titre devra être inédit, en langue française à 70%, a déjà précisé France Télévisions

Il est d'ores et déjà possible de candidater sur le site francetv.fr, et ce jusqu'à fin novembre. Une présélection aura également lieu dans les maisons de disque, chez les producteurs indépendants,... France Télévisions cherche des compositeurs/interprètes ou simplement des interprètes. La production ne ferme pas la porte à un groupe, avec la possibilité de se produire avec six membres maximum.

Au final, c'est une quinzaine de candidats, chacun avec une chanson originale et inédite, qui se présentera devant les jurés de l'émission. On sait déjà qu'il y aura un jury français (composé de chanteurs, compositeurs et interprètes) mais aussi un jury international (avec des représentants des délégations du concours Eurovision). Le vote du public suivra.

En 2013, France Télévisions avait déjà tenté de faire voter les téléspectateurs. Le dispositif avait abouti sur la sélection du duo Twin Twin, arrivé dernier de l'Eurovision 2014... Mais cette fois-ci, France Télévisions ne compte pas faire les choses à moitié et voit dans ce ""feuilleton"" autour de l'Eurovision une bonne façon de doper les audiences du programme européen. L'an dernier, plus de 5 millions de personnes avaient suivi la compétition qui se déroulait en Ukraine.

2000년 대선 전날 밤, 하비 웨인스타인은 언론인에게 헤드록을 걸었다.

뉴욕 옵저버 기자 앤드류 골드먼은 트라이베카 그랜드 호텔에서 웨인스타인에게 다가갔다. 웨인스타인이 골드먼의 동료이자 당시 연인이었던 레베카 트레이스터에게 욕을 퍼부었기 떄문이었다. MTV VJ였던 캐런 더피가 중추 신경계 관련 질병에 걸렸다가 회복된 이야기를 담은 책 ‘Model Patient: My Life as an Incurable Wise-Ass’의 출간 파티장이었다. 트레이스터에 의하면 웨인스타인이 주최한 파티였고, 트레이스터는 무모하게도 미라맥스가 보류한 영화에 대한 질문을 했다.

웨인스타인은 그 질문이 마음에 들지 않았다. “나를 쌍년(cunt)라고 부르고 자기가 ‘이 빌어먹을 무법 도시의 보안관’인 게 다행이라고 말했다.”고 트레이스터는 뉴욕 지의 더 컷에 썼다. 이때 골드먼이 끼어들자, 하비 웨인스타인은 그에게 헤드록을 걸었다.

다른 매체 기자들도 있는 공개석상에서 일어난 일이었다고 골드먼은 허프포스트에 말했다. 하지만 트레이스터가 거의 17년이 지난 다음에 글을 쓰기 전까지, 뉴욕타임스가 수십 년에 걸친 웨인스타인의 성적 불법 행위를 다루기 전까지 우린 그 사실을 몰랐다. 타임스 기사 이후 엔터테인먼트 업계에서는 헐리우드의 ‘다 아는 비밀’이 왜 이제서야 공개되었는지 묻는 목소리가 일었다. 그에 대한 대답은 비유적으로, 또한 문자 그대로, 웨인스타인이 미디어에 헤드록을 걸고 있어서였다.

그들은 언론인들을 돈으로 사고, 위협하고, 자기들에게 필요한 일이라면 뭐든 한다.

웨인스타인이 썼다는 방법들은 다양했다. “하비는 무엇이든 뒤바꾸거나 억누를 수 있었다. 그의 돈을 받는 언론인들이 정말 많았다. 영화 프로젝트의 컨설턴트로 일하거나, 시나리오를 쓰거나, 그의 잡지에서 일하는 사람들이었다.” 트레이스터가 쓴 글이다.

“그들은 언론인들을 돈으로 사고, 위협하고, 자기들에게 필요한 일이라면 뭐든 한다.” 베테랑 연예 기자가 웨인스타인의 팀에 대해 허프포스트에 한 말이다. 웨인스타인 측은 가차없이 여러 수단을 동원한다. 이 기자는 자신의 매체는 웨인스타인이 수사를 방해할까 봐 웨인스타인에 대한 기사를 준비하는 기자들의 이름을 숨겼다고 말했다.

언론계에서는 앞으로 호의적인 기사를 써주는 대가로 수익성 좋은 책 출판 계약을 해주는 등의 돈이 오갔다는 이야기가 몰래 오갔다. 때로는 노골적으로 드러나는 경우도 있었다. 웨인스타인은 어느 파티에서 페이지 식스 기자에게 “시나리오 어디 있어?”라고 외친 적이 있다고 한다.

웨인스타인은 커리어를 띄워줄 수 있는 것 만큼 망칠 수도 있었다. 뉴욕 사교계에서 아주 막강한 인물이 되어, 연예 기자들을 자기가 여는 파티와 시사회에 못 오게 할 수 있었을 뿐 아니라 다른 주요 행사에도 오지 못하게 할 수 있었다고 헐리우드에 정통한 한 인물은 말했다.

웨인스타인은 여러 방면에서 미디어에 압박을 가할 수 있었다. 2004년에 샤론 왁스먼이 뉴욕 타임스에 웨인스타인의 나쁜 행실에 대한 기사를 쓰고 있을 때, 맷 데이먼과 러셀 크로우는 왁스먼에게 전화를 걸어 말렸다. 왁스먼에 의하면 나중에 에디터들이 그 기사를 잘라냈다고 한다.

프로듀서 스콧 루딘은 셀러브리티 언론인 니키 핑크에게 웨인스타인 측에서 자신에게 ‘하비를 보호하고 페이지 식스에 거짓말을 해달라’고 부탁했다고 인정한 적이 있다. 핑크 자신도 웨인스타인이 그녀를 ‘창문이 없는 방’에서 90분 동안 개인적인 모욕을 퍼부었다고 말했다.

웨인스타인의 변호사, 에이전트, 기업은 언급 요청에 대답하지 않았다.

작년에 벤저민 월러스는 뉴욕 지의 요청으로 웨인스타인을 둘러싼 혐의들을 수사하기 시작했다. 월러스는 본격적으로 전화를 돌리기 시작하자 곧 웨인스타인의 강력한 변호사와 홍보 담당자들이 대거 몰려들어, 뉴욕 지에게 물러나라고 압박했다고 한다. 그중에는 막강한 변호사 데이비드 보이스도 있었다.

월러스는 자신과 에디터들이 웨인스타인의 압박에 무릎꿇었다는 지난 주말의 뉴욕 포스트 기사를 반박했다. 월러스는 자신의 보도는 사실 반발에 거의 영향받지 않았다고 한다. 그는 3개월 동안 수사한 끝에 폭로 기사를 쓸 만한 내용을 많이 모으지 못해 미뤄두었다고 한다.

“나는 그 기사를 내려고 애썼다.” 뉴욕 지의 아담 모스 편집장은 “취재를 든든하게 지원해 주었고, 하비 웨인스타인이 기사를 막지도 않았다. 기사가 나왔다면 우리는 신이 났을 것이다.”고 월러스는 말한다.

뉴욕 지는 90년대에도 웨인스타인의 범죄 혐의를 조사한 적이 있었다. 그러나 웨인스타인이 방해했다. “가차없이 압력을 넣었다. 개인적으로 전화가 걸려오고, 변호사들이 쉴새없이 고소하겠다고 위협했다.” 당시 뉴욕 지 에디터였던 TV 프로듀서 마이클 허숀의 말이다. “그리고 다른 식으로 접근할 수도 있다고 말해왔다. 당시는 그런 게 중요했던 때였다.”

허숀은 페이스북 포스트에서 90년대의 조사와 자신이 잘 아는 다른 건에 대해 자세히 밝혔다. “웨인스타인과 일급 변호사들이 매체와 관련된 여성들에게 엄청난 압박을 넣어서 두 조사 모두 가장 문제적인 이야기들을 보도하지 않기로 했다. 웨인스타인은 매체사 사장들에게도 당근과 채찍 전략을 취했다. 결국 관련 여성들은 무릎을 꿇었고, 사장들은 우리 조사를 끝내게 했다. 혹은 변호사들이 위험 대비 보상을 고려해보고 보도하지 말 것을 권하기도 했다.”

베테랑 연예 기자에 의하면 모든 규모의 기사에 대해 이런 식으로 접근했다고 한다. 웨인스타인 측은 나중에 특종을 주겠다며 웨인스타인에 대한 아주 작은 기사도 다 막으려 했다고 한다.

그 결과 전반적으로 부드러운 톤의 기사가 나가게 되었다. 예를 들어 웨인스타인이 트레이스터와 골드먼에게 폭력을 휘두른 것은 지나치게 밀어붙이는 언론인과 성자 같은 영화계 거물 사이의 유감스러운 몸싸움 정도로 미화되었다. 그러나 트레이스터와 골드먼의 이야기를 들어보면 사실은 전혀 달랐다.

골드먼이 허프포스트에 전한 바에 의하면 논쟁 중에 웨인스타인은 “누가 이 쌍년을 이 암 파티에 들여보냈어?”라고 여러 번 외쳤다고 한다. 그는 골드먼이 녹음기를 들고 있는 걸 알아차리기 전까지 골드먼에게도 욕설을 퍼부었다고 한다.

“몇 마디를 주고받았다.그러다 그는 내 녹음기에 달려들었다. 나는 녹음기를 뺏기고 싶지 않았기 때문에, 우리는 트라이베카 그랜드 한복판에서 양손을 공중에 치켜든 채 서로 막 잡아당겼다.”

녹음기를 뺏지 못한 웨인스타인은 골드먼을 호텔 앞으로 끌고나가 헤드록을 걸었다고 골드먼은 말한다. “이 사람이 내게 이런 짓을 하다니, 공개적으로 이런 일이 일어나다니 믿을 수 없다고 생각했던 기억이 난다.”

골드먼은 뉴욕 데일리 뉴스 사진사가 사진을 찍은 게 기억난다고 했다. “수십 장, 어쩌면 수백 장 찍었을지도 모른다.” 주위에는 다른 기자들도 몇 명 있었는데, 한 명은 “하비, 이러지 말아요! 이러면 안돼요!”라고 말했다고 골드먼은 회상한다. 결국 골드먼과 트레이스터는 그 자리를 떴다.

골드먼은 “젠장, 내일 데일리 뉴스 표지에 나오겠군.”이라고 생각했다고 한다. “끝내주는 뉴욕 타블로이드 기사감이었다. ‘영화계 거물이 멋진 파티에서 멍청한 기자에게 헤드록을 걸다’”

그런데 이상한 일이 벌어졌다. “다음 날 아침에 보니 신문에 전혀 실리지 않았다. 내가 아는 한 그 사진들은 아무도 보지 못했다.”

그러나 곧 뉴욕 포스트에 있는 골드먼의 지인에게서 전화가 걸려왔다. “하비가 파티에서 당신이 누군가를 공격했다는 이야기를 퍼뜨리고 있다”는 말을 “믿을 만한 사람”에게서 들었다는 내용이었다. 몸싸움 중에 한 여성이 다쳤다. 골드먼은 당시에는 그 사실을 몰랐다고 허프포스트에 말했다.

뉴욕 포스트는 골드먼과 트레이스터가 웨인스타인을 ‘한계점까지 밀어붙인 기자들’이라고 낙인찍었다. 또한 웨인스타인과 더피의 우정을 다루며, 더피가 병으로 고생할 때 웨인스타인이 ‘그녀의 생명을 구했다’며 성인처럼 묘사했다.

웨인스타인은 더프[sic]를 적절한 의사들에게 데려다주고 즉시 치료받게 해주어 생명을 구해준 다음 금세 친해졌다.

뉴욕 타임스 역시 골드먼을 에둘러 비난했다. 이름이 등장하지 않은 ‘미라맥스 관계자’는 골드먼 혼자 폭력을 휘두른 것처럼 말했고, 웨인스타인과 트레이스터는 “그가 인터뷰를 계속할 수 없다고 합의했고, 그건 괜찮았다. 그러나 앤드류가 끼어들었다.”고 했다.

골드먼의 상사인 옵저버의 에디터 피터 W. 카플란은 타임스에 골드먼을 옹호하는 성명을 전달했다. “앤드류는 책임감있게 프로답게 행동했고, 동료를 위해 나선 것이었다.” 그러나 이 성명은 끝에서 두 번째 문단에서야 등장했다. “골드먼 씨의 녹음기가 다른 손님의 머리에 세게 부딪혔고”, 골드먼이 웨인스타인의 요구에도 불구하고 사과하기를 “거부했다”는 무명의 미라맥스 관계자의 말이 그보다 먼저 나왔다. 포스트와 타임스는 이 기사들에 대한 언급 요청에 응답하지 않았다.

골드먼은 미디어 보도를 보고 충격을 받았다.

“그들은 내가 파티에서 여성에게 다가가 녹음기로 여성의 머리를 때린 것처럼 보이게 하려 했다. 하비와 내가 나의 녹음기를 두고 싸우고 있었다는 사실은 언급하지 않았다.”

골드먼은 이 사건으로 정신을 번쩍 차리게 되었다. 웨인스타인이 정확히 어떻게 했는지는 모르지만, 자신의 영향력을 발휘해 기사를 자기 구미에 맞게 바꾸고 사진이 보도되지 않게 했음을 골드먼은 직감적으로 알 수 있었다.

“누군가 완벽한 뉴욕 타블로이드 기사감을 완전히 없앨 수 있다는 건 나로선 놀라웠다.”

“그의 솜씨가 대단했다는 건 인정해야겠다.”

Thankfully this doesn't have to be the case.

If you're up to making your own pizza at home, you need a few professional tips. To help us out, HuffPost Australia spoke to Alex Pisani, owner of GOODPIZZA in Sydney.

1. Get the base right

We all know how important a good pizza base is for the overall pizza experience. There are tonnes of great pizza base recipes, but there's nothing wrong with buying fresh ready-made bases from delis, markets and grocers to use as your base.

2. Take inspiration from your favourite cuisines

While traditional pizza toppings are always a winner, get inspired by your favourite cuisines, flavours and dishes, and get creative about incorporating those flavours.

""Pizza toppings have changed in that people are experimenting with different cuisines and trying out some fusion elements borrowed from Asian, South American and Middle Eastern cuisine,"" Pisani told HuffPost Australia.

""Draw inspiration from existing dishes and adapt them to a pizza. If it works well on a sandwich or a dessert, there's a strong chance it will translate to a pizza with a few tweaks.

""The same goes for any classic flavour combinations like pork and apple. Why not try a roast pork pizza with stewed apples and shaved Parmesan?""

3. Try different cheese combos

Mozzarella is usually our go-to when it comes to homemade pizza, but Pisani recommends playing around with different cheeses and cheese combos.

""You could also start with different cheeses and think of things that typically pair with those cheeses. If it's a cheese that doesn't cook well, consider adding it on fresh afterwards,"" Pisani said.

Try crumbling soft cheese on top of your cooked pizza when serving.

4. Don't overload your pizza

Although it's tempting to pile on lots of delicious toppings, this can result in a soggy pizza. Instead, be choosy over your ingredients and keep it minimal.

""Don't overdo it. I like to avoid any 'filler' toppings -- every topping should have a purpose, be it flavour, aroma or texture,"" Pisani said.

""Before adding something ask yourself what its purpose is. Pizza tends to cook a lot better when the toppings aren't piled on.""

5. Play around with different pizza sauces

""Purists will hate me for this one, but don't always start with a tomato sauce base and cheese as a default,"" Pisani said. ""A pizza base is like a blank canvas -- you can use just olive oil as a base, or any sauce you can think of.

""Cheese is amazing on pizza but not always essential. Our confit pizza uses confit garlic and fennel, sliced kipfler potatoes and sea salt with fresh fennel tops. It's bursting with flavour and has zero cheese.

6. Keep some things raw

""Not everything needs to be cooked,"" Pisani said. ""Many pizza toppings like roquette, Parmesan cheese and various other vegetables and dairy work just as well being placed on the pizza after it's cooked.""

Need some ideas? Try these six delicious pizza toppings.

""Try zalzett (Maltese sausage) or any non-traditional cured meat, rather than plain pork sausage. The world is full of amazing smoked and cured meats from different cuisines,"" Pisani said.

""Choose confit garlic rather than plain crushed garlic. It takes patience to confit the garlic so typically it will need to be prepared beforehand, but it's easy and is well worth it. The flavour is enhanced immensely, it is easier to spread and won't give you the dreaded garlic breath if you were to use fresh crushed garlic.""

If you love onion on pizza, try caramelising onion instead of sticking with plain brown onion.

""This is another topping that takes a bit of time but is well worth it. Caramelised onion isn't the newest trick in the book, but it's seldom used on pizza. It really brings out the sweetness, has a lovely soft texture and adds a whole new flavour dimension to any pizza. It's great for vegetarian pizzas,"" Pisani said.

""Basil pesto is common in Italian cuisine and common on pizza. To add a zest of flavour, try making some salsa verde instead. The freshness of parsley and lemon juice bring a great hit of acidity to any pizza and works great with anything spicy or with seafood.""

For dessert pizza lovers, aside from the standard Nutella pizza, Pisani suggests using chocolate ganache for extra richness and creaminess.

""Ganache is a great alternative that is quick and easy to knock together, and it's a great foundation for any decadent dessert pizza. Just heat it up and it will spread easily,"" Pisani said.

""Apple raspberry crumble pizza is also delicious. This one takes a bit of beforehand prep also. We stew the apples and make the crumble mix, place the stewed apples and fresh raspberries on a pizza and cook it half way, then sprinkle the crumble mix over the pizza and put it back in the oven to finish it.""",How To Make Better Homemade Pizza,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/10/11/how-to-make-better-homemade-pizza_a_23239308/

And at this particular gathering they also stood as a stark representation of the number of New Zealanders who took their own lives between 2016 and 2017.

Around 70 people were in attendance to witness the event -- a silent, solemn crowd paying homage to the suicide crisis crippling their country.

Among the people in attendance, the bagpiper was also someone who has had a child take their own life.

New Zealand's suicide rate has reached a new peak at 606 per year, according to the latest statistics. That puts New Zealand alongside Australia, taking into account the population difference, with a near identical suicide problem (3,027 Australians take their own lives each year).

New Zealand and Australia are above average on suicide rates for OECD countries; Spain, the UK and Canada are well behind while NZ and Australia rank comparably to the United States, Iceland and Switzerland.

For Dave Macpherson, Memorial Park serves as a sombre reminder of the worst day of his life. His son's body was pulled from the river alongside this park in March 2015.

Nicholas Stevens took his own life after multiple stints in an inpatient mental health care centre. He was 21 years old. In among the lines of shoes, Stevens' name could be found etched on a plaque placed on a park bench and dedicated to him with his photo.

Macpherson, a Hamilton City councillor and member of the Waikato District Health Board, told HuffPost Australia the emotional gathering was a reminder of how widespread the issue of suicide is, both in Hamilton and around New Zealand.

""It's a big debate nationwide -- the last two to three years it's become bigger and bigger. Everyday there are stories either about particular cases or the statistics. It's that people have recognised that it's a hell of a problem,"" he said.

""[The shoes were] incredibly effective. We've had photos of these shoes laid out in the far north and far south of the country, in the main street of Auckland, on a bridge in another city, on the beach today in an ocean-side city. It's an icon that tells a story without needing any words.

""The people [in Hamilton] were coming for family or friends and we didn't know them but they all came rushing from down the hill with a pair of shoes for their family members. It was more emotional than I thought it would be.""

The gathering was part of a national roadshow known as The Shoe Project. It's an initiative of the New Zealand healthcare coalition YesWeCare.nz to highlight the devastating effects of suicide around the country.

The Shoe Project was designed to bring awareness to the fact that suicide can affect anyone, from any walk of life.

New Zealand has a population of almost 4.7 million and the 606 Kiwis who took their lives in 2016-17 show that the problem isn't getting any better. This most recent national suicide rate in New Zealand marks the third consecutive year the figure has risen, as well as the highest number for the country since the start of statistics began being recorded.

Campaign organiser Simon Oosterman said the tour of the shoes, mirroring the Maori idea of a hikoi (or protest march across the country), was planned to jump from city to city, ultimately leading to Parliament House in Wellington for International Suicide Prevention Day on September 10.

From place to place, the idea was to show Kiwi lawmakers that suicide has become an issue of national importance just as big as Maori land rights, as has been the theme of famous hikois in the past. It has now become the silent, indiscriminate killer that snakes from one New Zealand island to the other, affecting millions from all walks of life, in no particular order.

As part of the response formed by the tour group, letters addressed to the New Zealand government were written by mothers who had lost children to suicide.

The messages demanded politicians ""have the courage to put aside politics and do what's right"" by introducing a national suicide reduction target, implementing an independent inquiry into the country's mental health sector and focusing on adequate hospital staffing and services.

The hikoi was focussed on the individuals and families affected by suicide across New Zealand.

""People talk about numbers -- using shoes and leaving them empty really shows loss and it really shows visually what's happening. People say, 'Gee, is it really that much?' It gives it more meaning,"" Oosterman told HuffPost Australia.

""You need some way that they can easily participate, and everyone's got a pair of shoes and we've got people who might not have lost someone but still wants to contribute a pair of shoes.

""We've also got people who have lost someone and want to participate but don't want to come to the events because it's too raw, so they donate a pair of shoes, so those families still feel like they're a part of it.""

The problem doesn't stop with New Zealand. Suicide is now a major problem in countries around the world.

And as the roadshow progressed, and the team behind The Shoe Project came to further realise the extent of the problem, Oosterman said it was the heartbreaking, yet sometimes empowering, stories of the people he met at each local event that revealed the gravity of allowing them to talk about their circumstances.

From a mother who hadn't talked about the loss of her child for 25 years but felt supported enough to do so at one of the gatherings, to a 24-year-old from Invercargill who had lost 12 friends to suicide, and another teenager who had attempted taking his own life the night before coming to one of the events, the campaign was offering New Zealanders the opportunity to be part of a solution.

""[The teenager] stayed the whole day with us and brought his friends and he felt like he was a part of something, it wasn't a negative thing for him, it was like he a was part of the solution,"" Oosterman said.

""It was a really touching moment. I think we may have saved a life there.

""If you don't talk about suicide, that means we're leaving bereaved families at home, on their own, in pain, without sharing it.""

Suicide isn't just felt by families from around New Zealand and Kiwis aren't the only people putting their shoes out to send a message. The issue is plaguing countries around the world and there are people from multiple continents who have realised the power of speaking up.

Last year the Movember Foundation, a charity organisation that looks at addressing the biggest health issues faced by men, also arranged empty pairs of shoes in cities around the world as a marker of the devastating effects of suicide on men.

Craig Martin, the Movember Foundation's global director of mental health and suicide prevention, told HuffPost Australia the events were organised on November 1 in Australia, the Republic of Ireland, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States to symbolise the extent of loss of human life.

From the sunrise-lit, sandy shores of Sydney's Bondi Beach to the paths lining the River Thames under London's iconic Tower Bridge and to the picturesque serenity of New York's Central Park -- an army of shoes, representing the silent, lost lives of millions, show exactly how severe the impact of suicide has become.

191 pairs of shoes on Sydney's Bondi Beach represented the number of Australian men who take their lives within a month.

""Suicide is a massive issue, it's one of our key cause areas that were really passionate about and that we've invested a lot into,"" Martin said.

""When you're talking about suicide statistics, they just become numbers. The sad reality is that you know the devastating effect suicide has on a family and a community and, while it's really easy to talk about numbers, you lose that reality when you do.

""Laying out shoes symbolises a human life -- this was a man who existed in the world and meant a whole lot to different people and now they're gone.""

And in the United States? 1,620 pairs of shoes were lined up in multiple locations across the country.

And just like The Shoe Project in New Zealand, Martin also said connecting the empty shoes to the identity of a person was a way for the Movember Foundation to send a strong message and start a crucial conversation.

""It's the leading cause of death for young men between the ages of 15-29... [but] statistics can sometimes be so cold,"" he said.

""The [shoe] concept resonated with people and since then people have gone on to replicate that. I think because of that -- it's powerful imagery, it's emotive -- people get more of a sense that these are not just numbers, these are people's lives. Separately to that, people say 'Wow, that's a lot of people'. The response we got was really encouraging.

""There's been quite a narrative about, we need to be asking people and men, are they okay? It's trying to get people around to check in and say, 'How are you really going?' and then go through a process of ask, listen, encourage action and check in, it's a four-step process.""

Another 247 pairs were organised for London's Pottersfield Park in the United Kingdom.

That might seem like an easy process on paper -- but Martin also acknowledged that people around the world still struggle with the assumed implications of having conversations about suicide.

""People want to be there but they often get concerned that maybe they won't be able to deal with it,"" he said.

""There's sometimes a false belief that if you ask someone if they're thinking of killing themselves that they'll go off and do it and we know from research that that just isn't the case.

""It's about helping people to feel confident to have a conversation.""

Shoes were also set up in New York's Central Park, as well as 91 pairs in Stockholm, Sweden, 375 in Dublin, Ireland and 136 across Canada.

As Dave Macpherson stands still behind the Waikato River, the sound of 'Amazing Grace' washing over him and his eyes jumping from one pair of shoes to another, he finds clarity in his pursuit of an answer: the key to addressing suicide is talking about it.

There needs to be a culture change around the way mental health is spoken about and treated for any effective progress to be made.

""The first thing, we've got to start people talking about it and the problems they're having. It's a big issue here, including the families in treatment and support planning,"" Macpherson told HuffPost Australia.

""There are some things that are heading in the right direction but there's a whole culture change that needs to happen.

""We've had nurses in the mental health sector going onto our son's Facebook page and saying to us, 'You guys should forget about it, it happened two years ago get over it'. That's the attitude of the people who say they're caring for the patients, that's the cultural problem we're up against still.""

Barnier told reporters in Brussels on Thursday that on the issue of the financial settlement, there have “been no negotiations on this subject”.

“On this question we have reached a state of deadlock which is very disturbing for thousands of project promoters in Europe and it’s disturbing also for taxpayers,” he added.

Barnier told a news conference that negotiators “worked in a constructive spirit” and clarified points, but were unable to make “any great steps forward”.

He added: “There is a new momentum and I remain convinced today that with political will, decisive progress is within our grasp in the next two months.”

The amount of money the UK will pay to meet financial commitments it made while still a member has been one of the main stumbling blocks in the negotiations.

Barnier said Britain had told the EU that it was not ready to specify how much it believed it should pay.

“Regarding that question we are at an impasse, which is very worrying for thousands of projects everywhere in Europe and also worrying for those who contribute,” Reuters reports.

Barnier said he was still convinced that decisive progress was possible in the next two months given political will.

Brexit Secretary David Davis said he made “not secret of the fact that to provide certainty, we must talk about the future”.

Erdem is known as one of the UK’s leading brands when it comes to ethical fashion and sustainability.

Among the first to partake in Livia Firth’s green carpet challenge, the couture brand is celebrated for their stance on fair trading practices and slow fashion.

Erdem x HM

H&M have been slowly introducing ‘conscious’ (ie sustainable) items into their range since April 2012.

The brand also recently implemented a commitment for all their cotton to be sustainable by 2020.

Erdem x HM

So, although the collaboration between the brands isn’t classed as sustainable, some of the cottons used in the range are organic.

Moreover, some of the pieces in the men’s collection are made of hand woven wool from Harris Tweed in Scotland.

Erdem x HM

While some Erdem fans might be a little disappointed that the entire collaboration can’t be categorised as sustainable (and therefore, ‘ethical’ as Erdem is known to be), this combined venture is still a step in the right direction.

Erdem x HM

In 2016, 43% of H&M’s cotton was sustainably sourced.

It would be interesting to see what 2017′s statistic will be, no doubt this collaboration will affect it.

EU-Unterhändler Barnier beklagt eine ""Blockade"" der Gespräche durch die Briten

Der angestrebte Zeitplan gerät in Gefahr

Die Brexit-Verhandlungen haben ihr erstes Etappenziel klar verfehlt. Es gebe nicht genug Fortschritt, um die wichtige zweite Phase der Gespräche zu starten, stellte EU-Unterhändler Michel Barnier am Donnerstag fest.

Im Streit über die Schlussrechnung beim EU-Austritt Großbritanniens sprach Barnier gar von einer ""Blockade"". Brexit-Minister David Davis betonte hingegen, es gebe ""erhebliche Fortschritte"". Er appellierte an die EU, die Verhandlungen jetzt auszuweiten.

Der endgültige EU-Austritt der Briten steht bereits fest: Ende März 2019 will das Land die Europäischen Union verlassen. Ursprünglich wollten die Unterhändler wichtige Fragen der Trennung bis Mitte Oktober klären und danach über die künftigen Beziehungen sprechen. In nun mehr fünf Verhandlungsrunden gelang das aber nicht.

Barnier hofft auf Fortschritte

EU-Chefunterhändler Michel Barnier. Quelle: dpa

EU-Unterhändler Barnier sagte, er hoffe auf entscheidende Fortschritte in den kommenden zwei Monaten. Gelingt dies nicht, würde ein umfassendes Austrittsabkommen immer unwahrscheinlicher - ein Szenario, das vor allem die Wirtschaft auf beiden Seiten fürchtet.

Knackpunkt sind finanzielle Forderungen der EU für gemeinsam eingegangene Verpflichtungen in der mehr als 40-jährigen Mitgliedschaft des Vereinigten Königreichs.

Die britische Premierministerin Theresa May habe zwar versprochen, finanzielle Zusagen einzuhalten, sagte Barnier. In der fünften Verhandlungsrunde sei dies seit Montag aber nicht konkret unterfüttert worden. ""In dieser Frage stecken wir in einer Blockade"", kritisierte der EU-Vertreter.

Brexit-Minister Davis stellte klar, dass Großbritannien die finanziellen Zusagen erst im Zusammenhang mit den künftigen Beziehungen verhandeln wolle. In diesem Punkt sind sich beide Seiten also noch nicht einmal über die Abfolge einig.

Rechte der EU-Bürger in Großbritannien

Darüber hinaus ging es auch in dieser Runde um die künftigen Rechte der rund 3,2 Millionen EU-Bürger in Großbritannien und der 1,2 Millionen Briten in der übrigen EU. Hier stellten beide Seiten Fortschritte fest, aber auch noch viele Unstimmigkeiten.

Das gleiche gilt nach Darstellung von Davis und Barnier bei der Frage, wie die künftige EU-Grenze zwischen Irland und dem britischen Nordirland durchlässig gestaltet werden kann.

Davis machte deutlich, dass er die von der EU gewünschte Aufteilung in zwei Phasen nicht mehr akzeptiert. Der EU-Gipfel solle nächste Woche beschließen, Barniers Verhandlungsmandat auszuweiten, sagte er. Dass dies geschieht, gilt als sehr unwahrscheinlich.

Die 27 bleibenden EU-Länder geben sich bisher nach außen sehr einig. Sie sehen die Abfolge vor allem als Hebel, die Finanzforderungen durchzusetzen. Andernfalls würden sofort Milliardenlöcher im noch bis 2020 laufenden EU-Finanzrahmen klaffen.

""Kein Deal wäre ein sehr schlechter Deal""

Die zweite Phase der Verhandlungen dürfte dann aber noch komplizierter werden - deshalb will man sich dafür auch mehr Zeit nehmen. Dabei geht es um die von Großbritannien gewünschte ""tiefe und besondere Partnerschaft"" - also vor allem ein Handelsabkommen, aber auch die Zusammenarbeit in Sicherheits- und anderen Fragen.

Darüber hinaus soll über eine Übergangszeit gesprochen werden, um den Bruch für die Wirtschaft, aber auch für Bürger und Behörden sanfter zu gestalten.

Bis Oktober 2018 soll eigentlich alles in einem umfassenden Austrittsabkommen geregelt sein, das rechtzeitig vor dem Brexit Ende März 2019 ratifiziert und in Kraft gesetzt werden soll. Gelingt der Übergang in Phase zwei nicht bald, wird dieser Zeitplan zunehmend unrealistisch. Die britische Premierministerin Theresa May vertritt öffentlich die Ansicht, kein Abkommen sei besser als ein schlechtes.

Die EU verweist hingegen auf mögliche chaotische Folgen - von langen Staus an den Grenzen bis zu hohen Einfuhrzöllen auf beiden Seiten.

Almost 20,000 people have signed an online petition calling on all state governments to introduce the CNS -- a 24-hour legal advice and helpline for Aboriginal and Torres Islanders who have been taken into police custody already in operation in NSW and the ACT.

Indigenous affairs minister Nigel Scullion called on states to make a firm commitment to accept federal government help to accelerate its implementation, while advocates credit it with improving transparency and ending preventable deaths in states such as NSW and the ACT.

The Federal Government is currently in talks with the NT, SA, and Victorian governments and says preventing deaths in custody must be urgently addressed.

""The CNS is not a silver bullet to addressing this issue,"" a spokesman for federal indigenous affairs minister Nigel Scullion told HuffPost Australia.

""However, providing culturally-appropriate welfare support to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in police custody is a crucial first step to ending preventable deaths in custody.""

""The Minister calls on states and territories to make a firm commitment to accept the Australian Government's offer of funding to introduce the CNS and accelerate its implementation.""

But suicide prevention campaigner Gerry Georgatos says the some states -- such as Queensland and WA -- are dragging their feet to implement the full service.

""Every state and territory should be in line with one another with the best possible service and that's the two-decade-long tried and tested CNS in NSW,"" the anti-suicide campaigner told HuffPost Australia.

The Aboriginal and Torres Strait imprisonment rate (per 100,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population): Increased from 2,253 in 2015 to 2,346 in 2016;

The non-Indigenous imprisonment rate increased from 146 to 154 prisoners per 100,000 non-Indigenous population;

increased in every jurisdiction except South Australia;

was highest in Western Australia (3,997), followed by the Northern Territory (2,914);

When age standardised, was 13 times greater than the age standardised imprisonment rate for non-Indigenous persons (2,039 compared to 163). Source: ABS

""This is the opportunity to put an end to Black deaths in custody at least in police watch houses. Why would anyone get in the way of this?""

He said the Queensland and Victorian services -- which are not law like in NSW -- are not good enough.

""Nearly 100 percent of police watch house custodial deaths are of Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islanders and to not implement a service that puts an end to such deaths in police watch houses does indeed translate toxically as racism and is an indictment of our governments, one after another,"" he said.

Family and friends gathered outside Maitland Police station this morning for a memorial to mark a year since aboriginal woman, Rebecca Maher, died in police custody.

WA's Attorney General told the ABC he was committed to a CNS and that he and Premier Mark McGowen are entering into ""good faith negations"" with the Commonwealth.

Meanwhile Queensland's Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Partnerships, Mark Furner, told the National Broadcaster he was satisfied with the state's current system. State administrators earlier this year rejected the federal government's proposal to establish a hotline.

There Have Been Calls For A National CNS For 26 Years

Late last month tributes were held to mark 34 years since the death of Roebourne teenager John Pat, the 16-year-old Yindjibarndi boy whose death in WA police custody in 1983 sparked the 1987 Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody.

The Commonwealth offered to fund a CNS more than a year ago, after a recommendation from a coronial inquest into the death of 22-year-old Ms Dhu in in a Western Australian watch house.

But it wasn't the first recommendation. A compulsory custody notification service was recommended by the Royal Commission when it wrapped up in 1991, some 26 years ago.

The family of Ms Dhu believe a CNS could have saved her life.

""There's no doubt in my mind Ms Dhu would still be here, as well as other victims of deaths in custody, we need it implemented,"" her uncle Shaun Harris said on Wednesday.

Georgatos also believes Ms Dhu's life could have been saved by a CNS.

He also believes the psychological burden on police officers who have to sit on suicide watch from making health and welfare judgments.

There has been just one indigenous death in watch-house custody in NSW the CNS scheme was introduced in 2000.

Rebecca Maher, 36, was found dead in a cell at Maitland police station in July last year. Aboriginal Legal Service NSW has called for an independent investigation into her death, saying police failed to alert them to Maher's incarceration.

Overall, the imprisonment rate of Indigenous Australians has increased over the past decade, with Indigenous Australians representing 28 percent of the prisoner population.

Indigenous Australians make up just 3 percent of the general population.

So many deaths in custody - the silence from non-Indigenous Australia is deafening #StandAgainstBlackDeathsInCustody https://t.co/K4YWLVOn8V — NITV (@NITV) September 28, 2017

Georgatos said the CNS responds to nearly 16,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who have been taken into custody in NSW per year.

That's an average of 300 people per week.

The CNS costs only $526,000 per year, said Georgatos.

""That's it,"" he said.

Zuvor streiten sich vor allem die CSU und die Grünen - Göring-Eckardt pocht auf den Familiennachzug

Vor den ersten Gesprächen zwischen Union, FDP und Grünen knirscht es ordentlich zwischen den möglichen Regierungspartnern.

CSU-Landesgruppenchef Alexander Dobrindt kritisierte die Grünen gegenüber den Zeitungen der Funke Mediengruppe: ""Wir werden keine linken Spinnereien dulden.""

Die Partei müsse akzeptieren, dass ihre Chance darin bestehe, einer bürgerlichen Regierung von CDU, CSU und FDP beizutreten.

Grüne bestehen auf Famileinnachzug

Unbeirrt von Schelte aus der CSU-Spitze machten sich die Grünen weiterhin für den Familiennachzug von Flüchtlingen stark. So sagte Grünen-Fraktionschefin Katrin Göring-Eckardt am Mittwoch in Berlin: ""Der Familiennachzug wird eine der zentralen Fragen sein.""

Für eine bestimmte Gruppe mit eingeschränktem Schutzstatus, subsidiär Geschützte, hatte die Große Koalition den Familiennachzug bis März 2018 ausgesetzt. Die CDU/CSU will ihnen auch über diesen Termin hinaus den Familiennachzug verbieten.

Göring-Eckardt konterte gegen Dobrindt im Gespräch mit den Zeitungen der Funke Mediengruppe: ""Es ist nicht besonders klug, über die Identität möglicher zukünftiger Partner noch vor dem ersten gemeinsamen Gespräch herzuziehen.""

CSU-Chef Horst Seehofer versuchte, an das Verantwortungsbewusstsein aller an den Gesprächen Beteiligten zu appellieren. ""Das ist eine ganz wichtige Geschichte, zu versuchen, eine stabile Regierung für Deutschland zu bilden. Das ist ja auch der Wählerauftrag.""

Der bayerische Ministerpräsident sagte aber auch, wenn es keine ""vernünftigen Ergebnisse"" gebe, ""dann kann man halt nicht einer Regierung beitreten"". Aber das werde sich ""in den Sondierungs- und Verhandlungsgesprächen"" zeigen.

FDP will kleine Verhandlungsgruppen

Uneins sind sich die möglichen Koalitionäre auch, wenn es um die Größe ihrer Sondierungsgruppen geht. Der stellvertretende FDP-Vorsitzende Wolfgang Kubicki sagte dem Magazin ""Focus"": ""Ich halte es für einen Kardinalfehler, in den Verhandlungsrunden in Kompaniestärke anzutreten. Das ist nicht vertrauensbildend und keine Grundlage für gute und vertrauliche Verhandlungen.""

Seehofer kündigte derweil an, er wolle ein elfköpfiges Team in die Gespräche schicken. Bislang war in Berlin von zehn CSU-Unterhändlern die Rede gewesen. Die CDU stellt 18 Vertreter, die Grünen wollen 14 entsenden. Die FDP will lediglich mit einem halben Dutzend Personen an den Gesprächen teilnehmen.

Die Geschäftsführung hatte drei Wochen lang exklusiv mit dem deutschen Marktführer Lufthansa sowie mit dem britischen Billigflieger Easyjet über den Verkauf von Teilen des hoch verschuldeten Unternehmens verhandelt. Fraglich war zuletzt, ob auch eine Einigung mit Easyjet gelingt.

Is #IWWIWWIWI Changing Fashion Week As We Know It? It may not be the most well-known hashtag, but the rise in popularity of the 'I want what I want when I want it' attitude is no secret. Shoppers don't want to fall in love with a dress and have to wait six months for it to be in season and on the rack. As a result, we're seeing the rise of ""seasonless fashion"" in every market and at every price point.

Meteorologe Kachelmann forderte die Politiker zum Handeln auf

Die panischen Prognosen einiger Experten wollte er jedoch nicht teilen

Mehrere Tage lang hatte die Obergrenze die Republik als Geisel genommen.

Fast konnte man den Eindruck gewinnen, die Diskussion um das Maximal-Kontingent zur Einreise von Flüchtlingen, auf das die Union sich am Sonntagabend geeinigt hatte, sei derzeit das einzig wichtige Politikum.

Dabei geht es auch bei den Jamaika-Sondierungen um zahlreiche andere Themen. Nicht zuletzt der Klimaschutz könnte zu einem wichtigen Streitpunkt zwischen Union, Grünen und Liberalen werden.

Auch deshalb ging es im ARD-Talk von Sandra Maischberger am Mittwoch um den Klimawandel. ""Xavier und die Wetterextreme: Kippt unser Klima?"", fragte Maischberger die Gäste.

Neben Dorothee Bär von der CSU und Ex-Umweltministerin Bärbel Höhn von den Grünen waren das Klimawandel-Skeptiker Alex Reichmuth, Klimaforscher Hans Joachim Schellnhuber und Meteorologe Jörg Kachelmann.

Die Diskussionslinien waren von Anfang an klar gezogen. Forscher Schellnhuber warnte vehement vor den Folgen der Erderwärmung (""in den nächsten Jahrzehnten dringt die Sahara nach Europa vor"") – Skeptiker Reichmuth tat den menschlichen Einfluss auf den Klimawandel als ideologische Spinnerei ab.

CSU gegen Grüne beim Kohle-Ausstieg

Bär und Höhn lieferten sich vor allem beim Thema Kohle-Ausstieg spannende Wortgefechte. ""Selbst ich als Grüne sage ja nicht: Morgen alle Kohlekraftwerke abschalten"", gab sich Höhn anfangs kompromissbereit. Als Deadline müsse man aber das Jahr 2030 für alte Kohlekraftwerke setzen. Irgendwann müsse man komplett auf Kohle verzichten, vertrat Höhn die Grünen-Linie.

CSU-Politikerin Bär war das immer noch zu forsch. ""Klimaschutz darf keine Arbeitsplätze gefährden"", erklärte sie.

► Zum Hintergrund: In Deutschland arbeiten derzeit nur noch etwa 20.000 Menschen (0,07 Prozent aller Beschäftigten) in der Braunkohlewirtschaft. Zum Vergleich: Im Ökostrom-Sektor arbeiten laut dem Bundesverband Erneuerbare Energien etwa 330.000 Menschen.

Trotzdem erklärte Bär, bei den Sondierungsgesprächen müsse man sehen, ""was an realistischen Forderungen auf den Tisch kommt"". Durch die Blume heißt das wohl: Große Sprünge im Kampf gegen den Klimawandel, wie sie die Grünen planen, wird es mit der CSU nicht geben.

Höhn habe ja auch als NRW-Ministerin nicht alle Kohlekraftwerke abgeschafft, warf sie ihrer Kontrahentin vor. Die ging kurz auf 180: ""Hallo?"" Sie hätte mit ihrer Partei einen ""massiven Kampf gegen die Braunkohle"" geführt.

Kachelmann erklärt, was die Debatte so schwer macht

Fast dankbar konnte der Zuschauer sein, dass die ARD mit Meteorologe Jörg Kachelmann jemanden eingeladen hatte, dem es vor allem um Besonnenheit ging.

Als Klimawissenschaftler Schellnhuber eine Überflutung der Kontinente im Jahr ""3000, oder wie auch immer"" prophezeite, brachte Kachelmann das Gespräch wieder ins Hier und Jetzt.

Der ehemalige ARD-Wettermann machte damit gleichzeitig auf ein großes Problem der Klimapolitik aufmerksam: Menschen könnten nur schwer so weit in die Zukunft blicken. Kein Bürger würde daher sagen: ""Heute fahre ich nicht nach Schweinfurt ins Kino, weil möglicherweise bin ich schuld, wenn der Meeresspiegel in tausend Jahren 70 Meter höher ist.“

Kachelmann: ""Schmeißen Sie gefälligst den Laden!""

Auch deshalb gibt es für die meisten Parteien wohl attraktivere Themen als klimapolitische Langzeitkonzepte. Wichtig wären sie allemal. ""Ich erwarte von Ihnen auf dem Politiksofa, dass sie gefälligst den Laden schmeißen"", wandte sich der Schweizer an Bär und Höhn.

Ohnehin lieferte der Meteorologe viele kluge Einwände. Für Panik sei es zu früh, machte er schon zu Anfang der Sendung deutlich. Man sehe etwa statistisch gar keine Häufung von schweren Unwettern.

""Die Unwetter kommen nicht mit einem Zettelchen daher.""

Sind die derzeitigen Wetterextreme Indizien für den #Klimawandel, Herr @Kachelmann? pic.twitter.com/z7rHsW9xRS — Maischberger (@maischberger) 11. Oktober 2017

Ohnehin müsse es in der Diskussion um den Klimawandel stärker um etwas anderes gehen, als um die Frage, was der Mensch zu den derzeitigen Auffälligkeiten beigetragen habe. ""Falls es so ist, wie beschrieben: Was tun wir dagegen, damit es nicht so kommt?""

Es sei ""wie wenn so ein Meteorit auf die Erde zukommt, wir diskutieren aber nicht, wie wir das verhindern, dass wir alle sterben, sondern streiten uns übereinander.""

Ein Satz, den Höhn und Bär mit in die Koalitionsgespräche nehmen sollten.

The vice-president of product for Shopify ought to know.

In 10 weeks, Jet Cooper, the Toronto agency he co-founded, went from start-up status to merging with the Ottawa-based e-commerce site. What started as a meeting between Kanwar and Shopify's Tobias Lütke quickly evolved into a partnership that's since grown their Toronto business from 30-some people to over 400 employees.

The payoff was certainly there. But that's not to say the decision-making process wasn't daunting.

""What people don't realize before it's too late, often, is that there's no such thing as a perfect moment to become an entrepreneur.""

Kanwar says any further hesitation would have fed into what he calls the ""black hole of entrepreneurship"" — a headspace budding business owners can find themselves in as self-doubt starts piling up.

""There's this thing called the black hole of entrepreneurship. To me, that's all the reasons you build up in your own mind why you're not ready to become an entrepreneur.""

And while some self-doubt is inherently a part of becoming an entrepreneur, Kanwar says the remedy to keeping it in check is to not treat it like a business at all.

""You have to focus on doing something you love, and not on building a business. Think of it like a project; think of it like an idea. Don't think of it like a company. A company comes out of building and expressing yourself in something you love.""

EU-Unterhändler Barnier beklagt eine ""Blockade"" der Gespräche durch die Briten

Der angestrebte Zeitplan gerät in Gefahr

Die Brexit-Verhandlungen haben ihr erstes Etappenziel klar verfehlt. Es gebe nicht genug Fortschritt, um die wichtige zweite Phase der Gespräche zu starten, stellte EU-Unterhändler Michel Barnier am Donnerstag fest.

Im Streit über die Schlussrechnung beim EU-Austritt Großbritanniens sprach Barnier gar von einer ""Blockade"". Brexit-Minister David Davis betonte hingegen, es gebe ""erhebliche Fortschritte"". Er appellierte an die EU, die Verhandlungen jetzt auszuweiten.

Der endgültige EU-Austritt der Briten steht bereits fest: Ende März 2019 will das Land die Europäischen Union verlassen. Ursprünglich wollten die Unterhändler wichtige Fragen der Trennung bis Mitte Oktober klären und danach über die künftigen Beziehungen sprechen. In nun mehr fünf Verhandlungsrunden gelang das aber nicht.

Barnier hofft auf Fortschritte

EU-Chefunterhändler Michel Barnier. Quelle: dpa

EU-Unterhändler Barnier sagte, er hoffe auf entscheidende Fortschritte in den kommenden zwei Monaten. Gelingt dies nicht, würde ein umfassendes Austrittsabkommen immer unwahrscheinlicher - ein Szenario, das vor allem die Wirtschaft auf beiden Seiten fürchtet.

Knackpunkt sind finanzielle Forderungen der EU für gemeinsam eingegangene Verpflichtungen in der mehr als 40-jährigen Mitgliedschaft des Vereinigten Königreichs.

Die britische Premierministerin Theresa May habe zwar versprochen, finanzielle Zusagen einzuhalten, sagte Barnier. In der fünften Verhandlungsrunde sei dies seit Montag aber nicht konkret unterfüttert worden. ""In dieser Frage stecken wir in einer Blockade"", kritisierte der EU-Vertreter.

Brexit-Minister Davis stellte klar, dass Großbritannien die finanziellen Zusagen erst im Zusammenhang mit den künftigen Beziehungen verhandeln wolle. In diesem Punkt sind sich beide Seiten also noch nicht einmal über die Abfolge einig.

Rechte der EU-Bürger in Großbritannien

Brexit-Minister David Davis. Quelle: dpa

Darüber hinaus ging es auch in dieser Runde um die künftigen Rechte der rund 3,2 Millionen EU-Bürger in Großbritannien und der 1,2 Millionen Briten in der übrigen EU. Hier stellten beide Seiten Fortschritte fest, aber auch noch viele Unstimmigkeiten.

Das gleiche gilt nach Darstellung von Davis und Barnier bei der Frage, wie die künftige EU-Grenze zwischen Irland und dem britischen Nordirland durchlässig gestaltet werden kann.

Davis machte deutlich, dass er die von der EU gewünschte Aufteilung in zwei Phasen nicht mehr akzeptiert. Der EU-Gipfel solle nächste Woche beschließen, Barniers Verhandlungsmandat auszuweiten, sagte er. Dass dies geschieht, gilt als sehr unwahrscheinlich.

Die 27 bleibenden EU-Länder geben sich bisher nach außen sehr einig. Sie sehen die Abfolge vor allem als Hebel, die Finanzforderungen durchzusetzen. Andernfalls würden sofort Milliardenlöcher im noch bis 2020 laufenden EU-Finanzrahmen klaffen.

""Kein Deal wäre ein sehr schlechter Deal""

Die zweite Phase der Verhandlungen dürfte dann aber noch komplizierter werden - deshalb will man sich dafür auch mehr Zeit nehmen. Dabei geht es um die von Großbritannien gewünschte ""tiefe und besondere Partnerschaft"" - also vor allem ein Handelsabkommen, aber auch die Zusammenarbeit in Sicherheits- und anderen Fragen.

Darüber hinaus soll über eine Übergangszeit gesprochen werden, um den Bruch für die Wirtschaft, aber auch für Bürger und Behörden sanfter zu gestalten.

Bis Oktober 2018 soll eigentlich alles in einem umfassenden Austrittsabkommen geregelt sein, das rechtzeitig vor dem Brexit Ende März 2019 ratifiziert und in Kraft gesetzt werden soll. Gelingt der Übergang in Phase zwei nicht bald, wird dieser Zeitplan zunehmend unrealistisch. Die britische Premierministerin Theresa May vertritt öffentlich die Ansicht, kein Abkommen sei besser als ein schlechtes.

Die EU verweist hingegen auf mögliche chaotische Folgen - von langen Staus an den Grenzen bis zu hohen Einfuhrzöllen auf beiden Seiten.

Over a crackling line from Delhi, Roxna Swamy assures me that everything in her new book is true – except for one fact. ""I won't tell you what it is,"" she says, with the hint of a giggle. ""You have to read it and find out for yourself.""

The volume in question is a glowing tribute to her husband, Subramanian Swamy – firebrand right-wing politician, brilliant economist, crusader against corruption, propagator of serial controversies on social media and in real life. Swamy, as Roxna writes with pique, may be accused of being ""communal, biased, right wing, slanted, downright evil"" but never ""boring"".

Even his sworn opponents would admit he isn't. Not least the portrait of Swamy we come across in this chatty, occasionally rambling and intensely personal, volume, filled with amusing anecdotes rather than profound insights.

The course of the narrative is best described by the title. Evolving with Subramanian Swamy begins in the beginning, with the Swamys meeting as students at Harvard — he is an economist, she is a mathematician-turned-lawyer — and charts their lives over the next several decades, in India and abroad, riding out a tide of controversies and political disputes.

The journey, needless to say, is tumultuous — full of litigations, counter-attacks, relentless chases and wily escapes — but Swamy emerges from it all unscathed.

The journey, needless to say, is tumultuous — full of litigations, counter-attacks, relentless chases and wily escapes — but Swamy emerges from it all unscathed. Roxna's account, narrated with colour and buoyancy, makes her husband appear invincible. The subtitle, 'A roller-coaster ride', could just as well be rephrased to 'The Superpowers of Subramanian Swamy', since the ups and downs are breathtakingly dramatic.

You'd think publishers would be falling over one another to get such an explosive memoir, but Roxna had to go it alone, after being rejected by some of the biggest firms in the country, she tells me. Penguin Random House and HarperCollins both denied having seen the manuscript, Juggernaut Books admitted it didn't work for them. The result: after an unnecessarily tedious battle to acquire an ISBN number, the book was finally self-published last month by the author.

The most adventurous years come in the Emergency era, when Indira Gandhi took a distinct dislike to Swamy, leaving him on the run from the law, travelling at tremendous risk with a proscribed passport, while his wife, with two young children, lived in their home in Delhi, under the watchful eyes of 24x7 security. Much excitement follows in these pages as Swamy pulls off James Bond-like stunts, goes under cover and is on the run for several months.

But, as Roxna promises, there is never a dull moment. Leading the police on a wild goose chase, Swamy disguises himself as RSS leader Nanaji Deshmukh's Sikh driver, enjoys an ice cream with Narendrabhai Modi in Ahmedabad, and manages to smuggle letters home, even as the Congress government desperately struggles to catch him.

Swamy disguises himself as RSS leader Nanaji Deshmukh's Sikh driver, enjoys an ice cream with Narendrabhai Modi in Ahmedabad, and manages to smuggle letters home.

Such terrifying trials notwithstanding, Swamy's good cheer never seems to leave him. As Roxna recalls with much glee, even at the height of these difficult years, Swamy called her once, in soto voce, pretending to be one Mr Moto Moto, a Chinese man. ""Nothing keeps Swamy down,"" she writes fondly, ""not even the fact that the mythical Mr Moto Moto would have to be Japanese and not Chinese.""

Since the tone of Roxna's story is consistently adulatory, we find a portrait of Swamy as a flawless, upright, unfairly persecuted and eternally wronged individual – quite the contrast to his belligerent and polarising politics. We learn about his weakness for dogs, each one of his pets has been allegedly called Winnie (after Winston Churchill), his unfulfilled desire to get a pet monkey, and his unapologetically profligate lifestyle.

Not one to live like a ""hypocritical Gandhian"", Swamy continues to revel in the comfort and luxury he feels he is entitled to. From homes to cars to first-class privileges, he appears to be the chosen one – for whom, as a pop song memorable put it, the best things in life are free. In Roxna's doting words, ""hardly any family I know has as many air conditioners and TVs and computers as we do – as you could expect, most of them just dropped into Swamy's extended hand; and the worst is that most of them are switched on for most of the time.""

Along with her unflinching admiration of Swamy and spirited defence of him, Roxna takes an amused and rather indulgent view of life and its twists. She's scathing about her husband's arch-opponents, beginning with Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who messed with Swamy's political ambitions by provoking his fallout with the RSS in the 80s. The former prime minister, who, according to Roxna, went after Swamy driven by his own insecurities. She writes in the book about Vajpayee's alleged drinking, drug-taking and womanising habits. Even after all these years and Swamy's now-bittersweet reunion with the BJP, Roxna says she remains suspicious of the ruling party.

The other sworn adversary is, of course, the late J Jayalalithaa, against whom Swamy filed the famous disproportionate assets case, in which the apex court found her guilty 20 years much too late. Swamy's defiance in the face of AIADMK goons, the couple's hasty retreat from Chennai, pursued by Jayalalithaa's orders to bring them back, Swamy outwitting her plans and making a great escape via Bangkok — all these make for a thrilling read. Equally suspenseful is the story of the family's eviction from their quarters at IIT-Delhi, after Swamy was fired from his job there, and Roxna's feisty confrontation with the police.

In spite of the many entertaining, albeit grimly ironic, asides strewn over these pages, there aren't many profound insights into Swamy's mind or his political beliefs. Between his Rajinikanth-like antics and never-ending catalogue of injustices wrought against him, we wade through details about the various properties and cars that have belonged to the Swamys, the curious histories of their acquisitions, losses and equally incredulous retrievals.

With its cinematic progression and defiantly one-sided views, culled from newspaper cuttings saved by the author since 1968, Evolving with Subramanian Swamy demands a willing suspension of disbelief from its most compliant readers. It's naive to expect anything deeper than a two-dimensional comic-book heroism of the subject from the book, though the author's own character, from the glimpses we get from her account, is unconventionally appealing, if only for her sincere disregard for any pretense of being a neutral observer. As for that one falsehood in the book, I'd leave the joy of that discovery to other readers.

Viki Ferguson, 45, hopes her experience at the Royal Victoria Infirmary, in Newcastle, will serve as an example to other hospitals who may not currently provide such a high standard of care.

The mother chose to share her story during Baby Loss Awareness Week (9-15 October) after charities revealed current levels of care offered to women after baby loss are “worryingly inconsistent” across the UK.

The charities have called on the government to ensure all hospitals have accessible bereavement rooms and a member of staff to lead on bereavement care.

Ferguson believes these demands are achievable as she received a high standard of care after her stillbirth in 2013.

“I don’t know what more the staff could have done to help us through that time,” Ferguson told HuffPost UK. “Everything they did was for our benefit.”

VikiFerguson Viki Ferguson and her husband Colin.

In March 2013, Ferguson was 35 weeks pregnant with her first child when she went in for a routine scan.

She and her partner Colin knew their daughter had a heart condition, so she was having checkups on a more regular basis than most mothers-to-be.

At the appointment, she was told there was no heartbeat, her baby had died.

“The rest of that afternoon was a bit of a blur,” Ferguson explained. “But what I can remember is how supportive the staff were, they talked us through everything that was going to happen.”

Ferguson was told she had a choice of being induced or waiting for labour to start. She chose to be induced.

What surprised Ferguson when she went back to the hospital to give birth on 16 March 2013, was that she was given a private room away from other pregnant women.

“Within the maternity ward they have a bereavement suite,” she explained. “There are two rooms especially for anyone who will have a stillbirth. It is away from the noise, you can’t hear anyone else in labour or any crying babies.

“It was really well thought out and very self-contained. I had my own bathroom.”

Ferguson was assigned a specially trained bereavement midwife as soon as she arrived. The midwife stayed with her and, even when she finished her shift, a second bereavement midwife took over.

“If you want them there, they are there,” Ferguson explained. “If you wanted to be left alone, they left you alone.

“They looked after us so well, they made sure Colin was looked after as well, he was part of it - they brought another bed in the room so he could stay with me overnight.

“Things like that really made a difference to me.”

“The care was exemplary. I don’t know how it would have felt not to have that. If they want a model to work on, that was it."" Viki Ferguson

When Ferguson gave birth, she was surprised how comforted she felt by the midwife and staff in the room with her.

“They bathed my daughter, they put her in a babygro and treated her if she was still alive,” the mum explained.

“They were talking to her and made it the nicest experience it could’ve been. It wasn’t like it was all over as soon as she was born. How they treated her meant so much to us.”

Ferguson gave birth at 8.20pm and she and her husband had a couple of hours with their baby that night. The midwife stayed with them until after midnight, speaking to them and checking they were okay.

“I really couldn’t have faulted the care,” she said.

“The next day we had another couple of hours with our daughter and then we had staff coming in to talk us through everything that happens with funerals, who would be in touch with us, and the counselling that was available. It was all the information we needed.”

Ferguson said she didn’t feel rushed to leave the bereavement suite - she was told she could stay as long as she wanted, but she decided to get discharged the next day.

On leaving the suite, she was given a memory envelope with photos, hair, footprints and handprints taken from her daughter, and knitted teddy bear twins - one that stayed with her daughter and one that stayed with the couple.

In the weeks following, Ferguson had a visit from a chaplain to talk through the funeral, two visits from the health visitor, a counselling session, and her GP ensured she didn’t go back to work until she was up to it.

“The care was exemplary,” she added. “I don’t know how it would have felt not to have that. If they want a model to work on, that was it.

“The staff were completely lead by us, I didn’t feel like we were forced into anything. Everything was for our benefit.”

Ferguson believes good care does “not require a complete overhaul of the NHS”.

She said small gestures such as the memory box and the empathy shown by the midwives made her experience as good as it could have been.

“Every hospital should have a midwife or midwives trained in bereavement,” she said. ”Just to have someone to know how to deal with death and what to expect - simple things like that made such a difference.

“It’s shocking that there is a postcode lottery of care.

“It helps so much to have support at a time like that.

Pakistan is at quite a bizarre juncture. Seventy years on, the country is still clinging on to its colonial roots that find leadership in neckties, beauty in light skin, and brains in the English language. And yet at the same time, it continues to set strange, rather farcical standards for its inhabitants that are conveniently labelled as either cultural or religious obligation, but are more a consequence of the country's underlying patriarchal order. Because bearing the brunt of these are mostly and only women.

In a recent turn of events, the admin at FAST-NU has reportedly issued a stringent dress code for its female students, restricting them from wearing tights, sleeveless tops, shorter length shirts, and even make-up. FAST, however, isn't the first institute to impose such polarising regulations. The country's other leading universities also have similar dress codes in place. But while most of these universities justify them as a way of encouraging a formal educational environment, by subtly limiting male students as well from channelling their laidback fashion sensibilities in a pair of jeans or a graphic tee, FAST-NU has at least been honest about its intentions.

It is all about controlling women

The university it appears isn't interested in rationalising this as a 'grooming exercise' but is instead focused on curbing any display of 'immodesty or indecency' by its female students that may emotionally, or better yet sexually, 'provoke' male population on campus. This, in fact, is the real basis of all such dress codes. On many occasions, while men have managed to get away with breaking these rules, women have reported having been penalised or returned from the main entrance for not following them religiously. A student even shared how she was threatened with a disciplinary committee action by a group of four teachers trolling her for wearing a pair of tights under her long, flowing kameez.

How many times has research proven that there is barely any correlation between clothing and sexual harassment and assault? Several.

Interestingly enough, Pakistani women are not the sole victims of sartorial sexism. Earlier this year, a young student was also forced out of a chess tournament for wearing a 'seductive' dress – in this case, a high-neck top paired with a knee-length skirt. Pakistani women also have to worry about fittings and looking pretty, because any enhancement of their feminine features unnecessarily distracting men is a bigger priority than educating these young women. It's a woman's job to ensure that her body doesn't encourage the opposite sex in any way, for her own safety, because rape culture and harassment is a woman's fault.

How many times has research proven that there is barely any correlation between clothing and sexual harassment and assault? Several. Yet, administrations and authorities incessantly single out women, labelling them the flag bearers of temptation. Every time there is an incident at a school or the workplace, young women are immediately advised to dress more conservatively because their bare arms and ankles are likely to destabilise the male learning environment. Men are equally susceptible to sexual assault so where is the ban on bare biceps and unbuttoned collars that may evoke a woman's sexual desires?

It's a dangerous idea to instil; to not let young men be accountable for their lack of self-control and imply that a woman is responsible for the way she is treated or looked upon. It is a sort of blanketed leeway being offered to men for escaping liability for their actions and an unjustified right; an opportunity to exercise force and use violence for whatever they may interpret as women breaking the cultural code.

The onus is not, and should not be, on women to 'avoid being a temptation', for men will be men, their sinister, predatory selves, but on men to not conveniently assume vulnerable young women as sexually available and asking for it. This idea that any sort of sexual advances are unavoidable so long as you exist in a public space is the real problem. Imposing dress codes on women will not help maintain a stable learning environment, teaching men not to get distracted and not be rapists will.

Le 6 septembre dernier, le Fondation 30 millions d'amis s'alarmait déjà des ""conséquences dramatiques"" de cette mesure sur les refuges pour animaux, largement dépendants de ce type de contrats subventionnés par l'Etat. ""En diminuant d'un tiers le nombre de contrats aidés, le gouvernement met en danger des milliers d'animaux abandonnés ou maltraités, dont la survie ne dépend que des refuges qui s'interrogent sur les moyens dont ils disposeront demain pour continuer de mener à bien leur mission de service public"", prévenait l'association.

""On nous a dit 'stop, vous ne pouvez plus embaucher' alors qu'on était en plein mois d'août, en pleine période où on avait le plus besoin de salariés"", déplore au micro du HuffPost Stéphanie Slusarek, présidente du refuge de Montgeron. Dévouée à la protection animale depuis plusieurs années, la responsable doit maintenant se débrouiller avec une seule soigneuse (au lieu de deux ou trois habituellement), dont le contrat aidé se terminera... le 1er novembre.

Sans l'aide des contrats, plusieurs autres refuges se retrouvent ainsi dans une situation précaire. À Fleury-Mérogis, par exemple, le refuge de l'Association Rissoise de protection des animaux (ARPA) fonctionne également en sous-effectif cet automne. ""Tous nos emplois sont des emplois aidés.

""Nous sommes une petite association de protection animale qui vit exclusivement de dons et de subventions. Nous n'avons pas les moyens financiers pour des contrats non aidés"", ajoute l'association.

Die offenbaren, wie damals zahlreiche Imperien und Hochkulturen im öst­li­chen Mit­tel­meer­raum untergegangen sind

Eine alte Steinplatte könnte ""eines der größten Puzzles der mediterranen Archäologie des Mittelmeers"" lösen. Das teilen Schweizer und niederländische Forscher selbstbewusst mit.

Schon seit Jahrhunderten rätseln Forscher, warum vor 3200 Jahren innerhalb kurzer Zeit zahlreiche Imperien und Hochkulturen im öst­li­chen Mit­tel­meer­raum untergegangen sind.

Zwar wurde die Steinplatte schon 1878 in der heutigen Zentraltürkei entdeckt. Doch erst jetzt konnten die Forscher die Inschriften auf dem Stein entziffern - und fanden dabei neue Hinweise.

Demnach soll die 29 Meter lange Platte die Ereignisse am Ende der Bronzezeit im östlichen Mittelmeerraum beschreiben. Die Forscher wissen nun, dass die Schriftzeichen die Eroberungsfeldzüge von Großkönig von Mira, einem Vasallenstaat in Anatolien, erzählen - und die letztendlich einen Mas­sen­kol­laps in Gang setzten.

Rätselhafte Hieroglyphen

Der 35 Zentimeter dicke Kalksteinfries trägt die längste bekannte Hieroglyphen-Inschrift aus der Bronzezeit. Bauern aus Beyköy hatten die in mehre Stücke geteilte Platte vor über 100 Jahren gefunden. Dorfbewohner verwendeten die Steine später als Baumaterial für eine Moschee.

Zwar begann in den 1950er Jahren ein türkisch-amerikanisches Expertenteam mit dem Entziffern der Hieroglyphen. Doch eine Veröffentlichung wurde immer wieder verschoben, 1985 starb der letzte an der Arbeit beteiligte Wissenschaftler.

Nun hat Eberhard Zangger, Präsident der Luwian Studies Foundation, das Material zusammen mit einem Kollegen aus der Niederlande erneut ausgewertet. Luwian Studies ist eine gemeinnützige Stiftung mit Sitz in der Schweiz, deren alleiniger Stiftungszweck die Förderung der Erforschung vorchristlicher Kulturen in Anatolien ist.

Laut Zangger wurde die Inschrift von Kupanta-Kurunta, dem Großkönig von Mira, in Auftrag gegeben.

Glaubt man Zanggers Forschungsergebnis, dann befahl Kupanta-Kurunta seinen Heeren um 1190 v. Chr., nach Osten zu stürmen. Nachdem die Soldaten an Land erfolgreich waren, formten vereinte Streitkräfte aus Anatolien eine Flotte und eroberten zahlreiche Küstenstädte im Süden Anatoliens sowie Provinzen im heutigen Syrien und Palästina.

Die Luwianer, ein lo­ser Ver­bund anatolischer Kö­nig­rei­che, kämpften sich bis zur ägyptischen Grenze vor. Zanggers Theorie zufolge trugen die Luwianer entscheidend zu den sogenannten Seevölkern und damit zum Ende Bronzezeit im östlichen Mittelmeerraum bei.

Zanggers These widerspricht damit der bisherigen Forschungsmeinung. Bisher gingen Historiker laut dem ""Spiegel"" davon aus, dass der Niedergang der Großreiche durch eine Kom­bi­na­ti­on aus Na­tur­ka­ta­stro­phen, Hun­gers­nö­ten und ei­nem bron­ze­zeit­li­chen Kli­ma­wan­del verursacht wurde.

Luftfahrtunternehmer Niki Lauda kritisiert die Übernahme von Air Berlin durch die Lufthansa

Aufgrund der Monopolbildung erwartet Lauda steigende Flugpreise

Lufthansa sei außerdem nicht an Air Berlin selbst, sondern nur an den Flugstrecken interessiert

Im Interview mit dem Deutschlandfunk hat der Luftfahrtunternehmer Niki Lauda Kritik an der Übernahme von Air Berlin durch die Lufthansa geäußert.

Er wirft der Bundesregierung unter anderem vor, eine gezielte Monopolbildung in Kauf zu nehmen, wodurch die Preise für Flugtickets weiter ansteigen werden. ""Es kann doch nicht sein, dass wir Europäer plötzlich ein Monopol schaffen"", sagte der ehemalige Formel-1-Rennfahrer.

Auch andere Experten wie der Chef der Monopolkommission, Achim Wambach in der ""FAZ"" warnten vor einem solchen Monopol der Lufthansa. Bereits jetzt gebe es wenig Wettbewerb auf innerdeutschen Strecken. Das könne sich nicht nur in steigenden Preisen bei Flugtickets äußern.

""Auch die Bahn, die ja auf mittleren Strecken durchaus mit der Lufthansa konkurriert, muss sich dann weniger anstrengen und kann ohne große Sorge (...) ebenfalls die Preise anheben"", sagte Wambach.

Auch Lauda klagt: ""Wenn Sie sich in Deutschland die Inlandsstrecken anschauen, können Sie jeden Tag sehen, wie die Tickets teurer werden.""

Kritik am Vorgehen der Bundesregierung

Der 68-Jährige kritisiert im Interview die staatliche Unterstützung der Bundesregierung. Er glaubt, dass sich die Bundesregierung und der Vorstand von Lufthansa die Übernahme von Air Berlin abgesprochen haben.

Die Unterstützung von 150 Millionen Euro begründete die Bundesregierung im August mit dem Erhalt des Flugbetriebs. Niki Lauda hingegen hält einen anderen Grund für entscheidend.

Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel habe den Flugbetrieb von Air Berlin nur deshalb aufrecht erhalten wollen, damit Lufthansa die Slots, die bisher Air Berlin besaß, übernehmen kann.

► Slots werden an die Fluggesellschaften vergeben und sind bestimmte Zeitfenster, in denen eine Airline starten oder landen darf. Mit dem Kauf von Air Berlin sind nun der größte Teil der Slots in der Hand von Lufthansa.

Die Mitarbeiter haben für Lufthansa keine große Bedeutung

Lauda kritisierte außerdem, die Lufthansa sei nicht in erster Linie am Unternehmen Air Berlin interessiert, sondern nur an den frei werdenden Slots.

Die Lufthansa werde sich einzelne Strecken, die sie noch nicht besetzt haben, herauspicken und den Rest der Strecken einstellen.

Bei dieser Planung würden die Mitarbeiter des insolventen Unternehmens keine große Rolle spielen, glaubt der ehemalige Rennfahrer. Sie werden nach der Übernahme einen neuen Vertrag unterschreiben müssen, der möglicherweise schlechtere Arbeitsbedingungen als der bisherige Vertrag bei Air Berlin beinhaltet.

► Hätte eine andere Fluggesellschaft Air Berlin gekauft, wäre womöglich ein stärkerer Wettbewerb in der Flugbranche entstanden. Die Flugtickets wären so eher billiger geworden.

Niki Lauda war an einem Kauf von Air Berlin interessiert

Niki Lauda gründete er nach seiner Formel-1-Karriere seine eigene Fluggesellschaft Niki Luftfahrt GmbH, die 2004 von Air Berlin übernommen wurde.

Im Sommer diesen Jahres hatte Lauda zusammen mit den Unternehmen Kondor und Thomas Cook selbst Interesse an einer Übernahme von Air Berlin angemeldet. Der Gläubigerausschuss ließ ihn jedoch nicht am Verfahren teilnehmen, wie der Deutschlandfunk berichtet.

Indeed, when the mind is at peace with itself, our entire being is at peace with our external environment.","ADVERTISEMENT

Till recently, modern science refused to acknowledge the connection between the mind and body. While physical ailments were seen as causing stress and anxiety, Western doctors considered a direct correlation between the mind and the body as being implausible for want of compelling evidence.

This has since undergone a change, thanks to the significant body of scientific research that demonstrated how emotions, or the state of one's mind, can impact physical health. It is now acknowledged that emotionally stressed persons, for instance, are more vulnerable to a major physical ailment. It is argued, in other words, that if the mind is not at ease, it could invite disease.

Traditional Eastern philosophy, on the other hand, has always seen a strong mind-body connection and stressed on the healing power of the mind. In their view, a physically healthy person need not, necessarily, be emotionally balanced, whereas, a mind at peace with itself can lead to a healthy body and a better quality of life.

The externally imposed demands of contemporary living that all of us have internalised make it truly difficult to cultivate a mind that is at peace with itself. We live in a highly competitive world and are constantly being called upon to prove ourselves, to be better than the others, to make more money, buy bigger houses and cars. This is the criteria of success.

While no one does anything in order to fail, very few actually succeed in achieving externally imposed yardsticks. Consequently, our everyday biography is filled with stress, anxiety, and urgency. We are in a constant state of either rage or frustration, envy and depression. It's almost as if this were the age of despair, despondency and dissatisfaction.

Scientific evidence has established that modern society suffers from a sharp increase in hypertension, depression, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, with an increased risk of hospitalisation, even death because we suffer from 'lifestyle diseases'. More importantly, this is not an ailment that is restricted to the developed world but has increasingly found its way across the globe, even in poor and emerging economies.

A mind is at peace only when we are able to disengage while being part of the here-and-now.

There is a qualitative difference in the approach of Western and Eastern philosophical traditions that is worth recalling. In Western thought, for instance, an individual who is disengaged from his environment is seen as suffering from alienation, thus likely to suffer from morbid thoughts, and possibly suicidal, or homicidal tendencies. The suggested remedy is to integrate the individual with the external space they inhabit.

In Eastern thought, disconnect or distancing is not perceived in a negative manner. Indeed, a mind is at peace only when we are able to disengage while being part of the here-and-now. This is dispassion or the ability to stand apart rather than be consumed by one's surroundings or one's state of being. The 'Eternal Now', as Hindu philosophy sees it, is when time loses its temporal quality and is perceived only as part of a continuum. Only then would opposites be seen in context. Such as, black and white, day and night, happiness and sorrow, life and death. You need one to understand the other. What follows is equanimity or being at peace with one's mind.

Eastern philosophy also advises us to tame the mind, as the mind is known to plays tricks. Mindfulness is thus, the ability to be conscious of Maya or illusion and not to mistake it for reality. Only then would the individual cultivate a mind that is at peace with itself.

Mental peace is critical to living a life of quality and value. At the same time, the sole objective behind mindfulness is to recognise the importance of experiencing with the whole body and mind rather than to see and to feel with either the body or the mind and never with both together. It is this 'wholeness' that we will experience when we, to borrow a quote from the Dalai Lama, 'awaken the mind'.

When the mind is awakened, it shifts how we see ourselves. It determines our behavior, attitude and response to people and situations. Stephen Covey puts it wonderfully: 'The way we see a problem 'is' often the problem.' Indeed, when the mind is at peace with itself, our entire being is at peace with our external environment. It is helpful to recognise this, especially in today's day and age.

Allá donde un árbol crece en la soledad de una cumbre, donde las casas son más lodo que hogar y un niño de nadie con un ramo de flores naranja se para a la orilla de la carretera. Allí la gente sólo deja verse de la boca para arriba, buscando mirar al que llega, sólo para comprobar que la cosa no se ponga peor.

Fue un murmullo sin rodeos: un grupo de la delincuencia organizada amenazaba con asesinar el viernes 9 de junio a quienes no abandonaran esas comunidades, por lo que entre el 7 y 8 de junio el éxodo fue inevitable..

Desde entonces, lo que cuenta lo que ahí hubo son los lugares no las personas: hotel Mi Corazón, Sur 13, deshuesadero, se venden marranitos finos... y una iglesia resplandeciente, intacta, vacía, como si a alguien se le hubiera olvidado cerrar la puerta y también las de los seis baños construidos a su costado.

Ahuihuiyuco se quedó sin su población de aproximadamente mil 300 habitantes. Todavía el 9 de junio se podían ver por sus veredas a algunas familias que buscaban salir del lugar en camionetas.

En este lugar, dedicado principalmente a la siembra de autoconsumo y a la elaboración de la cinta de palma, sólo quedó abierta la iglesia.

Se trata de una zona estratégica para el trasiego de drogas, pues conecta con Ciudad de México o Puebla, explica el activista Manuel Olivares, del Centro Morelos, mientras estira el brazo para señalar el camino que tiene a su derecha y que, en un punto, parece volverse uno con la sierra: ""Esa ruta nos puede conectar con Zitlala, derecho llega a Copalillo y de ahí uno puede entroncar hacia la Ciudad de México o Puebla; son lugares muy estratégicos"".

De lo que se trata es de sembrar terror en el enemigo, no hay un cártel que sea menos sanguinario que otro, descuartizan, matan, esas son las razones por las que la lucha es tan sangrienta y tan cruel y que por la que ahora pelean por las comunidades."" Manuel Olivares.

La gente ha ido regresando de a poco, pero las escuelas y los centros de salud siguen vacíos; las cortinas de los negocios bajadas y las pocas personas que hay, sólo caminan, caminan, frenan un poco cuando algo o alguien sale a su paso, otean, se cubren la boca, se sacuden las piernas y siguen.

En Tepozcuautla el panorama es similar.

""Prácticamente se ve muy poca gente en las calles por el miedo, a partir de las 5 de la tarde la gente se regresa a su casa, como en una especie de toque de queda autoimpuesto, pero también demuestra que no le tiene confianza a los militares, porque justo hay una comisaría ocupada por los militares a unos metros"", continúa Manuel, quien comanda una Misión Civil de Observación con organismos internacionales a fin de hacer visible la emergencia.

Muchas casas siguen vacías, el retorno no se ha completado y, probablemente, no se complete; se sabe que muchas familias no piensan regresar ante la creciente práctica del reclutamiento forzado por parte de grupos de la delincuencia organizada.

Lo que antes se entendía por la lucha por la plaza era la lucha por el mercado de consumo, pero cuando el narcotráfico toma tintes empresariales, los fines económicos de la delincuencia organizada incrementan, aumentan los secuestros, el cobro de piso, la venta de protección, la extorsión, empiezan a controlar los servicios públicos."" Manuel Olivares

El tema del desplazamiento por la violencia se da al menos desde hace 10 años en Guerrero, explica José Raymundo Díaz, del Colectivo contra la Tortura y la Impunidad.

""En el estado de Guerrero hay desplazamiento desde hace mucho tiempo, pero ha estado silenciado y ahora en Chilapa se está documentando y tratando de visibilizar estos casos de desplazamiento que se están dando desde 2015"", señala.

Fue entre el 9 y 14 de mayo de 2015 que un grupo de 300 personas armadas tomó la ciudad de Chilapa, hubo, entonces, entre 31 y 32 desaparecidos. La gravedad se acentuó porque los hechos se dieron con la presencia de la Gendarmería Nacional y el Ejército.

De 2015 a la fecha, en Chilapa hay al menos 150 casos de desapariciones y sólo 14 se han podido denunciar ante la PGR para acceder al fondo de la Comisión Ejecutiva de Atención a Víctimas (CEAV); al resto, las autoridades no les han acreditado la declaración de ausencia, denuncia el Centro Morelos, el cual se ha encargado de documentar cada uno de los casos.

Hemos visto el momento en que Chilapa era un paraíso, llegaba mucha gente de otros lugares a vivir, nadie preguntaba nada mientras uno no se metiera en problemas, era un territorio libre para todos."" Manuel Olivares.

ENTRE LA ANARQUÍA Y LA OMISIÓN

El desplazamiento en Ahuihuiyuco y Tepozcuautla se dio en ""mucha anarquía, mucho desorden"", señala Manuel, pues aunque el Ejército y la Policía Municipal acompañaron a algunas personas, sólo las llevaron a la carretera y ahí las familias ""le dieron para donde mejor entendieron"", por eso no se tiene certeza sobre su paradero.

""Algunas familias fueron a dar a Chilpancingo, otras a Iguala, otras a Morelos, a diferentes partes del estado y del país; eso también tiene que ver con la desconfianza que tienen hacia el gobierno porque no fueron capaces de unificarse y plantearle al presidente municipal una solución.

""Cuando menos el presidente municipal de Chilapa no es ajeno a uno delos grupos de delincuencia organizada y la gente sabe que si van a presentar una denuncia al Ministerio Público más tardan en presentarla que el mismo MP que tomó la denuncia le esté informando al amo, al que le sirva"", acusa.

El centro de defensa de derechos humanos es claro en su mensaje, no quieren señalar a ningún grupo delictivo, pero sí exigirle al gobierno que haga las averiguaciones previas, que las carpetas de investigación avancen, que ""realmente se investigue y que realmente se castigue a los responsables.""

El Estado tiene la obligación de garantizar nuestro derecho a la vida, a la integridad física, a nuestro patrimonio y, cuando no es capaz de esto, pues la gente tiene que exigirle. Además nos enfrentamos a que el Ejército ha generalizado la visión de que los defensores de derechos humanos, defendemos a delincuentes, eso es muy grave porque tiene que ver con una criminalización y estigmatización hacia nuestro trabajo que provoca un linchamiento moral de la población hacia nosotros."" Manuel Olivares.

CHILAPA Y NUEVE ASESINATOS POR DÍA

De julio de 2013 a la fecha, en Guerrero suman 5 mil personas desplazadas en al menos 30 comunidades de 20 de los 81 municipios que integran la entidad.

Chilapa es una de las regiones más violentas, pero, a diferencia del norte, aquí la lucha no es por los capos, sino por comunidades pequeñitas, para que trabajen para un grupo y si se van con otro grupo, los matan"". Abel Barrera, Centro de Derechos Humanos de la Montaña Tlachinollan.

Actualmente en Chilapa hay tres retenes militares, es una localidad de 31 mil 157 habitantes, según cifras del Inegi, y en un día pueden ocurrir hasta nueve asesinatos.

Mientras que las desapariciones comenzaron desde 2014, con 19 personas; en 2015, 43; en 2016, 282; y hasta la primera quincena de septiembre de 2017, sumaban 188.

En lo que va del año, en el municipio de Chilapa 19 comunidades han registrado hechos violentos, mientras que en Zitlala, siete.

Destaca el éxodo de Quetzalcoatlán de las Palmas, una comunidad en el municipio de Zitlala: el 6 de enero del año pasado, un grupo armado entró, asesinó a seis personas, amenazó con regresar a matar a los demás y la comunidad, cargando a sus muertos, se desplazó.

Suena bastante grave, pero cargaron a sus muertos en una camioneta y todas las familias se salieron.

Hay gente que no soporta el sometimiento de los grupos criminales que los obliga a participar en actividades propias de la delincuencia y terminan huyendo"". Manuel Olivares.

SONAR LAS ALARMAS

La mañana del pasado 19 de septiembre dos cuerpos desmembrados fueron dejados en cuatro bolsas en el barrio San Juan, en Chilapa. Ese mismo día, llegaba a la cabecera municipal una Misión Civil de Observación. Ese mismo día, más tarde, un sismo causaría gran devastación en Ciudad de México, Morelos y Puebla.

La Misión de Observación, organizada por la Red Nacional de Organismos Civiles de Derechos Humanos (Red TDT), y en la que participaron las Brigadas Internacionales de Paz (PBI), Amnistía Internacional, Serapaz México y el Centro de Derechos Humanos de la Montaña Tlachinollan, buscaba visibilizar los casos y reunirse con el gobernador de Guerrero, Héctor Astudillo Flores, a fin de emitir una serie de recomendaciones para atender la creciente crisis de inseguridad en Chilapa, sin embargo el encuentro fue pospuesto debido a la emergencia nacional que desató el sismo del pasado 19 de septiembre.

La misión concluyó que no hay condiciones de seguridad para las comunidades desplazadas e hizo un llamado al gobierno del estado para garantizar los derechos humanos de las víctimas, las comunidades y los defensores de derechos humanos.

Mandan un operativo policiaco para acompañar a la misión y vemos que esos actores armados lo que hacen es vigilar el trabajo de los defensores y defensoras; falta visión de derechos humanos para entender la problemática de las víctimas. La forma en que se atiende a defensores y defensoras es colocar en el primer frente al Ejército, a la Policía.

Hubo tensión al llegar a Chilapa, estaba un retén, es una manera de dar la bienvenida con el fusil en la mano."" Abel Barrera Centro Tlachinollan

Para los activistas, la política de seguridad implementada, sobre todo en Guerrero, está siendo causante de la crisis de seguridad, porque consuma más violaciones graves a los derechos humanos, fomenta la impunidad y la falta de acceso a la justicia.","Chilapa, el municipio secuestrado: Las comunidades que el narco desplazó",http://www.huffingtonpost.com.mx/2017/10/12/chilapa-el-municipio-secuestrado-las-comunidades-que-el-narco-desplazo_a_23240700/

Members of the committee quizzed Gibb and fellow government minister Anne Milton on what action had been taken to tackle increasing sexual violence and harassment in schools.

The committee ordered a full inquiry last year after it emerged many schools were failing to properly tackle problems with “lad culture”, with girls regularly reporting unwanted sexual touching and comments.

Chair Maria Miller said she felt current systems aimed at both dealing with and recording incidents, were inadequate and that there was no real way of knowing whether victims were reporting assaults.

“The information is not gathered either by the school or by the police,” she added.

“The lack of protocol or information or guidance as to how you deal with such a situation is leaving headteachers flummoxed.

“l find it extraordinary that young girls are being asked to go back into class with people who have raped them.”

Gibb said such incidents should not happen and that guidelines offered to schools would be revised later this year, with a view to looking at the inclusion that perpetrators of sexual harassment and sexual violence should not be put back in the same class as the victim.

It also demonstrates that how Zuckerberg gives away his money will be just as important as what he gives it to.
Giving away a trickle of money each year is unlikely to live up to the verbs—transform, reimagine, revolutionize—the new philanthropists use to describe their goals.","For a long time, the way philanthropy worked was simple: Rich people gave their money to museums and churches and opera houses and Harvard. Their names went up on buildings, charities gave them made-up awards, their grandkids went to rehab, the Earth went around the sun. But philanthropy is changing. Today's billionaires are less interested in legacy institutions, less obsessed with prestige and perpetuity. Part of this is a function of their age: In 2012, 4 percent of America’s biggest charitable donations were made by people under 50 years old. In 2014, a quarter of them were. The other factor driving the new philanthropists is how they earned their money in the first place. Last year, six of the 10 largest charitable donations in the United States came from the tech sector, solidifying Silicon Valley’s place as the epicenter of the newer, bigger, disrupty-er philanthropy. There, tech billionaires form “giving circles” to share leads on promising charities, and they hire the same consultants to vet them. They use terms like “hacker philanthropy” and “effective altruism.” These guys—they are mostly guys—believe that they became successful businessmen by upending existing institutions, by scaling simple ideas, by ""breaking shit."" And, with few exceptions, that is how they plan to become successful philanthropists, too. All of this became much more relevant in December, when Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, announced that they were giving 99 percent of their wealth to charity. The total amount they pledged, around $45 billion in Facebook shares at current valuation, exceeds the endowments of the Rockefeller, Ford and Carnegie foundations combined. If Zuckerberg gives away the upper limit of what he announced in December, $1 billion per year for the next three years, he will likely become the world’s second-largest charitable donor after Bill Gates. He is 31 years old.

Give Early, Give Billions 4 of the biggest philanthropic donations came from people under 50. 25 of the biggest philanthropic donations came from people under 50. 2012 2014 Percentage of the biggest philanthropic donations that came from people under 50.

Zuckerberg’s ability to remake the world in his own image, in his own lifetime, is unprecedented. Andrew Carnegie opened his first library when he was 68, and only managed to get around $5 billion in today’s dollars out the door before he died. John D. Rockefeller, generally considered the most generous industrialist in history, launched his foundation when he was 76, and only gave away around half his fortune. If he wanted to, Zuckerberg could eradicate polio, or de-neglect half a dozen tropical diseases, or fix all the water pipes in Flint, or give $9,000 to every single one of the world's refugees. But $45 billion, as a former Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation grantee put it, is ""a 1,000-pound gorilla."" You don't give away that much money without changing the places and institutions and people you give it to, sometimes for the worse. Zuckerberg should already know this. In 2010, he donated $100 million to the Newark Public Schools on a promise from Cory Booker that he could, according to Dale Russakoff's The Prize, ""flip a whole city."" Zuckerberg rode into Newark with the suddenness of a software update. He was determined to end the stalemate between the teachers’ union and the district, establish dozens of new charter schools and close down failing public ones. Oh, and establish a model that could be replicated in urban school districts all over the country. All in just five years. Needless to say, it didn't happen. Up to $20 million of the donation went to consultants, scrappy little MBAs charging $1,000 a day to develop, among other things, an algorithm that assigned thousands of children to new schools. And nobody bothered to ask parents or teachers whether they wanted to be flipped, causing a ton of resentment that ultimately slowed everything down. By 2015, Zuckerberg was touting Newark's charter schools, with 14,000 students, as a success. Meanwhile, its public schools, with 35,000 students, were announcing a budget deficit of $65 million and layoffs of up to 30 percent of their staff. As Antony Bugg-Levine, the CEO of the Nonprofit Finance Fund, told me, the hard part about social change “is that it doesn’t scale like a social network.” I’ve spent the last few months talking to more than 40 researchers, development practitioners, foundation employees and other Silicon Valley philanthropists, asking them about the difficult business of giving money away. They told me about their own Newarks: Promising ideas scaled into oblivion, donations that disappeared into corrupt governments, groupthink disguised as insight. But they also told me about projects that worked, that scaled, that matched the ambitions of the new philanthropy while avoiding its blind spots. And it turns out that some of the best ideas are the ones Zuckerberg is the least likely to hear in Silicon Valley.

Don’t Be Seduced By Technology

Since December I've been studying Zuckerberg’s Facebook posts like a Talmudic scholar, looking for hints of what he's interested in, trying to figure out the investments and bets and mistakes he's going to make. So far he’s light on specifics, mostly speaking in gushy bromides about ""connecting people"" and ""building strong communities."" But if there is one clear, undeniable, overriding theme that emerges, it is this: Zuckerberg believes in the power of technology to transform the world. ""We must build technology to make change,"" he wrote last fall. ""Many institutions invest money in these challenges, but most progress comes from productivity gains through innovation."" He's not wrong. Nearly every social advance in history has technology somewhere near the center of it—the aqueduct, the steam train, the birth control pill. And whenever you start asking people about the life-altering potential of Mark Elliot Zuckerberg and the tech-based philanthropy he represents, the first words you're likely to hear are “The Green Revolution.” In 1975, nearly three out of five people in Asia lived on less than $1 a day. Rains at the wrong time of year meant the difference between starvation and survival. Then, researchers funded by the Ford and Rockefeller foundations created new crops—varieties that grew taller, needed less water and could be planted year-round. Over the next 30 years, this innovation radically improved the lives of hundreds of millions of people. Rice yields spiked by 1,000 percent. Wheat got cheaper, healthier and more abundant. Norman Borlaug, the scientist who developed the new wheat varieties, won the Nobel Prize.

It's understandable to be seduced by this story. America spent more than 100 years going from a poor agrarian society to a rich urban one. Technology, the development agencies and the foundations tell you, has the potential to ""leapfrog"" this process for the next batch of countries, to boost poor communities into the middle class without all the messy slave labor and cholera we went through on the way. But as Kentaro Toyama, a former Gates Foundation consultant and the author of Geek Heresy: Rescuing Social Change from the Cult of Technology, points out, it’s not the development of technology that leads to social change, but the application of it. The Green Revolution, he says, wasn't just a case of ""new crops, big changes."" At the same time the farmers were planting the higher-yield crops, governments were dramatically reforming their agricultural policies. Between 1972 and 1990, Asian countries nearly tripled their investments in agriculture. They provided subsidized loans for farmers to buy fertilizer, trained them in how to plant the new crops and built roads and canals to get their produce to markets. In 1970, only 12 percent of the agricultural land in Bangladesh was irrigated. By 1995, 38 percent of it was. ""Technology,"" Toyama says, ""is the easiest part of any solution."" The hard part is everything that comes afterward. Take car crashes, which kill more people every year than tuberculosis or pulmonary disease. The technology to prevent these deaths—seat belts, motorcycle helmets—is not rocket science. It's just that no one has figured out how to make it appeal to the people who need it, especially in the developing world, where 90 percent of these deaths occur. Sometimes technological solutions aren't up against indifference, but outright resistance. In the ’80s, a global health NGO called PATH got a grant to develop Uniject, a pre-filled, single-use syringe designed for midwives or birth attendants to inject patients in their homes. The syringe was ready in the mid-1990s, but more than 15 years later, it had only been rolled out in one developing country. The others had laws that prohibited anyone but doctors from giving injections. ""Lots of new technologies require policy changes to be effective,"" says Michael Free, the former director of product development for PATH. ""Getting buy-in for that takes a lot longer."" All these snags, though, are too complicated for the clean ""leapfrogging"" narrative you hear from the techno-utopians—and from Zuckerberg himself. ""A few months ago I learned about a farmer in Maharashtra called Ganesh,"" Zuckerberg wrote in an op-ed in the Times of India in December. ""Last year Ganesh started using Free Basics [Facebook's no-cost Internet service for developing countries]. He found weather information to prepare for monsoon season. He looked up commodity prices to get better deals. Now Ganesh is investing in new crops and livestock."" This, too, is tempting to swallow whole. If farmers knew the prices they'd get for their produce, they could choose the market offering the highest price, or plant more profitable crops in the first place. Entire communities could be changed by the simple injection of information. The only published evidence of this effect in the real world, though, is a 2007 study that showed fishermen in Kerala, India, checking prices for their fish before deciding which port to sell them to. These fishermen sell a perishable good. They have to sell it to someone, they have to sell it today and it's the same distance back to the shore regardless of which port they pick. But the typical African or Indian farmer does not live perfectly equidistant from several produce markets. One might take an hour to get to, the other 10. And when farmers in developing countries buy seeds, they are not comparison-shopping between dozens of stores. They have just a few options, and often have to go through village middlemen or loan sharks. ""Even when you have the information,"" Toyama says, ""you're not in a situation where you can get any benefit from it."" Also, when “leapfrogging” happens, it can be less of a jump and more of a step. The Kerala study, which sounds so transformative, only boosted incomes for fishermen by around 8 percent, and reduced the price of fish for consumers by 4 percent. It didn’t turn poor fishermen into white-collar workers, and it didn’t give a broad swath of the population access to more nutritious food. And guess what? That's fine! If there's one piece of advice that emerges from the last 50 years of the tech-for-the-poor hope and disappointment cycle, it is this: Chase the 8 percents. Zuckerberg has interest and expertise in technology, and there's nothing inherently wrong with making bets on gadgets or innovations that have the potential to help the poor. But as he does so, he should acknowledge that the silver-bullet promise of technology only works at changing the world when it's combined with political will and popular demand. Until he finds a way to engineer those (please don't), he should focus on the small ways, at the margins, where technology can improve people's lives, 8 percent at a time.

$45 Billion Isn't That Much Money

In 2001, the Gates Foundation gave PATH and the World Health Organization $70 million, 10 years and a simple objective: Develop a vaccine for meningitis A and make it affordable for every single person who needs it. At the time, meningitis A was concentrated in one part of the world, a stripe across the middle of sub-Saharan Africa known as the ""meningitis belt."" The disease mostly affected children, causing them to die or become paralyzed in minutes. The yearly outbreaks were predictable. Where they would happen, and how severely, were not. Eventually, PATH developed a vaccine that gave patients 15 years of immunity. At a cost of around 50 cents a dose, public health departments in every country in the meningitis belt could afford to procure it at scale. By 2013, less than a decade after an outbreak killed 25,000 people, the meningitis belt had just four reported cases. Marc LaForce headed the team in charge of bringing the vaccine to market. He says it wasn't just the scale of the Gates donation that mattered, but its duration. In those days, most grants were capped at two or three years, with check-ins every six months. Years of work could be wiped away if a donor decided progress was moving too slowly and pulled out. ""If you want to do something major,"" LaForce says, ""you need the ability to go two steps forward, then one step back."" Plus, the Gates team left LaForce alone. Back then, the foundation only employed about a dozen people who worked out of a small office in a residential neighborhood of Seattle. Staffers spent their time making lists of diseases, ranking them by annual fatalities, then calling around to find out which ones were closest to being cured. “We didn’t need to be specialists,” says Gordon Perkin, the foundation’s first director of global health. “We just needed to know which organizations had the judgment and the infrastructure, and we gave them money.” This story doesn't just illustrate the potential of philanthropy. It also demonstrates that how Zuckerberg gives away his money will be just as important as what he gives it to. Because one way to look at his $45 billion is that it's a lot of money. Another way to look at it is that it's about what the United States spends on prisons every six months. Or education every four weeks. Or health care every five days. Even at a scale that large, efficiency matters. It’s shocking just how unusual that early Gates grant was. Most legacy foundations pay consultants millions of dollars to study and re-study problems before they give grants toward solving them. The Ford Foundation spends nearly $1 for every $4 it gives away. In 2013, the Rockefeller Foundation’s largest grant recipient (other than its offshoot, Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors), was Dalberg Global Development Advisors, a consulting firm. “All the work was to provide advice on internal decision-making,” a former Rockefeller employee told me. “To make it seem charitable we'd ask them to write a blog on our website, and that would frequently be the only public or charitable thing to come out of these multimillion-dollar so-called grants.” (In a statement, the Rockefeller Foundation defended its approach, saying that it “has developed a rigorous model on how to determine the problems we support, and ultimately the solutions that we believe will create the most impact.”)

Won't Somebody Please Think of the Consultants? $146.4M What the Ford Foundation spent in 2013 deciding how to give its money away $539.1M What the Ford Foundation gave away

The Gates Foundation, as it's expanded to more than 1,300 employees, has become prone to the same bloat, the same ""expert-itis,"" as a former grantee calls it. ""They hired Ph.D.s in biotech and all they wanted to do was the science that the grantees were doing."" As the staff proliferated, so did the conditions on the donations. The foundation started requiring grantees to keep track of baggage fees and told them they couldn't buy laptops or let their overhead go above 15 percent. ""Grant approval processes went from 48 hours to 48 months,"" the former grantee told me. (The Gates Foundation responded, too: “While each grant agreement is unique, we have policies in place to help ensure that our funds are spent as effectively as possible."") It’s hard to overstate just how un-Silicon Valley all of this is. ""Money is sitting there to make the world a better place, and to dole it out cautiously is antithetical to why it’s there,"" says Freada Kapor Klein, a partner at the Kapor Center for Social Impact, a foundation set up by Mitch Kapor, an early investor in Uber and other unicorns. I heard similar arguments from almost all the tech people I talked to: Zuckerberg shouldn't be afraid to fail; he should approach philanthropy like a venture capitalist, testing out ideas to scale up later on. Bypassing legacy institutions is what Silicon Valley CEOs are good at, right? All those consultants must strike them as the charity equivalent of taxi medallions. Still, running a charity does require fully understanding problems before you try to solve them. ""Move fast and break things"" is a fine mentality for Facebook, where the consequences of a few bad lines of code are mostly limited to a drop in revenue or an exodus of users to Snapchat. Applying the same philosophy to health or education or criminal justice has consequences that can't be shrugged away. In the 1990s, Western donors' emphasis on HIV/AIDS in Africa resulted in chronic under-funding of less-visible conditions like pneumonia, anemia and diarrhea. Zuckerberg's donation in Newark resulted in public schools being closed and some kids having to walk through rough neighborhoods to charter schools far from their homes. And it’s this neglected zone, somewhere between bloat and ""break things,"" where Zuckerberg has the opportunity to do something quietly, unsexily awesome. The U.S. has more than 85,000 foundations and 1.5 million charities. Most major charitable causes, things like curing cancer, regularizing immigration and providing early education, are already covered by dozens of capable—and overlapping—organizations. In its annual survey of philanthropists, Grantmakers for Effective Organizations reported that 80 percent of donors wanted to see more collaboration between their grantees. But only 13 percent were willing to consistently pay for it. The need for coordination is obvious when you look at the scale of the problems that philanthropists want to solve. Again, studying Gates’ early years is instructive. When he decided he wanted to vaccinate hundreds of millions of African kids, he didn't set up an organization that would replace WHO or UNICEF or all the other agencies already handing out vaccines. Instead, he founded something called Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance—a funding pipeline designed to help those agencies work more effectively. Gavi pays pharmaceutical companies to research tropical diseases, it issues ""vaccine bonds"" so poor countries can buy millions of treatments on layaway, it orders medications in such bulk that the cost comes down to pennies. In short, it connects a network of actors who have similar interests—something Zuckerberg knows a thing or two about. So if he really wants to leverage the limited funding he has, Zuckerberg shouldn't think of himself as a venture capitalist. He should think of himself as a mutual fund manager. Find promising organizations, perform due diligence, link them to a portfolio of other agencies doing good work—then give them money and get out of their way. Or, as Patricia Stonesifer, the current CEO of Martha's Table and the former CEO of the Gates Foundation, puts it, “Don’t expect to be the only solution out there.”

Capitalism: The Cause of, and Solution to, All of Life’s Problems

What Zuckerberg actually announced last December wasn't a big fat donation to charity. All he did was establish a limited liability company (LLC) and issue a promise that he would use it for good. Much of the reaction at the time was suspicious, speculating that an LLC was a scheme for Zuckerberg to avoid taxes (which isn't true) or that it would allow him to spend mountains of money without disclosing how he was doing so (which is). But the corporate approach actually makes a lot of sense. Under the standard philanthropic model, billionaires set up a foundation and give it a huge endowment. Every year, the foundation has to give away at least 5 percent of its total value. Meanwhile, the other 95 percent gets invested in blue chip stocks, hedge funds, foreign currencies, whatever will keep the total endowment the same size. That's how foundations like Rockefeller and Ford exist in perpetuity: Do-gooders work on one side of the building finding things to donate to, while bankers work on the other side, making sure there's more to donate next year. Recently, though, donors have started to reject this model. Giving away a trickle of money each year is unlikely to live up to the verbs—transform, reimagine, revolutionize—the new philanthropists use to describe their goals. Besides, why should 95 percent of your money just sit there in hedge funds and Halliburton stock, especially if you think you can do just as much good with the money you invest as the money you give away? ""This idea that philanthropy is only about nonprofits is an outdated model,"" says Paula Goldman, a vice president at the Omidyar Network. Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay, was one of the most prominent tech billionaires to merge his investing and grant-making. The foundation still gives donations, but the LLC provides loans and seed capital and invests in things like solar-powered lighting startups, Brazilian test-prep companies and funds that discover Indian entrepreneurs. Zuckerberg is going even further, giving up on a foundation entirely and putting all of his charity money in a corporate form with no limits on how to spend it. He’s not interested in making his money back. He just wants the flexibility to fund charities or companies or both. Which explains why one of Zuckerberg’s most recent donations wasn’t a donation at all. It was $10 million in seed capital for an education startup called Bridge International Academies, a chain of private elementary schools that wants to deliver education to the world's poorest students. Bridge’s model, which has only been rolled out in Kenya so far, is based on standardization and accountability. Teachers get a centralized curriculum from Bridge experts, then deliver it to kids from an e-reader. Students—and teachers—are tracked in real time, principals notified of everything from attendance rates to busted pipes. The latest class of Bridge students just took their exams. Sixty percent passed, compared to the national average of 49 percent

It's tempting to say capitalism perverts philanthropy, full stop, and advise Zuckerberg to go back and form a foundation. But that's not right either.

The primary appeal of Bridge, especially to investors like Zuckerberg, is the $6 per month it says it charges its students. Operating as a business rather than a charity gives each school an incentive to deliver a decent education and ensures that it’s not going to wither away when development agencies or donors move on to the next idea. But the problem with dispatching private companies to supply basic services is that they replace the public systems already tasked with providing them. Last year, 116 African NGOs signed an open letter to Bridge International Academies and the World Bank, pointing out that $6 per month is in fact a lot of money for a lot of Kenyans. Bridge schools charge extra for uniforms and lunch. Its teachers earn around $90 per month, teaching classes as large as 70 students. Those pass rates 11 percent higher than the national average are great, but the letter also noted that Bridge, with 400 schools, has attracted more than $100 million in international investment. Meanwhile, Kenya's public system, with almost 20,000 schools, has gotten just $88 million. Lucy Bradlow, Bridge's global director of public relations, counters that the majority of Kenyan kids already attend private schools, many of which cost even more than Bridge and provide even less. In public schools, teacher absentee rates are so high that the average kid only gets two hours of instruction per day. She’s right: Bridge is a little bit better than what's already there. But the troubling part about the company isn't the service it provides now, but the one it wants to provide later. Bridge sees itself as a “model,” one that its backers believe can be spread across the entire developing world. It plans to be profitable once it serves 500,000 students. Eventually, it hopes to reach 10 million. Bridge's own marketing materials describe it as “a scalable Academy-in-a-Box solution.” But the history of philanthropy is littered with projects that helped the poor at a small scale, then made them worse off at a larger one. Microfinance started out small, too. The early trials were non-profit, and revenues were invested back into services that would help borrowers pay back their loans. Then, in the late 2000s, responding to donor pressure to be “sustainable,” microlending went private. Citibank, Barclays and Deutsche Bank established microfinance divisions. In 2007, one of the largest microlending banks, Mexico’s Compartamos Banco, even had an IPO, its executives earning millions loaning out money to women and poor farmers and charging interest rates as high as 195 percent. Since most loans were capped at a few hundred dollars, borrowers could only get enough money to set up informal businesses, stuff like selling fruit on the side of the road or giving rides on a scooter. As microloans flooded the market, small-scale services flooded entire economies. In Bangladesh, nearly 25 percent of the population took out a microloan. In Mexico, Compartamos’ customers were taking out new microloans to pay back the ones they already had. By scaling up too fast, microfinance ended up trapping people in the exact cycle—informal work, bottomless debt, low productivity—from which it was designed to free them.

How Microfinance Traps the Poor *As illustrated by someone we’ll call Joey Joey lives in a village. He earns $5 a day working on a farm. He doesn't want to do that anymore. One day, he takes out a microloan for $100. He opens a fruit stand that sells apples for 50 cents each. He sells around 20 a day, so now he’s earning $10. Success! But then the bank starts giving loans to lots of other people in the village, too. Suddenly everyone is selling apples, and Joey has to sell his for 25 cents each to compete. Now, he’s earning $5 a day again. And starting tomorrow, he owes the bank $10 every week to pay off his loan.

It's tempting to stop there, to say capitalism perverts philanthropy, full stop, and advise Zuckerberg to just go back and form a foundation. But that's not right either. One of the most successful private-sector development projects of the last 10 years is M-PESA, the mobile-money system that allows people in Kenya to transfer money via their cell phones. Before the system launched, Kenyans sent money to each other by mail, or by giving envelopes full of cash to bus drivers. Replacing an inefficient, expensive system with a regularized one made everybody better off. That's not as easy to argue, in the long run, about education. So, when Zuckerberg hears pitches from companies seeking to solve the world's problems, he shouldn't ask them if they have a plan to grow, or an ambition to exist in perpetuity. He should ask himself whether he really wants them to replace the systems that already exist, or simply make them better. Because successful companies don't just disrupt other companies—they disrupt economies, governments and the people who depend on them. That's not something that Zuckerberg ever had to worry about, but he has to start.

Go Beyond Giving Directly

In 2009, four grad students came up with an audacious idea: Instead of giving poor people the things we think they need—bags of food, stacks of clothing, a pair of goats—what if we gave them enough money to decide for themselves? They called their charity GiveDirectly, and in 2011 they started doing exactly that. They went to villages in Kenya, found the poorest people living there and transferred $1,000 straight to their cell phones. Later, they came back to ask the villagers what they did with the money. Mostly, it turns out, the villagers spent it on better roofs, better food, paying off debts, starting up businesses. All the stuff the development system used to buy for them—but without any overhead. At first, no one wanted to fund an idea this outlandish. But then, GiveDirectly went to Silicon Valley. Google got in early, awarding the charity its Global Impact Award and dispatching the head of Google.org to sit on GiveDirectly’s board. Since then, GiveDirectly has grown like a Y Combinator startup, its budget ballooning from $700,000 in 2012 to $17.4 million in 2014. In 2013, Chris Hughes, Zuckerberg’s Harvard roommate and Facebook co-founder, hosted a coming-out party for the charity with the heads of Dropbox and General Catalyst Partners. Dustin Moskovitz, Zuckerberg's other Harvard roommate and Facebook co-founder, just handed GiveDirectly $25 million. At five years old, GiveDirectly is the most buzzed-about charity in Silicon Valley. What all this hype ignores, though, is that GiveDirectly's audacious idea has been around for decades. Post-disaster charities have been experimenting with cash transfers since the 1990s. In 2010, when floods deluged one-third of Pakistan, aid workers handed out 1.7 million debit cards pre-loaded with $230. As early as the 1980s, Latin American countries were handing out ""conditional"" cash grants, paying parents to send their kids to school or feed them balanced meals. Even the World Bank, not exactly a laboratory of revolutionary thinking, has poured more than $25 billion into ""social safety nets""—unemployment and pension benefits, basically—in developing countries. ""Welfare"" sounds a lot less “break shit” than transferring money to people via their cell phones, but it is, sorry everybody, the same thing. And that's exactly why Zuckerberg should be excited about giving money directly to poor people: Not because it is a new and revolutionary idea, but because it is an old and effective one—that’s only fulfilling a fraction of its potential. The challenge with direct cash payments, says Owen Barder, the director of Europe for the Center for Global Development, is getting them to all of the people who need them. The places where this strategy has worked well already had functioning banking sectors and national identification systems in place before a disaster struck. In Pakistan, humanitarian agencies used government data to identify the areas with the worst damage, then checked IDs to make sure the debit cards got to the people living there. Most poor countries, though, don't have these pipes laid down. Kenya's Hunger Safety Nets program, which gives cash to people at risk of starvation, took months to establish because payouts were distributed through local agents, whom people didn't trust, or ATMs, which people had never used before. Barder describes a scenario where, 10 minutes after an earthquake hits Nepal, all the people within five miles of the epicenter get $500 on their cell phones. That's a great idea. But it is, he says, a lot harder than it sounds. After the 2005 tsunami, low-caste populations in India were almost entirely excluded from cash transfers because they weren't registered in the national welfare system. In Indonesia, cash transfers were distributed through community leaders who had to come to a central planning center, then travel back to their constituencies with an envelope full of cash. In at least one case, bandits were waiting for them on the bus. The need for modernizing these systems is obvious. In 2009, India launched an ambitious—and largely unheralded—project to issue a 12-digit identification number to all 1.3 billion of its citizens. So far, it has spent around $880 million and registered 970 million people. The numbers are already being used to distribute unemployment checks and disaster relief. But as this effort moves to more remote populations, registering them gets harder. Some farmers have hands so worn the scanners can’t read their fingerprints. Laying down the pipes to get cash transfers to the first 75 percent of a population, the people who have birth certificates and cell phones, is relatively easy. Getting to the last 25 percent, the people one charity could never reach, is technical, slow, expensive and absolutely critical—a perfect project for Zuckerberg.

The allegations came to light on Friday in a report for Science magazine.

According to Science, Jane Willenbring and Deborah Doe are speaking out because they no longer fear retribution.

Willenbring, who is now 40 years old and a tenured associate professor at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, part of the University of California, San Diego, alleges in the complaint to the university that during a 1999 field visit to Beacon Valley, Marchant repeatedly harassed her. He reportedly encouraged her to sleep with his brother, who was also on the expedition; called her a “slut” and a “liar”; and greeted her every morning by saying, “Today I’m going to make you cry.”

“Most days, I would listen to long discussions about how I was a ‘slut’ or a ‘whore,’” Willenbring wrote in the report.

Marchant also allegedly threw rocks at her whenever she urinated, so she would go days without drinking water, later developing a urinary tract infection. Toward the end of the trip he also is alleged to have repeatedly pushed her down an icy slope because she hadn’t cried that day.

Doe, who opted to remain anonymous, reports that she too was victim to Marchant’s harassment in the late 1990s, also on a trek to Antarctica.

She’d initially written a letter of support for Willenbring, but turned that letter into her own formal complaint. “He repeatedly called me a ‘c**t,’ among many other insults ... (bitch being the most common) that were invoked on a daily basis or more ... He would crow that he could say absolutely anything he wanted to because we were ‘in his domain,’” she said, according to Science. Doe also alleges that he threatened to ensure she never got funding if she were to finish her doctorate.

“I distinctly remember standing there, aghast, in my red down jacket and black wind pants, watching my career and life plans dissolve as Dr. Marchant smiled triumphantly at me,” she said.

Hillary Tulley, a high school teacher from Illinois who witnessed Marchant’s behavior during a National Science Foundation-funded program called Teachers Experiencing Antarctica, wrote a letter supporting Willenbring and Doe in which she detailed her own experiences with Marchant.

Marchant apparently refused to take Tulley, who was the only woman on that particular expedition, seriously.

“Talk during [group] meals ... always included relentless, snickering mentions of my advanced age (I was 43), my small breasts, and other failings, always initiated by Marchant,” she wrote. “All my attempts to steer the conversation to science were shut down.”

Letters of support for both Marchant and his accusers have poured in. One of Marchant’s former graduate students who had also traveled with him to Antarctica denies that the allegations align with his character.

“I ... sincere[ly] support ... him as an upstanding and professional individual,” the student wrote in an official letter of support.

But another former graduate student, Adam Lewis, wrote that not standing up for both Willenbring and Tulley is “one of the only real regrets I have in my whole life.” He had witnessed both of them being harassed on their separate expeditions.

“I had the chance to stand up for people,” he wrote. “And I didn’t.”

Sexual harassment is a pervasive issue in academia, with multiple universities like USC and UC Berkeley having settled complaints this year. A 2014 report also showed that scientific research field studies are particularly ripe for harassment ― PLOS ONE, a scientific research journal, conducted a survey that showed 64 percent of respondents had personally experienced sexual harassment while doing field work, and the majority of those people were trainees at the time.

India is still not able to do away with its caste politics as demonstrated by recent attacks on members of lower caste in south-western state of Gujarat during a festival.

Yet Narendra Modi's ruling Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) is making a dramatic effort to woo such lower castes. Three of these are especially important: reviewing social justice schemes, revisiting job reservations, and the sub-categorisation of lower castes.

These measures will eventually deepen India's caste politics and strengthen the caste system – the world's oldest surviving social hierarchy.

In India, society is divided among higher castes, lower castes (known as Other Backward Castes or OBCs, among the socially and ""educationally backward"" sections of Indian society), Scheduled Castes (known as Dalits, formerly ""Untouchables""), and Scheduled Tribes (known as Adivasis).

Today, the BJP is strategically working to win the heart and the vote of millions of lower castes, who make up 41% of the Indian population. However, the BJP's outreach initiatives are not born out of a concern for social justice; they are part of an electoral agenda.

Changing the BJP's image

The BJP's defeat in the 2009 general election proved a turning point for its engagement with lower castes. While still playing the Hindu nationalism card with dominant upper castes, the BJP is now deploying multiple strategies to win over lower castes too.

[T]he BJP's outreach initiatives are not born out of a concern for social justice; they are part of an electoral agenda.

For example, Amit Shah, now the party's president, first highlighted Modi's own lower-caste background in the 2014 election in Uttar Pradesh. Later on, as prime minister, Modi was projected as the champion of lower caste groups. The party's support for a Dalit presidential candidate was internationally hyped. Similarly, a recent cabinet reshuffle brought in more lower-caste leaders to appropriate the ""numerical demographic"" of OBCs for political gain.

The BJP is also making lower caste-friendly gestures in assembly elections campaigns in Gujarat and Karnataka. It highlights its commitment to provide constitutional status to the National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC), a statutory body that works for the welfare of lower castes.

Interestingly, the BJP is also pushing the idea of revisiting the existing system of reservation, which allocates 27% of governmental jobs and seats in educational institutions to lower castes. This the party proposes to do by setting up a committee to sub-categorise these groups into ""backward"", ""extremely backward"" and ""most backward"" classes.

Lower caste identity through history

These are big developments. For decades, most political parties – including the Jana Sangh, which morphed into the BJP in 1980 – played their politics in the usual framework, excluding the lower-caste categories from the power structure of the state.

The notion of ""affirmative action through reservation"" only appeared in the mid-1970s when socialist parties led by politicians Ram Manohar Lohia and Chaudhary Charan Singh started using it to mobilise and consolidate the lower castes as a separate political identity.

The identity of lower castes only began to coalesce in 1955, when the first Backward Classes Commission under Kaka Kalelkar recommended various reservation quotas in technical, professional and government institutions.

Then in 1990, lower-caste mobilisation was galvanised when the Second Backward Classes Commission – popularly known as the Mandal Commission – recommended that 27% of positions in educational institutions and public employment be reserved for OBCs.

This was violently opposed by non-political bodies, including conservative student organisations. Many of these were close to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), an ultra-nationalist ideological group that supports the BJP. In 2006, these student wings fiercely opposed the Congress-led government's decision to implement 27% lower caste job reservations in premier higher educational institutions.

Towards a universal Hindu identity

But now, India's right-wing organisations have made peace with lower-caste aspirations. This has proved electorally rewarding, with the BJP successfully winning a greater share of the OBC vote. A third of the OBCs shifted to the BJP in the 2014 election, and in subsequent state elections.

Strategically, the BJP has focused on dismantling the caste-based parties' monopoly over lower-caste votes. The tactic of painting other parties as corrupt bastions of single-caste politics worked wonders, as did an effort to compress the existing 2,479 lower castes into a smaller unit of individualised caste identity to diminish their collective heft.

The BJP also supported the aspirations of lower castes' leaders through either finance or political alliance, accommodating OBC leaders in the party or ministerial portfolios at local, state and national level.

At the same time, the party is building a network of lower castes cadres in both rural and urban areas, as well as among young people and women. To penetrate the lower castes' social base, the BJP formed an OBC Morcha or ""special wing"" in July 2015.

On the one hand, right-wing Hindu organisations are engaged in the radical Hinduisation of lower castes and Dalits through programmes such as ""Ghar Wapsi"" or ""Home Coming"", rituals of conversion to Hinduism, and running religious, spiritual and service programmes in lower caste areas.

On the other hand, the BJP's core clientele of higher castes are satisfied thanks to the works of its right-wing support organisations. They continue spreading messages they want to hear, such as tactically portraying Muslims as a common enemy.

With many of its much-acclaimed policies failing to deliver, the BJP knows it has to sustain the charisma of Narendra Modi long enough to fight the 2019 legislative elections.

The party's central challenge is to retain its support base while simultaneously supplementing it enough to ensure electoral victories. To do this, it must mobilise the emerging middle-class OBC vote – and it's clearly prepared to do almost whatever it takes.

In a high-spirited interview on the Radio 4 Today programme this morning, Letts said: “It strikes me that there is now this elite which has been preaching equality, but is no more faithful to the idea of equality than the medieval abbots and friars were to the virtues of chastity and poverty.”

He continued: “I’m attacking this big mass of people who are finger-waggers, who are telling hoi polloi how to lead their lives and hoi polloi are fed up.”

Describing the speech as “the wonders of Paul Dacre”, Toynbee levelled that Letts’ boss not only owns a grouse moor, but a large arable farm in Sussex “for which he gets huge amounts of EU funding”.

Matthew Horwood via Getty Images Guardian columnist Polly Toynbee said she and Letts were 'equally la-di-da'

Denying claims that she owns property abroad, she told Letts: “We are equally la-di-da. Quentin, from public school?

“It’s not where you’re from, it’s who you’re for - it’s who you stand for.”

She added: “There’s a whole world in which he [Letts] thinks the establishment is of the left or liberal, which is weird, because for most of our lifetimes, the Tories have been in power.

“They are the captains of industry, they run the commanding house - possibly not of the arts, but of almost everything else.”

Responding to Toynbee’s comments, Letts said later in the interview: “I wish I could pin her to the ground and tickle her under the armpits to make you smile, my dear.”

Patrick Brown, who as a former backbench MP in Stephen Harper's government voted in favour of reopening the abortion debate, has been busy trying to fend off Liberal attacks that he is a thinly disguised social conservative. But Brown says he is pro-choice and more recently has led Pride parade delegations.

'I'm not going to say it's even up for consideration'

""Any policy that attempts to limit a woman's right to choose or the ability of same-sex couples to marry are off limits, period,"" Brown said in an interview with The Canadian Press.

""I'm not going to say it's even up for consideration when I personally could not defend that or support it.""

The move says less about Brown himself and more about his sense of Ontario's political climate and what will get him elected, said Ryerson University political science professor Myer Siemiatycki.

""This is Mr. Brown responding to, I think, where the lay of the land is and public opinion is predominantly settling in Ontario that he can't win an election in Ontario by positioning himself as the candidate of social conservatism,"" Siemiatycki said.

Since becoming party leader in 2015, Brown says he has boosted party membership — it's now at 127,000 members, up from about 10,000 following the 2014 election loss — and believes the vast majority are on board with socially progressive policies.

Earlier: Brown calls Wynne's pot plan a distraction

""Frankly, I think I opened the party up to tens of thousands more who simply want a reasonable, thoughtful...modern, inclusive PC party,"" he said. ""So I'm not worried about a few leaving.""

In another effort to distance himself from social conservative policies, Brown published a video moments before the Liberal government announced legislation to create safe zones around abortion clinics, declaring himself pro-choice and saying he would support the bill. Party ads show clips of Brown repeating one of his often-used lines, that in the PC party ""it doesn't matter who you love.""

Kathleen Wynne has an agenda. That agenda is to re-open debates about divisive social issues. No one wants this. I don't want it. #onpoli pic.twitter.com/A8z8zIV5BJ — Patrick Brown (@brownbarrie) October 4, 2017

Social conservatives inside the party have accused Brown of flip-flopping on the issue of sex education — Brown spoke at an anti-sex-ed rally during the leadership campaign, promised in an email to a supporter that he would repeal the updated curriculum, and later promised in a letter in a 2016 byelection to scrap it, though he later said he was unaware of the letter before it went out.

There will be no sex-ed policy resolutions at the convention either, Brown said in the interview.

Extreme right win 'shoe doesn't fit': Brown

The Liberals are more than eager to remind voters of Brown's inconsistencies on social issues, accusing him last week of ""double speak on abortion rights."" It was just the latest in a long string of attacks that paint him with an extreme right wing brush, while polls show half the province doesn't know who he is — eight months before the provincial election.

The ""shoe doesn't fit,"" Brown said.

""I was a backbench member of a broader team,"" he said of his time in the Harper government. ""Now that I'm the leader of the party I can much (more) clearly speak from my own heart...Rather than criticize the fact that opinions have evolved, we should celebrate it.""

Party members will vote online between Nov. 2 and 6 on 139 resolutions, with results announced at the Nov. 25 convention.

Carbon tax is another policy that will be off limits at the party policy convention.

Carbon tax not up for debate either

Brown has already promised he would dismantle the current cap-and-trade program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and instead implement a carbon tax that would be offset by other tax cuts — to the chagrin of some of the base.

They bristle at the notion with complaints both privately and publicly through blog posts and websites such as Axe the Carbon Tax. A former PC caucus member who was either expelled or resigned cited the carbon tax as a main reason for joining the fringe Trillium Party. But Brown brushes off any suggestion it's a divisive issue.

""I think there's a broader understanding in the party that I staked out some ground that we are going to take climate change seriously, that we are going to support carbon pricing as part of the national framework, that we have to do our part on the environment, but it should not be used as a revenue grab by government,"" he said.",Patrick Brown: Social Conservative Policies 'Off Limits' At Ontario PC Convention,http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2017/10/12/patrick-brown-social-conservative-policies-off-limits-at-ontario-pc-convention_a_23241063/

Stress, anxiety and depression are the three demons of modern times trapping more and more people in their clutches every passing day.
Here are some tried and tested things you can do to help you deal with the monster.
Identify Your TriggersMost episodes of extreme stress, anxiety, and deep depression are set off by a trigger.
According to NCBI, ""Exercise improves mental health by reducing anxiety, depression, and negative mood and by improving self-esteem and cognitive function.""","ADVERTISEMENT

It happens so quietly that you cannot prepare for it, and before you know, you are enveloped in its grip so tight that escape seems impossible. So what does one do? Does one sit in a corner with the head bowed, eyes shut, and arms tightly wrapped, waiting for it to leave, or does one stand up and fight?

Battling with anxiety, stress, and depression can be hard, but it is not impossible. With a little care, awareness, and self-love, you can manage, if not overcome, the constant feeling of despair. How do I know? Well, I do it every day.

Stress, anxiety and depression are the three demons of modern times trapping more and more people in their clutches every passing day. National Institute of Mental Health describes depression as ""a common but serious mood disorder that causes severe symptoms that affect how you feel, think, and handle daily activities, such as sleeping, eating, or working"". According to a WHO report, almost 36% of people in India suffer from some form of depression, most of them young and at the peak of their lives.

Here are some tried and tested things you can do to help you deal with the monster.

1. Accept

Acceptance is the beginning of healing. You can, of course, wallow in self-pity, or you can take it in your stride and move ahead. Mental disturbances are quite similar to physical disorders. They are often caused by chemical imbalance in the brain or external triggers just like physical disorders, and just like any physical disorder, they can happen to any of us--some are affected more than the others, and some deal with them better than others. Accepting it makes a whole lot of difference. So breathe deep, smile wide, and embrace yourself wholeheartedly.

2. Share

Having someone who understands makes a lot of difference. If you are not comfortable sharing your feelings with immediate family, spouse, or even close friends, reach out to a support group. There are numerous mental well-being communities worldwide that extend help and support. Look them up online, connect with them on social media, or be an active physical member, the choice is yours. Knowing you are not alone always makes you feel better and more confident.

3. Identify Your Triggers

Most episodes of extreme stress, anxiety, and deep depression are set off by a trigger. The trigger could be an intangible feeling or fear, or a more concrete situation. Is it fatigue or feeling out of control that does it for you? Or is it coming face to face with an unpleasant situation or person that sets you off? Recognizing what triggers the discomfort and despair helps not only dealing with them better but also preventing the feeling to a large extent.

It feels good when people understand you. Or at least try to. When they trust you and believe you. When instead of doling out advice, they listen. Sometimes all you need is someone to talk to without the fear of judgment.

4. Pursue A Hobby

Doing what you love doing is a great and easy way to feel good. Investing time in yourself is proven to make you feel more positive and happier. Recall a long forgotten passion and revive it. Music, arts, dancing, gardening, philately, travel, writing, poetry, pottery--any of these activities will help you heal and feel positive. Join online and offline communities and connect with people who share your love. Creating something new, even as an amateur, gives you a feeling of accomplishment which goes a long way in ensuring metal well being.

5. Walk. Run. Work-out.

Picking yourself up and stepping out for a run is the last thing you'd want to do on a bad day, but trust me, once you have overcome that hurdle, rest will be much easier. Studies have shown that physical activity helps the body produce endorphins, hormones that promote the feeling of happiness and euphoria. According to NCBI, ""Exercise improves mental health by reducing anxiety, depression, and negative mood and by improving self-esteem and cognitive function."" If running or working out seems impossible, just step out for a walk in the park--looking at the green grass and blue sky will do you more good that you can imagine.

6. Love Yourself. Unconditionally.

We live in times where loving ourselves is not the simplest thing to do. The perfection portrayed in the media, films, and social media makes it even more difficult to appreciate our imperfections and flaws. The trick is to understand that what is portrayed is not always complete and that perfection may not always be possible. Knowing our limitations and capabilities helps us appreciate the flaws in others too. Love yourself unconditionally no matter what, and the rest will follow.

Note: While these are ways and methods to manage your condition, the importance of professional help cannot, and should not, be ruled out. Seeking medical attention or advice from mental health practitioners--counsellors, psychiatrist, phycologists--is essential to ensure you feel and perform at your best.

Claire Perry said that cutting stamp duty, which would save buyers thousands of pounds, was one option being looked at as part of the drive to help the UK reduce carbon emissions.

Perry spoke as the long-awaited ‘Clean Growth Strategy’ was published on Thursday, with a pledge to set Britain “on a path to a low carbon future”.

The strategy includes a new target to get all homes upgraded to “Energy Performance Certificate Band C” – often by installing insulation and other measures - by 2035.

An alliance of energy think tanks, campaigners and companies recently called for stamp duty rebates for homes that had been upgraded.

Asked if the idea of stamp duty cuts was being considered to boost the number of low-carbon homes, the minister told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “Yes it is, and that would be one of the incentives to do it.

“It’s more likely that a home where insulation has been put in would attract a higher value. In order to meet our targets on carbon emissions…we are looking at a whole series of measures.”

PA Wire/PA Images Loft insulators

At present, stamp duty of 2% is levied on homes between £125,001 and £250,000, and 5% on homes between £250,000 and £925,000. For many homes in the second bracket, tens of thousands of pounds would be cut from sales costs.

Perry added that she wanted to change building regulations and use “carrots and sticks”. She said: “In the worst energy efficient homes we are expecting landlords to upgrade those.”

Fresh support for ‘green finance’ would be provided, with the public not penalised through their mortgage for making home improvements.

Perry said that insulated homes in Band C on average saved £300 a year on energy bill, adding that “we’ve tried for years and years to get people” to insulate and it was time “to be much more innovative”.

HuffPost-Autor Sebastian Christ schreibt, warum er Air Berlin vermissen wird

Liebe Air Berlin!

Meine Facebook-Timeline ist voll mit Abschiedspostings. Es ist die Zeit der letzten Air-Berlin-Flüge. Ich finde es rührend, was da zu lesen ist: Viele meiner Freunde sprechen dem Personal ein letztes Mal Mut zu und wünschen ihnen alles Gute für den Weg in eine ungewisse Zukunft.

Jetzt, da eine Ära vorbei geht, scheint das geschäftige Treiben an den Flughäfen dieser Republik, zwischen Rollkoffern und Businessanzügen, plötzlich menschliche Züge zu bekommen. Das ist ein gutes Zeichen.

Andere schreiben wehmütig über den Geschmack der Schokoherzchen, die es früher beim Aussteigen gab. Zugegeben, ich fand die Teile auch lecker. Aber sie sind so ziemlich das Unwichtigste, was ich an Air Berlin vermissen werde.

Früher war Fliegen noch außergewöhnlich

Seit Donnerstag ist klar, dass Air Berlin größtenteils von der Lufthansa übernommen wird. Damit dürfte sich der Flugverkehr, so wie wir ihn kennen, radikal ändern. Jeder, der das Fliegen noch in den 1990er-Jahren erlebt hat, dürfte da eine Vorahnung haben.

Ich habe meinen ersten Flug in einem Linienjet erst mit 22 Jahren machen können. Dabei hatte ich weder Flugangst noch war ich jemand, der keine Lust aufs Reisen hatte. Ich konnte mir es schlicht und einfach nicht leisten, für mittlere Strecken ein Flugticket zu erwerben.

Bis vor etwa 20 Jahren war Fliegen etwas Besonderes, wenn es um innerdeutsche Strecken ging. Preise von 600 oder 800 Mark für ein Flugticket von Hamburg nach München waren damals nichts Außergewöhnliches, sondern eher etwas ganz Normales.

Das war etwas für Geschäftsreisende, deren Firmen bereit waren, teures Geld dafür zu bezahlen, um fähige Fachkräfte von A nach B zu transportieren. Aber kein echtes Konkurrenzangebot für die Bahn, die damals noch staatlich-gemächlich durch Deutschland zockelte.

Das Aufkommen preisgünstiger Flugangebote hat vieles verändert: bisweilen sogar die Infrastruktur unserer Städte. Vor allem aber die Art und Weise, wie wir reisen.

Du warst bei allem der Dreh- und Angelpunkt

Es ist heute kein Problem mehr, morgens in Stuttgart und nachmittags in Hamburg zu sein. Es gibt heute sogar Studenten, die Fernbeziehungen per Flugzeug führen – weil man es sich leisten kann, am Freitagmorgen von Berlin nach Köln zu fliegen, und am Sonntagnachmittag wieder zurück. Vorausgesetzt, man bucht rechtzeitig.

Und Du, Air Berlin, warst bei allem der Dreh- und Angelpunkt. Wahrscheinlich beschäftigt Dein Niedergang auch deswegen so viele Menschen: Wenn die Lufthansa für die Fernreisenden ein Stück Alltagskultur geworden war, warst Du es für die Kurz- und Mittelstrecken.

Und wenn wir schon über die Lufthansa sprechen: Genau da fängt das Problem an. Außer Germanwings und Eurowings gibt es sonst auf dem deutschen Markt keine größeren Billigfluganbieter mehr. Beide Gesellschaften gehören zu Lufthansa. Und die schluckt jetzt eben auch noch Air Berlin.

Um das ganze mal mit Fakten zu illustrieren: Im Juni 2017 belegten die nunmehr vier Fluglinien der Lufthansa die Plätze eins bis vier nach Abflugzahlen in Deutschland. Gut 46.200 Flüge gehen auf das Konto des Lufthansa-Imperiums. Auf Platz fünf folgt dann Ryanair mit 4.600 Abflügen.

Man muss kein Wirtschaftswissenschaftler sein, um an dieser Stelle eine Gefahr für den Wettbewerb zu sehen.

Uns droht eine Saure-Gurken-Zeit

Billigflüge könnten künftig wieder zu etwas werden, was in der Nische stattfindet. Zumindest hätte die Lufthansa die nötige Marktmacht, um das durchzusetzen.

Das hätte nicht nur Folgen für den Flugverkehr.

Denn auch die Bahn hat sich unter dem zunehmenden Druck von Seiten des Flugverkehrs in den vergangenen 20 Jahren zusehends modernisiert. In einigen Wochen zum Beispiel wird die Strecke von Berlin nach München für den Personenverkehr freigegeben: Dann wird man in vier Stunden von der Hauptstadt nach Süddeutschland fahren können.

Solche Trassen werden nicht gebaut, um den Bussen Konkurrenz machen zu können. Sondern, weil die Bahn gegen den Flugverkehr ankommen will. Vier Stunden – das ist durchaus eine wettbewerbsfähige Fahrtzeit. Leider bietet die Bahn viel zu wenige dieser Verbindungen an.

Im Gegensatz zu Frankreich übrigens. Dort war es offensichtlich möglich, ein Hochgeschwindigkeitsnetz für die Schiene aufzubauen. In Deutschland droht uns nach dem Wegfall der Konkurrenz aus der Luft eine neue Saure-Gurken-Zeit.

Auch deswegen werde ich Dich vermissen, Air Berlin. Es geht nicht um die Schokoherzen – sondern darum, einem bisweilen recht schwerfälligen Land den Mut zur Veränderung schmackhaft zu machen. Doch leider könnten wir uns bald schon wieder in Reisewelten befinden, die ein wenig streng nach den 90er-Jahren müffeln.

For the first time since undergoing bypass heart surgery, he's spoken about the importance of living in the moment and how the idea of being a man means talking about feelings and mental health.

The 57-year-old comedian spoke to Adam Garone, the co-founder of the Movember Foundation, in a podcast interview and revealed how he has learnt throughout his career to recognise his triggers for poor mental health.

""When I was younger, I had issues with depression. It wasn't until my 30s that I actually got a diagnosis or even understood what it was,"" he said.

""There was no real conversation about it. So what I do for my mental health -- what I know now having been through that more than once -- I recognise the triggers and I recognise what puts me back into that position. So, I act on that.

""The triggers are generally if I completely overstress myself and get very run down, that can lead to that depressive sense.""

As a result of his triple bypass heart surgery, Denton -- who is also a director of the assisted dying advocacy group Go Gentle Australia -- was forced to step aside in recent months from that organisation and media responsibilities.

Denton began Go Gentle in 2016 after seeing his father, prominent Australia broadcaster, writer and author of 'Breaker Morant' Kit Denton, die slowly and painfully two decades prior from heart failure.

Denton had made it his life's work to lobby for law reform for terminally ill people. And while that brought about a particular level of mental stress, he told Garone that he finds value for his own mental health in ""the elemental business of being alive"".

""When I was going through very depressive times, one of the things that enabled me to keep stepping forward was to reminding myself of—and this sounds very Hallmark greeting card—but literally of the beauty of a sunset or literally the amazingness of a flower,"" he said.

""Think, whatever other s--t is happening in the world, how extraordinary to, for however long I'm alive, to be able to experience these miraculous things. That's what I mean about the elemental business of being alive.

""Whether there's a God or not, I don't know. We are a part of the universe, a series of atoms that's coalesced for some reason into this conscious being, and we have the opportunity to experience the amazingness of the physical world.""

In the podcast, the television personality also spoke about his father's influence on him when it comes to thinking about masculinity and how he can convey that to his own son, Connor.

And the thing that stood out the most for him? That men from his father's generation simply didn't talk about mental health issues and males from his son's generation are much happier to dive into conversations about feelings.

""I think my dad being of his generation from England, he wasn't raised in a tradition of sharing your feelings. I think intellectually he knew how to do that,"" he said.

""But I would say that men today -- not across the board -- are much better at having that conversation... than my dad's generation was.

""It's still an issue and it's been great in recent years to see footballers, for example, who are strong masculine role models, start to talk openly about the kind of problems they have. One of the reasons I'm very proud of my son is that I have seen from a young age he's deeply empathetic to his friends and offers himself to be there.""

Andrew Denton said modelling might be his next career move -- at least he has the pose on point.

As for his next step into the future, he told Garone that he's looking forward to enjoying life -- even fitting in time for a quick laugh about his possible next career move.

""Look, I always transition [in his career], but for me I have a philosophy that life is the career, not the other way around,"" he said.

""In fact, when this is done, I'm really looking forward to stepping back out of the square.

""I think male modelling is my next step.""

Vor drei Jahren half ihr das FBI, der schrecklichen Situation zu entkommen

Jetzt will sie mit einem gemeinnützigen Projekt dafür sorge, dass andere Mädchen nicht Dasselbe durchmachen müssen

Vielen erschien Emmy Myers in der High School wie die Vorzeige-Schülerin schlechthin. Sie turnte, machte Leichtathletik und war in der Landwirtschafts-AG.

Doch ihr Leben nahm eine dunkle Wende - sie wurde drogensüchtig und Opfer von Sex-Handel.

Heute will die 28-Jährige aus Wisconsin andere Menschen darauf aufmerksam machen, dass dieses Schicksal jeden ereilen kann - und dass die Menschen, die Frauen und Mädchen kaufen, aus jeder sozialen Schicht kommen können.

""Das passiert nicht nur in Filmen, sondern auch normalen Menschen im echten Leben"", sagte Myers der HuffPost.

Menschenhandel nimmt in den USA stark zu. 2016 stiegen die Fälle im Vergleich zum Vorjahr laut der National Human Trafficking Hotline um 35,6 Prozent an.

Die Opfer werden gezwungen, körperliche Arbeit zu verrichten oder gegen ihren Willen mit Fremden Sex zu haben.

Armut und Arbeitslosigkeit helfen dem Menschen-Handel

Dass der Menschenhandel ansteigt, hat laut Experten mehrere Gründe. Jarrett Luckett, Geschäftsfüher der Organisation Exploit No More, sieht vor allem Armut und Drogenkonsum als Faktoren an.

Exploit No More unterstützt Menschen, die Opfer von Sex-Handel wurden. Luckett arbeitet gemeinsam mit Myers daran, über Sex-Handel in den Städten aufzuklären und auf die Gefahr aufmerksam zu machen.

""Armut und Drogen machen die Opfer anfälliger, in die Falle des Sex-Handels zu tappen"", sagte Luckett der HuffPost.

Diese beiden Probleme sind daran schuld, dass Myers Geburtsstadt Milwaukee zu einem Knotenpunkt für Menschenhandel geworden ist.

Milwaukee ist ein perfekter Ort für die Händler. Sie können ihre Opfer an viele größere Städte in der Nähe transportieren - etwa nach Chicago und Madison. Weit verbreiteter Heroinmissbrauch und die hohe Arbeitslosenrate in Milwaukee helfen den Händlern, ihre Opfer zu ködern.

Sex-Handel hat sich in Milwaukee so weit verbreitet, dass die Stadt auch ""Harvard der Zuhälter"" genannt wird.

Jeder kann zum Opfer werden

Myers Geschichte zeigt, dass Händler aber auch Erfolg haben können, wenn die Opfer aus einer guten Familie kommen. Sie wuchs als das aufgeweckte, fröhliche Kind auf, das sich alle Eltern wünschen.

In der Zeit zwischen ihrem dritten und sechsten Lebensjahr aber wurde sie von einem Freund der Familie mehrfach missbraucht. Einen Großteil ihrer Kindheit über machte sie sich Vorwürfe.

Myers wurde mehrfach verhaftet. Sie hat ein Strafregister, aber keine Einstufung als Schwerverbrecherin. (Foto: Emmy Myers)

Sie glaubte, sie sei selbst daran schuld, dass er sich immer wieder an ihr verging. Die Zweifel seien so stark geworden, dass sie angefangen habe, Drogen zu nehmen, sagt Myers. Und irgendwann sei sie einem manipulativen Menschenhändler in die Hände gefallen.

Ihre ersten Erfahrungen mit Drogen habe sie in der High School gemacht, erzählt sie. In ihrem letzten Jahr an der Schule wurde das Geld knapp und sie begann zu strippen, um ihre Sucht zu finanzieren. Nach der High School steig sie auf Heroin um und war zwei Mal in einer Entzugsklinik - das alles geschah, bevor sie 20 Jahre alt war.

Mit 24 versuchte sie erneut, clean zu werden und zog ausgerechnet mit ihrem gewalttätigen Drogendealer zusammen. Er wusste von ihrer Situation und bot ihr an, sie unter seine Obhut zu nehmen und sich um sie zu kümmern. Er stellte ihr eine Wohnung zur Verfügung und versorgte sie mit Kleidung und Essen.

Myers konnte sich nicht wehren

Dass er plante, sie für Sex zu verkaufen, ahnte sie nicht. Er erstellte eine Werbeanzeige auf Backpage.com, einer Seite, die Produkte und Dienstleistungen anbietet. (Dieses Jahr musste die Firma ihren Bereich für Erwachsenen-Werbung schließen, da sie wegen Unterstützung von Prostitution und Menschen-Handel unter Verdacht steht.)

""Ich hätte niemals gedacht, dass ich mich jemals verkaufen würde"", sagt Myers. ""Aber als ich an diesem Punkt angelangt war, gab es keine Ausweg mehr"", sagt Myers. ""Zuhälter wissen, was sie tun. Sie geben vor, dich zu lieben. Sie finden heraus, wie du tickst und wovor du am meisten Angst hast.""

➨ Mehr zum Thema: ""Gewalt gegen Frauen ist eben unsere Kultur"" - ich setzte mich weltweit für Frauenrechte ein, diese Ausrede kann ich nicht mehr hören

Als Myers sich wehrte, drohte ihr der Dealer. Er sagte, wenn sie nicht einwillige, würde er ihre Neffen töten. Er konfiszierte ihren Personalausweis und nahm ihr das wenige Geld, das sie noch hatte.

Ihr Zuhälter und seine Freundin brachten Myers zu Hotels in verschiedenen Städten. Dort musste sie sich schon um 6.30 Uhr mit Männern treffen, bevor diese zu ihren Meetings gingen. Bis spät in die Nacht musste sie mit den Klienten Sex haben. Damit sie sich nicht wehren konnte, verabreichte der Dealer ihr permanent Drogen.

""Es sind häufig die Männer, die in ihrem Umfeld anerkannt sind""

Gewissermaßen hatte sie ""Glück"" - keiner der Männer, mit denen sie schlafen musste, war ihr gegenüber gewalttätig. Viele von ihnen waren erfolgreiche Geschäftsmänner. Viele von ihnen hatten Familie.

""Das überrascht viele Menschen am meisten"", sagt Myers. ""Es sind nicht immer die großen, fetten, ekligen Typen. Es sind häufig die Männer, die in ihrem Umfeld anerkannt sind.""

Einen Monat später wurde Myers in Milwaukee verhaftet - für eine Sache, die nichts mit Sex-Handel oder Prostitution zu tun hatte. Die Anzeige gegen sie machte das FBI auf sie aufmerksam. Die Ermittler boten an, ihr zu helfen und sie aus dieser Situation zu befreien.

2013 musste sie für etwa einen Monat ins Gefängnis und ging danach erneut in eine Entziehungsklinik - zum dritten Mal. Nachdem sie wieder draußen war, fiel sie erneut für kurze Zeit dem Sexhandel zum Opfer.

Heute will die 28-Jährige darauf aufmerksam machen, dass jeder Opfer von Sex-Handel werden kann. (Foto: Emmy Myers)

Ein halbes Jahr später war sie wieder im Gefängnis - dieses Mal für sieben Monate. In dieser Zeit durfte sie arbeiten gehen (Anm. d. Red.: In den USA gibt es Integrations-Programme für Insassen. Sie können an ihren Arbeitsplatz zurückkehren, werden aber streng überwacht. Nach ihrer Schicht müssen sie zurück ins Gefängnis.).

Nach dieser Zeit im Gefängnis zog Myers für zwei Monate in eine soziale Einrichtung für Gewaltopfer. Mit Hilfe eines Übergangsprogramms fand sie eine eigene Wohnung.

Die Aufklärung in den großen Städten ist wichtig

Heute hat Myers seit drei Jahren keine Drogen mehr genommen. Sie hat ein Strafregister, ist aber nicht als Schwerverbrecherin eingestuft - zu ihrem großen Glück.

Viele, die in Amerika Opfer von Sex-Handel geworden sind, haben Prostitutions-Vorwürfe in ihrem Register stehen - und das, obwohl sie dazu gezwungen wurden.

Sie haben keine Möglichkeiten, ihre Register löschen zu lassen. Das bedeutet: Für sie ist es beinahe unmöglich, eine Arbeit oder eine Wohnung zu finden.

Derzeit arbeitet Myers als Pflegerin in einem Altersheim. Zusätzlich engagiert sie sich für ihr gemeinnütziges Projekt, mit dem sie Fälle von Sex-Handel verhindern will.

Sie erzählt ihre Geschichte in Schulen, Kirchen und anderen Gemeindeeinrichtungen. Sie klärt Ärzte, Schüler, Studenten, Eltern und Ordnungsämter auf, spricht über die Realität des Sex-Handels und erklärt, wie man ein solches Schicksal verhindern kann.

Ärzten erklärt sie beispielsweise, dass sie auf blaue Flecken an sonderbaren Stellen achten sollen und dass mehrfache Fehlgeburten sie ebenso stutzig machen sollten wie Patienten, die nicht wissen, wie viele Geschlechtspartner sie hatten oder die nicht genau angeben können, wo sie wohnen.

Diese Aufklärung sei entscheidend, um den Sex-Handel aufzuhalten, bestätigt Luckett.

""Diese präventive Arbeit ist wichtig, damit andere Menschen nicht in 'dieses Leben' abrutschen - sie sollen nicht auch noch durch diese Hölle gehen"", sagt er. ""Es lässt sich nicht pauschal sagen, wie ein Menschen-Händler aussieht - oder wie ein Opfer aussieht. Das macht es besonders schwer. Aber es gibt Zeichen, die einen davor warnen.""

Like Dylan, Ishiguro is well-known in America (though, unlike Dylan, he’s not American).
But the notoriety of Dylan’s choice could not be overwritten save with a similarly familiar, but distinctly literary, choice.
Ishiguro instead broadcasts three things: The Nobel cares about literature, the Nobel is relevant and the Nobel makes its own decisions, thanks very much.","On Thursday, British author Kazuo Ishiguro was revealed as the winner of the 2017 Nobel Prize in Literature. Best known for his novels Remains of the Day and Never Let Me Go, he’s famed for his restrained, subtle prose and his finely crafted explorations of individual and cultural emotion, survival and memory.

His Nobel win was received warmly, at least in English-reading circles, with fellow literary lights like Salman Rushdie offering praise for his oeuvre and readers sharing their personal love for his novels. Neil Gaiman praised Ishiguro as a “a wonderful writer, a terrific person,” and Joyce Carol Oates tweeted admiringly about his “beautiful melancholy work.”

It’s a stark contrast from one year ago. On Oct. 13, 2016, the Nobel Committee outraged much of the literary world by announcing Bob Dylan ― singer, songwriter, and (we suppose) poet ― as that year’s winner of the prize in Literature.

My feelings on the literature #NobelPrize can be summed up by the 🙄emoji.

You know what really needs to be celebrated more in our culture? Massively popular music! — Lincoln Michel (@TheLincoln) October 13, 2016

Many critiqued the Nobel Committee, suggesting it had basically dislocated its shoulder in an attempt to reach out to a broader, less literary audience. Others suggested that it was a deliberate snub to buzzed-about American authors like Philip Roth; with the last American honoree coming in 2016, it will likely be a good stretch before we get another. The choice of Dylan changed the scope of what would now qualify for consideration, possibly in a negative way; worse, the Nobel Committee seemed to be signaling a shift toward headline-grabbing popularity contests.

But now, all seems to be forgiven, maybe even forgotten, in the joyous haze of Ishiguro’s win. The Nobel Committee could hardly have selected a better writer to wash away the embarrassing awkwardness of last year’s prize. Like Dylan, Ishiguro is well-known in America (though, unlike Dylan, he’s not American). The Nobel encompasses the whole world of literature, and therefore often goes to authors and poets little-known by American readers (and indeed the Nobel Committee has been prickly in the past about the solipsism of American readers). But the notoriety of Dylan’s choice could not be overwritten save with a similarly familiar, but distinctly literary, choice. Ishiguro, whose work has been translated into over 40 languages and has inspired major film adaptations, provides exactly that.

Still, Ishiguro was a reminder that the Nobel is not a popularity trophy. Though Dylan’s choice was a surprise, he was a perennial favorite in odds-making, much like Japanese novelist Haruki Murakami, largely thanks to fervent fan support. This year they passed over odds-on favorites like Margaret Atwood, Murakami and Kenyan writer Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o to name a dark horse winner. Ishiguro, who was born in Nagasaki and has spent most of his life in England, rarely featured in odds-making or speculation about the next Nobel winner. In a comprehensive, if tongue-in-cheek, New Republic primer, Alex Shepard ran through dozens of possible choices ― some obscure, some famous ― but Ishiguro didn’t rate a mention. Then again, he concluded, “if the Nobel Committee ever picks a writer not on the Ladbrokes list, it’s going to be this year.”

Ishiguro perfectly threads the needle ― he’s an unexpected choice, but not an unfamiliar one, and his reputation as a literary craftsman is well-established. While Murakami or Atwood might have been a crowd-pleaser, especially in our current surreal political moment, it would have risked looking like more pandering. A relatively obscure author, at least to American eyes, would certainly have signaled the Nobel Committee’s continued dedication to craft over clout. Ishiguro instead broadcasts three things: The Nobel cares about literature, the Nobel is relevant and the Nobel makes its own decisions, thanks very much.

Though there are always naysayers, so far Ishiguro’s Nobel has been greeted with enthusiasm and even relief by many in the literary community. Part of the joy is that many British and American critics are familiar with his work and are eager to write effusively about him. The flip side of this excitement, of course, is that the Nobel has the potential to draw new audiences to less widely known authors. In 2014, the English-speaking world was fairly baffled by the Nobel going to popular French novelist Patrick Modiano, but his award boosted his profile and raised demand for English translations of his work.","A Year After Bob Dylan, Kazuo Ishiguro Gets The Nobel Back On Track",http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kazuo-ishiguro-is-not-bob-dylan_us_59d63c35e4b0380b6c9aa121

But the reality is fibre intake is just as important, with the nutrient boasting a huge range of amazing benefits.

If you're not a fan of prunes (sorry grandma), don't worry -- there are many other ways to get your daily intake of fibre. And it's easy.

Let's look at what fibre is in the first place and what role it plays in the body.

What is fibre and why do we need it?

""Fibre is the part of plant foods, such as vegetables, fruits, grains and legumes, which doesn't get digested,"" accredited practising dietitian Chloe McLeod told HuffPost Australia. ""It's a type of carbohydrate which helps to keep our digestive system healthy.""

There are a few different types of fibre and it's important we get a variety of all of them.

Soluble fibre

""There is soluble fibre which helps to slow down how fast food is emptied from our stomach. This helps us to feel more full, to reduce cholesterol and stabilise blood sugar levels,"" McLeod said.

""Sources of soluble fibre include fruit, vegetables, oats, barley and legumes.""

Variety is key when it comes to fibre.

Insoluble fibre

Then there's insoluble fibre which absorbs water and helps to soften the contents of our bowels.

""This helps with regular bowel movements occurring, helps us again feel full and keeps our bowels healthy in general. Insoluble fibre is found in foods like nuts, seeds, whole grains and the skins of fruits and vegetables,"" McLeod said.

Resistant starch

""The last type of fibre is resistant starch. This isn't digested -- instead it proceeds along to the large intestine. This feeds the healthy bacteria that are found in our large intestine, so it really helps with improving our gut health,"" McLeod said.

""Resistant starch is found in bananas, cooked and cooled potato, cooked and cooled pasta or rice, nuts, seeds and other grains.""

The benefits of consuming enough fibre: Makes it easier to pass healthy, regular bowel motions

Helps digestive and overall health

Helps keep us more satisfied after meals

Helps with weight management

""Aside from helping with our digestive health, fibre helps improve both cholesterol and blood sugar levels (which can help with preventing things like heart disease and diabetes),"" McLeod said. ""Eating enough fibre is also really important for prevention of bowel cancer.""

On the flip side, if we don't consume enough fibre often we begin to notice changes in our bowel motions.

""You might feel sluggish or have trouble concentrating, find it difficult to go to the bathroom, feel bloated, and you might notice a change in what your bowel movement look like -- most likely stool will be much harder and difficult to pass.""

How much fibre do we need per day?

""The average adult needs about 30 grams of fibre a day,"" McLeod said.

""Some people with certain bowel or health conditions may require a bit less, but this isn't often. If we can get around 30 grams a day we're doing pretty well.

""Some people might find they feel a bit bloated or uncomfortable if they're suddenly increasing their fibre intake, but if you slowly work up to having more fibre there shouldn't be any problems.""

If you're wondering how to tell if you're meeting the recommended daily intake of fibre, you can read the nutrition information panel, calculate the fibre content in food using an app, or just stick to a healthy, balanced diet.

""You can calculate fibre in foods using apps like Easy Diet Diary or Calorie King. Essentially, though, if you're eating your five serves of vegetables, two serves of fruit and whole grains spread across the day, then you are going to easily get enough fibre -- and even easily exceed the 30 grams,"" McLeod said.

Die Ratten werden darauf trainiert, den Sprengstoff in den Minen aufzuspüren. Die Minen können dann entschärft werden.

Die Ratten sind zu leicht, um eine Explosion auszulösen

Eine Ratte benötigt eine halbe Stunde, um ein Feld in der Größe eines Tennisplatzes auf Minen abzusuchen. Mit einem Metalldetektor würde man für die gleiche Fläche vier Tage brauchen, um den Bereich auf Minen abzusuchen. Da die Ratten so leicht sind, explodieren die Minen nicht, wenn sie die Tiere entdecken.

Bis heute hat die Organisation in sechs Ländern über 21 Millionen Quadratmeter Land von Minen befreit und für sicher erklärt.

Dabei konnten die Mitarbeiter 100.000 Landminen zerstören und so 900.000 Menschen helfen, ihr Land wieder produktiv zu nutzen. Übrigens können die Tiere auch am Geruch feststellen, ob ein Mensch an Tuberkolose erkrankt ist.

LOS MOTIVOS

El más polémico de los argumentos de Trump es que supuestamente este organismo no es justo con Israel, uno de sus mayores aliados mundiales. Washington ya había suspendido sus pagos a la UNESCO sencillamente porque dio cabida en la institución a Palestina, reconocida cono estado observador (no miembro) de la ONU en noviembre de 2012, por abrumadora mayoría de la asamblea.

En mayo pasado, Israel también retiró un millón de dólares de sus donaciones a la ONU, con el aplauso de EEUU, enfadado por una resolución de la UNESCO que condenaba las actividades de Israel en Jerusalén Este, ocupada desde 1967 y reclamada por los palestinos como capital de su Estado, y el impacto del bloqueo que el país impone sobre la Franja de Gaza desde hace diez años. Era especialmente dura con los efectos sobre la ciudad vieja de Jerusalén.

En agosto, el primer ministro israelí, Benjamín Netanyahu, trasladó a Antonio Guterres, secretario general de las Naciones Unidas, su convicción de que su país es tratado injustamente en el foro internacional. ""No hay duda de que hemos tenido una relación problemática con la ONU. Creo que tiene una obsesión absurda con Israel, con tácticas flagrantemente discriminatorias"", le dijo en Jerusalén. La queja fue muy aplaudida por los diplomáticos de EEUU en el país.

Los medios israelíes ven tras este paso la mano de Jared Kushner, el yerno y mano derecha del presidente de Estados Unidos, judío y con numerosos intereses personales y empresariales en Israel.

""PÉRDIDA PARA EL MULTILATERALISMO""

La directora general de la Unesco, Irina Bokova, dijo hoy que la decisión de Estados Unidos, después de haber suspendido ya en 2011 el pago de sus contribuciones, es una ""pérdida para el multilateralismo y para la familia de Naciones Unidas"".

La responsable de la organización de la ONU para la Educación, la Cultura y la Ciencia confirmó en un comunicado que el secretario de Estado de EEUU, Rex Tillerson, le ha notificado oficialmente esa decisión, que ella ""lamenta profundamente"".

Climate change is happening. In recent years average temperatures across the globe have increased, with significant impact on humanity's most precious resource, the environment. Water systems are being stressed. Food sources are being imperilled. And areas once safe for settlement are being threatened and erased.

The implications for human health are many. Climate change increases the frequency and severity of extreme weather events such as cyclones and floods, exacerbating almost all public health risks, from foodborne disease to malnutrition and heatstroke. It impacts the spread and abundance of disease-carrying vectors such as mosquitoes, threatening the re-emergence of illnesses such as scrub typhus to dengue. It can create a range of outcomes that compromise public health in one way or another: rising sea levels or prolonged drought can displace communities, scarce resources can trigger instability and conflict, and a decline in agricultural output can aggravate and entrench poverty.

The WHO South-East Asia Region is particularly vulnerable

In recent years the Region's 11 Member countries, all of them low, or middle-income, have faced public health challenges from diverse climate-associated events and processes, including glacial lake outburst floods, cyclones and rapidly eroding coastlines. These and other phenomena are likely to be exacerbated as global temperatures rise. Economic losses associated with climate change, meanwhile, are already affecting the development aspirations of millions of people Region-wide, and with it their ability to secure health and wellbeing. As the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) emphasise health, both determines and is determined by poverty and its attendant conditions.

Though the problem of halting and reversing climate change is bigger than any one country mitigating its health-related impact is both possible and necessary for all. Across the region, health systems should be able to anticipate, respond to, cope with, recover from and adapt to climate-related shocks and stress, and do so in a way that advances health equity and ensures no one is left behind. There are several ways to do this.

Most critical is obtaining high-level awareness and resolve to take action. In each of the region's member countries, health authorities should be fully cognizant of the specific climate-associated health risks they face and draft national plans accordingly. At the same time, cross-sectoral collaboration should be established with a range of key ministries, ensuring climate-associated health concerns are addressed across diverse policy areas.

Health systems' service delivery should likewise be evaluated and augmented. This could include integrating meteorological information with climate-sensitive health programmes to better anticipate shifting disease burdens. It could include enhancing disaster risk reduction and emergency preparedness to manage the threat of extreme weather events better. And it could also include scaling up the technical and professional capacity of health workers to better prepare for and deal with climate change's health-related outcomes.

Climate-resilient infrastructure and technology has much to offer. All health facilities, for example, should have contingency plans to ensure essential services such as water, sanitation and electricity are maintained during extreme weather events. Similarly, new facilities should be planned, sited and built as per projected climate risks such as storm surges or cyclones. Technologies that provide early warning of extreme weather events should be integrated into emergency preparedness systems, while mobile communications that can reach appropriate audiences should be obtained and utilised.

To facilitate these investments, climate and health financing should be adequately assessed, mobilised and secured. This means looking for opportunities to integrate the principles of climate resilience into everyday health system strengthening, whether related to health personnel or basic infrastructure. It also means identifying and accessing funding that can build resilience through more targeted initiatives such as expanding surveillance or retrofitting health facilities.

Member countries across the South-East Asia Region are working to make this happen. In recent years a range of innovative measures have been implemented Region-wide to protect and improve health as climate change takes effect. This must continue. It must also be scaled up. WHO South-East Asia Region is committed to facilitating this process, and ensuring Member countries across the Region can cope with one of humanity's most significant challenges.

There is, after all, no other option. Climate change is already transforming life as we know it and will continue to do so as global warming advances. Though the risks to human health are many, the means to take action are available to all. By building climate-resilient health systems, countries across the South-East Asia Region can stay on track to achieve the SDG goal of health and wellbeing for all, and also safeguard their many public health gains. Adapting to change can be difficult; the need to do so is clear. Climate resilience is a principle all health systems must embrace.

« C’est un drame, parce que c’est d’abord la perte d’une vie humaine. Et puis c’est une entreprise agricole de moins sur notre territoire », résume Jean Poirier, maire de Saint-Basile, un village d’environ 2600 âmes dans la région de Portneuf, et dont la moitié de l’économie tourne autour de l’agriculture.



Peu avant Noël dernier, Rudy Ducreux, un jeune agriculteur d’origine française, mettait fin à ses jours en se pendant dans l’atelier de sa ferme, la ferme Ducrêt, située à un jet de pierre de la mairie.



Pour les gens du milieu, ce jeune agriculteur était une étoile filante dans le firmament des fromagers québécois. « C’était quelqu’un d’assez réservé. Mais dès que vous parliez d’agriculture, vous constatiez combien il était passionné! Ses fromages au lait cru, dont Le Gaulois de Portneuf, étaient exceptionnels, irremplaçables. On ne peut pas se permettre de perdre des gens comme lui », raconte Charles Trottier, copropriétaire de la Fromagerie Des Grondines qui, partageant la même profession, l’a bien connu.



Les deux fromagers artisans ont passé à travers la crise de la listériose de 2008, qui a fait 2 morts et 38 malades, et où le gouvernement a fait jeter aux poubelles des milliers de kilogrammes de fromage. Dans un rapport sur la gestion de cette crise (2010), le ministère de l’Agriculture, des Pêcheries et de l’Alimentation (MAPAQ) exonérait les fromages au lait cru en identifiant la bactérie coupable, le pulsovar 93, une souche de la bactérie Lysteria monocytigene, provenant de fromages au lait pasteurisé. Mais le mal était fait, le Québec ne compte plus aujourd’hui, avec le départ de Rudy Ducreux, que quatre ou cinq fromagers au lait cru, selon Normand Côté, président de l’Association des fromagers artisans du Québec, qui regroupe une trentaine de membres.



Pour opérer notre fromagerie, j'ai besoin de 16 à 17 permis différents.

– Charles Trottier



Un métier sous très haute tension



Le métier de fromager-artisan relève des 12 travaux d’Hercule. Il faut traire des vaches 2 fois par jour, 365 jours par année, car on ne peut pas fermer le pis des vaches comme l’eau d’un robinet. Il faut ensuite fabriquer son fromage dans des conditions hygiéniques aussi salubres qu’une salle d’opération d’hôpital. Et il faut l’emballer, le distribuer et le vendre dans les boutiques spécialisées ou les restaurants.



« C’est trois métiers dans un », explique Charles Trottier. Sans compter qu’il faut composer avec le stress de la météo, la ferme étant une usine à ciel ouvert, pour produire des fourrages et des grains afin d’alimenter les vaches.



C'est dans l'établi de sa ferme que le jeune agriculteur Rudy Ducreux a mis fin à ses jours.



De plus, ce métier s’exerce sous une charge administrative kafkaïenne. « Pour opérer notre fromagerie, j’ai besoin de 16 à 17 permis différents, dont un de fabrication du ministère de l’Agriculture, un permis du ministère de l’Environnement, un permis de transport du lait, de vente au détail, de l’organisme de certification biologique, de la municipalité… » poursuit Charles Trottier.



Comme si cette lourdeur administrative ne suffisait pas, la décision du gouvernement Trudeau de permettre l’importation de 16 000 tonnes métriques de fromages fins en provenance d’Europe dès le 21 septembre prochain sous l’Accord économique et commercial entre le Canada et l’Union européenne (AECG) risque de faucher plusieurs fromagers artisanaux du terroir québécois. « Cette importation, c’est l’équivalent de 640 fermes comme la nôtre. Il est illusoire de penser que nous ne serons pas affectés », croit Charles Trottier.



Depuis ses débuts, l’homme d’affaires a investi 1,8 million $ dans la fromagerie, dont 750 000 $ depuis deux ans, entre autres pour construire une nouvelle étable. Et il compte sur sa clientèle québécoise -- plus de 30 000 personnes visitent la fromagerie chaque année -- pour survivre.



Contrairement à Charles Trottier, qui dit travailler plus de 105 à 110 heures par semaine pour faire tourner la fromagerie avec son associé et une vingtaine d’employés, « Rudy, lui, opérait seul, avec l’énergie de la jeunesse ».



C’est peut-être parce qu’il devait se battre envers et contre tous que Rudy Ducreux avait surnommé son produit vedette « Le Gaulois de Portneuf », gagnant d’un prix Caseus (2011), sorte de Jeux olympiques annuels du fromage.



Charles Trottier, co-propriétaire de la Fromagerie Des Grondines, a bien connu Rudy Ducreux, un champion fromager.



Combien d’agriculteurs se suicident?

« Je ne sais pas dans quelle mesure le cas de Rudy Ducreux est représentatif de l’état psychologique de l’ensemble des producteurs laitiers du Québec », dit Ginette Lafleur, doctorante au Centre de recherche et d’intervention sur le suicide et l’euthanasie (CRISE) à l’UQAM. Si les fromagers artisans ne transforment qu’une goutte de lait produite par les quelque 5 600 fermes laitières du Québec, ils sont le porte-étendard d’une industrie qui génère près de 30 % de toutes les recettes agricoles de la province.



Selon la doctorante, le métier d’agriculteur est reconnu comme l'un des plus à risque de stress à cause d’éléments incontrôlables comme la météo. Mais la mondialisation, les traités commerciaux, le prix du lait, le prix du quota, l’endettement des entreprises, les changements technologiques, les conflits familiaux, les chicanes de couple ou l’isolement sont tous des facteurs de stress qui s’additionnent et font grimper le taux de la détresse psychologique. « Jusqu’à ce que l’élastique pète », explique celle qui a étudié le malaise des agriculteurs tant au Québec qu’en France et en Suisse1.



Toutefois, la seule étude disponible sur le taux de suicide des agriculteurs québécois indiquait qu’il était le double de celui des hommes dans la population générale québécoise. Mais cette étude2 réalisée par Santé Canada date de trente ans (1971-1987). Le problème, pour obtenir l’heure juste, c’est que l’Institut national de la santé publique du Québec ne comptabilise pas les suicides par profession. En 2014, 845 Québécois se sont enlevé la vie et, depuis 1981, cette triste statistique annuelle oscille entre 795 et 1284 hommes.



Parmi les pays développés, la France s’est toutefois dotée en 2013 d’un Observatoire national du suicide qui dénombre 417 suicides chez les hommes agriculteurs entre 2007 à 2009, surtout dans les élevages de bovins.



Rudy Ducreux, l’arbre qui cache la forêt?



Notre enquête révèle cependant que le phénomène du suicide des agriculteurs existe bel et bien dans la campagne québécoise. Parlez-en à Laurier Gauthier, un voisin de Rudy Ducreux. L’homme de 67 ans est producteur de lait et copropriétaire avec ses frères de la seconde plus grosse érablière de la Belle Province. Il a offert de nous accompagner à la ferme Ducrêt.

La vraie raison profonde, les gens partent avec.

– Laurier Gauthier

En chemin, à bord de son camion, M. Gauthier lance devant la ferme d’un de ses voisins. « Lui aussi il s’est suicidé. Puis pourtant, il avait de l’argent plein les poches. Il venait de s’acheter une Cadillac. Un bon matin, on apprend qu’il s’était tiré un coup de 22 en arrière des oreilles. Surprise totale ». Il ajoute avoir connu six personnes, dont cinq producteurs et un employé de ferme, qui se sont enlevé la vie dans un rayon de 12 kilomètres de son entreprise.



Quant au geste irrémédiable de Rudy Ducreux, M. Gauthier l’explique peut-être par une charge de travail trop lourde pour un seul homme, mais, « la vraie raison profonde, les gens partent avec », dit-il. Maire de Saint-Basile durant une trentaine d’années, le producteur pointe du doigt l’actuel contexte socio-économique comme facteur important de détresse psychologique chez les producteurs agricoles. Il reproche à Québec, depuis le règne du ministre de l’Agriculture péquiste Jean Garon (1976-1985), champion de la souveraineté alimentaire, de nommer des ministres de l’Agriculture à temps partiel ou ignorant des enjeux.



Quant au fédéral, le producteur se demande jusqu’où Ottawa, dans l’actuelle renégociation de l’ALENA exigée par le président Donald Trump, est prêt à défendre la gestion de l’offre et ne pas la sacrifier au profit des secteurs du bois d’œuvre, de l’automobile ou de l’aviation.



Nous arrivons à la ferme Ducrêt. Rudy Ducreux avait acheté en 2004 la ferme de Luc Mailloux, un ex-fromager au lait cru, et frère du psychiatre controversé Pierre « Doc » Mailloux. Sur place, nous sommes accueillis par Connie McLellan, une jeune agricultrice de 28 ans originaire de Nouvelle-Écosse. Elle hésite à parler au journaliste, selon les conseils de l’avocat engagé par la succession « pour ne pas nuire à la vente de la ferme », prévue d’ici l’automne. Le corps de Rudy Ducreux a depuis longtemps été rapatrié par la famille.



Connie McLellan, une jeune productrice, s'occupe du troupeau de Rudy Ducreux.



La jeune femme explique avoir été recrutée pour traire le troupeau de 26 bêtes. À part le cliquetis des chaînes des vaches à l’étable, le silence règne autour de la maison, de la fromagerie, de l’établi et des remises désertés. Seul un chat en manque de caresses nous suit d’un bâtiment à l’autre.



Dans les champs adjacents, de la machinerie rouille au milieu de hautes herbes. Et on peut apercevoir de nouvelles plantations d’arbres sur les terres voisines autrefois cultivées. Comme l’arbre qui cache la forêt, le suicide du créateur du Gaulois de Portneuf cache un pan de l’agriculture québécoise en péril.

""Cette séquence touche à la violation d'une correspondance certes professionnelle mais privée, analyse Marie-France Chambat-Houillon.","MÉDIAS - Ce SMS n'était pas censé être rendu public. Et pourtant, une semaine après sa lecture en direct sur C8, il continue de faire vivre la bataille entre ""Quotidien"" de Yann Barthès et ""TPMP"" de Cyril Hanouna qui affirme être boycotté par TF1.

Tout commence le 3 octobre. Sur Twitter, Cyril Hanouna fait saliver ses 5,5 millions d'abonnés en affirmant avoir ""reçu un coup de pression"". Quelques heures plus tard sur le plateau de ""TPMP"", il conclut sa quotidienne en annonçant un gros ""doss"" pour le lendemain.

C'est finalement Benjamin Castaldi qui, comme promis, dévoile le dossier et lit à voix haute les SMS qu'aurait envoyé le programmateur de l'émission ""Quotidien"" à l'athlète Pierre-Ambroise Bosse. Celui-ci avait préféré aller chez Cyril Hanouna que chez Yann Barthès. Les messages ont été capturés et diffusés sur l'écran géant situé derrière l'animateur de C8. La réponse de l'intéressé? ""Achète-toi une vie"".

C'est une nouvelle mode qui prend racine depuis plusieurs mois à l'antenne. Télévision, radio, avec un relais sur les réseaux sociaux... toutes les plateformes sont bonnes pour divulguer aux téléspectateurs le contenu de messages privés.

Quand Guy Carlier lâche sur Europe 1 une chronique assassine au sujet de Capucine Anav, les deux orchestrent un billet à quatre mains dans la semaine qui suit. Le rôle de chacun est bien défini: le chroniqueur déroule la chronologie des faits puis passe le micro à son invitée. La jeune femme lit alors le long SMS privé qu'elle lui avait envoyé pour lui dire ce qu'elle en avait pensé. Elle termine sa lecture en larmes, avant de lui passer la main pour qu'il conclut et s'excuse.

Quand Thierry Ardisson accuse Bruno Masure de lui envoyer des messages injurieux, il le fait à l'antenne. ""J'ai un scoop pour vous, lâche-t-il le 11 mars dernier dans ""SLT"" sur C8, avant de dévoiler le 06 de celui qui l'agresserait à coup de SMS: Bruno Masure. Au HuffPost, ce dernier avait dénoncé à l'époque un ""mensonge grossier"" de l'animateur, pointant du doigt un ""procédé répugnant, tout à son image"".

La transparence à outrance

Ce ""procédé"", c'est celui de la transparence à outrance. En dévoilant le contenu de messages privés, les animateurs et célébrités prennent les téléspectateurs à témoin. ""La transparence est un idéal journalistique, médiatique et démocratique, explique Marie-France Chambat-Houillon, spécialiste de la télévision et analyste des médias. Mais toute démocratie est fondée sur le respect de la vie privée"".

Pour la maître de conférence habilitée à diriger des recherches à l'Université Paris 3, les animateurs sont en train de confondre l'exigence de sincérité et une sorte de franchise exacerbée qui ne tient pas compte de ce principe fondamental.

Franck Annese, patron de Society, avait dénoncé ces méthodes après la diffusion d'un SMS sur l'écran géant de ""TPMP"". Cyril Hanouna n'avait pas apprécié un article du magazine sur les coulisses de l'émission, un mois après l'affaire des coups de fil et menaces reçues par le chroniqueur de Canal+, Julien Cazarre, qui avait porté plainte.

""C'est une erreur de sa part, avait jugé Franck Annese dans l'émission 'Médias le mag' du site Puremédias. On n'a pas le droit de faire ça. Ça s'appelle une atteinte à la vie privée, poursuit-il, quand on diffuse les SMS et une photo de quelqu'un dont on n'a pas les droits"".

Les échanges SMS entre Cyril et le patron du magazine. Qu'en pensez-vous ? #TPMP pic.twitter.com/cHWCcmW7Bg — TPMP (@TPMP) 7 mars 2016

Puisque ""la télé c'est que de la télé"", Cyril Hanouna a fait de la lecture et du partage de SMS une spécialité autour de son émission.

Il y a d'abord les SMS qui font rire, ceux qui témoignent de l'affection que se portent les membres et invités de son émission, ou ceux que l'animateur affirme recevoir de sa mère en direct:

Voilà le SMS qui m a fait chialer aujourd'hui que je tweete avec l accord de @Mokhtar_TPMPOFF qui est vraiment mon frérot d amour ❤️ pic.twitter.com/0xm9xSjdpX — Cyril Hanouna (@Cyrilhanouna) 25 décembre 2016

🖕🏻😂🖕🏻 pic.twitter.com/UVHOk3ZzjS — Michael Youn (@MichaelYoun) 1 mars 2017

Mais il y a aussi les SMS qui font du tort, à l'image de ceux dévoilés par Benjamin Castaldi.

""Cette séquence touche à la violation d'une correspondance certes professionnelle mais privée, analyse Marie-France Chambat-Houillon. Elle intervient dans le cadre d'une charge, d'une dénonciation des pratiques de la concurrence. C'est tout à fait différent par exemple des SMS lus par Capucine Anav qui était face à son contradicteur dans un cadre humoristique"".

La stratégie de la citation

Si tout cela peut paraître léger, cela l'a moins été pendant la dernière campagne présidentielle. En direct sur France 2, Nicolas Dupont-Aignan exécute sa promesse et lit les messages reçus ""d'un grand patron de presse"", dont tout le monde comprend qu'il s'agit du propriétaire du Figaro, Serge Dassault. Le happening avait étonné Léa Salamé qui avait questionné l'intérêt de lire ces textos.

En octobre 2016, les messages de Cyril Hanouna envoyés à Thierry Ardisson et dévoilés par Stéphane Guillon avaient tout de la polémique à épisodes, notamment sur les réseaux sociaux, qui avaient pris le relais de la télévision. Après les révélations de l'animateur de ""TPMP"" sur le salaire de l'humoriste, ils s'étaient lancés des piques par médias interposés, Stéphane Guillon dénonçant une initiative ""téléguidée"" et politique depuis les hautes sphères de Canal+ pour l'évincer.

Comme l'explique l'universitaire Marie-France Chambat-Houillon, la lecture de SMS à l'antenne s'apparente à ""de la création de citations"". C'est notamment le cas quand Thierry Ardisson lit le texto qu'il affirme avoir reçu de sa fille en réaction à l'affaire de la jupe de Nolwenn Leroy soulevée par Laurent Baffie.

""En communication, ce procédé est très stratégique, analyse-t-elle. Il permet de faire intervenir un tiers, en l'occurrence un proche féminin, pour désamorcer une polémique. Et plus généralement, le fait de lire sans montrer la 'preuve' physique du SMS pose problème: qui nous dit que la citation a réellement été écrite?""

Si le CSA ne s'est récemment pas emparé de ces affaires, considérant que les SMS diffusés à l'antenne ne portaient préjudice à personne, l'instance a plusieurs fois épinglé des médias comme France 5, RTL, ou NRJ Hits pour ce type d'infractions.



Contactée par Le HuffPost, la direction de la chaîne C8 n'a pas encore répondu à nos demandes.

Per monsignor Carlo Alberto Capella, il funzionario della Nunziatura apostolica negli Stati Uniti accusato di possesso e diffusione di materiale pedopornografico, il Vaticano ha opposto l'immunità diplomatica contro il mandato di arresto emesso a suo carico da parte delle autorità canadesi.

Pour la Journée internationale des filles, le collectif féministe Insomnia y a déversé du colorant rouge.

""Notre sang, notre souffrance, leurs règles"", ""des tampons sains pour nos vagins"": Leurs revendications s'affichent en lettres rouges et noires sur des banderoles blanches.

L'action avait pour but de sensibiliser au tabou qui règne sur les règles. ""Honteuses de leur corps dès l'adolescence, les femmes se sentent continuellement obligées de les cacher"", dénonce le collectif sur sa page Facebook. Et de poursuivre: ""On évite de le nommer, de le montrer, d'en parler; il est censuré dans les médias au point de devenir un liquide bleu dans les publicités pour protections hygiéniques.""

""Notre condition de femmes nous poussent à briser ce tabou"", expliquent les militantes au HuffPost. Et d'énumérer les polémiques qui ont remis cette question sur le devant de la scène: taxe tampon, chocs toxiques liés aux tampons...

""Nous réclamons un accès facilité aux protections hygiéniques"", écrivent-elles sur StreetPress. Elles donnent ainsi plusieurs pistes, comme la gratuité de ces protections pour les mineures et les femmes sans-abri, mais aussi la mise en place de distributeurs dans la rue ou la poursuite de la baisse de la ""taxe tampon"".

En décembre 2015, après plusieurs déboires législatifs, les députés avaient finalement accepté de baisser la TVA sur les protections hygiéniques de 20% à 5,5%. Le collectif Insomnia, lui, réclame une taxe à 2,1%. ""Les règles coûtent 23.500 € dans la vie d'une femme"", soutiennent-elles.

Par ailleurs, elles réclament plus de transparence sur la composition des serviettes hygiéniques et tampons. ""Les pesticides dans le coton et autres produits néfastes peuvent être sources d'intoxications"", critiquent les membres du collectif, qui pointent aussi le risque de choc toxique.

22 cas ont été déclarés en 2014. Des cas qui seraient liés à la composition des tampons, comme le dénonçait au mois d'avril un documentaire de France 5: ""Tampon, notre ennemi intime"".

Enfin, les militantes demandent à ce que davantage de moyens soient alloués à la recherche sur l'endométriose, cette maladie qui touche une femme sur dix, cause de règles douloureuses et de risques d'infertilité.

Le collectif féministe Insomnia s'est créé en mai 2016. Les trois militantes qui en sont à l'origine dénoncent alors les blagues sexistes de la chaîne de bagels Bagelstein. En juin et juillet 2016, elles recouvrent les vitrines de la chaîne. Puis continuent les coups d'éclats. Au mois de novembre de la même année, elles avaient affiché, sur les abribus de Paris, les noms de femmes tuées dans l'année par leur conjoint ou ex-conjoint.

L'action s'était, cette fois encore, déroulée de nuit, pour exiger la reconnaissance du ""féminicide"", c'est à dire ""le meurtre d'une femme parce qu'elle est femme"", comme elles l'expliquaient alors à Buzzfeed.

""Ce mode d'action de nuit nous permet de se réapproprier l'espace public"", racontent-elles au HuffPost, et de ""rappeler notre mission de 'Veille antisexiste'"".

Vor drei Jahren half ihr das FBI, der schrecklichen Situation zu entkommen

Jetzt will sie mit einem gemeinnützigen Projekt dafür sorge, dass andere Mädchen nicht Dasselbe durchmachen müssen

Vielen erschien Emmy Myers in der High School wie die Vorzeige-Schülerin schlechthin. Sie turnte, machte Leichtathletik und war in der Landwirtschafts-AG.

Doch ihr Leben nahm eine dunkle Wende - sie wurde drogensüchtig und Opfer von Sex-Handel.

Heute will die 28-Jährige aus Wisconsin andere Menschen darauf aufmerksam machen, dass dieses Schicksal jeden ereilen kann - und dass die Menschen, die Frauen und Mädchen kaufen, aus jeder sozialen Schicht kommen können.

""Das passiert nicht nur in Filmen, sondern auch normalen Menschen im echten Leben"", sagte Myers der HuffPost.

""Lacey's Hope Project"" macht auf Sex-Handel aufmerksam

Sie hat eine gemeinnützige Aktion Lacey's Hope Project gestartet und spricht offen über ihre Erfahrungen. Der Name der Organisation ist eine Anlehnung an ihren damaligen Bühnennamen, mit dem sie auftrat, um gegen Geld zu tanzen.

Menschenhandel nimmt in den USA stark zu. 2016 stiegen die Fälle im Vergleich zum Vorjahr laut der National Human Trafficking Hotline um 35,6 Prozent an.

Die Opfer werden gezwungen, körperliche Arbeit zu verrichten oder gegen ihren Willen mit Fremden Sex zu haben.

Armut und Arbeitslosigkeit helfen dem Menschen-Handel

Dass der Menschenhandel ansteigt, hat laut Experten mehrere Gründe. Jarrett Luckett, Geschäftsfüher der Organisation Exploit No More, sieht vor allem Armut und Drogenkonsum als Faktoren an.

Exploit No More unterstützt Menschen, die Opfer von Sex-Handel wurden. Luckett arbeitet gemeinsam mit Myers daran, über Sex-Handel in den Städten aufzuklären und auf die Gefahr aufmerksam zu machen.

""Armut und Drogen machen die Opfer anfälliger, in die Falle des Sex-Handels zu tappen"", sagte Luckett der HuffPost.

Diese beiden Probleme sind daran schuld, dass Myers Geburtsstadt Milwaukee zu einem Knotenpunkt für Menschenhandel geworden ist.

Milwaukee ist ein perfekter Ort für die Händler. Sie können ihre Opfer an viele größere Städte in der Nähe transportieren - etwa nach Chicago und Madison. Weit verbreiteter Heroinmissbrauch und die hohe Arbeitslosenrate in Milwaukee helfen den Händlern, ihre Opfer zu ködern.

Sex-Handel hat sich in Milwaukee so weit verbreitet, dass die Stadt auch ""Harvard der Zuhälter"" genannt wird.

Jeder kann zum Opfer werden

Myers Geschichte zeigt, dass Händler aber auch Erfolg haben können, wenn die Opfer aus einer guten Familie kommen. Sie wuchs als das aufgeweckte, fröhliche Kind auf, das sich alle Eltern wünschen.

In der Zeit zwischen ihrem dritten und sechsten Lebensjahr aber wurde sie von einem Freund der Familie mehrfach missbraucht. Einen Großteil ihrer Kindheit über machte sie sich Vorwürfe.

Myers wurde mehrfach verhaftet. Sie hat ein Strafregister, aber keine Einstufung als Schwerverbrecherin. (Foto: Emmy Myers)

Sie glaubte, sie sei selbst daran schuld, dass er sich immer wieder an ihr verging. Die Zweifel seien so stark geworden, dass sie angefangen habe, Drogen zu nehmen, sagt Myers. Und irgendwann sei sie einem manipulativen Menschenhändler in die Hände gefallen.

Ihre ersten Erfahrungen mit Drogen habe sie in der High School gemacht, erzählt sie. In ihrem letzten Jahr an der Schule wurde das Geld knapp und sie begann zu strippen, um ihre Sucht zu finanzieren. Nach der High School steig sie auf Heroin um und war zwei Mal in einer Entzugsklinik - das alles geschah, bevor sie 20 Jahre alt war.

Mit 24 versuchte sie erneut, clean zu werden und zog ausgerechnet mit ihrem gewalttätigen Drogendealer zusammen. Er wusste von ihrer Situation und bot ihr an, sie unter seine Obhut zu nehmen und sich um sie zu kümmern. Er stellte ihr eine Wohnung zur Verfügung und versorgte sie mit Kleidung und Essen.

Myers konnte sich nicht wehren

Dass er plante, sie für Sex zu verkaufen, ahnte sie nicht. Er erstellte eine Werbeanzeige auf Backpage.com, einer Seite, die Produkte und Dienstleistungen anbietet. (Dieses Jahr musste die Firma ihren Bereich für Erwachsenen-Werbung schließen, da sie wegen Unterstützung von Prostitution und Menschen-Handel unter Verdacht steht.)

""Ich hätte niemals gedacht, dass ich mich jemals verkaufen würde"", sagt Myers. ""Aber als ich an diesem Punkt angelangt war, gab es keine Ausweg mehr"", sagt Myers. ""Zuhälter wissen, was sie tun. Sie geben vor, dich zu lieben. Sie finden heraus, wie du tickst und wovor du am meisten Angst hast.""

➨ Mehr zum Thema: ""Gewalt gegen Frauen ist eben unsere Kultur"" - ich setzte mich weltweit für Frauenrechte ein, diese Ausrede kann ich nicht mehr hören

Als Myers sich wehrte, drohte ihr der Dealer. Er sagte, wenn sie nicht einwillige, würde er ihre Neffen töten. Er konfiszierte ihren Personalausweis und nahm ihr das wenige Geld, das sie noch hatte.

Ihr Zuhälter und seine Freundin brachten Myers zu Hotels in verschiedenen Städten. Dort musste sie sich schon um 6.30 Uhr mit Männern treffen, bevor diese zu ihren Meetings gingen. Bis spät in die Nacht musste sie mit den Klienten Sex haben. Damit sie sich nicht wehren konnte, verabreichte der Dealer ihr permanent Drogen.

""Es sind häufig die Männer, die in ihrem Umfeld anerkannt sind""

Gewissermaßen hatte sie ""Glück"" - keiner der Männer, mit denen sie schlafen musste, war ihr gegenüber gewalttätig. Viele von ihnen waren erfolgreiche Geschäftsmänner. Viele von ihnen hatten Familie.

""Das überrascht viele Menschen am meisten"", sagt Myers. ""Es sind nicht immer die großen, fetten, ekligen Typen. Es sind häufig die Männer, die in ihrem Umfeld anerkannt sind.""

Einen Monat später wurde Myers in Milwaukee verhaftet - für eine Sache, die nichts mit Sex-Handel oder Prostitution zu tun hatte. Die Anzeige gegen sie machte das FBI auf sie aufmerksam. Die Ermittler boten an, ihr zu helfen und sie aus dieser Situation zu befreien.

2013 musste sie für etwa einen Monat ins Gefängnis und ging danach erneut in eine Entziehungsklinik - zum dritten Mal. Nachdem sie wieder draußen war, fiel sie erneut für kurze Zeit dem Sexhandel zum Opfer.

Heute will die 28-Jährige darauf aufmerksam machen, dass jeder Opfer von Sex-Handel werden kann. (Foto: Emmy Myers)

Ein halbes Jahr später war sie wieder im Gefängnis - dieses Mal für sieben Monate. In dieser Zeit durfte sie arbeiten gehen (Anm. d. Red.: In den USA gibt es Integrations-Programme für Insassen. Sie können an ihren Arbeitsplatz zurückkehren, werden aber streng überwacht. Nach ihrer Schicht müssen sie zurück ins Gefängnis.).

Nach dieser Zeit im Gefängnis zog Myers für zwei Monate in eine soziale Einrichtung für Gewaltopfer. Mit Hilfe eines Übergangsprogramms fand sie eine eigene Wohnung.

Die Aufklärung in den großen Städten ist wichtig

Heute hat Myers seit drei Jahren keine Drogen mehr genommen. Sie hat ein Strafregister, ist aber nicht als Schwerverbrecherin eingestuft - zu ihrem großen Glück.

Viele, die in Amerika Opfer von Sex-Handel geworden sind, haben Prostitutions-Vorwürfe in ihrem Register stehen - und das, obwohl sie dazu gezwungen wurden.

Sie haben keine Möglichkeiten, ihre Register löschen zu lassen. Das bedeutet: Für sie ist es beinahe unmöglich, eine Arbeit oder eine Wohnung zu finden.

Derzeit arbeitet Myers als Pflegerin in einem Altersheim. Zusätzlich engagiert sie sich für ihr gemeinnütziges Projekt, mit dem sie Fälle von Sex-Handel verhindern will.

Sie erzählt ihre Geschichte in Schulen, Kirchen und anderen Gemeindeeinrichtungen. Sie klärt Ärzte, Schüler, Studenten, Eltern und Ordnungsämter auf, spricht über die Realität des Sex-Handels und erklärt, wie man ein solches Schicksal verhindern kann.

Ärzten erklärt sie beispielsweise, dass sie auf blaue Flecken an sonderbaren Stellen achten sollen und dass mehrfache Fehlgeburten sie ebenso stutzig machen sollten wie Patienten, die nicht wissen, wie viele Geschlechtspartner sie hatten oder die nicht genau angeben können, wo sie wohnen.

Diese Aufklärung sei entscheidend, um den Sex-Handel aufzuhalten, bestätigt Luckett.

""Diese präventive Arbeit ist wichtig, damit andere Menschen nicht in 'dieses Leben' abrutschen - sie sollen nicht auch noch durch diese Hölle gehen"", sagt er. ""Es lässt sich nicht pauschal sagen, wie ein Menschen-Händler aussieht - oder wie ein Opfer aussieht. Das macht es besonders schwer. Aber es gibt Zeichen, die einen davor warnen.""

Why Is Gaslighting So Disturbing? Being gaslighted over time effectively disconnects you from yourself, your feelings, your ability to know what you want and don't want, what you know to be true about yourself, others, and the world. It can eventually strip a person of their core sense of themselves, leaving them feeling dependent upon the gaslighter to define reality and provide approval and confirmation of what is real.

To those who can't sing, I say karaoke.
To those who can sing, I say karaoke.
So to those who can't sing, I say karaoke.
To those who can sing, I say karaoke.","I recently performed 'You Can Call Me Al' at a karaoke bar; well, perhaps 'butchered' would be a better description. Somehow I'd convinced myself that this Paul Simon classic would go down a treat, until -- moments in -- I realised the yodel-esque song was no friend of mine. I stumbled over the words and scream-sang the chorus off-key.

Staring out at a sea of disinterested faces, I realised two things: 1) no one actually cared and, 2) I was really, really happy. This gin-and-tonic-fuelled epiphany got me thinking about this pastime and why we love it so much.

Looking at my fellow open-mic participants it was clear that karaoke draws a diverse crowd. There was a big, beefy bloke in a singlet and stubbies, a group of twenty-somethings teetering in stiletto heels, and a middle-aged woman in an ill-fitting cat jumper -- the 'Islands in the Stream' type.

A bunch of misfits ready to take the stage. But were we all singing for the same reason?

Karaoke is a Japanese word which means 'empty orchestra', but there's nothing empty about it.

It's easy to assume karaoke is a purely narcissistic endeavour, a chance to be in the spotlight, to enjoy those fleeting Andy Warhol minutes of fame. But as I watched song after song recited hopefully on stage, I realised we all had our own agendas which were as unique and diverse as our song choice.

One of the teenyboppers took to the stage, mic in one hand, alcopop in the other, and kicked off her high-pitched Katy Perry rampage. It was clear she saw this as an opportunity to show off her 'talent' -- a self-promoting platform for a wannabe star.

She pulled out some Mariah-Carey-type runs with a desperation that I found slightly disconcerting. Her eyes darted around the crowd, as though she were looking for someone, a potential agent or judge from 'X Factor' perhaps. She wanted to be famous, and for three minutes and 46 seconds she was.

Singlet and Stubbies was next, his strong presence engulfing the stage. He cleared his throat, took a swig of VB and then unleashed the most tender and raw version of REO Speedwagon's 'Keep On Loving You' I've ever heard. It was as though all this emotion was bottled up inside and it was finally given a chance to escape.

I wondered who he was singing about, or to. Was he a widow? A divorcee? Was it an ode to a teenage romance from long ago? I guess it didn't matter because, in under a minute, he'd managed to get the entire room hanging out for his next heartwrenching note.

To him, karaoke seemed cathartic, a chance to dive in and explore his emotions, to be vulnerable, emotional, to express all the things he perhaps found hard to express in everyday life.

Once the song was over a steely expression returned to his face -- the vault had been closed once again.

To those who can't sing, I say karaoke. To those who can sing, I say karaoke. Just try to avoid 'You Can Call Me Al'.

The cat lady softly sang Cindy Lauper's 'Time after Time', shutting her eyes and swaying from side to side. The music consumed her, she was living every lyric. Unfortunately, all I could think of was that dance scene from 'Romy and Michele's High School Reunion'. But you could see that she really loved this song and just wanted to share it.

The cat lady and I probably had most in common, because for me karaoke is and has always been about sharing the music that I love with others.

'Graceland' was an album I first listened to with my Dad. Whenever I hear it I flood with nostalgia and all round good feels -- mainly when I imagine Chevy Chase in the film clip -- it's a happiness that I want to share.

And what I lack in vocal ability I make up for in enthusiasm -- I'd like to imagine I look like ScarJo serenading Bill Murray in 'Lost in Translation' but in reality it's tragically uncool Elaine-style dancing. But that's half the fun of it. It's liberating to not give a shit, and let it rip.

I guess that's what makes karaoke so damn infectious. It doesn't matter if you can sing, if you have a hidden talent like Singlet and Stubbies or you're tone-deaf like me. Fun is contagious. Those singing get an adrenalin rush, those feelgood endorphins, and the people watching get entertainment, or at the very least a reassuring dose of schadenfraude.

And no matter how bad we were that night, the crowd applauded every time. Because it takes courage to get up there and be open and vulnerable. You're putting yourself, and your taste in music, up for judgment and critique. No matter the motive, that takes guts. And perhaps a bit of alcohol.

Karaoke is a Japanese word which means 'empty orchestra', but there's nothing empty about it. I find it a fulfilling experience. So to those who can't sing, I say karaoke. To those who can sing, I say karaoke.

These boxes appear so often that it has just become second nature for many of us to fill them in without thinking just to get them to disappear.

So who do we protect agains these?

As Krause points out there are a number of reasons why you’re very very unlikely to ever encounter a fake login box.

For starters they have to be built into the app, which means getting it past Apple’s very strict approval process. Secondly you would need to have downloaded a malicious app, which in turn can be avoided through some checking of the app’s permissions etc.

Most importantly though is activating two-factor authentication.

Ein ziemlicher Klotz, groß, schwer und wuchtig. Zumindest bei uns hat sich BMW mit dem Fünfer GT nicht viele Freunde gemacht. Deutlich besser sah es allerdings im Rest der Welt aus, vor allem im Reich der Mitte. Die Chinesen liebten den ""dicken Bayern"" wegen seines präsenten Auftritts und den großzügigen Platzverhältnissen. Der Nachfolger, ab November im Handel, könnte sich auch bei uns in die Herzen fahren. Schlank und elegant, flacher, länger und leichter. Als hätte er eine erfolgreiche Diät mit anschließendem Fitness-Training hinter sich. Da macht es von der Marketing-Seite her nur Sinn, auch gleich den Namen zu ändern: Sechser Gran Turismo. Das klingt nach gediegenem Langstreckenkomfort und stilvollem Reisen. Aber Halt! Gibt es nicht schon ein Sechser Gran Coupé? Stimmt, ist aber anders positioniert. Zudem wird es nur noch kurze Zeit gebaut und dann durch die neue Achter-Baureihe ersetzt.

Ein Kofferraum wie ein Kleiderschrank

Der Sechser Gran Turismo basiert auf der gleichen Architektur wie Fünfer und Siebener. Vom Flaggschiff erhielt er den langen Radstand von 3,07 Metern. Entsprechend fürstlich sind die Platzverhältnisse im Fond. Business-Class. Damit dürften sogar chinesische Direktoren und Minister zufrieden sein. Doch damit nicht genug. Der Kofferraum fasst üppige 610 Liter, ein Plus von 110 Litern. Gut einen Meter breite Gegenstände können bequem hineingeschoben werden. Keine Ladekante stört, alles ist eben wie der Esszimmertisch zu Hause. Neu ist die Fernentriegelung der Sitzlehnen vom Kofferraum aus. Fallen sie nach vorne, wächst die Ladekapazität auf gigantische 1.800 Liter. Das schaffen manche Kombis in dieser Klasse nicht, inklusive des hauseigenen Bruders Fünfer Touring. Wer also vom Design her Kombis nicht zu seinen Favoriten zählt, ist mit dem Sechser Gran Turismo bestens bedient. Etwas Gewöhnung verlangt lediglich die Handhabung mit der Gepäckabdeckung. Normalerweise hakt man einfach das Rollo aus. BMW wählte jedoch erstmals zwei Hartschalen, hat für diese aber unter dem Ladeboden ein spezielles Fach vorgesehen, in das die beiden Teile exakt eingesteckt werden können.

Der 6er kann selbstständig überholen und parken

Hinter dem Lenkrad heißt es sofort: Willkommen zu Hause. Das bekannte BMW-Cockpit glänzt durch gute Übersicht, leichte Bedienung und exzellente Verarbeitung. Premium-Segment eben. Für das auch entsprechende Preise aufgerufen werden. Beim Sechser Gran Turismo beginnt der Spaß bei 62.300 Euro (630i). Dafür gibt es wohlgemerkt ""nur"" einen Vierzylinder mit zwei Liter Hubraum. Leistung: 258 PS. Souveräner und geschmeidiger geht da natürlich der Sechszylinder-Reihenmotor (3,0 Liter Hubraum) im 640i zu Werke (68.100 Euro). Klangbild, Elastizität und Leistungsentfaltung machen das 340-PS-Aggregat zur ersten Wahl für dieses Auto. Es sei denn, man steht auf Diesel und dessen extrem bulliges Drehmoment. Schon der 630d schickt maximal 620 Newtonmeter in die Achtgang-Automatik, setzt selbst kleine Gaspedalbewegungen unmittelbar in Vortrieb um. Ende des Jahres will BMW noch den 640d nachreichen, mit gleichem Hubraum, aber gut 20 Prozent mehr Leistung sowie zehn Prozent mehr Drehmoment.

Was Fahrkomfort, Agilität und Handling angehen, muss eigentlich kein Wort mehr verloren werden. Der Sechser Gran Turismo grenzt hier an Perfektion. Die Hinterachse hat serienmäßig Luftfederung. Gegen Aufpreis gibt es eine komplette Luftkissenbettung, dazu Aktivlenkung und Wankstabilisierung. Und natürlich hält die Preisliste ein ganzes Bündel an Assistenzsystemen parat. Zu den jüngsten Errungenschaften zählen der Staupilot, dessen Zeitraum für die automatische Wiederanfahrt auf 30 Sekunden verlängert wurde, das selbstständige Überholen auf der Autobahn, das ferngesteuerte Parken per Display Schlüssel und die Gefahrenwarnung durch Vernetzung mit anderen BMW-Fahrzeugen.

Ohnehin spielt BMW beim Thema Konnektivität in der Champion-League. Wie beim Fünfer und Siebener wird auch der Sechser Gran Turismo zum rollenden Mobilitätsassistenten. Das Auto zeigt einem in Echtzeit Staus und freie Parkplätze an. Die Routenplanung zu Hause am PC lässt sich direkt ins Cockpit übertragen. Der Fahrer erhält sogar automatisch Nachricht, früher zu starten, weil sich zwischenzeitlich die Verkehrssituation geändert hat. Und Geschäftspartner oder die Ehefrau können von unterwegs per SMS benachrichtigt werden, falls es später werden sollte als vereinbart. Wirklich aufmerksam, diese neuen Assistenten.

To date, a few small steps have been taken in this direction. The issue might have quietly simmered down, were it not for the readings of Senate Bill S-219 ""An Act to Deter Iran sponsored terrorism,"" which, if passed, would impose some of the most restrictive sanctions on Iran, and potentially stall the prospect of re-establishing diplomatic relations with Iran.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau speaks to world leaders at the 72nd United Nations (UN) General Assembly at UN headquarters on Sept. 21, 2017 in New York City. Topics discussed at this year's gathering included Iran, North Korea and global warming.

Background to Iranian-Canadian relations

Robust relations with Iran date back to the regime of the last Shah of Iran, Mohammed Reza Pahlavi who ruled from 1941 to 1979. Canada's gravitation to Iran came at a time when nations courted the pre-revolutionary regime for its oil. The Shah's ambitions to modernize his country's military and industrial capacity using the country's massive oil revenues created many economic opportunities, eventually propelling Iran to be one of Canada's largest trading partners in the Middle East. These opportunities came to a halt with the 1979 Iranian revolution, which ended the Shah's reign, changed Iran's political landscape, and the trajectory of its relationship with Canada and many other nations. Canada's relations with Iran sharply contracted during the eight-year-long Iran-Iraq war, although later commercial relations were greatly improved in the 1990s.

The suspicious death of Iranian-Canadian photojournalist Zahra Kazemi in 2003, who died while detained in Tehran's Evin prison, resulted in the downgrading of relations. By 2012, Canada formally suspended diplomatic relations with Iran, citing not only its noncompliance with UN resolutions on its nuclear program but also its hostile rhetoric towards Israel, support for the Assad government in the Syrian civil war and safety concerns for Canadian diplomats. In the same year, Canada identified Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism under the State Immunity Act and Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act. Accordingly, Canadian and Iranian diplomats retreated, leaving behind a precarious situation.

Today over 163,000 Iranians (by birth or descent) call Canada home. The first wave, including Western-orientated professionals, business people and disenfranchised minorities, came to Canada around the time of the 1979 Iranian revolution. A second wave, from the 1990s to the present, has seen highly skilled Iranians, many in STEM fields, leave Iran due to insufficient economic opportunity and social restrictions. Consequently, Iran suffers from the world's highest rate of human capital flight.

Islamic Republic of Iran passport.

Viewpoints amongst Iranian-Canadians

Iranian-Canadians cannot access consular services, making it difficult, if not impossible, to renew passports or to obtain visitors visas for family members. Iranian-Canadians hoping for the re-establishment of relations are not naïve, but rather realist in their views of the regime: they are cognizant of the fact that Iran is an undemocratic nation with a poor record of human rights — but underscore that the problem impeding the relationship, namely Iran's noncompliance with United Nations resolutions regarding its nuclear programs, has been resolved through the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) (better known as the Iran nuclear deal). Others fault Canadian foreign policy for being tied to the American position and urge Canada to adopt a more neutral line by re-opening relations. Lastly, a Canadian embassy in Tehran would, in theory, provide leverage to help Canadians (and perhaps Americans) who seek diplomatic assistance while in Iran.

On the other side, a substantive portion of Iranians continue to express opposition to re-opening diplomatic relations with Iran, with one of the most common arguments being that the government of Iran is not a legitimate representation of its citizens. Evidence for the latter includes the protests since 1979, notably the 2009 and 2011 election protests. From this perspective, the re-establishment of relations with Iran would lend credibility to the regime and marginalize the voice of the opposition. Other critics note that pre-existing relations were unable to stop the murder of Zahra Kazemi. Others are distrustful of the intent of the Iranian embassies citing that they have been used in the past to spy on dissident Iranian-Canadians.

Economic possibilities

Another complexity lies in the commercial and economic relations between Iran and Canada. Due to years of relative isolation and economic neglect, Iran finds itself ripe for foreign investment and joint ventures. In purchasing power parity (PPP), Iran's economy is roughly the same size as Canada's, and GDP growth in the first half of the Iranian calendar year (ending on March 20), reached 7.4 per cent. Iran has one of the world's highest numbers of scholarly citations, has launched a satellite into space and in 2011 briefly surpassed the United Kingdom in automobile production . Despite this, massive influxes of industrial and technological goods are still needed to meet the demand.

This year, Italy and France, two countries with a long history of investment and co-operation with Iran, signed billions of dollars in trade agreements with Iran for heavy machinery, refining equipment and commercial jets. Many analysts have noted that there is a clear division between how Europe and the United States wish to interact with the Iran in the wake of the JCPOA. As the financial prospects for the Canadian technology and manufacturing sectors become strained by Trump's ""America First"" policies, new markets such as Iran will become increasingly attractive prospects. Iran's needs are endless — from commercial jets ( e.g., Bombardier) to oil and natural gas infrastructure (e.g., SNC Lavalin), to cellular phones (e.g., Blackberry) and medications ( e.g., Valeant Pharmaceuticals). On the downside, the expansion of trade with Iran could jeopardize Canada's trade relations with other countries, namely Saudi Arabia and Israel.

The Canadian Government closed its embassy in Iran and expelled all remaining Iranian Diplomats from the Iranian Embassy on Metcalfe Street, pictured here, in Ottawa.

What's at stake abroad?

The passing of Bill-219 means that Canada would formally challenge Iran over its ever-growing political leverage in a host of nations, namely Afghanistan, Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen. Conversely, the re-opening of diplomatic relations with Iran could potentially positively influence Canada's position among this group of nations, who have been labelled the ""Axis of Resistance.""

The fate of the Iranian-Canadian relationship may also act as a precedent for how Trudeau's administration would interact with other undemocratic nations such as Cuba and China. Re-establishing diplomatic relations with Iran would mark a departure from former Prime Minister Stephen Harper's hard-line policies, which involved criticizing and sanctioning nations such as Iran and Russia when they misbehaved in the international arena. However, shutting the door on relations may also strengthen Canada's diplomatic position with two other key allies — the United States and Israel.

Canada may find itself at a crossroads when it comes to Iran. It could vote to repeal Bill S219 and re-engage Iran with the goal of restoring diplomatic relations, or it could pass Bill S219 and either further widen the gap between the two countries. Either way, the outcome will be contentious.

Depending on who you talk to, they will tell you that branches are rooting for ANC treasurer general Zweli Mkhize, that Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa is commanding the support or that the pro-President Jacob Zuma fan base is firmly behind Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma.

The province emerged united in 2007 and 2012, and was an instrumental force behind Zuma's election and re-election as president. He would have been hoping that KwaZulu-Natal would again stand united behind his preferred candidate, Dlamini-Zuma.

But this is not the case.

HuffPost SA spoke to four ANC members in the province who hold positions at branch level. Their allegiance is divided among the three front runners.

From their perceptions of how branches are siding, it is clear Mkhize, Ramaphosa and Dlamini-Zuma all hold some power in the province, splitting the voter support three ways. Who currently holds the most influence over branches is difficult to tell.

And it is that problem with perceiving and predicting how KwaZulu-Natal will vote that makes this elective conference all the more unique. Five years ago, it would have been a Zuma landslide.

But conflict in the ANC in the province is raging.

The current provincial executive committee -– led by Zuma frontmen such as Sihle Zikalala and Super Zuma -– is scrambling to maintain its legitimacy inside the courtroom, now seeking to appeal a high court ruling that declared their election unlawful and void.

On the other side of the court battle are the Ramaphosa backers, led by ANC veteran Lawrence Dube, who won the case and are now opposing the appeal.

The court case resembles the symptoms of a province divided. But what then for December?

Mkhize is poising himself as the ""unity candidate"" to a divided party, Ramaphosa is riding on the ticket that the deputy president traditionally follows as president and Dlamini-Zuma is trying to set herself apart from her ex-husband while basing her campaign on the wheels of his massive support base.

Let's say each candidate takes an equal chunk of the province's voters. The second-best bet is securing the support of Mpumalanga Premier David Mabuza. His province, unlike KwaZulu-Natal, is united behind him.

Mpumalanga is the second-largest voting province this year -– 736 of the 4,723 delegates will come from there. And Mabuza is now singing the song of unity.

One would think Mabuza's closeness to Free State Ppremier Ace Magashule and North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo (the three were subbed the ""Premier League"" not too long ago and were seen as Zuma backers) may have the two of them lean in the same direction he decides to go in.

There are seven candidates vying for the top spot in December and 4,723 votes for the taking. Those close to the campaigning say 1,500 votes should secure a win. They say this makes almost a third of the entire voting delegation and with seven campaigners, three of which are seen as front runners, they believe 1,500 is the golden minimum for which to aim.

Based on that number, this therefore means our next president could be decided by a ballot box containing a slice of the KwaZulu-Natal pie, a majority from Mabuza's Mpumalanga branches and little bits and pieces from any of the seven other provinces.

But allegiances can change, better deals can be made and partnerships can strike up at the eleventh hour. It may be too early to say who will take the win, but what is certain is that with KwaZulu-Natal being so unpredictable, the race is certainly fascinating to watch.","KZN, The Broken Presidential Kingmaker",http://www.huffingtonpost.co.za/2017/10/12/kzn-the-broken-presidential-kingmaker_a_23240965/?utm_hp_ref=za-homepage

For Kalmus, personal and global transformation are intertwined: As he writes in the intro to Being The Change:""Global warming touches every aspect of our lives.
Global warming is, perhaps first and foremost, a failure of humanity's collective imagination.""
And that plays into using less fossil fuels, which are kind of there to make us zoom around really fast.""
The problem is that by burning fossil fuels into the atmosphere we're causing the blanket to become warmer.","The addiction we never even think about.

We're helplessly, hopelessly hooked. Virtually all of us have an insatiable thirst for some of the most fantastically addictive products humanity has ever invented.

These are products we rarely think about in terms of being addicted, because everyone uses them, and we largely take them for granted. They are products which fuel our busy lifestyles, yet which ironically now threaten them.

The products are fossil fuels, and this is the story of one man doing his utmost to cut them from his life.

Peter Kalmus is a climate scientist with NASA's jet propulsion lab. We profiled him in our climate change podcast Breaking The Ice a little earlier this year. As we said then, despite his line of work, Kalmus is unlikely ever to take a jet anywhere ever again.

Kalmus started giving up fossil fuels a few years ago now. Through a mixture of dietary, transport and other lifestyle changes, he's cut down to about 10 percent of the fossil fuel he once consumed.

The really amazing thing about cutting back?

If Peter Kalmus is any guide, it might just make you a whole lot happier.

Kalmus is living a much more satisfying life without fossil fuels than he ever dreamed. He's incredibly upbeat in person, and that attitude shines through in his new book Being The Change: Live Well And Spark A Climate Revolution.

If you could stop global warming with a smile, Kalmus would have frozen years ago.

The book's title says it all. Peter Kalmus really is being the change. He's being the internal change, living his best life by farming bees in his backyard, cycling to work, and skipping exhausting work trips interstate and abroad. And he's living the external change, doing his bit for the climate system, and through it, the earth.

For Kalmus, personal and global transformation are intertwined: As he writes in the intro to Being The Change:

""Global warming touches every aspect of our lives. It connects gardening to population growth, bicycling to flying in a plane. Most of all, global warming challenges us to rethink humanity's place in the web of life on this beautiful planet -- to reimagine what it means to be human. Global warming is, perhaps first and foremost, a failure of humanity's collective imagination.""

And as he told us in the podcast:

""Increasingly I sense that people are gaining an awareness that the social media, the flying around and the career pressure, all the running around and the rat race and the speed that life has taken on, that somehow we've been misled, that something isn't quite right. ""We're consuming more than ever and yet life seems less satisfying than ever. So all I'm saying is if we look inside ourselves a little bit more instead of consuming, maybe slow down a little bit instead of speeding up. And that plays into using less fossil fuels, which are kind of there to make us zoom around really fast.""

This really is a book like no other.

Climate science literature is often too dense, difficult or depressing. As Kalmus points out, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fifth Assessment Report was a whopping 4,852 pages. Who's going to read that?

Kalmus makes it easy for us. He sums up the science in 34 pages. His stated goal is to ""give the context necessary for a basic understanding of the global warming that's happening at this moment, but not to overwhelm you with more than that"".

And he pulls it off. For example, his description of the greenhouse effect is simple enough for anyone to understand:

""Greenhouse gases like CO2 act like a blanket warming the planet. We need this blanket. Without it the Earth's average surface temperature would be −18°C (0°F) and there could be no life as we know it. So the greenhouse effect per se is not a bad thing. The problem is that by burning fossil fuels into the atmosphere we're causing the blanket to become warmer. By 2014 we'd already in creased the atmospheric CO2 fraction by 43% over pre-industrial levels, and this increase is accelerating exponentially.""

The climate section is about 10 percent of the book. The rest is mostly about Kalmus' personal transformation. It's often pretty funny stuff. Wait till you read about Kalmus family holidays with their beaten up old car which runs on veggie fuel. It's not quite the Griswolds, but it's close.

It's not preachy or narcissistic. Phew.

Personal transformation books are often trite exercises in ego-driven vanity. Being The Change is not that. It's one guy's journey, written honestly, openly, with gallons of facts underpinning it all.

Kalmus has an easy, optimistic style which makes you want to hang out with him.

Not all of us are going to give up flying overnight like he did. We'll likely still be racing around tomorrow living our fossil fuel-charged lives. But who knows? Maybe we'll be inspired to make a small change or two. And that, says Kalmus, is the thing he hopes for.

As he writes:

""I'm aware that the changes I'm making to my daily life will not solve global warming or stave off global economic collapse. How could they? We're rapidly approaching eight billion people on the planet, and I am only one of them. However, my actions do make me happier, and that's reason enough to do them. I also suspect that for most of us, individual and local-scale actions are the most skillful means to effect global-scale change. This is a paradox of scale. Our individual actions don't make much of an immediate difference in the global response to our predicament, but they are pieces in a vast puzzle. As more pieces get added, more people will get excited by the emerging picture and begin to add their own pieces. The prevailing mindset in our industrial society is to search for a silver bullet solution, some brilliant techno-fix that allows us to avoid personal change (which is assumed to be undesirable). After decades of searching by the world's brightest minds, however, it seems likely that there is no such silver bullet. Personal change will therefore likely be necessary.""

And as Kalmus has shown, personal change is so much more than ""necessary"". It can be enjoyable too.

Pour Alain Griset, si le premier critère est ""logique"", ce n'est pas le cas du second, qui pénalise les jeunes.","POLITIQUE - ""Encore une réforme pour l'apprentissage."" C'est un peu l'état d'esprit des chefs d'entreprises à propos de la réforme du système voulue par Emmanuel Macron, alors que s'ouvre ce jeudi 12 octobre la concertation entre les partenaires sociaux et l'exécutif pour lancer les prochaines réformes sociales, dont celle sur l'apprentissage.

Favoriser le développement de l'apprentissage est un objectif récurrent des derniers gouvernements. Nicolas Sarkozy comme François Hollande avaient fixé leurs objectifs: 1 million pour le premier à la fin de son quinquennat, 500.000 pour le second. Aucun n'a réussi son pari. Ce qui explique la réticence des employeurs face aux ambitions du nouveau gouvernement.

En 2016, les chiffres sont très légèrement repartis à la hausse, avec 402.900 apprentis fin 2015 contre 400.900 l'année d'avant. Une petite amélioration fortement nuancée quand on sait que ces chiffres sont en réalité les mêmes qu'en 2012, comme le rappelle Alain Griset, président de l'Union des Entreprises de Proximité (U2P), contacté par le HuffPost. ""Ce n'est pas du tout satisfaisant"", estime-t-il. ""En France, 7% des jeunes sont en apprentissage"", a d'ailleurs indiqué la ministre du travail Muriel Pénicaud le 4 octobre, en comparant ces chiffres à ceux des pays (comme l'Allemagne) ""qui ont vaincu le chômage de masse"" et où les taux d'apprentis atteignent ""15% voire 20%"".

Pourtant, les réformes n'ont pas manqué ces dernières années. En 2011, Nicolas Sarkozy a ainsi lancé plusieurs mesures destinées à favoriser l'embauche des apprentis. Idem pour François Hollande, qui a par exemple modifié la législation sur le crédit d'impôt alloué aux entreprises qui embauchent.

Sauf que ces mesures n'ont pas du tout eu l'effet espéré, comme en témoignent les derniers chiffres. Pire, elles ont eu pour conséquence de lasser les professionnels, un peu plus prisonniers chaque fois de nouvelles réglementations peu efficaces.

Pour s'y retrouver, des spécialistes sont nécessaires

""En réalité, ce n'était pas de vraies réformes"", regrette Alain Griset. Il y a eu des annonces, quelques mesures ou plutôt quelques mesurettes qui ont été prises, mais il n'y a pas eu de réformes qui ont vraiment abouti à une évolution positive de l'apprentissage. Donc quand nos collègues entendent parler de réforme de l'apprentissage, ils se disent, 'Allez, une fois de plus on en parle et il n'y a rien qui va se passer.'""

En plus d'être jugées inefficaces, ces ""mesurettes"" ont un autre effet pervers: en s'accumulant, elles provoquent une sorte de cacophonie administrative, dans laquelle les chefs de petites et moyennes entreprises ont bien du mal à se retrouver. ""La difficulté tient d'abord à la rémunération, qui est très compliquée. Il faut vraiment que les entreprises aillent voir des spécialistes pour savoir combien ça va leur coûter. Ensuite il y a les aides: crédit d'impôt, exonération, etc. Et puis aussi la complexité du contrat lui-même"", détaille Alain Griset.

En résumé, ""il faut vraiment avoir beaucoup de courage pour prendre un apprenti"".

Avec sa nouvelle réforme, Emmanuel Macron ne prend-il pas le risque de rajouter une couche à cet embrouillamini? Dans son programme pour l'élection présidentielle, le candidat En Marche! affirmait qu'il voulait rendre les règles ""plus simples, transparentes et lisibles pour les entreprises comme pour les jeunes"". ""Notre système d'apprentissage est trop complexe à gérer pour les entreprises: le système d'aides à l'embauche est éclaté, le mode de financement de l'apprentissage n'est pas lisible, le contrat d'apprentissage est trop rigide"", estimait-il alors.

Une simplification brutale des règles n'est cependant pas la priorité pour Alain Griset. ""La priorité, c'est la rémunération à l'âge: on dit à un jeune de 23 ans qu'il est trop vieux parce qu'il coûte trop cher par rapport à un jeune de 18 ans. Il ne faut pas que l'âge soit un critère de recrutement. Etre trop vieux à 23 ans, c'est un peu bizarre."" Aujourd'hui, la rémunération des apprentis est calculée en fonction du niveau de formation et de l'âge. Pour Alain Griset, si le premier critère est ""logique"", ce n'est pas le cas du second, qui pénalise les jeunes.

Le président de l'U2P évoque également le contrat de travail qui est aujourd'hui appliqué dans l'apprentissage, et qui n'est selon lui pas adapté à certaines formations. ""Par exemple, quand vous êtes apprenti boulanger et que vous ne pouvez pas travailler avant 6h du matin, c'est un peu compliqué"", détaille Alain Griset. Selon le Code du Travail, ""il est interdit de faire travailler un jeune de moins de 16 ans entre 20h et 6h"", sauf exception dans les entreprises de spectacle, de cinéma, de radiophonie, de télévision ou d'enregistrements sonores. Or dans certains cas, l'apprentissage peut commencer dès 15 ans.

""Tout un tas de verrous"" en matière de santé et de sécurité au travail limitent l'activité des apprentis, relève-t-il. ""On peut le comprendre vu leur âge, mais il faut assouplir le système"", invite dans une interview parue dans Le Journal du Dimanche, François Asselin, président de la CPME, regrettant ""une surcouche"" réglementaire ""dissuasive"" pour l'employeur.

Enfin, la gestion du contenu des formations par l'Education Nationale et non par les branches professionnelles est aussi pointée du doigt. ""On a des diplômes qui ne correspondent plus aux besoins des entreprises"", déplore-t-il. ""Voilà au moins trois éléments qui, s'ils ne sont pas changés ne modifieront pas la donne.""

A en croire les dernières déclarations de l'exécutif, les attentes des chefs d'entreprises pourraient être satisfaites. En visite le 4 octobre à l'Ecole d'applications aux métiers des travaux publics en Corrèze, le président de la République a déclaré que les branches professionnelles devaient avoir ""un rôle central dans l'élaboration des enseignements."" ""Nous devons simplifier les circuits de financement parce qu'ils sont trop nombreux et qu'ils se cannibalisent, simplifier les contrats"", a également affirmé le chef de l'Etat.

Les objectifs d'Emmanuel Macron semblent donc plus ou moins en phase avec les attentes des professionnels. Mais ""chat échaudé craint l'eau froide"", et le souvenir des ""réformes"" mises en place lors des précédents quinquennats est encore bien présent. L'annonce d'une nouvelle réforme de l'apprentissage est donc observée du coin de l'œil par des professionnels suspicieux, qui attendent davantage une vraie ""refonte"" du système. ""Il faut vraiment qu'on aille sur les vrais sujets, qu'on ne fasse pas de la cosmétique ou de la communication, pour aboutir à un contrat qui sera au bout du compte plébiscité par tout le monde et utilisé par beaucoup.""

Selon le quotidien américain, le producteur a abusé sexuellement de nombreuses femmes parmi lesquelles des actrices mondialement connues.

Mardi 10 octobre, deux enquêtes menées par le New York Times et le New Yorker ont révélé des témoignages de victimes. Les comédiennes Judith Godrèche, Emma de Caunes, Angelina Jolie, Gwyneth Paltrow ou encore Asia Argento ont d'ailleurs avoué avoir subi des actes relevant du harcèlement sexuel, d'agressions voire de viol.

La femme d'Harvey Weinstein, Georgina Chapman, a annoncé tout récemment qu'elle le quittait par voie de communiqué, mettant fin à une relation longue de 10 ans.

Au centre de la polémique, Harvey Weinstein ne s'est pour l'instant que très peu exprimé. Seules quelques interviews accordées à la journaliste du New York Post, Emily Smith. Dans un long papier publié le 5 octobre dernier, elle avait retranscrit ses propos, lui laissant l'occasion de s'exprimer concernant cette affaire.

""Exclusif: Harvey Weinstein donne sa première interview après les allégations choquantes de harcèlement sexuel""

""Je porte la responsabilité de mes actes (...) Je dois changer, je dois travailler sur ma personnalité. Je sais que beaucoup de gens aimeraient que j'aille dans un établissement, et je vais peut-être le faire, j'irai où je peux en apprendre davantage sur moi-même. Je veux pouvoir regarder les gens que j'ai blessés et dire: 'Je suis désolé, j'ai changé et j'ai progressé'. Je suis terriblement embarrassé et la seule personne qui pourrait résoudre ce problème est moi"", avait affirmé le magnat hollywoodien dans des propos relayés par nos confrères.

Le producteur de ""Gangs of New York"" a aussi reconnu ""souffrir de troubles thérapeutiques"": ""J'ai la pire humeur de l'humanité, je crée de la tension, je suis émotif, c'est pourquoi je dois passer davantage de temps avec un thérapeute. Mon tempérament fait que les gens se sentent intimidés mais je ne sais même pas quand je le suis. Dans le passé, j'avais l'habitude de complimenter les gens et certains l'ont pris comme des remarques sexuelles.""

Et celui qui est au cœur de la tourmente médiatico-politique semble vouloir aller plus loin en fustigeant les méthodes du New York Times. A ce titre, il a déclaré: ""La raison pour laquelle je le poursuis est due à l'incapacité du Times à être honnête avec moi. Ils m'ont dit des mensonges. Ils ont fait des hypothèses.""

""Mon monde est en train de s'effondrer""

Lors de l'émission ""Page Six TV"" diffusée ce mercredi, la journaliste est revenue sur sa dernière discussion avec Harvey Weinstein qui s'est déroulée ce mardi soir. Et, à en croire ses déclarations, ce dernier serait désormais au bord du gouffre. ""Mon monde est en train de s'effondrer. Je n'arrive pas à croire ce qui se passe"" aurait déclaré l'homme âgé de 65 ans.

Enfin, Emily Smith a affirmé qu'il reconnaissait ses torts: ""Il admet qu'il a agi de la mauvaise manière, qu'il a blessé de nombreuses personnes et qu'il a besoin d'aide. Il n'arrive pas à croire qu'il a perdu toute sa carrière à Hollywood, ses fils et sa femme qu'il aimait par-dessus tout. Il est aussi très déçu du manque de soutien des gens à Hollywood à son endroit et regrette d'avoir perdu des amis du monde politique tels que Hillary (Hillary Clinton, ndlr) ou le couple Obama"".

Earlier today, Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Padmavati trailer was unveiled online.

With Bhansali, who is known to weave magic with his visuals, one expects nothing but a stunning canvass, and with Padmavati, it seems that he has trumped all of his past work.

Padmavati's trailer is moody and atmospheric with an appropriate background score that adds to the tension instead of overwhelming the proceedings.

His three actors: Deepika Padukone, Ranveer Singh, and Shahid Kapoor appear in top form, with Singh's Khilji (who looks a bit like Khal Drogo), looking much more menacing and mad than one initially imagined. To nobody's surprise, Padukone looks dreamy, gorgeous, and completely in command of her titular role.

Bhansali's past work has proven that he has the unique ability to mount films on a stupendous scale without muddling the narrative. Padmavati seems like an extension of the same body of work, but with a lot more ambition.

Produced by Viacom and Bhansali, film opens in cinemas on December 1.

Last month, it was reported that Ryan was Ramsey Street-bound, and would be playing the part of Raphael Humphreys in the Aussie soap, a year after stepping down from his role in ‘Corrie’.

He’s now confirmed this to be the case, and it sounds like his “loner” character’s arrival in ‘Neighbours’ is to coincide with the beginning of a “dark” era for the usually cheerful soap.

Channel 5 Ryan Thomas on the set of 'Neighbours'

Channel 5’s Commissioning Editor Greg Barnett commented: “With his good looks and Corrie years under his belt, Ryan is the perfect handsome devil. His arrival in Erinsborough marks the start of darker times for a particular Ramsay St favourite.

“Prepare to be gripped.”

Ryan added: “I was on holiday with my daughter when I got a phone call from my agent asking if I’d like to play this part…I spoke to the producer and found out more – it was very different from anything I’d played before – it was quite a deep, dark story, that really interested me.

“It’s a new challenge and I can’t wait to start filming.”

Ryan is best known for his portrayal of Jason Grimshaw in ‘Corrie’, a role he played for 16 years until making the decision to bow out last year.

Since leaving the ITV soap, he’s made an appearance on the reality show ‘Celebrity Island With Bear Grylls’, where he met his now-girlfriend, former ‘TOWIE’ star Lucy Mecklenburgh.

His first ‘Neighbours’ scenes are set to air “early next year”.

Wie ""Game of Thrones"" eine hässliche Wahrheit über uns selbst enthüllt Es war ein Moment, auf den sich die Fans der Fantasy-Serie Game of Thrones lange gefreut haben: Ramsay Bolton's Tod in der neunten Episode der aktuellen Staffel. Getötet wurde er ausgerechnet - oder: gerechterweise - durch Sansa Stark, eigentlich Ramsays Ehefrau, die er so lange drangsaliert und missbraucht hatte. Nicht nur Sansa, sondern auch alle Zuschauer und ich haben gelächelt, als Ramsay endlich sein verdientes Ende fand. Darf man das?

AHMEDABAD -- The Gujarat High Court is likely to pronounce its verdict on a set of appeals challenging convictions and acquittals by a special SIT court in the 2002 Godhra train coach burning case.

Coach S-6 of the Sabarmati Express, in which 59 people, mostly 'kar sevaks' returning from Ayodhya were travelling, was burnt on 27 February, 2002 at the Godhra station, triggering riots in the state.

The special SIT court had on 1 March, 2011 convicted 31 people and acquitted 63 in the case. While 11 people were sentenced to death, 20 were given life in jail.

Later, several appeals were filed in the High Court challenging the conviction, while the state government had questioned the acquittal of 63 people.

The court had convicted 31 people while accepting the prosecution's contention that there was a conspiracy behind the incident.

All the 31 were convicted under IPC sections related to murder, attempt to murder and criminal conspiracy.

Those acquitted included the prime accused, Maulana Umarji, the then president of Godhra Municipality Mohammad Hussain Kalota, Mohammad Ansari and Nanumiya Chaudhary of Gangapur, Uttar Pradesh.

The Nanavati Commission, appointed by the Gujarat government to probe the carnage, had concluded that the fire in the S-6 coach was not an accident, but it was set ablaze.

The research theorized that as a result of this belief, Grade 4 girls think they are less valued than boys.
Thus, more than one in five girls believe they need less schooling than their male peers.
In the U.S., more than one-third of Grade 4 children believe this as well.
""Globally, we know that girls are more likely than boys to miss out on school, experience violence and live in poverty.","In this day and age, we like to think that anything a boy can do, a girl can do too. But according to new data released by Save the Children, by Grade 4, kids already have biased views when it comes to gender, believing that boys are smarter and worth more than girls.

The survey asked fourth graders in the U.S., Sierra Leone, and Côte d'Ivoire a series of questions relating to male and female power dynamics. As a result, it found that nearly 40 per cent of boys in the U.S. believe they are smarter than their female counterparts, and that two out of three boys in the Western African nations believe the same.

The research theorized that as a result of this belief, Grade 4 girls think they are less valued than boys. Thus, more than one in five girls believe they need less schooling than their male peers.

It's not hard to see where children are picking up these biased beliefs. Gender stereotypes are clearly to blame, as over 90 per cent of kids in Sierra Leone believe dads are the head of the household and moms are in charge of the kids. In the U.S., more than one-third of Grade 4 children believe this as well.

17 per cent of U.S. fourth graders believe a man would make a better boss than a woman.

While stereotypes of moms and dads are changing with more men than ever opting to be stay-at-home fathers and more women becoming career-focused after having kids, the change isn't happening fast enough to combat kids' gender bias.

Sadly, the finding that 17 per cent of U.S. fourth graders believe a man would make a better boss than a woman is proof.

""Girls are worth far more than what the world tells them,"" Carolyn Miles, president & CEO of Save the Children, said in a statement. ""Globally, we know that girls are more likely than boys to miss out on school, experience violence and live in poverty.

""That is why we need to invest in their education and do everything possible to delay early marriage and motherhood. By providing children equal opportunities and access to learning, every girl can realize what she's truly worth.""

Save the Children launched their survey on Oct. 11, also known as International Day of the Girl, to highlight the discrimination and inequality women and girls face today.

Last month, a global study confirmed Save the Children's findings that gender stereotypes are established in children far earlier than we thought. In fact, the Global Early Adolescent Study found that by the age of 10, gender roles are already ""firmly rooted.""

As a result, these stereotypes ""leave girls at greater risk of dropping out of school or suffering physical and sexual violence, child marriage, early pregnancy, HIV and other sexually transmitted infections,"" the report read.

So what can parents do to combat gender bias and stereotypes? According to Dr. Christia Spears Brown, an associate professor of developmental psychology at the University of Kentucky, you can start by taking gender out of your language and by focusing on kids as individuals.

Matthew Taylor told a parliamentary inquiry into modern work on Wednesday that consumer convenience could negate worries over the minimum wage, holiday and sick pay.

“Part of the reason well intentioned people use Uber is that when they speak to Uber drivers they generally enjoy being Uber drivers,” Taylor told a joint committee of MPs.

Parliament Jobs tsar Matthew Taylor said workers' rights could be seen as a price worth paying for the convenience of platform apps like Uber

“I use Uber from time to time and if I got an Uber car and the driver said to me ‘My life is one of misery and oppression’, then I wouldn’t do it again.

“[Instead] they say ‘It is good to be able to drive when I want to drive’. And I think there are certain benefits of that platform, you know about the driver and the way you can rate it and those kinds of things.

“I think it is a legitimate business model as long as it abides by the general regulatory framework that we want for our labour market.

“But... if drivers find they can’t work when they want to and if consumers don’t have the service when they want it, then we may well find that people say ‘If that’s the price we have to pay, we don’t want the regulations’.”

Some 600,000 people have signed a petition to keep Uber in London after the firm lost its operating licence in a shock ruling by Transport for London (TfL).

“I think it is very important to think about what it is workers and citizens value in these platforms,” Taylor added.

‘Bit of a sin’

One Labour MP said people who use Uber think it is “a bit of a sin” to do so as a result of “pretty dodgy working practices”, but they think “to hell with it”.

“Convenience for consumers seems to be trumping everything,” Peter Kyle said.

The MP for Hove, east Sussex, said that Uber were “revelling in their bad boy status” and “going to war against regulators”.

TfL, which regulates transport in the capital, said its review of Uber’s operation had found the firm was not a “fit and proper” operator, citing public safety concerns.

Taylor’s review into modern work and the so-called gig economy, commissioned by Prime Minister Theresa May, was published over the summer.

It recommended that those working for apps like Uber be considered “dependent contractors” and be entitled to some workers’ rights such as the minimum wage, holiday and sick pay.

The report will be used to inform future laws and regulations which will need to reflect the changing nature of work in Britain.

Currently Uber drivers are technically self-employed and choose when and where they work. As a result they are not entitled to the national minimum wage.

But two Uber drivers have taken the firm to an employment tribunal over their rights, arguing they are, in fact, workers for the firm.

Lead claimants, James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam, won a case last November which found the pair were workers for the firm and entitled to benefits such as the minimum wage, sick pay and annual leave. Uber is now appealing that decision.","Public Love Of Uber Could Override Concern For Workers' Rights, Warns Jobs Tsar",http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2017/10/11/uber-matthew-taylor_n_18235174.html?utm_hp_ref=uk

Dass Hollywood-Produzent Harvey Weinstein mittlerweile untragbar ist, sollte eigentlich außer Frage stehen. Immerhin haben sich in den vergangenen Tagen fast 30 Frauen zu Wort gemeldet und angegeben, von dem Filmmogul sexuell belästigt worden zu sein. Zu den Betroffenen zählen auch bekannte Schauspielerinnen wie Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie und Ashley Judd.

Doch Ex-Teeniestar Lindsay Lohan, bekannt aus Filmen wie “Girlsclub” oder “Ein Zwilling kommt selten allein”, schlägt sich nun auf die Seite von Weinstein. In einem Video, das die heute 31-Jährige auf Instagram postete, verurteilt sie den Gegenwind, den der Produzent gerade von allen Seiten erfährt. “Harvey Weinstein tut mir sehr leid. Ich finde das, was gerade gegen ihn läuft, falsch”, sagt Lohan in die Kamera.

Man sollte meinen, es sei eine gute Sache, wenn Männer, die ihre Machtposition missbrauchen, um Frauen zu belästigen, zur Rechenschaft gezogen werden. Während Donald Trump, gegen den im November ähnliche Vorwürfe erhoben worden waren, es trotzdem bis zum Präsidenten der Vereinigten Staaten gebracht hat, wurde Weinstein inzwischen von seinem eigenen Filmstudio gefeuert.

Lohan: “Er hat mich nie belästigt”

Die Vorwürfe gegen Weinstein werden täglich mehr. Doch Lohan hält fest: “Harvey und ich haben mehrere Filme zusammen gedreht und er hat mich nie belästigt.” Anscheinend ist es für die Schauspielerin unvorstellbar, dass nicht jeder Mensch dieselben Lebenserfahrungen gemacht hat, wie sie.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: An den Mann an der Ampel, der mich fragte, ob ich Sex mit ihm will

Aber: Sie erkennt nicht nur die Vorwürfe der Frauen, die Weinstein beschuldigen, nicht an. Nein, sie kritisiert auch noch seine Frau Georgina Chapman, die sich inzwischen von ihm getrennt hat. “Ich finde Georgina sollte zu ihrem Mann stehen.”

Zwar hat Lohan das Video später gelöscht, doch “Buzzfeed”-Autorin Lauren Cap hatte es bereits heruntergeladen und auf Twitter veröffentlicht.

In October 2015, a little over a year after Narendra Modi became prime minister, the price of pulses suddenly saw a sharp increase. It was, as it often is, election season. Narendra Modi had staked his own persona in the high-pitched battle for Bihar. Lalu Yadav's supporters came up with a biting slogan: Arhar Modi, a pun on Har Har Modi, Ghar Ghar Modi – the slogan for the PM's Lok Sabha campaign in Varanasi.

Arhar dal, also known as Tur or Split Pigeon Pea, is an Indian staple. Since Arhar Modi, the government has imported pulses in such large quantity that it has caused a glut in the market. There's mayhem among farmers, they are unable to sell pulses even at the minimum support price, which they complain is already a lot less than minimum should be.

It was only in May 2017 the government finally relented and decreased its Tur import quota, increasing the import duty on it. In financial year 2016-17, the total import of pulses increased by 20 percent.

By not raising MSP the Modi government is exacerbating rural distress, but it doesn't seem to mind: controlling inflation is the top priority.

Agriculture expert Devender Sharma has wondered why the government has been punishing Indian farmers — increasing pulses at a high price while refusing to increase the MSP — making prices crash and farming unviable. While the government has been causing a glut of pulses so that sudden lack of supply doesn't result in inflation, it doesn't want to increase the money in the farmers' pockets as their consumption will boost rural demand and hence inflation. (The government blamed back-to-back droughts as the need to increase imports.)

By not raising MSP the Modi government is exacerbating rural distress, but it doesn't seem to mind: controlling inflation is the top priority.

The case of Tur Dal is just a snapshot of Modi's one-point economic policy: keeping inflation low at any cost. And the Bihar election was no turning point; inflation had been a top priority for Modi from day one.

In March 2015, the Modi government and the Raghuram Rajan-led Reserve Bank of India agreed to make a historic change in India's monetary policy, making inflation-targeting the centerpiece of it. They agreed to amend the RBI Act and create a monetary policy committee that would give the centre a greater say than earlier.

Just before Rajan stepped down as RBI chief, the government agreed with him on setting an inflation target of 4%, with a minimum of 2% and maximum of 6%. Rajan was criticised by many for sacrificing growth at the altar of inflation targeting, because this required him to not lower interest rates beyond a point.

Split pigeon peas are displayed for sale in a store at a local market in Hyderabad, India, on Saturday, July 9, 2016.

But after Rajan left, the RBI and the government have continued with the policy. Modi even hailed inflation targeting in his 2016 independence day speech.

The BJP's in-house loose canon, Subramanian Swamy, had called Raghuram Rajan ""mentally not fully Indian"" for choosing inflation targeting over rate cuts, alleging that he was wrecking the Indian economy. Swamy had demanded Rajan's sacking. But the Modi government's backing of inflation targeting has only proved that it needed that move more than Rajan.

It is nearly impossible for any central government to be re-elected if there's high inflation. People react instantly and angrily to mehngai, price rise, and never blame state governments or global factors for it. In a emerging economy like India, keeping inflation low is often difficult. High growth needs high economic activity resulting in high inflation. Between high growth and losing elections, the Modi government has made a clear choice.

Between high growth and losing elections, the Modi government has made a clear choice.

Given the Reserve Bank of India has lost its claims to being an autonomous institution since demonetisation, it's clear who is calling the shots on the monetary policy.

Demonetisation, by stifling economic activity, resulted in lowering inflation even further. That may well have been one of the considerations in going ahead with demonetisation: an unintended side benefit.

One great risk to inflation is the Goods and Services Tax. Across the world, the introduction of GST, with all the preparation and precautions, results in raising inflation substantially for a year or two. (Thereafter, it helps bring keep inflation in check.)

This is why the government was in a crying hurry to introduce GST in the middle of the financial year. It didn't want GST to happen too close to 2019. Despite keeping more than half the items of the Consumer Price Index out of GST, it is already contributing to raising inflation again. But thanks to the dip caused by demonetisation, GST-caused inflation won't pinch as much.

Defending his government's management of the economy last week, the first data point the prime minister showed was a comparison of inflation in his three years and the last three years of UPA-2.

Inflation over the years. pic.twitter.com/iP6gyhoLGh — PMO India (@PMOIndia) October 4, 2017

While UPA-2 lost the political narrative to one alleged scam after another, surveys showed people were most angry about inflation. Thanks to generous increases in MSPs for farmers, high crude prices and other factors, the UPA years were marked by high inflation.

The Modi government has been lucky with inflation thanks to record low oil prices, but those are rising again. There have been other factors, such as the increase in wages of government employees. The economic slowdown, caused partially by the disastrous decision of demonetisation, is helping Modi succeed in his one-point economic agenda: low inflation.

The government could increase MSP for farmers, and provide a rural stimulus, just before the 2019 elections, possibly in the forthcoming budget. That way, it would hope to appease farmers, while making sure inflation impact is not felt before the summer of 2019.",Modi Has A One-Point Economic Agenda And It’s Succeeding,http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/10/12/modi-has-a-one-point-economic-agenda-and-it-s-succeeding_a_23240771/

Although there are many faces of mental illness, I'd like to spotlight Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) which is often greatly misunderstood. OCD can affect anyone, and according to the Canadian Psychological Association approximately 1% to 2% of the Canadian population will have an episode of OCD in their lifetime.

What is OCD?

OCD is made up of two parts – obsessions and compulsions. Obsessions are unwanted and repetitive thoughts, urges or images that don't go away. Compulsions are behaviours like washing, cleaning or ordering things in a certain way. Over 90% of people with clinical OCD have both obsessions and compulsions, with 25% to 50% reporting multiple obsessions. Although many people who suffer from OCD are aware that their obsessions and compulsions don't make sense, they still can't control them. While we often associate OCD with people who wash their hands constantly, are germ phobic or refuse to shake hands, sadly, people with OCD are frequently the butt-end of jokes. We know that OCD is anything but funny; in fact, it is often a debilitating mental illness that severely affects a person's ability to enjoy life.

Additionally, OCD often interferes with work and negatively impacts relationships. In severe cases, obsessive thoughts and repetitive, compulsive rituals can consume the entire day, making it difficult to hold down a job or maintain personal relationships.

What causes OCD?

The cause of OCD has not been established. Studies have suggested that the cause may be genetic, biological and/or psychological, but as yet there is nothing definitive.

Some signs of OCD

In the workplace, you may notice:

Excessive hand washing and/or hand wringing

Refusal to shake hands

Everything on their desk has to be precisely arranged

May become visibly upset if you touch or move any of their things

Need to check and recheck their work

Late to meetings because of their need to ""prepare"" again and again

Appear to be lost in thought because of their obsessions

How best to support an employee with OCD

There are several effective ways to support an employee with OCD. An EAP is an excellent resource for a person suffering from OCD. You can also gently encourage your employee to seek medical help as medication and therapy can benefit the OCD sufferer. There are also modifications and accommodations that you can make to better support them at your organization:

Allow telecommuting

Issue deadlines as much in advance as possible

Try not to put the person in situations where frequent handshaking is expected

Make hand sanitizer readily available

Avoid disturbing the setup on the employee's desk

Don't ask to borrow their office supplies or equipment

If possible, avoid putting the employee in stressful situations as stress is a major trigger of OCD

Do you have a process in place to accommodate employees suffering from OCD or other forms of mental illness? If not, a referral to the EAP and the willingness to make modifications in the workplace will go a long way to setting up employees for success and ensuring that your employees are feeling supported by their employer.",Spotlight On Mental Health: Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/charles-benayon-/spotlight-on-mental-health-obsessive-compulsive-disorder_a_23240044/

Diese tiefe Überzeugung ist der Grund für einen weltweiten und jahrzehntelangen Krieg gegen Drogen, der in vielen Ländern bis heute andauert.

Die wahre Ursache von Sucht ist jedoch nicht die Droge an sich - es ist vielmehr eine schmerzhafte Erfahrung, die ein Ungleichgewicht im Leben auslöst. Und diese schmerzhafte Erfahrung lässt sich zumeist auf Erlebnisse in der Kindheit zurückführen. Am häufigsten trifft das auf emotionalen und körperlichen Missbrauch zu, aber es gibt auch weniger offensichtliche Auslöser. (Mehr dazu oben im Video)

“Nicht alle Abhängigkeiten haben ihren Ursprung in Missbrauch oder Traumata, aber ich bin überzeugt, dass sie alle auf schmerzhafte Erfahrungen zurückgeführt werden können”, sagte Gabor Maté, ein kanadischer Arzt, der sich seit Jahrzehnten mit Sucht und der Bekämpfung von Abhängigkeiten beschäftigt.

Schmerz im Zentrum der Abhängigkeit

Maté glaubt, dass Schmerz im Zentrum jeder Abhängigkeit steht - egal, ob es Drogensucht, Internet-Abhängigkeit, Spielsucht, Kaufsucht, Magersucht oder Sucht nach Arbeit ist.

“Die Wunde mag nicht sehr tief erscheinen und der Schmerz nicht unerträglich - vielleicht ist die Verletzung sogar vollkommen verborgen - aber sie ist da”, sagte Maté.

Und wer Schmerz empfindet, der wird versuchen, diesem Schmerz zu entkommen.

Sucht ist die Krebserkrankung der Seele

“Wer seelisch belastet ist, sucht nach Entlastung und findet diese unter anderem in Alkohol, Drogen oder Medikamenten”, schreibt Psychotherapeut Ralf Schneider in “Die Suchtfiebel”.

Das bedeutet aber nicht, dass jeder, der eine schmerzhafte Erfahrung in der Kindheit gemacht hat, später auch eine Abhängigkeit entwickelt. Jeder Mensch geht mit Verletzungen ein wenig anders um.

Es gibt jedoch Erlebnisse in der Kindheit, die Schmerz verursachen und dadurch Abhängigkeiten begünstigen. Sie können frühzeitig von Eltern vermieden werden, indem sie sich bewusst machen, dass bestimmte Erziehungsmethoden Schaden verursachen.

6 Erlebnisse in der Kindheit, die Schmerz auslösen:



1. Die fehlende Befriedigung von Grundbedürfnissen

Geborgenheit, Schutz und Liebe sind ebenso wichtige Grundbedürfnisse von Babys und Kleinkindern wie Hunger und Durst. Werden sie nicht befriedigt, gerät das Kind in eine Notsituation: Es ist schließlich von den Eltern abhängig und es hat nur seine Stimme und möglicherweise noch keine Sprache, um sich mitzuteilen.

Wenn Eltern ihre Kinder zum Beispiel schreien lassen - etwa, weil sie glauben, dass Babys so lernen, allein einzuschlafen (was nicht der Fall ist - die Babys haben nicht aus der Erfahrung gelernt, sie haben schlichtweg aufgegeben), können sie damit unwissentlich erheblichen Schaden anrichten.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Das passiert mit Babys, die man schreien lässt

Das Schreienlassen hat keinerlei pädagogischen Wert

Babys und Kleinkinder sind geistig noch nicht weit genug entwickelt, um logische Schlussfolgerungen aus dem Verhalten ihrer Eltern zu ziehen. Sie weinen nicht, um ihre Eltern zu ärgern oder zu manipulieren, sondern weil sie irgendein Problem, irgendein Bedürfnis haben.

Viele Kinder fühlen sich nur in der Nähe ihrer Eltern sicher genug, um einschlafen zu können. Denn genau da, in der Nähe ihrer Eltern, sind Kinder nunmal am sichersten aufgehoben und aus Sicht der Evolution am besten geschützt.

Schreienlassen schädigt Körper und Seele

Wenn das Kind also weint, dann ruft es nach seinen Eltern. Reagieren die Eltern jedoch nicht darauf, entsteht Stress. Das Hormon Cortisol wird vermehrt ausgeschüttet. Dies kann Experten zufolge das zentrale Nervensystem sowie die Gehirnentwicklung beeinträchtigen. Und neben diesen körperlichen Auswirkungen bleiben natürlich auch die Seelischen nicht aus.

Wenn Kinder das Gefühl haben, so viel schreien zu können, wie sie wollen und doch nicht gehört zu werden, entstehen Schmerz und Unsicherheit, in besonders schlimmen Fällen sogar Traumata.

Bindungsprobleme, Schlafstörungen, Ängste und Depressionen können mögliche Folgen sein. Aber auch Abhängigkeiten und Süchte.

Schwere Versagungen in der Befriedigung von Grundbedürfnissen, die Dauerstress und Hilflosigkeit hervorbringen, können sich laut Schneider auf die Bereitschaft zum Drogenkonsum auswirken. In der “Suchtfiebel” schreibt er: “Offensichtlich erzeugt der frühe Stress eine Veränderung im Gehirn.”

2. Die Erfahrung, dass Liebe an Bedingungen geknüpft ist

Fast alle Eltern würden voller Überzeugung behaupten, dass sie ihr Kind bedingungslos lieben. Es sind jedoch vergleichsweise wenige, denen das wirklich und in letzter Konsequenz gelingt.

“Es gibt ganz wenige Kinder auf der Welt, die das Glück hatten, um ihrer Selbst willen geliebt zu werden”, sagte der bekannte deutsche Hirnforscher Gerald Hüther der Huffington Post.

Dabei ist genau das aus seiner Sicht die Grundvoraussetzung für eine glückliche Kindheit:

“Ein Kind muss spüren, dass es so wie es ist richtig ist. Dass es um seiner Selbst willen und bedingungslos geliebt wird. Das ist die wichtigste Erfahrung, die jedes Kind braucht”, sagte Hüther der HuffPost.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Ein Hirnforscher erklärt: Das ist das Geheimnis einer glücklichen Kindheit

Zuneigung im Tausch gegen Gehorsam

Kinder sind dann am glücklichsten, wenn sie nicht das Gefühl haben, sich anstrengen zu müssen, um von ihren Eltern geliebt zu werden.

Viele Kinder haben jedoch das Gefühl, dass ihre Eltern sie mehr lieben würden, wenn ihre Schulnoten besser wären. Oder wenn sie immer artig und hilfsbereit wären, nie widersprechen oder in Wut ausbrechen würden.

Es ist leider bis heute eine gängige Erziehungsmethode, Kinder mit Zuneigung zu belohnen, die sich so verhalten, wie ihre Eltern (oder auch Lehrer, Erzieher) das gerne hätten. Und die meisten Erwachsenen meinen das nicht einmal böse - ihnen ist schlichtweg nicht bewusst, dass dieses Verhalten extrem verletzend ist.

Ein Kind, das spürt, dass es nicht bedingungslos geliebt wird, hat ein sehr großes Problem. Denn Kinder sind von der Zuneigung ihrer Eltern abhängig - das hat die Natur so vorgesehen.

Das empfindliche Band der Liebe

Aus diesem Grund kommen sie bereits mit einem sicheren Band des Vertrauens und der Verbundenheit zu ihren Eltern zu Welt. Weil sie ihre Eltern lieben und sie brauchen, sind Kinder bereit, alles zu tun, um ebenfalls geliebt zu werden, damit sie sich weiterhin auf den Schutz und die Fürsorge der Eltern verlassen können.

Doch diese besondere Verbindung, dieses natürliche Band des Vertrauens zwischen Eltern und Kind, ist empfindlich.

“Wenn ein Kind zum Objekt elterlicher Erwartungen, Wünsche, Ziele, Vorstellungen oder Maßnahmen gemacht wird, dann zerreißt dieses Band zu den Eltern”, sagte Hüther. “Und das geht mit einem großen Schmerz einher.”

Der Schmerz des unvollkommenen Kindes

Dieser Schmerz ist sogar messbar. In wissenschaftlichen Versuchen konnte nachgewiesen werden, dass dies derselbe Schmerz ist, den der Körper auch bei physischem Schmerz signalisiert. Es werden dieselben Bereiche im Gehirn aktiviert, die auch betroffen sind, wenn wir körperliche Schmerzen erleben.

Diesen Schmerz, der entsteht, wenn wir als Kind das Gefühl haben, nicht vollkommen zu sein, verarbeitet jeder Menschen anders.

Manche Menschen werden ihr Leben lang versuchen sich anzustrengen, um geliebt und akzeptiert zu werden. Andere werden sich möglicherweise mit schmerzlindernden Substanzen behelfen.

3. Ein überfürsorgliches Verhalten der Eltern, das zu Verunsicherung führt

“Wenn man Suchtkranke rückblickend fragt, welche seelischen Ursachen ihr Substanzkonsum gehabt hat, erhält man unzählig viele plausible Antworten. Überrepräsentiert scheinen diejenigen zu sein, die sich nicht trauen, Risiken einzugehen, die sich ‘Mut antrinken’ oder ihre Hemmungen durch Drogenkonsum herabsetzen, die also Angst verringern”, schreibt Schneider in der “Suchtfiebel”.

Die Bereitschaft, Risiken einzugehen und furchtlos auf Herausforderungen zuzugehen, wird zu großen Teilen in der Kindheit geformt.

Kinder müssen hinfallen dürfen

Kinder müssen unbeaufsichtigt spielen, sie müssen sich sogar in gewissem Maße in Gefahr begeben, um zu erkennen, wo ihre eigenen Grenzen liegen.

“Es kann kein Kind lernen, wie man aufsteht, wenn es nie hinfällt. Es kann kein Kind laufen lernen, wenn ihm die Steine weggeräumt werden”, sagte Gerald Hüther der HuffPost.

So schwer es auch fällt - man tut einem Kind wirklich keinen Gefallen, wenn man es vor jeder Gefahr beschützt.

4. Der Mangel an freiem Spiel, der zu Fantasielosigkeit führt

Eine lebhafte Fantasie könnte ein sehr effektiver Schutz vor der Entwicklung von Suchtkrankheiten sein. Zu dieser Erkenntnis kommt Eckhard Schiffer, Autor der Bestsellers “Warum Huckleberry Finn nicht süchtig wurde”.

Bei seiner jahrelangen Arbeit mit Suchtkranken stellte Schiffer fest, dass Öde und Langeweile Vorboten späterer Abhängigkeiten sein können. Viele Patienten würden Suchtmittel benutzen, um einer inneren Leere zu entkommen.

Und diese Öde und Langeweile entsteht aus seiner Sicht durch einen Mangel an Fantasie, die wiederum auf einen Mangel des freien Spiels in der Kindheit zurückgeht - ein Problem, von dem heute immer mehr Kinder betroffen sind.

Der Angriff auf das freie Spiel

Das freie Spiel wird durch zwei entscheidende Entwicklungen beeinträchtigt: Zum einen bleibt Kindern immer weniger Zeit zum Spielen, weil viele Eltern wollen, dass ihre Kinder neben der Schule in Sport-, Musik- oder Sprachkursen weiter gefördert werden.

Zum anderen wird heute immer mehr in das kindliche Spiel eingegriffen, sodass es seine Spontanität und Regellosigkeit verliert; Es wird weniger um des Spielens Willen gespielt und mehr, um ein bestimmtes Ergebnis zu erzielen. Wir greifen viel zu häufig in das kindliche Spiel ein, indem wir organisieren, zeigen, “wie es besser geht”, erklären, dass Bäume grüne und nicht blaue Blätter haben.

Kreativität schützt den Geist

Kreativität und Fantasie entstehen jedoch genau da, wo das Kind frei sein darf. Wo alles erlaubt und alles möglich ist. Ein Kind, das ausreichend spielen darf, wird sich nicht langweilen. Es wird immer neue Möglichkeiten finden, sich zu beschäftigen und dafür braucht es nicht einmal Spielzeug.

Die so gewonnene Kreativität wird ihm ein Leben lang helfen, Lösungen für die komplexesten Probleme zu finden. Um die Ecke zu denken, sein Denken nicht durch andere einschränken zu lassen. Und sie wird es vor der Öde und Leere bewahren, die Abhängigkeit und Sucht - und sei es “nur” eine Konsumsucht, Kaufsucht oder Spielsucht - begünstigt.

5. Das Leistungsprinzip unserer Gesellschaft, dem Kinder unterworfen werden

Was Kinder heute leisten müssen, ist enorm. Schule um acht Uhr morgens, Konzentration und möglichst rege Beteiligung in allen Fächern, anschließend Hausaufgaben und außerschulische Aktivitäten - schon Kinder haben einen straffen Zeitplan, arbeiten also teilweise so viel wie Erwachsene.

Und das ist alles in Ordnung, sobald man nicht aus dem Raster fällt, hinter den Erwartungen zurückbleibt oder das schnelle Tempo einfach nicht mitgehen kann.

Schon im Kindergarten wird den Kleinsten beigebracht: Nur wer hart arbeitet, kann erfolgreich sein. Und nur wer erfolgreich ist, kann glücklich sein.

Kinder sollen funktionieren und Leistung erbringen

Wir bläuen unseren Kindern ein, dass sie gute Noten brauchen, um später mithalten zu können. Kommen sie mit einer Drei nach Hause, machen wir ihnen klar, dass sie doch auch eine Zwei haben könnten, wenn sie sich nur ein bisschen mehr anstrengten. Was viele Kinder aber hören, ist: Du würdest uns besser gefallen, wenn du bessere Noten hättest. Eine Fünf auf dem Zeugnis würde uns sehr enttäuschen.

“36 Prozent aller Eltern sind bereit, ihren zehnjährigen Kindern Arzneimittel zur Verbesserung der Konzentration zu geben”, schreibt Schneider in der “Suchtfiebel”. Dieses Leistungsstreben fordert jedoch seinen Preis: “Unter den guten Schülern ist der Anteil derjenigen, die regelmäßig Medikamente konsumieren, am höchsten.”

Über solche karriere- und kulturbeflissenen Familien schreibt Schiffer:

“Hier wird eine andauernde innere Friedlosigkeit erzeugt, denn die Leistung der eigenen Kinder steht im Vergleich zu der der jeweils anderen. Die Szene wird von Konkurrenz und Marktwert beherrscht. Was ist mein Marktwert? Wie steche ich meinen Konkurrenten aus?”

Das falsche Selbst vergiftet die Seele

So entstünde schließlich ein falsches Selbst. “Und das ist wegen der inneren Friedlosigkeit sucht- oder dopinggefährdet.”

Unsere Leistungsgesellschaft macht diejenigen zu Verlierern, die nicht mithalten können. Wer die Erwartungen nicht erfüllt, versucht häufig, sich zu verbiegen - jenes falsche Selbst zu erschaffen, um nicht ausgeschlossen zu werden.

Der daraus resultierende Stress, das andauernde Streben nach Erfolg und Glück, das doch scheinbar nie wirklich erreicht werden kann, ist Gift für die Seele. Für Kinderseelen noch viel mehr als für Erwachsene.

Das ständige Gefühl, nicht gut genug zu sein, löst einen Schmerz aus. Vielleicht einen, der zunächst unter der Oberfläche schlummert, wie Maté es ausdrückte, aber eben einen, der durchaus spürbar ist.

Es ist genau dieses Leistungsstreben, das zu den neuen Volkskrankheiten wie Depressionen und Burnout führt - und das ein Bedürfnis nach Ablenkung, Flucht und nach Betäubung auslösen kann.

6. Die Angst vor dem Versagen, die Eltern auf ihre Kinder übertragen

Es ist nicht leicht, heute ein Kind zu erziehen und viele Eltern fühlen sich stark unter Druck gesetzt. Hinzu kommt häufig die Angst, zu versagen. Was, wenn mein Kind in der Schule nicht gut genug ist? Was, wenn es in dieser globalisierten Leistungsgesellschaft nicht mithalten kann?

Viele Eltern wollen ihre Kinder beschützen und greifen deshalb sehr stark in ihr Leben ein. Sie planen ihre Freizeit, sie greifen in ihr Spiel ein, sie erwarten, dass ihr Kind ihre Erwartungen erfüllt. Sie glauben, dass sie es aus Liebe tun. In Wahrheit jedoch steckt Angst dahinter:

Elterliche Geborgenheit könne schnell in einen Würgegriff umschlagen, schreibt Schiffer, “wenn die Eltern aus eigener Not heraus nicht mehr die Bedürfnisse und Interessen ihres Kindes im Auge haben, sondern vorwiegend ihre eigene Angst in Schach halten"".

Leistung als magisches Mittel gegen die Angst

Das Heilmittel, das unsere Gesellschaft für diese Angst erfunden hat, heißt Leistung. Solange man nur hart genug arbeitet, wird man nicht untergehen.

“Leistung als magisches Mittel gegen Angst wird heute schon von Kindern eingefordert”, schreibt Schiffer. “Und ebendies bedeutet eine erhebliche Einschränkung der Autonomie und des eigenen Weges.”

Kinder, die nicht selbst bestimmen, nicht selbst ihre Umwelt entdecken und erleben, nicht ihren eigenen Interessen in ihrem eigenen Tempo folgen dürfen, verlieren ihren Eigensinn.

Dröhnungen gegen die Langeweile

Der Verlust des Eigensinns bleibt jedoch nicht ohne Folgen:

“Wenn Erwachsene die Fähigkeit, sich in tagträumerischer Weise von ihrer Umwelt ansprechen zu lassen und so stöbernd, stutzend, und staunend innerlich viel zu erleben, verloren bzw. nicht ausreichend erworben haben, dann verlieren sie einen Teil ihres Eigensinns. Un diesem Augenblick sind sie auf Mittel, Medien, ‘Dröhnungen’ angewiesen, um etwas zu erleben.”

Was Kinder also viel mehr brauchen als gute Zeugnisse und gradlinige Lebensläufe sind Freiräume. Platz für Abenteuer, Räume zur Selbstentfaltung. Und die Chance, auch mal scheitern zu dürfen.

In den Wahlprogrammen der möglichen Jamaika-Koalitionäre zeigen sich tiefe Gräben

Aber sie sind nicht unüberwindbar

Es ist ein Bündnis, das viele Hoffnungen weckt - und nach dem schlechten Abschneiden der Union und SPD bei der Bundestagswahl nun realistischer ist als je zuvor: Eine sogenannte Jamaika-Koalition aus Union, FDP und Grünen.

Sie gilt unter ihren Befürwortern als progressiver als die Große Koalition und bürgerlicher als Rot-Rot-Grün. Unter ihr könnten drängende Zukunftsthemen angegangen werden.

Die FDP treibt die Digitalisierung und den Wettbewerb mit weniger Staat voran, die Grünen den Klimaschutz und Europa. Und die Union steht für innere und äußere Sicherheit.

Allen Parteien zeigen sich gesprächsbereit - ihnen ist aber auch klar: Jamaika ist kein Selbstläufer.

Mehr oder weniger rote Linien haben alle potenziellen Partner gezogen - in der Klima- und Sozialpolitik, vor allem aber in der Flüchtlings- und Einwanderungspolitik.

Grüne und FDP haben Zehn-Punkte-Kataloge vorgelegt. Zoff aber dürfte es vor allem mit der CSU geben, Störfeuer aus München sind zu erwarten.

Es schwirrt deswegen noch ein anderes Wort durch Berlin. Es heißt Neuwahlen. Die sind natürlich hochhypothetisch, aber ein Schreckgespenst - weil sie eine Staatskrise auslösen, die AfD stärken und die Volksparteien weiter schwächen könnten.

Wie realistisch ist also Jamaika? Hier sind 5 Konflikte, an denen das Bündnis scheitern könnte - und warum sie wahrscheinlich gelöst werden.

1. Klimaschutz: Rote Linie für die Grünen

Es ist das wichtigste Thema für die Grünen, sagte Parteichef Cem Özdemir am Montag in der Bundespressekonferenz. Hier wird sich die Partei also wenig reinreden lassen.

Im einen entscheidenen Streitthema hat sich Özdemir allerdings bereits kompromissbereit gezeigt.

Die Grünen treten in ihrem Wahlprogramm dafür ein, ab dem Jahr 2030 keine Autos mit Verbrennungsmotor mehr neu zuzulassen. Die CSU wiederum will keinen Koalitionsvertrag unterschreiben, in dem ein Enddatum für den Verbrennungsmotor festgehalten ist.

Die Liberalen halten nichts von einem Verbot von Verbrennungsmotoren. CDU-Chefin und Kanzlerin Angela Merkel sieht den Verbrennungsmotor allenfalls als eine Brückentechnologie an.

Grünen-Chef Özdemir ließ also erkennen, dass 2030 als Enddatum für Benziner und Diesel nicht durchsetzbar sein könnte, da man ja nicht allein regiere.

2. Energiepolitik: Kompromisse von allen Parteien nötig

Hier müssen alle Koalitionspartner Kompromisse eingehen.

► Die Grünen wollen die 20 schmutzigsten Kohlekraftwerke sofort dicht machen und bis 2030 ganz aus der Kohle aussteigen.

► Die Union ist für einen Ausstieg zumindest aus der Braunkohle, ohne sich aber auf ein Datum festzulegen.

► Die FDP versteht sich als Partei des Wettbewerbs, des schlanken Staates und des freien Unternehmertums.

Auch sie steht zu den Klimazielen von Paris und der EU, will aber Korrekturen und weniger Vorgaben. Beim Ausbau von Ökostrom dürfte es etliche Reibereien geben.

3. Flüchtlingspolitik: Was wird aus der Obergrenze?

Ein entscheidendes Thema wird die Obergrenze sein, das Steckenpferd der CSU.

""Wir werden darauf bestehen. Ich hab das jeden Tag dem Wähler versprochen"", sagte Seehofer in einer Pressekonferenz am Montag. Zu einer Bedingung hat er es bislang allerdings nicht gemacht.

Gegen die Obergrenze sind CDU, Grüne und auch die FDP. Letztere ist nicht bereit, das Grundgesetz dafür zu ändern. Auch der Familiennachzug könnte unter den Jamaika-Parteien für Diskussion sorgen - die Grünen wollen ihn erleichtern.

FDP und Grüne sind zudem für ein Einwanderungsgesetz und ein Punktesystem zur Steuerung der Zuwanderung. Auch hier müssen sie sich zunächst vor allem mit der Union auf einen gemeinsamen Nenner verständigen.

4. Steuerpolitik: Wenig Verhandlungsmasse

Hier profitieren die Parteien davon, dass sie im Wahlkampf wenig bis gar keine konkreten Versprechen gemacht haben.

Alle Parteien wollen den Soli abschaffen und untere und mittlere Einkommen entlasten.

Kritisch wird es bei Einkommens-, Erbschafts- und Vermögenssteuer. Die Grünen etwa sind für eine Vermögenssteuer, die mit der FDP nicht zu machen ist.

5. Europapolitik: Hardliner FDP

Auf diesem Gebiet sorgt vor allem die FDP im Ausland für Unruhe. Die Liberalen könnten in einer neuen Regierung darauf dringen, bei den Euro-Regeln kompromissloser aufzutreten.

Die Liberalen lehnen einen gemeinsamen Haushalt für die Euro-Zone ab und wollen die EU-Verträge so ändern, dass der Austritt eines Landes aus der Euro-Zone nicht auch den Austritt aus der EU nach sich zieht.

Darauf angesprochen, gab sich die Kanzlerin heute in ihrer Pressekonferenz vorsichtig - und sagte, dass sie sich erst mit der FDP abstimmen müsse.

Die CDU ist in Europa-Fragen eher auf Linie der Grünen. Einen Reformerfolg in Frankreich wünschen sich alle Beteiligten.

Ein Schwarm von 30.000 Bienen hatte sich dort eingenistet

Wie ein Imker die Bienen entfernt, seht ihr im Video oben

Ein Mann aus Hillside in New Jersey fragte sich, was sich hinter seiner Wohnzimmerwand verbirgt. Immer wieder hörte er lautes Summen. Er vermutete einen Insektenschwarm hinter dem Gemäuer.

Und damit sollte er Recht behalten. Denn es war ein Schwarm aus 30.000 Bienen, wie unter anderem das Wissenschaftsportal “Science Alert” berichtet.

“Das ist verrückt! Sowas habe ich noch nie gesehen.”

Auch der Imker Mickey Hedegus, der den Schwarm beseitigen sollte, war beeindruckt. “Das ist verrückt! Sowas habe ich noch nie gesehen”, sagte er der ”Washington Post”.

Der Bienenzüchter bohrte zunächst ein kleines Loch in die Wand, um mithilfe einer Kamera die Größe des Schwarmes einzuschätzen.

Beim Öffnen der Wand stieß der Imker dann nach und nach auf immer mehr Bienen und Waben. “Das sind mindestens 30.0000 und über 40 Pfund Honig”, sagte Hedegus.

Der Imker wird mehr als 30 mal gestochen

Er nutzte einen Vakuumsauger und konnte 95 Prozent der Bienen aus der Wand in Boxen sammeln. Auch die Waben entfernte er aus der Wand und nahm sie mit, um die Bienen zu retten und nicht töten zu müssen.

Offenbar handelte es sich um eine sehr aggressive Art. “Ich wurde trotz meines Schutzanzugs mindestens 30 Mal gestochen. Das sind afrikanisierte Honigbienen. Diese Art baut besonders viel Waben und Honig an, sie sind aber auch äußerst aggressiv”, sagte er.

Um sie dennoch nicht töten zu müssen, brachte der Imker sie in ein isoliertes Gebiet in Mountainside, New Jersey.

Jahrhunderts avancierte. Denn er schrieb unter anderem die Songs für die vierköpfige Gruppe. Nach letzterem Lied wurde sogar ein Musical und der Film ""Mamma Mia!"" mit Pierce Brosnan (64) und Meryl Streep (68) benannt. Und wäre Madonnas Song ""Hung Up"" so erfolgreich geworden, hätte sie nicht Auszüge aus ABBAs Hit ""Gimme Gimme Gimme"" dafür hergenommen? Die Nachrichtenagentur spot on news hat mit Benny Andersson gesprochen und dabei verriet er, warum seine Enkelkinder das Wichtigste für ihn sind und dass er es bereut, Klavierstücke nicht direkt vom Notenblatt spielen zu können.

Herr Andersson, Sie waren Mitglied einer der erfolgreichsten Formationen des 20. Jahrhunderts. Für was sind Sie noch besonders dankbar?

Hier können Sie Benny Anderssons neues Album ""Piano"" bestellen

Benny Andersson: Ich bin für vieles dankbar. Am wichtigsten ist natürlich, dass ich gesund bin und sechs Enkelkinder habe. Aber auch, dass ich in meiner Arbeit erfolgreich und von Glück begünstigt bin, überhaupt so lange im Musik-Business arbeiten zu können.

Sie waren Hauptsongwriter für ABBA. Was ist Ihr Lieblingslied?

Andersson: Diese Frage bekomme ich oft gestellt und immer antworte ich wieder: Ich weiß es nicht, denn wenn, dann habe ich mehrere. ""Knowing Me, Knowing You"", ""Dancing Queen"" oder ""The Winner Takes It All"" sind wahrscheinlich meine drei Lieblingshits.

Ihr neues Album ""Piano"" kam kürzlich in die Läden. Spielen Sie auch privat viel Klavier oder tun Sie das mehr im Tonstudio?

Andersson: Ich spiele jeden Tag Klavier - oft von 10 bis 16 Uhr und das seit vielen Jahren. Wenn ich es satt habe meine eigene Musik zu spielen oder neue zu schreiben - dann spiele ich auch gerne Stücke von anderen Künstlern auf dem Klavier.

Was war Ihre größte Inspiration für Ihr neues Album?

Benny Andersson: Ehrlich gesagt dachte ich nur: Inzwischen habe ich so viele selbstgeschriebene Songs, dass ich davon doch einfach ein paar hernehmen könnte und diese auf dem Klavier spiele. Kein Orchester, keine Lyrics - nur ich und das Klavier - sonst nichts. Ich fing mit ein paar Songs an und irgendwann hatte ich so viele zusammen, dass sie für ein Album reichten. Ich will kein Klavierspieler sein, ich will einfach nur Musik machen.

Bereuen Sie etwas in Ihrem Leben oder Ihrer Karriere nicht getan zu haben?

Andersson: Manchmal finde ich es schade, dass ich Musik nicht professionell lesen oder schreiben kann. Ich habe mich inzwischen aber damit abgefunden, denn es funktioniert auch so - ohne diese Fähigkeit. Wenn ich zum Beispiel Stücke für große Orchester schreibe, dann helfen mir Freunde dabei, meine Arbeit für das Orchester verständlich zu machen. Ich bereue nicht, dass ich keine akademische Ausbildung habe. Manchmal vermisse ich einfach, dass ich nicht direkt vom Notenblatt Klavierstücke spielen kann. Stattdessen höre ich aber auf bestimmte Records und spiele die vom Gehör her nach.

Ist das nicht ein viel größeres Talent, Musik einfach vom Gehör nachspielen zu können?

Andersson: Vielleicht - ich lese die Musik nicht, ich habe sie einfach im Kopf. Alles was ich höre und was mir gefällt, bleibt in meinem Kopf. Ich spiele immerhin schon seit sechzig Jahren Klavier, also seit ich zehn Jahre alt bin. Also das was in meinem Kopf ist, ist gleichzeitig auch in meinen Händen. Wenn ich einen Song im Kopf habe, kann ich ihn auf dem Klavier spielen - selbst, wenn ich ihn noch nie zuvor gespielt habe.

Wenn Sie sich in einer Zeitschrift oder im Spiegel sehen - was denken Sie?

Andersson: Ich habe gelernt, mit mir und meinem Aussehen zu leben, sagen wir es so. (lacht)

Könnten Sie sich vorstellen, selbst in einem Musical wie ""Mamma Mia!"" aufzutreten?

Andersson: Ich würde nie in einer Serie oder einem Musical mitspielen. Nur über meine Leiche - ich bin kein Schauspieler.

Was war Ihre beste Erfahrung auf der Bühne?

Andersson: Meine Band ""Benny Anderssons Orkester"" und ich, wir spielen alles von schwedischer Folkmusik bis hin zu Dance-Music der 40er und 50er Jahre und auch einige ABBA-Cover. Jedes zweite Jahr spielen wir auf einem Event, zu dem 5.000-7.000 Leute kommen. Die Leute tanzen oder sitzen einfach nur auf der Wiese und hören zu - das liebe ich sehr. Es geht mir nicht um das Performen, sondern um das Musizieren an sich.

Was würden Sie Ihrem früheren Ich raten, wenn Sie die Möglichkeit dazu hätten?

Gilbert Carrasquillo via Getty Images Ronan Farrow had reportedly been told by NBC News executives that he didn’t have enough reporting to go on air with his Harvey Weinstein story.
But Farrow was told by multiple NBC News executives and producers that the reporting and interviews he had conducted weren’t sufficient for a televised story.
By July, Farrow was ready with a bombshell story about Weinstein that included on-camera interviews with accusers and interviews with four female and male former Miramax and Weinstein Co. executives.
NBC insiders have told HuffPost that this has led some employees to wonder if this was an internal talking point that NBC executives were using to justify the lack of coverage.","In mid-August, Ronan Farrow, an NBC News contributor, had secured an interview with a woman who was willing to appear on camera, in silhouette, her identity concealed, and say Harvey Weinstein had raped her, according to four people with close knowledge of the reporting. It was a pivotal moment in a testy, months-long process of reporting a story that had bedeviled a generation of media and Hollywood reporters.

Farrow had a lot of material already. In March, he had acquired a damning and much-coveted audio recording in which Weinstein admits to having groped an Italian model. He had interviews with former executives and assistants who’d worked closely with Weinstein who spoke about the culture of harassment and abuse he perpetrated. And now he had someone ready to accuse Weinstein of rape, on camera.

But at that moment Farrow was also caught in the pincers of an NBC News edict. He had been told by executives at NBC News that he didn’t have enough reporting to go on air with his Weinstein story, according to four sources, and he had been told by the network to stop reporting on it. NBC tried to put a stop to the interview with the woman accusing Weinstein of rape. The network insisted he not use an NBC News crew for the interview, and neither was he to mention his NBC News affiliation. And so that was how Ronan Farrow wound up paying out of his own pocket for a camera crew to film an interview.

As a project for NBC News, Farrow’s story was effectively dead. Later that month, he received permission to take his reporting to another news organization. The story that resulted, published Tuesday by The New Yorker, was a blockbuster: multiple women accusing Weinstein of rape and other sexual misconduct, accompanied by the audio of Weinstein admitting to sexual assault.

Jacopo Raule via Getty Images An audio of Harvey Weinstein arguing with a young model at a hotel was included with The New Yorker article.

At an NBC News town hall Wednesday, NBC News President Noah Oppenheim said: “The notion that we would try to cover for a powerful person is deeply offensive to all of us. We were on that long list of places that chased this thing, tried to nail it, but weren’t ultimately the ones who broke it.”

Then he struck a rueful tone, suggesting that the NBC iteration of the story had died of natural causes. “We reached a point over the summer where we, as an organization, didn’t feel that we had all the elements that we needed to air,” he said.

Yet interviews with 12 people inside and outside NBC News with direct knowledge of the reporting behind Farrow’s story suggest a different cause of death. All of the sources who spoke to HuffPost asked not to be named, either because they weren’t authorized to speak to the media about the story or because they were fearful of retribution from NBC News executives. These sources detailed a months-long struggle within NBC News during which Oppenheim and other executives slow-walked Farrow’s story, crippling it with their qualms and irresolution.

Toward the end, the concerns seemed to take on a personal tone, and it became difficult to tell where the Weinstein team’s attempts to discredit the story left off and NBC News’ editorial forbearance began. According to multiple sources inside and outside of NBC News who worked on the aborted story, Oppenheim related to Farrow what Weinstein’s lawyers had said in complaint to NBC: that Farrow had a conflict of interest because Weinstein had helped revive the career of Farrow’s estranged father, director Woody Allen. Weinstein’s representatives would later use a similar line of attack when the story landed at The New Yorker. The magazine, known for its rigorous vetting process, saw no conflict of interest.

Oppenheim’s statement and the pushback that NBC News has been sharing on background to reporters conflicts significantly with the accounts of people who worked on the story inside NBC News and elsewhere, according to several sources with close knowledge of the reporting.

Farrow, who began reporting the story in January and by late July had interviewed at least eight women, some on the record, had been told twice that the story was “reportable,” meaning it had passed the network’s stringent fact checking and legal process, according to four people with detailed knowledge of the process. A separate NBC investigative journalist was also asked to re-report his work, and her review raised no flags, these people said.

Gilbert Carrasquillo via Getty Images Ronan Farrow had reportedly been told by NBC News executives that he didn’t have enough reporting to go on air with his Harvey Weinstein story.

Farrow scored his first major reporting coup in January: an on-camera interview with actress Rose McGowan during which she accused Weinstein of sexually assaulting her when she was 23 years old. The Times has reported that McGowan settled her sexual assault claim with Weinstein for $100,000 in 1997. Ultimately, McGowan withdrew her permission for NBC News to use the footage after she’d received legal threats from Weinstein.

In March, Farrow obtained audio in which Weinstein admits to having sexually assaulted Italian model Ambra Battilana Gutierrez. The audio was recorded a day after Gutierrez had gone to the New York Police Department and told officers that Weinstein had groped her breasts and attempted to put a hand up her skirt.

The NYPD fitted Gutierrez with a wire, and she recorded her conversation with Weinstein at the Tribeca Grand Hotel in New York.

Weinstein is heard on the recording pressuring Gutierrez to join him in his hotel room, and toward the end of the tense exchange he admits he’d sexually assaulted her. When Gutierrez asked Weinstein why he had groped her breasts the day before, he answered, “Oh, please, I’m sorry, just come on in,” and “I’m used to that. Come on. Please.”

Gutierrez asked, “You’re used to that?”

“Yes,” Weinstein said, adding, “I won’t do it again.”

For two years, reporters from numerous publications had been attempting to obtain that damning audio. To many publications, the audio on its own would have merited a stand-alone news story. And even if the network had deemed it unworthy of television, NBC News could have published the story online, which Farrow, along with Rich McHugh, an NBC News investigative producer, also pursued. In fact, Farrow was said to be eager to get some of their reporting out in hopes that it would break the dam and other sources would come forward.

By April, NBC News had two big scoops in its pocket: an on-record interview with McGowan and the explosive audio of Weinstein admitting to sexual assault. But Farrow was told by multiple NBC News executives and producers that the reporting and interviews he had conducted weren’t sufficient for a televised story. According to four sources, Farrow and McHugh also prepared a lengthy text story to run on the NBC News website, but Farrow was told it wouldn’t run.

By July, Farrow was ready with a bombshell story about Weinstein that included on-camera interviews with accusers and interviews with four female and male former Miramax and Weinstein Co. executives.

At this point, Farrow and McHugh were ready to move forward with the story but were told by NBC executives that the story had to go up to NBC News Chairman Andy Lack for approval and that the story would be under review by Steve Burke, executive vice president of Comcast and president and CEO of NBCUniversal — a highly unusual level of scrutiny, according to three NBC News staffers, who had never heard of Burke’s office needing to review a story.

In August, according to four sources familiar with the conversations, Farrow was repeatedly told by the network that he didn’t have enough reporting done to go to air but that he should also stop reporting on Weinstein’s story, putting him in an untenable position.

One of the people Farrow had interviewed on camera for the story was veteran media reporter Ken Auletta. Earlier in his career, Auletta had tried to break the story of Weinstein’s predations. According to two sources familiar with the interview, and as reported in slightly different form by the Daily Beast’s Lloyd Grove, Auletta, after having reviewed Farrow’s reporting, said on camera something along the lines of, “If NBC News sits on this evidence Ronan has, it is a black eye for the organization and a huge scandal.”

Farrow ultimately brought his reporting to The New Yorker, which published his blockbuster account on Monday after putting his piece through its gauntlet of editors and fact checkers.

“Ronan Farrow, who came to us about two months ago, had very serious reporting already accomplished,” said David Remnick, editor in chief of The New Yorker. “And with extremely hard work, and with work with a lot of my colleagues here at The New Yorker, he deepened the piece and made it publishable. And it is something that exemplified great investigative journalism.”

NBC had initially been reticent about reporting on other news outlets’ stories on Weinstein as well. Last Thursday, when The New York Times first broke the story of Weinstein’s long history of alleged sexual abuse, both CBS and ABC carried the Weinstein story on their evening broadcasts. But NBC was conspicuously absent among its competitors and didn’t air a Weinstein piece that evening on “NBC Nightly News,” despite having had seven hours to put together a story (the Times article was published at 11 a.m. EDT).

Some NBC sources said that the broadcast was jam-packed with breaking news, including reporting on the aftermath of the Las Vegas shooting and the NBC News report that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called President Donald Trump a “moron.” But the broadcast also had room for a segment on NFL player Cam Newton’s sexist remarks to a female reporter and a segment about Rock and Roll Hall of Fame nominees.

Two sources familiar with the production told HuffPost that Oppenheim made the final decision not to include a Weinstein story in the broadcast, telling staff that Weinstein wasn’t a nationally recognizable figure. That weekend, when “Saturday Night Live” executive producer Lorne Michaels was criticized for not including any Weinstein jokes, he told The Daily Mail that “it’s a New York thing,” suggesting something similar. NBC insiders have told HuffPost that this has led some employees to wonder if this was an internal talking point that NBC executives were using to justify the lack of coverage.

Slaven Vlasic via Getty Images NBC News President Noah Oppenheim said at a town hall: “The notion that we would try to cover for a powerful person is deeply offensive to all of us.""

The next morning, NBC was, once again, bested by its competitors when ABC’s “Good Morning America” ran a segment that was 10 minutes long and CBS’ “This Morning” ran a five-minute segment. NBC’s “Today” show simply had anchor Craig Melvin read off a teleprompter part of a story that largely included Weinstein’s pushback as opposed to the detailed allegations made in the Times.

The news that NBC had the audio of Weinstein admitting to sexual assault shocked and frustrated NBC News employees who spoke to HuffPost, saying that the mood in the newsroom had grown dark over the missed opportunity to break a big story.

It reminded several people who spoke to HuffPost of another time that NBC lost the chance to break a story involving a man admitting to alleged sexual misconduct.",How Top NBC Executives Quashed The Bombshell Harvey Weinstein Story,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2017/10/11/nbc-harvey-weinstein_n_18241592.html?utm_hp_ref=uk&ir=UK

Remember LK Advani's famous assertion about the media on their passive obedience to the Indira Gandhi regime during emergency? ""You (journalists) were asked to bend, but you began to crawl!""

I was not born then, but I hear from my seniors in the profession that most mainstream journalists embarrassed their fraternity by displaying their unflinching loyalty to Indira Gandhi for fear of being arraigned by her. In 2017 there is no emergency — at least there has been no declaration to the effect — but many from my profession have chosen to prostrate before the powers before being asked to bend.

This Sunday, the independent news website The Wire published an investigative report by journalist Rohini Singh on the changing fortune of Jay Amit Shah, the son of BJP President Amit Shah. The report created ripples on social media within minutes of being published. Singh made damning allegations against the son of the president of a party that came to power in 2014 claiming to be the panacea to a ten-year-old corrupt Congress regime.

Before I proceed I must add that there have been similar allegations of corruption against Amit Shah made by officials in the Gujarat dispensation that had been reported by various publications. In fact in 2010 among many other publications, The Hindu carried a report titled 'Gujarat government buried CID report on Amit Shah'.

The BJP claimed these reports were politically motivated just like his arrest in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter case in Gujarat in 2010. Shah was the first serving home minister of a state in India to face this ignominy. All was forgotten in 2014 as Modi rose to prominence as the man who wanted to rid the country of the malaise of corruption.

Indian politician and former Gujarat minister Amit Shah (L) and his son Jay celebrate on his arrival at his residence after his release from Sabarmati Central Jail in Ahmedabad late on October 29, 2010.

'Na Khaaonga, na khaane doonga', he roared in his speeches and the Indian voter accepted with great relief his war against graft. The ten-year-old Congress regime with its corruption-tainted ministers had exhausted the average Indian. It needed a change. The PM continued with his barbs against ex-PM Manmohan Singh stating that ""Manmohan Singh knew the art of bathing with a raincoat on"" — a reference to Singh's alleged silence over the corruption of his ministers.

But for a party which considered transparency on corruption and financial impropriety as sacrosanct, similar allegations made by The Wire on Sunday based on paperwork stung the BJP rank and file to such an extent that it got one of its most media-friendly political heavyweight Piyush Goyal to address a press conference not just to defend a non-political entity but also to proudly proclaim that Jay Amit Shah would slap a 100 crore defamation suit against the organization and its reporter.

The BJP, of all parties, should know this best as it has followed a similar protocol in the past not just with allegations against Robert Vadra.

This press conference was preceded by a similar one addressed by Congress leader Kapil Sibal seeking accountability from the BJP over the allegations. This was normal political outcome of an investigation.

The BJP, of all parties, should know this best as it has followed a similar protocol in the past not just with allegations against Robert Vadra, but post various other media investigations including the Coal scam and the 2G scam which led to the downfall of the UPA. But if you are a consumer of mainstream Indian television news, you were made to believe this Sunday that only one such presser took place, that in which the BJP lashed out at a leftist website for defaming its leader.

Blackout

There was an eerie silence on news channels, some focused on karva chauth, others on Muslim appeasement, the rest on pressing issues such as the Hrithik Roshan-Kangana Ranaut spat. With a few exceptions — yes those very exceptions which rescue the media each time — others made you believe that the last time you witnessed a big investigative story was the appearance of Honeypreet Insaan on their television channels.

Jay Amit Shah should not have bothered writing those words of caution because the present day media understands even the unsaid.

Some of the media houses, conspicuous in their silence, were last seen talking of the need to protect free speech post the murder of journalist Gauri Lankesh.

In the concluding statement of his claim of defamation, Jay Amit Shah said, ""If anyone else republishes/re-broadcasts the imputations made in the said article, whether directly or indirectly, such person or entity will also be guilty of the very same criminal and/or civil liability.""

In an ideal world this intimidation should have led to an outrage in the media.

In an ideal world this intimidation should have led to an outrage in the media. An investigative report like any other report should have been the subject of discussion, criticism, arguments, debate — these being the fundamentals of journalism. Silence by intimidation being the last on the charter of a journalistic organization. But Jay Amit Shah should not have bothered writing those words of caution because the present day media understands even the unsaid. The media did not need a threat, it had already obliged, it had long memorized those unsaid rules of being in circulation in the present day dispensation.

Yes, there were a few journalists who stuck their neck out, for on them rests the onus of protecting free speech each time it is under threat. Those handful of journalists with a public voice defend the ethics of the profession and risk losing their job each day. These journalists have become the shoulders that bear the pretense of free speech in India while their colleagues read from the nationalist scripts dictated by the government.

And no, these journalists are doing no favour to us. This is basic, ethical journalism where a reporter needs to worry about the facts in her story and not the consequences of it, not the smear campaign, nor the character assassination.

I remember a senior editor telling me last year at my book event that I can afford to be critical of the government and publish a book because I speak from a position of privilege.

I remember a senior editor telling me last year at my book event that I can afford to be critical of the government and publish a book because I speak from a position of privilege. I do not have any loans to re-pay, no kids to look after, no family to run, unlike him who has to bear these responsibilities. I was quite stunned and I still am. Since when did journalism become a profession to fulfill our financial and social obligations. I have more respect for my journalist friends who have crossed over to corporate communications and public relations to feed their needs and ambition.

At least they do not shape the opinion of a generation that looks up to them.

Do not hold The Wire and its reportage as the ultimate truth and the last word on the story. Question it, criticize it, debate it, hold its journalists accountable, laud them for their work if you so believe. But your silence on this story and on other such investigations in the past is only proving right what the cynical common man on the street believes 'ye media bika huva hai' (the media is sold).","'The Wire' Story On Jay Amit Shah Deserves Debate And Discussion, Not Silence From The Media",http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/10/09/the-wire-story-on-jay-amit-shah-deserves-debate-and-discussion-not-silence-from-the-media_a_23238006/

“After that, indications are that by that point it will then have weakened and be no longer a hurricane or tropical storm, it will be extratropical.","Gusts of up to 70mph and wet weather could batter Britain’s shores as Hurricane Ophelia crosses the Atlantic Ocean in the coming days, despite other parts of the country basking in the heatwave approaching from Spain this weekend.

The tropical storm was named a hurricane overnight and the US National Hurricane Centre has warned it could strengthen over the coming days.

The remnants of the hurricane is expected to reach the UK on Monday, coinciding with the 30th anniversary of the Great Storm.

The Met Office has warned that the unsettled weather could cause disruption.

The west of the country will see the worst of the weather, with winds of between 60mph and 70mph forecast.

Ophelia is the tenth consecutive Atlantic tropical story to attain hurricane strength this season, the Met Office said.

It will coincide with the 30th anniversary of the Great Storm of 1987, which hit southern England overnight on October 15. The storm caused damage estimated at £1 billion and claimed 18 lives.

The Met Office said that the Great Storm of October 15 and 16, 1987, was a “wake-up call” for weather service providers and helped to identify gaps in severe weather forecasting capability.

#30yearsago people were woken by the #greatstorm, How would we forecast and communicate about a similar weather event today? pic.twitter.com/SjS4CRVpwr — Met Office (@metoffice) October 11, 2017

Met Office forecaster Alex Burkhill said: “Ophelia became a hurricane overnight and the forecast track takes it eastwards towards Iberia for the weekend.

“After that, indications are that by that point it will then have weakened and be no longer a hurricane or tropical storm, it will be extratropical.

“But then it will continue its way towards the British Isles, probably reaching us very early next week.”

Burkhill said cold sea temperatures mean Ophelia will not be strong enough to be categorised as a hurricane when it hits Britain.

But he added: “It’s definitely something that we are keeping an eye on, for the possibility of some disruptive weather early next week.”

The unsettled weather looks likely to continue into Tuesday due to a separate band of low pressure, and will remain changeable throughout the rest of the week.

Despite the weather warnings for next week, some parts of the UK are set to experience a rise in temperatures this weekend, with some areas in the south east of the country experiencing 24C (75F).

It will be the first time the U.S. team will be excluded from the event since 1986.

The team from Trinidad and Tobago, which has been out of World Cup contention for months, beat Team USA 2-1.

“We played poorly. The first goal was unfortunate, the second was an incredible shot. There is nothing wrong with what we are doing” in U.S. Soccer, Coach Bruce Arena said after the game. “We didn’t qualify for the World Cup, and that was my job... to qualify.”

Arena came on board after coach Jurgen Klinsmann was fired at the end of 2016 following a series of losses by Team USA in a bout of regional qualifying matches for next year’s World Cup.

The FIFA World Cup is a month-long men’s tournament played every four years. It features 32 teams from around the globe.

There are three direct qualification spots reserved for nations in CONCACAF, the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football.

The top six CONCACAF nations have been playing off for those spots since November 2016, and the U.S. was well positioned before Tuesday’s final round of games, sitting third in the standings.

But while U.S. lost to bottom-ranked Trinidad and Tobago, fifth-place Honduras beat top-ranked Mexico and fourth-place Panama upset No. 2 Costa Rica.

This unlikely trio of results left the U.S. languishing in fifth place in the standings, while Mexico, Costa Rica and Panama now qualify automatically for the World Cup. Honduras will play a two-leg qualification series with Australia next month for a final spot in the World Cup.

“You either qualify for the World Cup or you don’t,” Michael Bradley, captain of the U.S. team, said Monday, according to The New York Times. “There’s no extra points for how you qualify. There’s no extra points for even qualifying first, or second, or third.”

Debbie Abrahams, the shadow work and pensions secretary, was condemning the Government’s use of a 0345 number for claimants - which HuffPost yesterday revealed could leave callers significantly out of pocket - when she was ensnared by LBC host Jim Diamond.

Abrahams was exercised about the 55p per minute call charges which Theresa May had been forced to defend during Prime Minister’s Questions on Wednesday, accusing the Conservatives of lacking “humanity”.

Labour MP tears into govt for using 0345 numbers, but is lost for words when LBC host tells her Labour use them too https://t.co/utRB2qxabJ — LBC (@LBC) October 12, 2017

“People can be racking up costs if they are using their mobile, if they don’t have a landline... at an average of £3.30 a call.

“Someone on a low-income to get the support they need to have to pay £3.30... that is a lot of money.”

Diamond then informed Abrahams that Labour uses an 0345 number for people wanting to sign up as members and asked, “if it is so bad” why does the party use it?

But as listeners were quick to point out, there was an easy defence for the Labour MP:

A clearly flummoxed Abrahams replied: ” I don’t know. I think you make a very valid point. I had no idea about this and yes, we need to get our own house in order as well.”

When Diamond pushed her further, Abrahams tried to steer the conversation back to the Conservatives: “Lets not forget this is a Government programme and you’ve got me on here taking about this.”

After Diamond interjected to reaffirm his point, Abrahams concluded: “I agree with you. So can we move on.”

Ce mercredi 11 octobre, le tribunal correctionnel de Paris a rendu son jugement à l'encontre des neuf militants ""antifascistes"" accusés d'avoir participé, à divers degrés, à l'attaque retentissante d'une voiture de police, incendiée à Paris en mai 2016.

Les peines vont de 12 mois de prison avec sursis à 7 ans ferme pour le Suisse Joachim Landwehr, en fuite, auquel il était reproché d'avoir lancé la fusée de détresse à l'intérieur de la voiture. Deux jeunes hommes ont été relaxés.

Le principal prévenu, Antonin Bernanos, a été condamné à cinq ans de prison dont 3 ans ferme. Pour l'accusation et les enquêteurs, il ne fait aucun doute que cet étudiant de 23 ans, devenu au fil du procès une figure pour la mouvance d'extrême gauche, est bien l'assaillant masqué et vêtu de noir qui assène des coups de poing à un policier encore assis dans la voiture, et qui fait exploser la lunette arrière du véhicule à l'aide d'un plot métallique.

Descendant de l'écrivain Georges Bernanos, ce militant est suivi par les services de renseignement depuis des années. Il a déjà effectué dix mois de détention provisoire.

Refugees on Manus Island have been told they can apply to move to the other Australian-run offshore detention centre of Nauru, as the facility in Papua New Guinea nears its final shutdown and demolition.

Signs were posted inside the Manus Island facility on Tuesday stating that refugees who waiting on approval to resettle in the United States as part of the controversial 'swap' deal could apply for transfer to Nauru until a decision was reached.

The Manus centre is in the process of being demolished, following a 2016 PNG Supreme Court decision that detention on the island breached the country's Constitution, but refugees and asylum seekers remain inside the centre and refuse to leave. It will officially close on October 31.

Just 50 people -- 25 each from Manus and Nauru -- were accepted in the first round of the U.S. resettlement process last month. The sign posted in the Manus facility stated that transferring to Nauru ""will not affect eligibility or progress of U.S. resettlement applications"".

In a statement to HuffPost Australia, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection said:

The Government of Nauru has agreed to receive PNG-determined refugees in Nauru to await third country resettlement. Relocation is voluntary; no one will be forced to move to Nauru. We continue to work with the Governments of Nauru and PNG to implement appropriate arrangements for people at the Manus RPC.

Behrouz Boochani, an Iranian journalist and refugee on Manus, said he doubted any would take up the Nauru offer.

""It's the latest political trick to get the refugees out of the Manus detention centre, because they have not left the centre despite the Government's efforts to push them out in the past few months,"" he told HuffPost Australia.

""I talked with the refugees and they are saying they don't want to go to Nauru.

""People are really frustrated and disappointed by this news. After four years of pain the Australian Government should transfer us to a safe place, not to another hell.""

Sending refugees from Manus prison camp to Nauru is unacceptable. How can the gov want to send people from hell to another hell after 4yrs? — Behrouz Boochani (@BehrouzBoochani) October 10, 2017

The Nauru offer comes within three weeks of the Manus centre's planned shutdown, and confusion as to where the refugees and asylum seekers left in PNG will be moved to. HuffPost Australia understands men on Manus will be moved to one of three new facilities on Manus, depending on their refugee status. It is understood only one of these centres will house a medical facility. It is unclear how these new facilities will be classified, considering the Supreme Court's decision that the existing centre and detention itself on Manus were unconstitutional. So far, no official information has been released about the three new facilities.

In the latest update posted on the Department's website, as of July 31 there were 791 men in detention on Manus.

Ian Rintoul of the Refugee Action Coalition said that while facilities on Nauru were ""marginally better"" than those on Manus, that moving refugees there from PNG was not a suitable alternative.

""It's a last desperate measure because they've got the same problem on Nauru as Manus, in that Nauru won't allow these people to stay forever. Hundreds of people will be left behind. This is just moving deckchairs on the Titanic,"" he told HuffPost Australia.

The sign announcing the Nauru option states that refugees transferring there ""will have access to the same services and resettlement arrangements as other refugees on Nauru"", which would ostensibly mean access to only a 20-year visa rather than a permanent visa.

Rintoul said he was concerned that medical and accommodation facilities on Nauru would not be able to absorb the extra strain of more refugees from Manus. He also criticised the plan to move remaining refugees to new facilities on Manus, which he also claimed were inadequate.

""The Government goes from disaster to disaster, it's a rolling crisis, there's no resettlement plan. They're trying to shift everyone out of the centre to other barrack accommodation on Manus but the Manus province itself says it wont allow refugees to settle,"" he said.

Wieso gibt es in Österreich nicht die Ehe für Alle?","Mit nur einem Tweet gelingt es der österreichischen Journalistin und Moderatorin Lou Lorenz die Lage zwischen Deutschland und Österreich auf den Punkt zu bringen.

Am 1. Oktober 2017 schrieb sie: ""In Österreich tritt heute das Vermummungsverbot in Kraft. In Deutschland die Ehe für alle.""

Der Kontrast, der auf nur einen Blick den Unterschied zwischen den zwei deutschsprachigen Ländern zeigt, ist aber noch viel stärker.

Hauptsache, Burkas verbieten!

In Österreich nennt man das Kind ungern beim Namen. Deswegen gilt seit Tagen nicht etwa das jahrelang besprochene ""Burkaverbot"", sondern das ""Vermummungsverbot"". Man soll in der Öffentlichkeit sein Gesicht so zeigen, dass man erkennbar ist. Legitim und fair.

Aber in den Diskussionen dreht es sich immer um muslimischen Frauen, die einen Niqab tragen. Fälschlicherweise wird der Niqab immer mit der Burka verwechselt. Die Hauptsache ist, man will ihn verbieten.

Was ist der Unterschied? Beim Niqab sind nur die Augen sichtbar, bei der Burka nicht einmal diese, denn die Frau sieht darunter nur durch ein Gitter in die Außenwelt hinaus. Absurd? Für manche sicher.

In den letzten Jahren habe ich mit vielen unterschiedlichen Frauen Interviews geführt. Drei von ihnen waren Niqabis.

Eine österreichische Kroatin, die vor einigen Jahren zum Islam konvertiert ist, trug lange Zeit lediglich ein Kopftuch. Durch einen Unfall wurde ihr Gesicht jedoch total entstellt. Sie traute sich wochenlang nicht mehr aus der Wohnung, weil die Menschen auf den Straßen das taten, was sie am besten können: Sie starren.

Erst diese Erfahrung bewegte sie dazu, einen Niqab zu tragen. Die Leute starren immer noch, aber weitaus weniger. Jetzt ist das Vermummungsverbot in Kraft getreten und sie überlegt, nach Kroatien zu ziehen.

Ich lass mir von Männern in Anzügen nicht sagen, wie ich mich zu kleiden habe

Eine andere Bekannte von mir hat nicht lange gezögert: Sie ist sofort nach Serbien gezogen. Ihre letzten Worten waren: ""Ich lasse mir doch von Männern in Anzügen nicht vorschreiben, wie ich mich zu kleiden habe! Ich bin weg.""

Kleidung hin oder her - als Journalistin interessiert mich eine ganz andere Frage: Welches gesellschaftliche Problem ist durch das Gesetz gelöst?

In Österreich gibt es schätzungsweise 150 Niqabis. Angenommen diese werden jetzt alle den ihren Schleier ablegen, was dann? Was wird sich ändern? Sie werden wohl kaum alle erblonden. Aus Fatima wird nicht einfach Stefanie.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Frau in Berlin beleidigt eine Muslima und versucht, ihr das Kopftuch herunterzureißen

Die ganze Aktion ist reiner Populismus auf dem Rücken muslimischer Frauen. Doch was denken sich die politischen Akteure dabei? Etwa, ""mit denen können wir es machen, die sind Unterdrückung und Bevormundung von Haus aus gewöhnt?""

Doch nicht nur muslimische Frauen leiden unter der Absurdität des Gesetzes. Laut dem Journalisten Florian Klenk sind sogar Clowns angezeigt worden.

Außerdem mussten Musiker ihre Masken während eines öffentlichen Auftritts abnehmen. Ein Augenzeuge berichtete in einem Post von U-Bahn-Fahrgästen, die fremde Frauen dazu zwangen, ihre Verschleierung abzunehmen.

Frauen werden verbal angefeindet und körperlich attackiert

In der Zeitung las ich einen Bericht über ein Werbemaskottchen, dass von der Polizei dazu gezwungen wurde, den Kopf seines Kostüms abzunehmen. Der junge Mann war als Hai verkleidet und machte Werbung für das Unternehmen McShark.

Doch was ist mit den verschleierten und ach so unterdrückten Frauen? In Österreich werden sie jetzt auf den Straßen verbal angefeindet und sogar körperlich attackiert - meistens in der Anwesenheit ihrer Kinder.

Wo ist die Logik, wenn durch das Gesetz Frauen auf der Straße in die Enge getrieben werden, um ihnen ins Gesicht zu boxen, oder, ihnen buchstäblich die Kleidung vom Leib zu reißen?

Doch wie reagieren Musliminnen eigentlich auf den Versuch den Islam Stück für Stück aus der Öffentlichkeit zu beseitigen?

Die Künstlerin Asma Aiad hat ein Fotoprojekt mit dem Namen ""Ceci n´est pas une Burqa"" in die Welt gesetzt, um zu veranschaulichen, wie ziellos das Gesetz eigentlich ist.

Das Projekt erlangte durch seinen Humor viel mediale Aufmerksamkeit und verbreitete sich schnell im Internet. Auch der Berliner Youtube-Kanal ""Die Datteltäter"" griff das Thema auf. Die Kernthese: ""Solange du einen Besen in der Hand hast, stört sich keiner an deinem Kopftuch.""

In einer Zeit, in der saudi-arabische Frauen endlich Autofahren dürfen ihnen für uns selbstverständliche Freiheiten bietet, verbieten wir Menschen, sich so zu kleiden, wie sie es möchten.

Im Deckmantel der Freiheit müssen sich muslimische Frauen anhören, dass alles was sie tragen, eine Zwangsjacke ist.

""Wir haben damals unsere BHs verbrannt"", teilte mir vor kurzem eine Frau mit. ""Aber Sie tragen doch im Moment einen"", war meine Antwort. Natürlich verbrennen wir symbolisch so einiges, aber nur, um diesen Symbole wieder neu definieren zu können.

Aus dem Auge heißt nicht aus dem Sinn

Nur, weil der Niqab nun aus den Augen ist, ist er noch lange nicht aus dem Sinn. Denn wenn man Unterdrückung bekämpfen möchte, dann sollte man dort anfangen, wo die Idee dieser sitzt: In den Köpfen der Menschen.

Niemand entscheidet darüber, was ein Mensch trägt, wie frei oder unterdrückt er ist.

Angela Merkel wird immer mit Männern verglichen, weil sie auf Make-Up verzichtet und in den Augen der Medien ""einen männlichen Auftritt"" hinlegt. Melania Trump wird als ""Puppe"" bezeichnet, weil sie Model war und für die Medien ""schön weiblich"" ist.

Marylin Monroe war eine eine intelligente Frau und begnadete Schauspielerin, die so lange als Sexsymbol missbraucht wurde, bis sie starb. Nicht viel anders erging es auch Romy Schneider.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Schulwechsel: Vater will nicht, dass seine Tochter von einer Lehrerin mit Kopftuch unterrichtet wird

Frauen werden in der Öffentlichkeit immer auf ihr Aussehen reduziert, in Schubläden gesteckt und mundtot gemacht. In einem Gespräch verriet mir eine Dame: ""Ich möchte wissen, wie die Frauen darunter aussehen, man muss doch das Gesicht erkennen können.""

Meine Frage darauf konnte sie nicht beantworten: ""Wieso? Würden Sie mit den Frauen sprechen, wenn Sie deren Gesicht sehen würden?"" Wahrscheinlich nicht.

Wie viele Niqab-Trägerinnen steckten hinter Terroranschlägen? Wie viele sind in den letzten Jahren kriminell auffällig geworden?

Und wenn es uns wirklich um die Freiheit der Frauen geht:

Wieso zahlen wir ihnen dann nicht faire Gehälter?

Wieso gibt es keine Barrierefreiheit für alleinerziehende Mütter?

Wieso gibt es in Österreich nicht die Ehe für Alle?

Wieso gibt es kein Anti-Diskriminierungsgesetz?

Wieso gibt es kein Gesetz gegen Hetze?

Ja, Vermummung jeglicher Art ist nun in Österreich mit 150 Euro strafbar, aber die Köpfe sind leider noch dieselben geblieben.","Verschleierte Hetze: Das österreichische Burka-Verbot zeigt, dass es nie darum ging, Frauen zu befreien",http://www.huffingtonpost.de/menerva-hammad/burka-verbot-oesterreich-frauenrechte-hetze-populismus_b_18229112.html?utm_hp_ref=germany

Il s'agit du feu vert clignotant non autorisé par le ministère de la Sécurité publique.

Selon nos informations, au moins quatre municipalités permettent ou ont permis jusqu'à tout récemment à leurs pompiers d'installer un feu vert clignotant dans leurs véhicules personnels, sans avoir obtenu l'autorisation du gouvernement du Québec. Il s'agit de Sainte-Rose-de-Watford, dans Chaudière-Appalaches, de Shannon, dans la région de Québec et de Saint-Armand, dans les Cantons-de-l'Est. À Sainte-Catherine-de-la- Jacques-Cartier, aussi dans la région de Québec, on indique que son utilisation a cessé cette année.

«Je sais que je n'ai pas le droit de l'utiliser, mais je ne le fais que rarement et uniquement en situation d'urgence», admet le lieutenant Nicolas Desautels du Service incendie de Saint-Armand.

Celui qui oeuvre au sein d'une brigade de 20 pompiers souligne que le feu vert clignotant, même s'il n'est pas doté d'une sirène, permet une importante économie de temps. «Quand j'utilise le clignotant, je sauve de 5 à 7 minutes pour effectuer le trajet d'environ 10 km qui sépare ma maison de la caserne. Les gens me laissent passer dans le trafic. Et vous savez que chaque seconde compte pour sauver des vies lors d'un incendie», ajoute M. Desautels qui demande au gouvernement Couillard d'autoriser rapidement cet instrument partout au Québec.

À Sainte-Catherine-de-la- Jacques-Cartier, on dit ne plus l'utiliser sachant que la loi ne le permet pas. «On l'a utilisé de 2016 à 2017, mais notre demande de dérogation au gouvernement a été refusée. Nous ne voulions pas continuer d'être dans l'illégalité. Pourtant, cet outil a toute son importance surtout pour nous qui devons composer avec un embouteillage monstre en raison de l'achalandage du Village vacances Valcartier. Quand les voitures sont pare-chocs contre pare-chocs sur des dizaines de kilomètres, il est essentiel que nous puissions nous rendre le plus rapidement possible à la caserne», se défend Steven McCarthy, directeur du Service incendie de cette caserne de 27 pompiers.

La Ville de Shannon, elle, estime être conforme à la réglementation et ce, même si le gouvernement du Québec n'a jamais donné son feu vert pour l'utilisation de ce dispositif. C'est qu'une résolution du conseil municipal a été adoptée en avril 2016 permettant à ses pompiers l'usage de ce gyrophare lors de déplacements vers la caserne à la suite d'un appel d'urgence.

«Nous avons installé trois affiches aux trois points d'entrée de la ville. Toute manœuvre impliquant l'emploi du clignotant vert sur une urgence doit demeurer sécuritaire et respecter le code de sécurité routière en vigueur, pas question de brûler un feu rouge ou de ne pas faire un arrêt obligatoire. Le clignotant vert est simplement un outil d'identification dans le but de sensibiliser le citoyen à faciliter le passage lors d'un déplacement vers la caserne afin de diminuer le temps de réponse à une urgence», mentionne Marie France Lambert, agente aux communications à Shannon.

La résolution précise que l'application de cette mesure est autorisée sur le territoire de la Ville de Shannon uniquement. Conséquemment, les territoires touchant l'entraide mutuelle avec les autres municipalités ne font pas partie du territoire approuvé.

D'autres pompiers défient la loi

D'autres pompiers de d'autres municipalités du Québec disent avoir «expérimenté» le feu vert clignotant «seulement pour des démonstrations aux médias», lance rapidement Michel Desjardins, un pompier qui milite depuis trois ans pour que les articles 226.2 et 287.1.1 soient ajoutés et actifs au code de la sécurité routière du Québec.

Proposition d'ajouts:



L'article 226.2: Le véhicule routier, autre qu'un véhicule d'urgence, conduit par un pompier visé par la Loi sur la sécurité incendie peut être muni d'un gyrophare vert amovible uniquement lorsque ce pompier agit dans le cadre d'un événement visé par cette loi. Ce gyrophare autorise le conducteur, lorsque la situation l'exige, à circuler sur l'accotement et à immobiliser son véhicule à tout endroit. Le conducteur doit agir de manière à ne pas compromettre la sécurité des usagers de la route. L'article 287.1.1: Le conducteur d'un véhicule routier qui contrevient au deuxième alinéa de l'article 226.2 est passible d'une amende de 300 $ à 600 $.

«L'autre jour un policier de la SQ m'a dit: ''pourquoi tu n'a pas allumé ton feu vert j'aurais pu te laisser passer sur l'accotement et t'éviter de perdre du temps au périmètre de sécurité'"". Je lui ai répondu que je n'avais pas le droit.»

«Le feu vert clignotant permet de faire un couloir pour laisser passer les pompiers au volant de leurs voitures personnelles comme c'est le cas lorsque nous sommes à bord du camion pompier», a-t-il expliqué.

M. Desjardins souligne qu'à plusieurs endroits au Canada, le feu vert clignotant est légal. «L'Ontario l'utilise et ça fonctionne à merveille. En Alberta, ils sont rendus au feu rouge avec sirène. Les véhicules personnels des pompiers sont de véritables véhicules d'urgence».

Des résultats convaincants?

Présentement, le gouvernement du Québec accepte que les MRC de Bécancour et la MRC Les Collines-de-l'Outaouais fassent l'usage du feu vert clignotant dans le cadre d'un projet-pilote de trois ans débuté en 2015 et qui se terminera en août 2018.

Le HuffPost Québec a mis la main sur des statistiques colligées par le ministère de la Sécurité publique à partir du rapport sur l'effet de l'utilisation du feu vert clignotant entre le 13 octobre 2015 au 31 octobre 2016.

Le nombre total d'interventions (tout type d'appel confondu) est de 1863 pour les deux MRC participantes au projet-pilote. Dans 83 % des cas, les utilisateurs du feu vert clignotant estiment avoir ainsi facilité leurs déplacements. Plus de 16% des sapeurs disent avoir sauvé plus de deux minutes. Le projet-pilote vise 418 pompiers répartis dans 31 casernes pour une population totale de 69 645 habitants.

«Il a aussi été démontré que les arguments contre l'utilisation du feu vert clignotant et les craintes étaient par le fait même non fondés», assure Michel Desjardins.

En réaction, Emmanuel Macron a annoncé ce mardi qu'il allait officiellement reconnaître le drapeau bleu et or lors d'un sommet de l'Union européenne, la semaine prochaine, afin qu'il ne puisse plus être ""enlevé de l'hémicycle"".

Ce à quoi le député des Bouches-du-Rhône a riposté ce mercredi 11 octobre par un communiqué contestant la légalité de cette reconnaissance.

Il n'est pas le sien et la France a voté contre son adoption sans ambiguïté"", écrit Jean-Luc Mélenchon, lui-même ancien eurodéputé, en faisant référence au rejet par la France du traité constitutionnel européen qui instaurait l'emblème européen.

Le drapeau et l'hymne européens ont néanmoins été reconnus par 16 des 28 pays de l'Union européenne par la signature d'une déclaration commune annexée au traité de Lisbonne.

If You Have A Loved One With Dementia, Love Them The Same Way You Always Have I have had the privilege of being an ambassador for Alzheimer's Society for a number of years now. My grandmother, Nans, lived with Alzheimer's for half the time that I knew her... Here is my plea. This World Alzheimer's Day - and beyond it - let's do everything in our power to make sure people don't have to face dementia alone. Let's speak up and speak out about dementia so awareness and understanding across society is improved. Let's come together and unite against dementia. If you have a loved one with dementia, spend time with them. Love them, the same way you always have. Actress and Alzheimer’s Society ambassador

Helping The BVI In Times Of Need The British Virgin Islands have been absolutely devastated in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma. Almost all houses have been destroyed, there is no food, no water and no electricity. Right now, it's crucial that people, especially children, stuck in the BVI get off the islands for the sake of health, safety, and security. Sadly, the location is currently unlivable... My severe disappointment in the UK Government's response to this disaster was only overcome by the extreme altruism and genuine concern for human life and dignity that I've witnessed from all those who care about the BVI and the people in it.

How We're Turning Grenfell Donations Into Cash For Victims In the immediate aftermath of the Grenfell Tower fire, dozens of people started to arrive at the local rest centres with bottles of water, bags of bedding, clothing, children's toys, anything they could muster to help those who had lost everything. Very quickly, those dozens of people turned into a community, then a city, and before the day was out the whole country was donating items to the fire victims. Everyone wanted to do something to help. It was a huge spontaneous response to what has been one of the UK's worst peacetime disasters. Chief Executive at the British Red Cross

""Mental health is a growing challenge in society,"" Tim Munden, chief teaching officer at Unilever, where several mental health initiatives are in place, told HuffPost.","It's a hard statistic, but an important one: one out of every two people in the youngest generation of workers in Canada has had experience with depression.

According to a survey conducted by Ipsos on behalf of the Great-West Life Centre for Mental Health in the Workplace, a full half of employees aged 18 to 34 reported that they'd dealt with the mental illness, while for Gen-Xers (aged 35 to 54) that number was 39 per cent.

So what does it mean to have such a huge portion of workers — particularly the ones who will be taking up more of the workforce in the coming years — reporting so many negative experiences?

Actually, it could mean progress.

Younger workers are more aware of mental health and less likely to be silenced by social stigma.

""These trends among younger age groups in the workplace may seem disconcerting,"" Mary Ann Baynton, Great-West Life's program director for this initiative, said in a press release. ""However, these results may partly reflect that younger workers are more aware of mental health and less likely to be silenced by social stigma.""

That tendency can certainly be seen elsewhere, as more millennials speak up about the struggles faced when it comes to anxiety and depression, something that has long been missing from both offices and other public spaces.

In an article from Vice on how millennials use memes to talk about mental health, it's easy to see that technology has helped put the word out that a huge number of people go through these kinds of struggles — and by sharing them, it reminds people that there are others who are struggling too.

""I have chronic depression which isn't exactly hilarious but sometimes memes resonate more than my $200 therapy session,"" mental health advocate Deidre Fidge told the site. ""I don't know if it's deeply pathetic or heart-warming that random memes make me feel less alone sometimes, but there you go.""

Offices in need of a change

It's natural that these tendencies will carry over into the workplace, which has long been a space in need of a mental health revamp.

Studies have shown that workers who have depression are more likely to miss days of work, as well as have a poorer quality performance, and that can be exacerbated by factors at the office.

Former Globe and Mail columnist (and Baby Boomer) Jan Wong wrote a book in 2012 entitled Out of the Blue: A Memoir of Workplace Depression, Recovery, Redemption and, Yes, Happiness, about her experience with depression while at the newspaper (where she was eventually let go), and what she learned during her illness.

Especially for those of us who work with our brains, there's this huge fear that if you've had a mental illness, no one will ever hire you again.

""[Human resources staff] need to be educated about mental illness,"" she told HuffPost Canada at the time. ""As soon as they see a behavioural change, they have to do something. The first thing the HR person needs to ask is whether it's because of a situation at work or because of a situation outside of work. If it's outside, you tell them where to get counselling. If it's inside work, you tell them where to get treatment, but you also stop the situation at work.

""Especially for those of us who work with our brains, there's this huge fear that if you've had a mental illness, no one will ever hire you again. But in fact that didn't happen — I have a job.""

Already, changes are happening within organizations. A feel-good story from earlier this year detailed a boss' response to an employee's request for a day off for her mental health, and it resonated with thousands.

Other initiatives include talking about mental health in situ, not just recommending counselling for people who need it.

""Mental health is a growing challenge in society,"" Tim Munden, chief teaching officer at Unilever, where several mental health initiatives are in place, told HuffPost. ""And whatever goes on for employees outside of work also goes on inside of work. Helping people manage that is just the right thing to do.""

Philosoph Precht polterte, Özdemir dürfe auf keinen Fall Außenminister werden

Precht ist überzeugt: ""Es gibt keine grüne Außenpolitik""

Vor wenigen Monaten hätte es kaum einer für möglich gehalten. Die Grünen könnten bald regieren, wenn die schwierigen Verhandlungen zur Jamaika-Koalition glücken.

Den Grünen könnte so sogar eine der wichtigsten Positionen im neuen Merkel-Kabinett zukommen. Beobachter sehen Cem Özdemir als aussichtsreichen Anwärter auf den Posten des Außenministers.

In der ZDF-Talkshow von Markus Lanz diskutierten unter anderem der Journalist Wolfram Weimer und Philosoph Richard David Precht über die mögliche neue Regierung.

""Man kann keine grüne Außenpolitik machen""

Beide waren sich einig: Union, FDP und Grüne seien alle in der politischen Mitte angesiedelt, mit ein bisschen Kompromissbereitschaft könnte eine funktionierende Regierung entstehen.

Als es dann aber um den möglichen Außenminister der Grünen ging, wurde Precht plötzlich aufbrausend. ""Ich persönlich würde es zutiefst bedauern, wenn Özdemir Außenminister wird"", sagte der Philosoph. Der Grund für seine Ablehnung: ""Man kann keine grüne Außenpolitik machen.""

Wenn die Partei aber diesen ""Riesenposten"" bekomme, könne man in anderen Punkten der Koalitionsverhandlungen womöglich ""wenig in die Waagschale werfen"". Die Posten des Landwirtschaftsministers und des Umweltministers würden den Grünen als Konsequenz womöglich entgehen.

""Und wofür haben die Leute denn die Grünen gewählt?"", fragte Precht. Die Partei stehe für Nachhaltigkeit und eine ökologische Politik in Zeiten des Massenkonsums. Das Amt des Außenministers dagegen würde an Özdemir ""verpulvert"" werden – aufgrund des ""persönlichen Ehrgeizes eines Menschen"".

Die Folge sei, dass das Landwirtschaftsministerium womöglich ein CSU-Politiker bekomme. ""Was ich für ein Problem halte, weil wir insbesondere auf dem Agrarsektor, bei der Massentierhaltung, eine unglaubliche Veränderung brauchen, den wir mit der CSU nicht kriegen, und für den die Grünen stehen"", erklärte Precht.

""So ein Amt darf ein Grüner nicht bekleiden""

Dann wurde es zunehmend bizarr.

Precht redete sich weiter in Rage: ""Was ist denn grüne Außenpolitik? Das ist doch völliger Quatsch!"" Er schimpfte regelrecht: ""Das ist alles nur Unsinn."" Man könne in Peking nicht nur die Klimapolitik ansprechen statt der Menschenrechte.

""So ein Amt darf man als Grüner nie bekleiden wollen, oder man ist kein Grüner"", polterte Precht. Eine steile These.

Schließlich haben auch die Grünen ein ausgearbeitetes außenpolitisches Programm, pochen immer wieder entschieden auf die Einhaltung der Menschenrechte in aller Welt. Zwischen 1998 und 2005 bekleidete mit Joschka Fischer ein Grüner das Amt des Außenministers.

Das Studiopublikum applaudierte Precht dennoch frenetisch.

Weimer hielt dagegen: Der Philosoph unterschätze die Partei. ""Da sind schon schlaue Menschen dabei. (...) Die haben schon politische Überzeugungen.""

Auch die proeuropäische Haltung der Grünen ließe sich in eine konkrete Politik umsetzen, nicht nur der Klimaschutz. Fischer sei rückblickend ""kein so schlechter Außenminister"" gewesen.

Frank Gardner, the BBC’s security correspondent, told the Radio 4′s Today programme that it is “very likely” that Jones had been killed, but added that unless special forces sent a team on the ground to gather DNA, there was no way to be 100% sure.

“But US sources are pretty certain that they have got her,” he said.

Gardner said Jones’ death would be “significant” to IS from a propaganda perspective, but that it would make, “no difference to Isis’s fortunes on the battleground”.

“She was useful for Isis as a symbolic Western figure who was prolific on social media,” he said.

Jones, who was previously the bass guitarist in all-girl punk rock group Krunch and a L’Oreal saleswoman, left her home in Chatham, Kent, after converting to radical Islam.

She used her Twitter account to recruit women and provided practical advice on how to travel to Syria.

Jones was said to be a high priority target for the Pentagon because of suggested she was behind dozens of terror plots and was the leader of the secret Anwar al-Awlaki battalion’s female wing.

She was said to be responsible for training European female terror recruits.

Born in Greenwich, London, Jones encouraged individuals to carry out attacks in Britain, offering guidance on how to construct home-made bombs.

She has also shared pictures of herself posing with weapons and is believed to be the sixth Briton killed by drones in Syria.

Jones also posted messages in support of IS as well as extremist comments such as: “You Christians all need beheading with a nice blunt knife and stuck on the railings at Raqqa.

“Come here I’ll do it for you.”

Major General Chip Chapman, the former MoD head of counter terror, said Jones would have been a target as a result of her alliance with Hussain and her role in recruiting IS fighters.

Referring to reports her son was killed in the strike, he added: “It is a difficult one because under the UN Charters he is under the age of what we would classify as a soldier.”

He continued: “Even if he got up to really bad things, he shouldn’t have been targeted.

“We don’t know for sure whether he was with her or not.”

Jones left school at 16 and worked as a beautician before later falling pregnant. The child’s father died from liver cirrhosis when their son was just two years old.","Sally-Anne Jones, UK's Most Wanted Terrorist, Killed In US Drone Strike, Reports Claim",http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2017/10/12/white-widow-sally-anne-jones-killed_n_18243964.html?utm_hp_ref=uk

Dr Samina Khan, director of admissions and outreach at the university said: “Interviews will be an entirely new experience for most students, and we know many prospective applicants are already worried about being in an unfamiliar place and being questioned by people they have not met – so to help students to become familiar with the type of questions they might get asked we release these real examples.

“We want to underscore that every question asked by our tutors has a purpose, and that purpose is to assess how students think about their subject and respond to new information or unfamiliar ideas.”

Khan added: “No matter what kind of educational background or opportunities you have had, the interview should be an opportunity to present your interest and ability in your chosen subject, since they are not just about reciting what you already know.”

Subject: Law

Q: Should it be illegal to run a red light in the middle of the night on an empty road?

Exeter College lecturer Jon Herring said: “The ability to think normatively is important to the study of law, so we are interested in what candidates think the law ought to be, but more important is their capacity to justify their position.

“This involves being able analyse concepts, critically appraise arguments and the reasoning behind a position, as well as to consider objections and to offer rebuttals to those objections. There isn’t a right or wrong answer to this question; we would be using the example to see how well the candidate could justify their stance.

“For example, a candidate might say that if no one was harmed by running the light, then it wouldn’t hurt to run it so it shouldn’t be illegal. This would be suggesting that the law is based on preventing harm. We might then explore whether this is the only purpose or the dominant purpose of the law, and how that might shape how legal rules need to be constructed, when exceptions might be valid and how effective exceptions could be created.”

He continued: “Here, we would be looking to see how well they can see the problems with their approach, the difficulties inherent in drafting a rule that works in every situation without being too broad. This line of discussion would draw out their capacity to respond to challenges to their position, their mental flexibility, and their ability to think precisely.

“Another candidate might suggest that even if no one is harmed, it is important that laws are respected and we could examine why this is the case. For example, if running lights was only illegal when it was dangerous, this would leave it to each person’s assessment of ‘dangerous’, so we could never be sure when someone would run a light, leading to chaotic traffic.”

Herring added: “This question also picks up on ideas about what it means for something to be illegal and citizens’ relationship with the law, whether it can ever be justified to break the law and what might be a sufficient justification. This could lead into more philosophical discussions of what it means for a law to be binding and how legal rules might differ from moral rules or guidelines.

“A candidate might begin to consider whether there is something special about ‘law’, and we could use this as a way into exploring with them whether the fact that something is illegal is itself a reason not to do something, over and above, perhaps, the harm the rule is aiming to prevent. Candidates might then think about how law makes other people’s behaviour more predictable so that we can plan our own actions, or how the law might serve functions like punishing wrongdoing.

“An example might be that because the law makes murder illegal and those who kill are punished, I can expect that I can leave my house and generally not expect to be killed, so this allows me to decide it’s safe to go outside.”

Subject: Philosophy (Philosophy, Politics and Economics)

Q: ‘I agree that air transport contributes to harmful climate change. But whether or not I make a given plane journey, the plane will fly anyway. So there is no moral reason for me to not travel by plane.’ Is this a convincing argument?

Interviewer Cecile Fabre of Lincoln College said: “The interview is not meant to test candidates’ knowledge of Philosophy, since more often than not, they have not studied this subject before. Moreover, we are not trying to get them to guess or arrive at ‘the right answer’.

“Rather, the interview is about candidates’ ability to think critically, to deal with counter-examples to the views they put forward, and to draw distinctions between important concepts.”

She continued: “This answer raises the difficult question of individuals’ responsibility, as individuals, for harmful collective actions. Some candidates might be inclined to dispute the premise that air transport contributes to climate change: that’s fine, but we would then ask them to accept that premise for the sake of argument. Whether they are able to do that is in itself an important test, since much of philosophical thinking proceeds in this way.

“Some candidates might say that the argument is a good one: given that what I do makes no difference, I have no moral reason not to do it. At this point, I would want to know what they consider a moral reason to be (as distinct from or similar to, for example, a practical or prudential reason).”

Fabre added: “I would also push them to think about other cases: for example, the bombing of Dresden (one jet fighter less makes no difference to the collective outcome – so why not go and fight); or voting (why should I vote in a general election, given that my vote makes no difference)?

“Are the cases the same? Are they different? If so, are the differences or similarities relevant? That is to say, do those differences and similarities help us think about the original case? Do they help us to work out a view about individual responsibility in those cases?

“For example, in the Dresden case, the individual jet fighters act together as part of an organisation – the air force – whose aim is to bomb Dresden. But we cannot say of companies such as British Airways that they aim to cause climate change. And the air passengers cannot really be described as acting together. Does this make a difference?”

Subject: Medicine

Q: Put these countries in order by their crude mortality (deaths per thousand of the population): Bangladesh, Japan, South Africa, the UK.

Exeter College interviewer Andrew King, said: “Interviews for Medicine aim to gauge candidates’ understanding of the science underpinning the study of medicine, as well as skills in scientific enquiry. This question invites candidates to think about a public health question and epidemiology that can be approached in many different ways, without necessarily knowing anything about specific mortality rates around the world.

“We would expect the initial discussion to probe the differing causes of death that contribute to mortality rates – such as those ‘Western diseases’ heart disease and cancer – and how they compare to those found in developing countries (high infant mortality, infectious diseases, poor nutrition, high rates of HIV etc.).”

He continued: “The majority of candidates will expect Bangladesh or South Africa to have the highest crude mortality rate, and will be surprised to find that it is in fact Japan.

“The other part of the mortality rate calculation is of course the age of the population: we would ideally steer the conversation towards a discussion of why a wealthy but older country like Japan might have a higher mortality rate, while a country like Bangladesh – which many people might initially expect to have a high mortality rate due to relative poverty as a country – actually has a relatively lower mortality rate because of its young population.

“Similarly, Britain actually has the second-highest mortality rate because of the age structure of its population: we are a relatively old country and a majority of deaths occur in older people. We wouldn’t expect students to get the right answer on their own, and in fact that’s not the point: the point is to see how they apply their understanding of social and cultural factors in health and illness to a problem of epidemiology.

“Some students might already have a detailed knowledge of demography, others might need to be given more relevant information – the point isn’t what they know, it’s what questions they ask to make their conclusions, and how they interpret information to draw those conclusions. We might then go on to discuss how you could make a valid comparison between mortality rates in different countries.”

Subject: Modern Languages (French)

Q: What do we lose if we only read a foreign work of literature in translation?

Interviewer Jane Hiddleston, of Exeter College, said: “This is a good question as it helps us to see how candidates think about both languages and literature.

“They might be able to tell us about the challenges of translation, about what sorts of things resist literal or straightforward translation from one language to another, and this would give us an indication of how aware they are of how languages work.”

She continued: “They might also tell us about literary language, and why literary texts in particular use language in ways that make translation problematic. This might lead to a discussion of what is distinct about literary works, and this helps us to see what kind of reader they are more broadly.

“We don’t do this with the expectation that they have already read any particular works, however, but in order to get a sense of why they think it is worth studying literatures in foreign languages.”

Hiddleston added: “This is an important issue, given that Modern Languages students at Oxford read a lot of literature in the language as part of their course.",Oxford University Sample Interview Questions: Would You Make The Cut At Britain's Top Uni?,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2017/10/12/oxford-university-sample-interview_n_18246648.html

Viki Ferguson, 45, hopes her experience at the Royal Victoria Infirmary, in Newcastle, will serve as an example to other hospitals who may not currently provide such a high standard of care.

The mother chose to share her story during Baby Loss Awareness Week (9-15 October) after charities revealed current levels of care offered to women after baby loss are “worryingly inconsistent” across the UK.

The charities have called on the government to ensure all hospitals have accessible bereavement rooms and a member of staff to lead on bereavement care.

Ferguson believes these demands are achievable as she received a high standard of care after her stillbirth in 2013.

“I don’t know what more the staff could have done to help us through that time,” Ferguson told HuffPost UK. “Everything they did was for our benefit.”

VikiFerguson Viki Ferguson and her husband Colin.

In March 2013, Ferguson was 35 weeks pregnant with her first child when she went in for a routine scan.

She and her partner Colin knew their daughter had a heart condition, so she was having checkups on a more regular basis than most mothers-to-be.

At the appointment, she was told there was no heartbeat, her baby had died.

“The rest of that afternoon was a bit of a blur,” Ferguson explained. “But what I can remember is how supportive the staff were, they talked us through everything that was going to happen.”

Ferguson was told she had a choice of being induced or waiting for labour to start. She chose to be induced.

What surprised Ferguson when she went back to the hospital to give birth on 16 March 2013, was that she was given a private room away from other pregnant women.

“Within the maternity ward they have a bereavement suite,” she explained. “There are two rooms especially for anyone who will have a stillbirth. It is away from the noise, you can’t hear anyone else in labour or any crying babies.

“It was really well thought out and very self-contained. I had my own bathroom.”

Ferguson was assigned a specially trained bereavement midwife as soon as she arrived. The midwife stayed with her and, even when she finished her shift, a second bereavement midwife took over.

“If you want them there, they are there,” Ferguson explained. “If you wanted to be left alone, they left you alone.

“They looked after us so well, they made sure Colin was looked after as well, he was part of it - they brought another bed in the room so he could stay with me overnight.

“Things like that really made a difference to me.”

“The care was exemplary. I don’t know how it would have felt not to have that. If they want a model to work on, that was it."" Viki Ferguson

When Ferguson gave birth, she was surprised how comforted she felt by the midwife and staff in the room with her.

“They bathed my daughter, they put her in a babygro and treated her if she was still alive,” the mum explained.

“They were talking to her and made it the nicest experience it could’ve been. It wasn’t like it was all over as soon as she was born. How they treated her meant so much to us.”

Ferguson gave birth at 8.20pm and she and her husband had a couple of hours with their baby that night. The midwife stayed with them until after midnight, speaking to them and checking they were okay.

“I really couldn’t have faulted the care,” she said.

“The next day we had another couple of hours with our daughter and then we had staff coming in to talk us through everything that happens with funerals, who would be in touch with us, and the counselling that was available. It was all the information we needed.”

Ferguson said she didn’t feel rushed to leave the bereavement suite - she was told she could stay as long as she wanted, but she decided to get discharged the next day.

On leaving the suite, she was given a memory envelope with photos, hair, footprints and handprints taken from her daughter, and knitted teddy bear twins - one that stayed with her daughter and one that stayed with the couple.

In the weeks following, Ferguson had a visit from a chaplain to talk through the funeral, two visits from the health visitor, a counselling session, and her GP ensured she didn’t go back to work until she was up to it.

“The care was exemplary,” she added. “I don’t know how it would have felt not to have that. If they want a model to work on, that was it.

“The staff were completely lead by us, I didn’t feel like we were forced into anything. Everything was for our benefit.”

Ferguson believes good care does “not require a complete overhaul of the NHS”.

She said small gestures such as the memory box and the empathy shown by the midwives made her experience as good as it could have been.

“Every hospital should have a midwife or midwives trained in bereavement,” she said. ”Just to have someone to know how to deal with death and what to expect - simple things like that made such a difference.

“It’s shocking that there is a postcode lottery of care.

“It helps so much to have support at a time like that.

HuffPost Australia also spoke to Sydney singer-songwriter Montaigne -- real name Jessica Cerro -- who also gave us her thoughts on the marriage equality debate.","Sydney singer-songwriter Montaigne was one of those throwing her weight behind the push for marriage equality at the 2017 Yours And Owls festival.

Wollongong hosted the Yours And Owls music festival on the October long weekend, two days of sun, fun and bands just a stone's throw from the beach on the beautiful NSW south coast. HuffPost Australia has visited the festival before, calling it ""Australia's coolest small festival"", but the ""small"" tag doesn't exactly fit anymore as the event has expanded to a two-day, four-stage format featuring the likes of The Presets, At The Drive-In, The Preatures, Dune Rats and an impressive lineup of Australia's biggest musical acts.

2017 was the festival's biggest and most impressive iteration yet, but the weekend was tinged with a slightly more serious flavour this time around. Yours And Owls landed on the same weekend as the NRL grand final, and another much-anticipated musical performance -- that of U.S. rapper Macklemore, who was bizarrely the hot topic of the political sphere that week as he prepared to sing his hit song 'Same Love', which promotes marriage equality, in the midst of Australia's own postal survey and debate around same-sex marriage.

Little reminders of the survey were sprinkled all around the festival grounds too, from rainbow-striped drink cups at all the bars, rainbow banners hanging from stalls, a stack of 'Vote Yes' stickers being handed out all over the place, large LCD video screens playing behind bands bearing the same message, and even shout-outs from bands on stage to support the push for marriage equality.

""Fuck homophobia,"" called Aussie band Holy Holy during their set.

HuffPost Australia caught up with Tim Carroll and Oscar Dawson from the band for our Uncut podcast following their set, where they opened up on their support for the marriage equality reforms which they have talked about often online and during their performances, as well as the furore over the Macklemore performance.

""We did a post on our social media [above] saying something along the lines of 'vote yes,' we said 'fuck homophobia'. A few people in the comments said 'it's not homophobic to vote no, you're not instantly a homophobe' and this is where the challenge arises,"" Dawson said.

""People say it's not homophobic, I think 'you can say that but I think it is'. It's entirely a phobia. You're afraid. People say 'you are equal but you're just not allowed to get married' and I'm like 'that's the same as not being equal'.""

Carroll laughed at immigration minister Peter Dutton's suggestion just days earlier that ""presumably two songs should be played, one for gay marriage and one against gay marriage"", in response to the Macklemore controversy. Dutton said this should happen to honour ""free speech"", but Carroll disagreed.

""That's a bit like saying, when there was the decision to give women the vote in Australia, let's have a song against women having the vote. In not all issues is it right to give both sides equal weight. One is a moral absolute, one is on the right side of history and one is not,"" he said.

""I find it really hard to sympathise with the no vote campaign because I feel like it's really hateful and cold and misinformed and out of this time, out of date, out of step with where we are.""

HuffPost Australia also spoke to Sydney singer-songwriter Montaigne -- real name Jessica Cerro -- who also gave us her thoughts on the marriage equality debate. She has been talking to her fans about the marriage push, even raising money for the yes campaign, so we asked if she thought artists felt some responsibility to speak up about important social issues like this.

""I think it's appropriate if the issue is of great concern and interest for the artist. You can't fight every battle. There are a lot of battles I don't fight actively or regularly. My things I think are important are queer right, animal rights, veganism and environmental stewardship,"" said Montaigne, who told us she identifies as bisexual.

""If you're a queer person, you ought to at least put a message out there saying 'I'm going to vote, what are you going to do?' because that matters.""

She said she didn't feel artists had an obligation to speak up if they didn't want to, and understood why some keep their noses out of heated debates.

""Don't just jump on the bandwagon. If you're genuinely invested in whatever it is you're speaking about, great, then you should feel compelled to speak out about it. There are some artists who are a bit more timid and don't want to be attacked for their political views and I totally understand that.""

Starting late Sunday, at least 22 wildfires swept through several counties, including Napa and Sonoma, killing at least 23 people and injuring more than 100. As of late Wednesday, the Sonoma Sheriff’s Office told HuffPost that hundreds of people are still unaccounted for. They said that power outages and intermittent cell phone service may be preventing people from contacting friends and relatives.

California Gov. Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency Monday, and thousands of people have since been forced to flee their homes in mandatory evacuations. By Wednesday morning, at least 3,500 homes and businesses had been destroyed and nearly 170,000 acres burned, according to Daniel Berlant of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.

For those who are evacuating, some will have friends or family to stay with, others can afford a hotel for a few nights ― but for the most vulnerable groups, such as the elderly and the poor, many are staying in one of the dozens of Red Cross shelters that have been set up in the region.

At one such shelter at the Sonoma County Fairgrounds in Santa Rosa ― one of the hardest-hit cities, where smoke still hung thick in the air Tuesday afternoon ― about 300 people had spent the night, according to Jim Bray, Red Cross volunteer and assistant manager at the shelter. Many of those staying at the fairgrounds were older residents from retirement communities.

“We haven’t heard anything ― we think that’s a good sign,” said Candace Hayes, who evacuated from Vigil Light, an affordable housing community for the elderly and disabled, on Monday. Hayes, who is blind, said her biggest concern was “going home. I’d like to go home.”

“That’s the one thing I don’t like: We don’t know what’s going on or what’s going to happen,” she added, as she petted her service dog on the head. “It’s all kind of up in the air.”

HuffPost spoke to several evacuees at the shelter, and a common concern was simply that people wanted to see their homes again, to make sure they were still standing.

“There’s a large evacuation area in Santa Rosa, and even if your house isn’t destroyed, the police are not letting people back in there. That causes a lot of consternation for people, because they don’t know,” Bray told HuffPost, noting that over 500 homes have been lost in the city, about 50 miles north of San Francisco. “Other people know their houses have been burned, but they’re still being kept out.”

HuffPost / Sarah Ruiz-Grossman Evacuees wait at a Red Cross shelter at the Sonoma County Fairgrounds in Santa Rosa, California, on Tuesday.

One couple, Marion and Lloid Heim, who had evacuated from Santa Rosa on Monday and stayed overnight at a hotel, managed to get back to their house Tuesday only to find it burned to the ground.

It was one of many houses on several blocks near Coffey Lane and San Miguel Road that had been leveled by the flames. In some cases, single chimneys or car skeletons were the only recognizable structures left.

“Everything that we have is charcoal,” said Marion Heim, 67, as she stood on the pile of ashes and rubble where her house used to stand. “How fast your life can just… go away.”

Marion and her husband, Lloid, had moved into the house just a year ago, after living for close to four decades in San Rafael, in Marin County. She was confident the insurance would reimburse them for the house, but her biggest concern was whether to rebuild in the same spot.

“I loved this house when we first came here, because it was like Little House on the Prairie,” said Marion, a retired nurse. “When I first walked in, I just knew, it just felt like home.”

“When you see it on TV, you don’t realize until it happens to you: It’s like a death, it’s just so... unreal,” she added. “But this too shall pass. We’ll just start over.”

A hospital in Patna, Bihar, has made is compulsory for patients to furnish an Aadhaar card before they can be admitted for treatment. According to a report in The Telegraph, the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) will only admit patients with Aadhaar cards starting Monday. Emergency patients will reportedly have to submit Aadhaar cards within 15 days of admission.

The hospital's decision to ask for Aadhaar has to do with irregularities in medical insurance cases and patients being treated under the chief minister's relief fund, according to the report.

""We smelled something fishy was going on. So, to prevent any mistake, we have made the norm of taking proof of Aadhar card from the patient before admission,"" the hospital's superintendent Prabhat Kumar Sinha told The Telegraph.

The government recently made Aadhaar for all post office deposits, PPF, the National Savings Certificate scheme and Kisan Vikas Patra.

Earlier this year, the Supreme Court of India made it clear that Aadhaar was optional.

That’s why the theme of this year’s World Mental Health Day is “workplace wellbeing”, hoping to create working environments where employers encourage good mental health and employees feel empowered to speak their minds.

But while we are encouraged to speak about our mental health or even take mental health sick day, for many it’s easier said than done.

According to a 2014 poll by Mind and YouGov, one in five (19%) people have taken a day off sick because of stress. But of those people, the vast majority (90%) gave their employer a different reason for their absence, such as an upset stomach (44%) or a headache (7%).

A recent study found that while more than half of employees (53%) feel comfortable talking about mental health at work, just 11% of those surveyed felt able to disclose a mental health issue to their line manager. Of those, 15% said they had faced negative consequences, such as dismissal or disciplinary as a result.

We spoke to three charities to get advice on empowering employees to take a mental health sick day (whether you decide to fully disclose your reason for being off sick or not).

What Is A Mental Health Sick Day?

While the idea of mental health sick days are creeping into public consciousness, there is no set definition. That said they are generally understood to be taking time off to manage stress or another mental health condition.

Chris O’ Sullivan, head of workplace mental health at the Mental Health Foundation tells HuffPost UK: “It’s a proactive thing you can do when you are starting to feel stressed or worn-out. It might be that you plan a mental health day after you’ve met a big deadline, or you take one at short notice after a stressful period at home.”

Some companies offer discretionary mental health sick days to allow staff to recuperate. The Mental Health Foundation, for example, offers staff three mental health days per year in addition to annual leave.

However other charities are wary of differentiating between mental health days and sick days.

A spokesperson for Mind, the UK’s leading mental health charity tells HuffPost UK: “Sick days can and should be used for a mental health problem, just as for a physical health problem, if it’s severe enough that someone needs time off.

“Creating a distinct category such as ‘mental health sick days’ could undermine the severity and impact a mental health problem can have on someone’s day to day activities, and creates an artificial separation between mental and physical health.”

Lotte Lane, digital editor at The Blurt Foundation, explains that just like regular sick days, employees should use their discretion to work out how ‘bad’ their symptoms need to be to warrant a day off work.

“As a guideline we need to ask ourselves if our illness is stopping us working to our best ability. Will going to work make us feel better or worse? If we went to work, would we be able to do our job effectively? Is it safe for us to work? With some kinds of jobs (such as those that involve driving, heavy machinery or looking after other people) our symptoms might put us or others at risk.

“We also need to consider if our attendance at work that day is absolutely essential. Will the world crumble without us? If not, it’s probably OK to take a mental health day.”

What To Do On A Mental Health Day

Again, there is no hard and fast rule. It’s up to you. Take some time to think about what might be best for you, depending on how you’re feeling at that moment.

This might be a bit of “me time” doing things you enjoy or exploring a new hobby to really take your mind off things.

Lane explains: “What self-care looks like differs from person to person. Some of us might benefit from spending our mental health day snuggled under blankets on the sofa, or in bed; others might find a peaceful walk in nature, or time with loved ones more helpful.”

It might be a good opportunity to be more proactive by booking a doctors appointment or addressing some of the things that are causing unnecessary stress, such as sorting out your finances, Lane adds.

If you decide to seek medical advice for your mental health, read our handy explainer on what to expect when you head to the GP.

But remember this is sacred time to allow you to focus on what you need, try and keep it as focused as possible.

O’Sullivan adds: “Try not to end up committing it to someone else, or sneaking a peek at work stuff – it’s about you and what helps you out.”

How To Speak To Your Boss About Your Mental Health

While some people have had positive experiences talking to their boss about their mental health, others have not. So it’s understandable if you don’t feel comfortable disclosing the full story.

Mind says: “It depends on the relationship you have with your manager, but if you have a good relationship and trust them, you could meet them one to one to discuss what’s going on.

“Having someone from HR present will make the meeting more formal, and normally wouldn’t be necessary in the first instance. But if you didn’t get anywhere with the first meeting then it might be a sensible next step. If you’re thinking of opening up about your mental health for the first time, also think about where you want the meeting to take place.”

O’Sullivan recommends planning what you want to speak about ahead of the meeting. “It can be good to talk to a trusted friend, GP colleague or mentor first. You can also talk to your employee assistance programme if you have one,” he says.

Your Rights As An Employee

Lane says: “Our employers are legally required to respect our mental health too. They have a duty of care for their employees, and ensure their health, safety and welfare under the Health and Safety Act. Minimising any work-related stress and looking after our wellbeing is part of our employer’s responsibility.

“Under the Equality Act 2010, mental health problems that are substantial, adverse, and have a long term effect on normal day-to-day activities count as a disability. Employers have a legal duty to provide reasonable adjustments for an employee who has a disability – this could include the need to take mental health days.”

Mind adds: “Such adjustments vary from workplace to workplace, but typically you might be offered a change of working hours – start time, finish times, breaks, a change of working environment, and more regular catch ups with your manager to discuss workloads, priorities and stress and anxiety levels.”

The unnamed 16-year-old, who has since recovered, went to hospital in Texas when she felt short of breath the next day.

A series of tests lead doctors to diagnose her with three separate conditions, which they believed could be linked to her overzealous cheering.

Her story recently appeared as a case study in the Journal of Emergency Medicine.

EMPICS Entertainment

The doctors noted that while the girl was breathing quickly, her breathing sounded normal.

However, they noticed signs of crepitus - a cracking or clicking sensation that occurs under the skin - when they pressed down around her neck and chest.

Speaking to Live Science, report author Dr J. Mack Slaughter Jr. described the sensation as “feeling Rice Krispies”.

Following x-rays the doctors diagnosed the girl with pneumothorax, which is the term given when air builds up between the outside of your lung and the inside of your ribcage. This is also known as a collapsed lung.

After further examination she was also diagnosed with pneumomediastinum, which is when abnormal gas or air is contained within the mediastinum (the space in the chest between the lung sacs).

Finally, doctors identified rogue air in a third place, near the back of the throat, and diagnosed her with pneumoretropharyngeum.

The team said there was no evidence to suggest an underlying lung condition caused the three problems and noted that shouting could have prompted the damage, although this was impossible to conclude for certain.

“Spontaneous pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and pneumoretropharyngeum are uncommon diagnoses individually, and furthermore, the combination of all three diagnoses has yet to be described in medical literature,” they said in the report.

Commenting on the case study, GP Dr Clare Morrison, from online doctor service MedExpress, said it’s important to remember the girl’s experience is extremely rare.

“I cannot think of another time when lungs have collapsed due to screaming at a pop concert - but there’s a first time for everything,” she told HuffPost UK.

“So it’s important not to panic and for parents to get too judicious.”

She said smokers and recreational drug users have a higher chance of a pneumothorax - or lung collapse - than the general popualation.

“Also, if you’re suffering from a condition like asthma or pneumonia, your chances increase,” she added.

She pointed out that symptoms of a collapsed lung include:

Chest tightness

Tiredness

Rapid heart rate

Nasal flaring

Blue-coloured skin

“A small pneumothorax will likely go away on its own - you could only need oxygen treatment and rest,” Dr Morrison added.

“Often a needle will be used to pull the air out from around the lung so it can expand fully. If the pneumothorax is large, a chest tube will be placed between the ribs into the space around the lungs to help with draining the air and allow the lung to re-expand.

“In such an instance, you could need to stay in hospital. In some more extreme cases, patients may need lung surgery.”

Son mouvement, dans toute son absurdité, laisse en suspens une indépendance sans la déclarer vraiment, alors que le gouvernement de Catalogne affirme qu'elle a bien été déclarée, que la CUP dit que non et que la moitié de l'Espagne, dont la Catalogne, n'y comprend plus rien. Un comportement inadmissible qui confine au ridicule.

Vous me pardonnerez cette tautologie, mais l'indépendance est un sujet si sérieux qu'il doit être traité avec le plus grand sérieux. Or, c'est tout l'inverse. Puigdemont ne peut plus maintenir le gouvernement de la coalition ""Ensemble pour le oui"" (""Junts pel Sí""). Le bloc indépendantiste s'est fissuré à tel point que le processus n'est à présent plus possible: la colère, la stupéfaction et l'exaspération des membres de la CUP sont le reflet palpable du dynamitage d'un projet qui avait insufflé tant d'espoir aux milliers de Catalans. Le 1er octobre, ceux-ci étaient allés voter, malgré tout, intimement persuadés que cette fois, oui, c'était la bonne. C'est ce qui était promis.

La seule échéance que doit gérer Puigdemont, c'est le meilleur moment de disparaître, tête basse, par une porte dérobée.

Au pied du mur, il se raccroche à présent au dialogue avec le gouvernement espagnol, après avoir dynamité toutes les voies de sortie. Mariano Rajoy l'a bien dit et répété, il est disposé au dialogue, mais pas avec Puigdemont. Cela fait longtemps que, pour le chef de l'exécutif, il a cessé d'être un interlocuteur valable. Comme cela, non, et avec lui encore moins. Oriol Junqueras, dans l'ombre, attend son tour.

Carles Puigdemont est un cadavre de la politique. Il réalisera en effet son rêve d'entrer dans l'Histoire, mais uniquement en tant qu'irresponsable (pour les unionistes) ou en tant que traître (pour les indépendantistes). Il n'y a aucune autre issue pour lui. Sa folle stratégie l'a fait passer de héros à déception majeure pour des millions de citoyens pleins d'espoir, à présent stupéfaits, insatisfaits. Venir à bout d'une telle déception serait une œuvre titanesque, qui ne pourra sûrement pas être le fait de celui qui a causé tant de frustration.

L'erreur la plus lourde de Puigdemont, dans tout cela, a été de mettre en pause l'indépendance pour gagner du temps. Gagner du temps sur Mariano Rajoy? Espère-t-il vraiment gagner du temps face à un président connu justement pour manier à la perfection l'art de gagner du temps? C'est en effet maintenant que Rajoy devra jouer son meilleur coup: ne plus bouger aucune pièce car, dans la situation actuelle, l'application de l'article 155 ne se justifie pas. Si le Conseil des ministres extraordinaire l'approuvait ce mercredi, les déçus d'aujourd'hui deviendraient les défenseurs de l'indépendance de demain. L'urgence du moment est de faire tomber la pression. Activer l'article 155 provoquerait tout le contraire.

La seule échéance que doit gérer Puigdemont, c'est le meilleur moment de disparaître, tête basse, par une porte dérobée.

Malgré tout, l'euphorie du camp espagnoliste devra rester contenue: l'indépendantisme catalan ne se sera pas évaporé demain matin. Il restera là, quotidiennement, durant des mois et des années. Bien entendu, il sera voté un jour. Mais pas comme ça.

Su nombre es Mott Solé. Tiene 35 años. Es licenciada en artes escénicas, y cuenta con una maestría en maquillaje teatral. Desde 2009 hace performance, una disciplina que le ha ayudado a expresarse y que utiliza como un acto de protesta.

El domingo 17 de septiembre participó en la manifestación que se realizó del Zócalo a la PGR para condenar el feminicidio de Mara Castilla, la joven que fue asesinada tras abordar un taxi Cabify en Puebla.

Luego de marchar, hizo un ejercicio corporal con el que buscaba simular cadáveres de mujeres asesinadas y lanzadas a lotes baldíos.

Desde hace varios meses inició varios proyectos en los que busca combatir la gordofobia. Está trabajando en una obra de teatro, tiene una columna en una editorial independiente, está por arrancar un programa de radio, y cada tanto realiza performances.

Antes de su presentación, mientras marchaba tomada de la mano de sus compañeras, hacía conciencia de cuántas mujeres habían sido mutiladas, violadas, estranguladas, asesinadas y tiradas en campos abiertos. Lamentó que la sociedad haya empezado a ver los feminicidios como algo cotidiano.

Fue una forma de hacer que la gente viera cómo se ve un cuerpo femenino ensangrentado y tirado en un campo. Para que la gente tome consciencia. Para que reflexione acerca de que pudo haber sido su hermana, su amiga, su pareja. Mott Solé.

Después del performance llegó a casa y se dio cuenta de que lo que para ella había sido una catarsis, para otros había sido objeto de burla.

Crearon memes burlándose de su gordura.

""Cuando me pasaron los memes, mi primera reacción fue de tristeza. La gente está más enfocada en la burla, en la doble moral y en el doble discurso machista que en el problema que estamos viviendo como sociedad. Los feminicidios. La explotación a la mujer. En lugar de reflexionar hace burla y escarnio público de algo que me parecía realmente importante concientizar"", lamentó.

Su peso no sólo motivó a otras personas a generar imágenes ofensivas contra ella, también recibió mensajes en videos que se postearon en redes sociales. ""Me parece que la gente no tiene idea de qué es un performance y menos de lo que es un happening"".

""No estaba mostrando mis senos con orgullo. Estaban llenos de sangre. Estaba simulando que había sido asesinada"": Mott Solé.

Mott se ha dedicado a combatir la fobia social que la gente siente por la gordura desde hace algunos meses. En su página de Facebook postea imágenes suyas y de otras mujeres en las que exige poner un ""¡¡¡ALTO A LA GORDOFOBIA!!!"".

Mott explica que la gordofobia se materializa como una discriminación hacia las personas por su aspecto. ""No somos aceptables ni bien vistos. No somos deseables sexualmente. No somos socialmente aceptables. Nos exigen tener un estándar de belleza"".

Si te aceptas como eres, te quitas muchos pesos de encima. Mott Solé.

Agrega que aunque los hombres también son víctimas de la gordofobia, no sucede en el mismo grado que con las mujeres: ""Es más aceptable un hombre de 35 años con panza chelera que una mujer"".

""Me quemé, traigo ampollas en los pies, sufrí, me deshidraté por tener una causa, por hacer una lucha"".

Lamentó que los seres humanos no estén contentos con su apariencia, ""no somos felices con lo que tenemos, queremos tener el cuerpo perfecto porque creemos que eso nos va a ser más felices y más deseables"", dijo.

""Una mujer tarda muchísimos años en aceptar su cuerpo. No acepta sus lonjas, ni sus estrías, ni sus nalgas o sus senos caídos o fláccidos. La publicidad y la mercadotecnia siempre te exigen que los levantes, los separes y los endurezcas, que seas 20 años más joven toda tu vida"".

Mott explica que su gordura no tiene nada que ver con su salud: ""Yo no digo que no se cuiden. Al contrario, una persona saludable es alguien que se cuida y se siente sana. Yo nunca voy a ser 90-60-90. Mi complexión es gruesa. Soy una persona normal que no se mete con los estándares médicos. Lo mío no es sobre la salud, es sobre el aspecto"".

La artista performance dijo que por su peso ha sido criticada de diferentes formas: ""Se me ha dicho que soy perezosa, que no hago ejercicio, que no soy sana, que tengo cuerpo de señora de 60 años. No tiene que importarte si estoy enferma o no; soy yo, acéptame como soy"", pidió.

Mott asegura que seguirá luchando contra la gordofobia con el mejor instrumento que tiene a la mano: haciendo su arte.

Doch Noch-Finanzminister Wolfgang Schäuble grätscht dem Franzosen mit einem eigenen Plan dazwischen

Das Duell der führenden Euro-Nationen wird wohl Deutschland gewinnen - mit möglicherweise fatalen Konsequenzen

Emmanuel Macron hat es eilig.

Der mit 39 Jahren jüngste französische Staatspräsident aller Zeiten ist kaum fünf Monate im Amt und hat bereits einen ehrgeizigen Plan zur Reform der EU vorgelegt

► Er fordert unter anderem einen eigenen EU-Haushalt, ein Euro-Finanzminister und ein Parlament für die Eurozone.

Doch nun grätscht Noch-Finanzminister Wolfgang Schäuble dazwischen. In einem inoffiziellen Arbeitspapier mit dem Titel ""Wegbereitung einer Stabilitätsunion"" hat er nun seine Vorstellungen zusammengefasst - die Macrons Plänen diametral gegenüberstehen:

► Der CDU-Politiker schlägt einen Ausbau des bestehenden Rettungsfonds ESM (Europäischer Stabilitätsmechanismus) zu einem europäischen Währungsfonds mit weitreichenden Kompetenzen vor. Der ESM ist Teil des sogenannten Euro-Rettungsschirms.

Beide Vorschläge würden Welten voneinander entfernt liegen, kommentiert die ""Welt"" beide Positionen.

""Schäubles zentraler Ansatz setzt auf mehr Überwachung und Disziplinierung der nationalen Haushalte in der Europäischen Währungsunion"", erklärt der Volkswirt Sebastian Dullien der HuffPost.

Macrons Ansatz würde die Euro-Zone hingegen stärker in Richtung eines traditionellen Bundesstaates bewegen. Doch wie wird dieser finanzpolitische Konflikt ausgehen?

Bundesregierung kann Schäubles Vorstoß nicht ignorieren

Schäubles Vorhaben sei ein ""vergiftetes Abschiedsgeschenk für den Euro-Raum"", kommentiert IMK-Vizechef Andrew Watt das brisante Papier. Für die ""Welt"" stellt Schäubles Vorschlag ein ""Affront gegenüber der Kommission und ihrem Präsidenten Jean-Claude Juncker"" dar.

Denn Schäuble schlage ""Pflöcke ein"", die die künftige Bundesregierung nicht so einfach ignorieren könne.

In den kommenden Wochen wollen sich Vertreter Deutschlands und Frankreichs über einen Fahrplan für Reformen der Euro-Zone verständigen.

EU-Kommission soll entmachtet werden

Volkswirt Dullien, Professor an der Hochschule für Technik und Wirtschaft in Berlin, erklärt, dass für Schäuble der ESM künftig eine zentrale Rolle spielen soll. Unter anderem soll dieser bei finanziellen Schwierigkeiten eines Mitgliedstaates einen Schuldenschnitt einleiten können und zudem - als Teil der Bankenunion - Mittel für die Banken-Restrukturierung bereitstellen können.



Dullien betont: ""Dieser Ansatz läuft auf eine Entmachtung der EU-Kommission und einer Stärkung des ESM heraus.""



Auffällig ist aus Sicht Dulliens, ""dass es weltweit keinen Währungsraum gibt, der nach den Vorstellungen Schäubles funktioniert."" Er bezweifelt deshalb, dass die Vorschläge ""zu einem sinnvollen Funktionieren der Euro-Zone führen"" werden.

Macron wird das Duell verlieren

Das Ziel von Frankreichs Staatschef dagegen: Mit einem eigenen Budget für den Euroraum will er öffentliche Investitionen zu tätigen. Und so verhindern, dass Drittstaaten - wie in der Griechenland-Krise - massiv die Investitionen der betroffenen Länder beschneiden und damit die Krise weiter verstärken.



Macron werde sich mit seinen Vorschlägen aber nicht durchsetzen, glaubt Dullien:

► Einerseits habe Deutschland faktisch ein Veto-Recht bei Reformen der Euro-Zone.

► Andererseits habe Berlin aufgrund der besseren wirtschaftlichen Lage und guter Staatsfinanzen eine stärkere Verhandlungsposition.

Der Volkswirt hält es aber für unwahrscheinlich, dass Frankreich einem Mechanismus der Schuldenrestrukturierung zustimmen wird.



Kommt es in Deutschland tatsächlich zu einer Jamaika-Koalition mit einem FDP- oder einem CDU-Finanzminister - wonach es derzeit aussieht - ""würde es in den kommenden Jahren keinen Fortschritt bei der Reform der Euro-Zone geben"", kritisiert Dullien.

Sollte die Euro-Krise wieder aufflammen, sind möglicherweise keine ausreichenden Vorkehrungen getroffen, um diese sinnvoll abzufedern. Im Extremfall könnte die Euro-Zone sogar auseinanderbrechen, warnt Dullien - mit verheerenden Folgen für die Export-Nation Deutschland.

After President Donald Trump fired Murthy in April, however, he has focused on a different national crisis: loneliness.

“As prevalent as loneliness is, many people don’t recognize that people that they know may very well be suffering from loneliness,” Murthy told HuffPost. “It’s important for many reasons, one of which is that it has a profound impact on health.”

And while it might seem like a departure, Murthy sees a number of connections between fighting the opioid epidemic and addressing loneliness in the United States.

In September, Murthy wrote a cover story about workplace loneliness for the Harvard Business Review and pointed to the connection between loneliness and poor health. In the article, Murthy noted that loneliness and weak social connections are associated with reduced lifespan and a greater risk for illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, dementia, depression and anxiety.

Indeed, one meta-analysis, published in PLOS Medicine in 2010, examined 148 studies and found that participants were 50 percent more likely to avoid an early death if they had strong social relationships.

“Physicians, health professionals, educators, and the media should now acknowledge that social relationships influence the health outcomes of adults and should take social relationships as seriously as other risk factors that affect mortality, the researchers conclude,” the PLOS editors wrote.

Another meta-analysis, published in Perspectives on Psychological Science in 2015, examined 70 studies on social connection shortfalls, such as social isolation, loneliness and living alone, and found that the mortality risk from social disconnection was greater than the mortality risk associated with obesity.

A growing number of people feel ‘profoundly alone’

When Murthy was traveling the country as surgeon general, he asked communities nationwide about the issues that were most important to them and how he could help address them.

“What I heard time and time again was that people were in fact dealing with an epidemic of stress and loneliness,” Murthy said. “In times of stress, you hope that people will come together and support each other, but I found that there were a growing number of people who were saying that they felt profoundly alone.”

As it stands, more than one-third of Americans say they are lonely, according to a 2010 AARP survey of more than 3,000 adults 45 and older.

Lonely individuals were more likely to be middle-aged, have never married and have lower incomes. Loneliness was also associated with poor health in the survey, with only 25 percent of people who rated their health as “excellent” saying they were lonely, compared with 55 percent who described their health as “poor.”

There’s also evidence that Americans are getting lonelier.

The average size of Americans’ social networks has decreased by a third since 1985, with 12 percent of Americans now saying they have no one with whom they can discuss important matters, according to a Pew Research Center survey from 2009.

And since loneliness tends to increase with age as friendship networks tend to shrink, the United States’ aging population appears poised to get even lonelier and less healthy in coming years.

Nobody wants to talk about being lonely

Similar to the silence surrounding the opioid crisis and addiction, many people are hesitant to talk about feeling isolated.

“Part of the reason people don’t talk about their loneliness is that they feel they will be judged for it,” Murthy said.

“This is something that we’ve seen as being really important in addressing the addiction crisis, an area which is similarly burdened with this unfortunate stigma. But there it’s been very important for people to step forward and talk about their struggles with addiction, to talk about their families’ experiences with addiction, and to support and offer help to those who are struggling.”

The individuals Murthy met who were in recovery for opioid addiction stressed that without support, either from an individual or a group, their recovery wouldn’t have been possible. Murthy sees that support as an integral part of addressing the loneliness epidemic.

In a workplace setting, addressing loneliness could mean employers checking in to see if their employees feel valued and supported by their colleagues and encouraging high-quality relationships between employees that extend beyond working on projects or attending office happy-hours together. On a person-to-person level, addressing loneliness can mean paying attention to people who might be lonely and reaching out to them, even if it’s just an informal conversation that’s not about work.

And while it might seem counterintuitive, it can be valuable for people who feel isolated to help others. “When you help someone else, not only do they benefit, but you reaffirm to yourself that you have something of value to give them, and you help to strengthen and nurture a bond with an individual that you’re helping,” Murthy said.

The former surgeon general stressed that the interventions he had in mind went deeper than policy or program changes.

“What we’re talking about is a change of culture in the workplace,” he said.",What A Surgeon General Learned From The Opioid Crisis Could Help Fight Loneliness,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/surgeon-general-vivek-murthy-loneliness-opioid_us_59db8529e4b072637c457d4e

I have a question for Varun Dhawan. Say, he's at a department store with some friends, getting supplies for a party. A random man walks up to a female friend, while she is bent over a shelf, and spanks her butt. Would he — as he probably expected his audience in Judwaa 2 to — break into peals of laughter?

My hunch is, he or any decent person for that matter, won't find harassment of that kind funny. In his latest film, Dhawan plays Raja, a man who cannot control his urge to grab a woman's butt when he sees one. Now the problem is not Dhawan playing the man — he is an actor and he'd ideally play a gamut of different characters — but the film's insistence that this man is its 'hero'. And, like a zillion Hindi films before it, also establish that this butt-grabber, sexual harasser is a man women will eventually fall in love with, because they actually secretly consider being chased and grabbed as a rite of passage to fall in love. I guess, at this point, we should just be thankful that Bollywood movies aren't yet suggesting women actually want to date the T-Rex or that human-chomping shark from Jaws.

In 10 days, Judwaa 2 has made Rs 112 crores. It is hardly surprising, given that the last time he played an entitled Indian man chasing a woman and not taking 'no' for an answer, it was a blockbuster hit, too, that made over Rs 200 crore.

In Badrinath Ki Dulhaniya, his character Badri abducted the girl and locked her inside the trunk of his car... yet the film was being hailed far and wide as 'feminist'.

In Badrinath Ki Dulhaniya, his character Badri abducted the girl and locked her inside the trunk of his car. His father threatened to hang her in the town square and none of them apologised for these specific incidents of violence inflicted on the woman. Yet the film was being hailed far and wide as 'feminist'.

Why?

Because, though true to Bollywood, boor extraordinaire Badri gets the girl, he also gets ridiculously sloshed and tells his horrible, violent father at the conclusion of the film that he is a bad person who doesn't not let women pursue careers. My guess is people in India found it fairly progressive that the protagonist did not actually let the woman he abducted die inside the trunk of the car. Though common human sense says, such a man shouldn't be let alone near an ant unsupervised, forget a human being, in the Indian scheme of gender justice, all was fair in love and two super-hit nightclub numbers. The rousing support for Badrinath Ki Dulhaniya was symptomatic of how even in the presumably 'aware' social circles in India, dignity of women is considered a conditional allowance, not an unquestionable right, the breach of which should be met with punishment, not romance. In a country with a frustrating understanding of gender equality, we actually cannot afford to send out mixed messages as Badrinath Ki Dulhaniya did.

The rousing support for Badrinath Ki Dulhaniya was symptomatic of how even in the presumably 'aware' social circles in India, dignity of women is considered a conditional allowance, not an unquestionable right,

Judwaa 2 doesn't even pretend that nearly two decades have passed since the original film was released, when there were just a few channels to call out it's obnoxious sexism. Which brings us to the question, what gave the makers the courage to go ahead and make the same film, its misogyny intact? Look no further than the film's raging collections and the nearly non-existent protests, to figure what.

One is compelled to wonder if Bollywood's slapstick ideas only have to do with violating women's bodies and ignoring consent? Judwaa 2 showcases every possible way of harassment imaginable to women in India, perpetrated by the male protagonist. A lecherous co-passenger hurling sexually coloured comments at a woman on a flight, a man in a mall who grabs someone's butt, a man who has been rebuffed but comes back to forcibly smooch a girl in a public space, a man who spots a house help in a skirt and immediately grabs her and rubs himself against her — the list is infuriating.

Not only that, the women in the film — obviously — are made out to be the most confusing humans you would know. So the character played by Tapsee Pannu is initially upset that Varun Dhawan's character forcibly smooched her and her mother, but runs right back into his arm thinking it was him who fought a few louts harassing her at a basketball game. A part of me felt that character she plays doesn't need a boyfriend, she needs a lesson in self-respect first.

A part of me felt that character doesn't need a boyfriend, she needs a lesson in self-respect first.

Judwaa 2's success comes unsurprisingly at a time when a host of men and women actually went to town arguing that the repulsive 'Aunty Ki Ghanti' song doing the rounds of the internet was actually about consent. Several 'fans', apart from shouting lines from that song in public places, argued that since the singer is asking 'Bol na anty aoon kya', it is clear that he is seeking consent. Ask them what kind of people actually think saying 'hey should I come and flap your boobs' qualify as consent, they will present you a plethora of arguments that usually make one point — 'but it's a joke!'

Before HuffPost India and a few other news outlets pointed out the frighteningly misogynistic nature of the song, several social media pages of comedy groups and even self-proclaimed 'feminist' content sites made 'funny' memes about the song, helping normalise and legitimise this brand of misogyny as 'fun'. No wonder Judwaa 2 exists and is laughing its way to the bank.

Ask any woman, if a random man grabbed her butt in a mall and gnawed at her mouth, she'd be furious and traumatised. It's high time films start sticking to the script of reality on issues like these.

Yesterday, 11 October, was International Day of the Girl and Beyonce honoured it with a powerful new video of her Freedom track from her 2016 hit album Lemonade.

The new videos shows young girls from around the world mouthing the song's lyrics, while disturbing statistics about atrocities against girls are outlined in the background — like 71% of human trafficking victims are female, 63 million girls have undergone female genital mutation, 130 million girls are out of school, among many others.

The most piercing moment of the video comes in the form of a little Black girl dancing in front of the Capitol Hill, with Abraham Lincoln's statue watching over her in the background. In another shot, another one dances in front of the White House.

Intentional or not, these moments are poignant reminders of the oppression faced by girls who find themselves at the intersection of sexism and racism in Trump's America.

Those more rooted in ground level realities, including farmers themselves, will seek coherent tackling of the wide variety of concerns.

Usually, the novice will suggest raising subsidies on agricultural inputs, a-la the Chinese model, and raising the government administered support price for certain crops. In effect, they wish that the government subsidise the production, and thereafter purchase the output at a raised cost. This essentially means that agriculture be addressed as a public sector project, and worse, with logic that advocates to further expand the inbuilt inefficiencies.

It is ingenuous minds who raise imagery of a perpetual cycle of under-priced inputs and artificially priced outputs; a cycle of fabricated demand and magical reality.

Sadly, such naiveté is not unique to novices but has also been the approach of a few 'experts', who tend to pursue answers to sequential equations, seemingly unaware of the magnitude and diversity of variables that agriculturists have always sought to balance.

A wider market offers optimal price, the common citizen being the largest source of revenue for farmers.

There are some who also profess that this vision is a pipe dream and needs divine intervention. India has passed the age of 'bearded babas waving magic wands', is increasingly grounded in reality, and seeks sustainable answers with long-term solutions.

These kind of suggestions are from those who remain unable to perceive the farmer as an enterprising business person, one who seeks to expand and grow, rightfully. Instead they, consciously or subconsciously, accede farming to be a failed venture, whose growth cannot be linked to its markets. Lacking capacity, such proposals are stop-gap answers and inadequate in vision and understanding.

Agriculture is not bound by the few crops that have administered or minimum support prices (MSP). Farmers output a large bouquet of produce, in multiples of the MSP rated crops. The MSP mechanism benefits very few farmers who grow wheat, paddy, sugarcane and cotton, and only in regions where it is honoured through linked procurement.

Physical access to a one-India market, one of the largest in the world, is what the farmers really strive for.

The government's own procurement is limited in range and coverage (for building strategic buffers mainly), and the administered price system is a minimum cost-plus model to offer margin support. Whereas a wider market offers optimal price, the common citizen being the largest source of revenue for farmers. Ineffectual linkage with this larger market disallows farmers from connecting with the best value, leaving them no recourse but to settle for minimum returns.

Farmers today, need to monetise their produce for optimal value. Not just the reprieve at any nearby market, but at markets further afield where they feed real and ready demand. Physical access to a one-India market, one of the largest in the world, is what the farmers really strive for. They are not ones who pursue gratuity in perpetuity but seek equal opportunity and scope to grow. Growth that will come when agriculture is developed as any business enterprise should be driven by a value that is market-led. Anything less means being sated with cost-plus models or waivers, and thereby missing the bigger agenda.

The Prime Minister's challenge was not a loosely cast gauntlet, asking for quick-fix reactions. His dare positions a short-term objective and lays the ground for a changed approach in thought and action: on how we treat farmers. It directs towards a very long-term progressive phase in India's future. This is not a matter to be scoffed or one that invites counter challenges, it is actually a notion towards greater national prosperity, inspiring and one that must be worked and advanced upon.

A committee for doubling farmers' income, constituted by the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers' Welfare, has introduced what is probably the most extensive and comprehensive series, of both the strategies and the tactics, of implementable actions that will lead to sustained income growth for farmers.

Also known as the DFI Committee, its draft reports are available on the Ministry's website, inviting public comments. All concerned should review the documents with a holistic perspective, and suggest how various proposals by the committee can be strengthened for a more constructive and coherent phase in India's nation-building.

It is time to redefine agriculture, with a vision that is not constrained by past insecurities

Primarily, future strategies must aim to ensure that farmers are empowered with a choice of market. Farmers need not monetise their produce only through near-farm transactions, but be facilitated with agri-logistics to connect with the pan-India market, so as to supply at the best price possible.

The consumers' changing preferences and associated demand cannot be de-linked from farmers' income growth. Market-led agriculture must replace blind drives to increase production. Higher output does not add to income unless connected with markets. The marketing system itself needs to be opened up, disabling the rules that discourage wider participation from entrepreneurs.

It is time to break the shackles that weigh down agriculture, the very restraints that were released off industry in the liberalisation years. It is time to redefine agriculture, with a vision that is not constrained by past insecurities, and revamp the heartland of India. There is no India, no city, no society, without agriculture and this reality is slowly sinking in.

Agriculture will, and slowly is, recovering its rightful place in our socio-economic matrix; we just need to accelerate this momentum sensibly. Not for now, or for tomorrow, but for many coming decades.

Der Befreiungskampf um Mossul hat die einstige Hochburg des IS stark verwüstet

Die Altstadt ist zerstört - und die Menschen kämpfen um ihr Überleben

Khaled al-Dschaburi kann sich noch genau daran erinnern, wie dieser Platz früher aussah. Dort drüben die Gemüsehändler, daneben Restaurants und Cafés, das Leben pulsierte.

""Es war immer voll hier, das ist das Zentrum Mossuls"", sagt der grauhaarige Mann mit einer Stimme, die von Zigaretten heiser geworden ist. Er ist hier aufgewachsen, er hat hier gespielt, er kannte jeden Winkel. Bab al-Tub, wie der Platz heißt, war seine Heimat.

Jetzt blickt Khaled nur noch auf zerbombte Häuser, die entstellten Skeletten gleichen, auf Berge aus Schutt und Steinen, staubig, grau und leer.

Khaled ist noch immer fassungslos. ""Es ist sehr schwer zu glauben, dass all das hier passiert ist"", krächzt er, als er mit seinem Wagen weiter durch die Trümmerlandschaften Mossuls fährt, wo er als Projektmanager des UN-Entwicklungsprogramms arbeitet.

Mossul war einst wichtigste Hochburg des sogenannten Islamischen Staates (IS) im Irak. Nach dem Sieg gegen die Terrormilz liegen weite Teile in Trümmern. Die Altstadt ist kaum noch zu retten - und die Menschen kämpfen täglich ums Überleben.

""Die schlimmste Schlacht seit Stalingrad""

Ein Kämpfer einer schiitischen Miliz in Mossul

Die Millionenstadt im Norden des Irak war drei Jahre lang das Zentrum der Terrormiliz IS. Von hier aus überrannten die Extremisten im Sommer 2014 große Teile des Landes. Hier zeigte sich IS-Chef Abu Bakr al-Bagdadi in der Großen Moschee das erste und einzige Mal öffentlich, um ein ""Islamisches Kalifat"" auszurufen.

Als vor einem Jahr die Offensive irakischer Sicherheitskräfte zur Befreiung Mossuls begann, ahnten viele, dass es ein langer und schwerer Kampf werden könnte. Sie sollten Recht behalten.

""Das war seit Stalingrad die schlimmste Schlacht in einem urbanen Zentrum"", sagt ein internationaler Helfer, der ungenannt bleiben möchte.

Besonders schwer haben die Kämpfe, Granaten und Bomben den Teil Mossuls getroffen, der westlich des Flusses Tigris liegt. Die Straßen führen vorbei an zertrümmerten Häusern, in denen sich Schutt türmt, die Fensterscheiben zerschossen, riesige Löcher klaffen in den Wänden. Manche Gebäude haben die tragenden Mauern verloren und sind wie tot zur Seite gekippt.

Die Altstadt ist ein Geisterviertel

Auch drei Monate nach dem Sieg über den IS in Mossul riegeln irakischen Sicherheitskräfte die Altstadt im Westteil ab, wo sich die Extremisten bis zum Schluss verschanzten. Unter den Trümmern verbergen sich unzähligen Sprengfallen, die IS-Anhänger dort versteckt haben.

Auf dem Weg zur Großen Moschee liegen Autos und Kleinlaster in einem Krater übereinander gestapelt, wohl die Spuren eines Luftangriffs der US-geführten internationalen Koalition.

Doch es ist nicht nur der Anblick von zerstörten Häuser und zertrümmerten Wagen, der unheimlich wirkt. Das Inferno des Kriegs hat die Altstadt in ein Geisterviertel verwandelt, leer von Menschen, von Grün, von Leben, von Hoffnung. Über den Straßen liegt eine verstörende Stille, eine beängstigende Ruhe nach dem Sturm.

""Wo sollen wir hin?""

Muaijad Dschasim geht mit seiner Familie durch die zerstörte Altstadt von Mossul. Quelle: dpa

Eine Familie - Vater, Mutter, kleiner Sohn - läuft einsam über eine der Straßen. Sie wohnten da drüben in einem Trümmerhaus um die Ecke, sagt Muajad Dschasim, graue Haare, tiefe Falten im Gesicht, 47 Jahre alt. ""Wir haben keinen anderen Ort"", sagt er. ""Wo sollen wir hin?""

Während in Ost-Mossul langsam das Leben zurückkehrt, gleicht der Westen einer toten Stadt ohne Strom und Wasser. Für die Altstadt gebe es praktisch keine Hoffnung mehr, sagt der internationale Helfer.

Zu sehr hätten Kämpfe und Luftangriffe das Gebiet zerstört: ""Das lässt sich nicht mehr reparieren. Es muss von Grund auf neu aufgebaut werden. Die irakische Regierung muss eine Entscheidung fällen.""

Jahrzehnte von Aufbauhilfe liegen vor den Menschen

Das UN-Entwicklungsprogramm UNDP geht davon aus, dass 15 Viertel im Westen der Stadt, einst Heimat für 250.000 Menschen, völlig zerstört sind. Rund eine Milliarde Euro seien nötig, nur um die lebenswichtigste Infrastruktur in Mossul wieder instand zu setzen.

Das UNDP-Wiederaufbauprogramm, eines der größten in seiner Geschichte, konzentriert sich zunächst auf Strom- und Wasserwerke, Krankenhäuser, Schulen sowie Straßen. Um den Menschen etwas Arbeit zu geben, finanziert es Straßenreiniger.

Deutschland ist dabei nach den USA der größte Geldgeber für das Programm. Das Entwicklungsministerium gibt unter anderem Geld für das Trinkwassernetz und den Wiederaufbau der Universität.

Trotz der Hilfe dürfte es Jahre, wenn nicht Jahrzehnte dauern, bis in viele Viertel West-Mossuls Leben zurückkehrt. Auch im Allgemeinen Krankenhaus dort gleicht die Arbeit einem täglichen Kampf ums Überleben. Was dort fehlt?

""Beim letzten Mal dachte ich, sie töten mich""

Hassan Ibrahim, Leiter des Allgemeinen Krankenhauses in West-Mossul. Quelle: dpa

Klinik-Leiter Hassan Ibrahim, 60 Jahre alt, muss überlegen: ""Ich weiß gar nicht, wo ich anfangen soll.""

Er habe kein eigenes Budget, sagt Hassan Ibrahim, sondern sei abhängig von Geldgebern aus dem Ausland, Katar hat einiges gespendet, Deutschland gibt ebenfalls Geld. Doch es herrsche akuter Mangel an Medikamenten, um die Hunderte von Patienten zu versorgen, die täglich kämen, sagt Mediziner. Nutzen können die Ärzte ohnehin nur das Keller- und Erdgeschoss.

Die oberen Etagen sind zerstört vom Krieg, die Wände schwarz und verbrannt, das Dach von Granaten aufgerissen, der Fahrstuhl läuft seit langem nicht mehr.

Allerdings sind das nur die materiellen Schäden. Die verletzten Seelen der Menschen schmerzen wahrscheinlich noch mehr.

Der IS habe seinen Bruder und Neffen getötet, sagt Hassan Ibrahim. Ihn selbst hätten sie vier Mal vor Gericht gezerrt, wegen ""unsinniger"" Vorwürfe. ""Beim letzten Mal dachte ich, sie töten mich"", sagt der Arzt. Er flüstert, als er das erzählt. Die Angst ist noch lange nicht verschwunden.

We were out of the diaper phase and almost out of the babysitter phase. While we were enjoying this new phase in our family, our hearts yearned for another child. And though we were physically capable of creating a new life, we instead wanted to create space for a baby in need of a home.

When we began to talk about our decision, we received mixed messages from our friends and family. Some people were cautious, telling us that such a decision was a risk and that the baby could come with special needs. We were asked why would we want to raise an infant again at this stage of our parenting journey. And we were questioned about why we would want to do this, given that we already had two beautiful, biological children. Some were concerned whether I would be able to love a baby from another's womb to the same extent that I loved my own biological children. And that led to my own concerns. Would I be able to love all of my children the same?

On the other hand, many people were incredibly supportive, offering non-stop emotional support. Some friends even offered to come over and set up an instant nursery with the baby furniture they'd been holding onto in their garage to help show our dedication during adoption agency's home visits.

I was surprised when people felt the need to explain the risks to me. I am a professor of special education and a child psychologist. I teach teachers how to best meet the needs of children with special needs in the classroom. In my clinic, I have assessed countless adopted children over the years. Our very own godchild was adopted from Korea. If anyone knew the risks, it was me. It seemed a bit absurd that they were compelled to tell me these things, but I understood it was their way of showing love and concern for my family's well-being.

The love that filled my heart was nearly overwhelming.

I tried to articulate exactly what it was that had brought us to this choice, but it wasn't easy. How do you explain such a personal, intrinsic desire? How could I put into words the grace, beauty and incredible love I observed in families that had made this choice? How do you explain the deep need for human connection that is only made possible through opening your heart in this way?

Once a decision like this is made, one that feels so true to your family, no amount of skepticism can deter you. Almost exactly a year later, our infant son Jack was placed in our arms.

The love that filled my heart was nearly overwhelming. It was heady and destabilizing. But, of course, on every single level it was also one of the most beautiful moments of my life. He was born with some medical challenges that required a short stay in NICU, but that didn't matter to me. The love I instantly felt for Jack was just as intense as the love I felt after giving birth to my girls. I could not imagine that life could hold such treasure for my family and I, and that I was able to experience such a love three times over.

We had some fun the next Halloween. Would we dress up as people who won the ""Jack-pot?"" Would we put Jack in a pot? Could we dress him in a gold jumper and say he was the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow? How do you put into worlds the incredible luck? The incredible gift? The incredible sacrifice a young woman made for him? A sacrifice that fills me with earth-shattering gratitude and love.

This year, our Jack turned five years old. He started kindergarten at a wonderful school. He is taught and cared for by amazing educators (and I mean amazing!) He is learning and growing and making friends. Each day he seems to sparkle to me. He comes home from school filled to the brim with excitement and pride of his accomplishments that day. No matter how happy he is, I think I am always even more excited and a little more proud.

I cannot even imagine what life would have been like if we did not make this choice. I am so grateful to all the people, and the universe itself, for the cosmic magic of allowing me to raise this child. And for those considering the adoption journey for their own family, I encourage you to listen to what your heart tells you, how your family feels and, if it feels right to you, pursue it with all you have.

Twenty families were first allegedly boycotted, then threatened and turned away from their homes even as police continued to look for two men who killed a Rajasthani folk singer in Jaisalmer's Danta village.

The entire episode started when during Navaratri, a faith healer, Ramesh Suthar, complained that Amad Khan, a singer from the Manganiyar community of Muslim folk singers, did not sing the Raag Parcha correctly because of which he could not reach a state of trance during a ritual.

Reports suggest that on the same night, Suthar and two of his relatives, Shyam Ram and Tara Ram, allegedly dragged Khan out of his house and killed him. His body was found in the temple next morning, after which his family silently buried him.

Ramesh Suthar, who belongs to an upper caste Hindu community, and others from his community allegedly threatened others of the Manganiyar community in the Danta village and forced 20 families to leave the village and seek refuge with their relatives in Balad.

The incident has put the spotlight on the Manganiyar's of Rajasthan – a Muslim community that has been singing praises of Hindu gods for generations.

Manganiyars originate from Rajasthan's Jaisalmer and Barmer, and in Pakistan's Sindh province.

Though they are Muslims, for centuries they have been singing peans of Hindu gods.

Shalini Ayyagari, an Assistant Professor at the University of California, Berkely, writes in her dissertation, Small Voices Sing Big Songs: Music and Institutional Culture in Western Rajasthan:

""Customarily the Manganiyar, a community considered to have been extremely low caste and lacking voice and class mobility, have provided family genealogies and ceremonial music to their hereditary patrons for remuneration for at least the past three centuries. They have been affiliated not only with individual patron families, but entire family lineages over many generations through social and economic co-dependence. With modernization the importance of these customary patronage relationships is waning and in their location, development initiatives, cultural tourism, and more modern modes of musical production are filling in, pointing to new ways of understanding the ways in which cultural subjectivities can be imagined and inscribed through music. ""

Manganiyars have lived under the patronage of Hindu landlords and nobility for years.

They pass on their singing tradition from generation to generation and are said to have been entertainers in courts of Rajput princess. They even travelled with them to war to provide entertainment.

The genre of Rajasthani folk music sung by them is world famous.

The Hindu in a report about the community says that while till 1950 their music was confined to only Rajasthan, with the help of an activist, Komal Kothari, groups of singers and performers from the community have travelled far and wide in India and outside.

Its ""two checked bags at no extra charge"" and ""no ticket-change penalty"" policies make Southwest a clear winner for being nice to customers. Fortunately, at least so far, Southwest seems to have convinced Wall Street that those passenger-friendly policies gain more revenue in total customers than it would gain by imposing fees and losing customers.

At least for now, Alaska Airlines' Mileage Plan seems more generous than the big-line programs that are moving toward dollar-based earnings and rewards. You still get one mile for every mile flown, and the award chart mileage requirements are less than the effective requirements on the giant airlines. Alaska still has useful partnerships with Air France/KLM, American, British Airways, Delta, Korean, Qantas, and a few others. We don't know how long Alaska will retain its current system, but it's a winner as long as today's rules remain. If you accumulate miles or points through a credit card that allows transfers, such as American Express, the award chart for Air Canada's Aeroplan is more generous than current big lines' plans. But you get only partial mileage credit when you fly on Air Canada's lowest fares. Related: 6 Ways to Get the Best Coach Seat Every Time (Photo: Alaska Airlines)

Yes, JetBlue beats it by the measurements, but Virgin America keeps earning great survey ratings for its flashy decor, well-trained flight attendants, top inflight technology, and general flair.

The nod for best ultra-low-fare carrier for coach-class service goes to Allegiant, not because of its base product—which is down there with Spirit in terms of sheer torture—but because it alone brings the only low-fare mainline service to dozens of communities where travelers would otherwise have to rely on regional flights to nearby hubs, with the usual hassle, wasted time, and high fares of hub connections. Allegiant's ""nowhere to somewhere"" business model gives travelers to/from communities as small as Hagerstown, Missoula, Owensboro, Provo, South Bend, and Stockton access to nonstop flights to 16 of the country's primary leisure travel destinations, including Honolulu, Las Vegas, Myrtle Beach, Orlando, and Phoenix.

Southwest is the only airline to offer useful senior fares for travelers 65 or over. Senior fares aren't as low as Southwest's initial lowest ""Wanna Get Away"" fares for travelers of any age, but when those lowest-fare buckets sell out or when they're no longer available less than a week in advance, Southwest's unrestricted senior fares are usually a lot less than any remaining any-age fares.

JetBlue, which starts out with a 1- to 3-inch advantage for regular coach, retains a similar advantage for its extra-legroom cabin. And the price, capped at $90 for a transcontinental flight, is likely to be lower than the variable prices other airlines charge. This is a big advantage JetBlue has over Virgin America, the one airline that surveys usually place in the same class as JetBlue. On Virgin America, the extra-legroom seats, limited to bulkhead and exit rows, cost more than three times the regular-coach fare: more than $900 on a transcon, for example, compared with a base coach fare of $300. Yes, you get extras along with the legroom, but that huge fare premium is a deal breaker for someone who just wants enough space to use an e-reader or tablet comfortably.

The giant airlines will charge you around $1,200 for a nonstop summer round-trip flight between New York and Paris in a cattle-car economy cabin. But two people paying $1,495 each can move up to an angle-flat business-class seat, with business-class cabin service, on La Compagnie, the niche French airline offering low-cost business-class service from Newark to London/Luton and Paris/DeGaulle. La Compagnie's current fare is almost $1,000 less than the premium economy fares on Open Skies or Air France. The price gap between regular economy and La Compagnie isn't always this small. But whenever it is, you sure feel better when you arrive in London or Paris after an overnight in business class than in economy. It's worth considering.

(My character, Alice, in the last Resident Evil movie has this sickness and it really sets in motion the creation of the T-virus).His daddy @lukes_dad78 felt that he would rather live more modestly and quit his job so he could spend every minute Luke has left with his son. I wanted to share his story with you all because his parents would love for people to be more educated about Progeria and if anyone wants to help in a financial way, that is of course appreciated, but definitely not expected. I've included Luke's FB page info so you can read more about this brave little fellow and for any of you able to donate, I've also included a pic of his gofundme info as you can't post links on here. Thanks for taking the time everyone, I know from yesterday's post how many parents with sick children follow me and will be empathetic to Luke's mom and dad. Your kind words to them are as, if not more important than donations. Xo m❤️ p.s. I've been reading your wonderful, supportive comments and I swear, I'm crying right now. I feel so happy to have such amazing people following me. So full of empathy and compassion. You've made my day. Thank you all so much. 👊🏼👍🏼👏🏼❤️❤️❤️

""He just grinned like a jerk,"" Crews said of the perpetrator. He explained that he didn't immediately react because he was afraid of how it would look. (""'240 lbs.

A representative for Crews told HuffPost the actor would not be commenting further.

Crews' story comes after Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, Rosanna Arquette, Rose McGowan and other women in Hollywood have gone public with tales of the harassment and abuse they say they sustained at the hands of Weinstein. A small but growing number of high-profile celebrities ― including Jennifer Lawrence, Meryl Streep and George Clooney ― have spoken out against Weinstein and in praise of the women who've shared their experiences so far.

The Weinstein Company fired its co-founder on Sunday in response to the allegations against him.

INTERNATIONAL - Les Etats-Unis ont annoncé ce jeudi 12 octobre qu'ils se retiraient de l'Unesco, accusant l'institution d'être ""anti-israélienne"".

Les Etats-Unis conserveront un statut d'observateur, a précisé le Département d'Etat, en lieu et place de leur représentation à l'agence onusienne basée à Paris.

Washington avait déjà quitté l'Unesco entre 1984 et 2003.

Le retrait annoncé ce jeudi ne sera effectif qu'à compter du 31 décembre 2018, conformément aux statuts de l'Unesco. ""Cette décision n'a pas été prise à la légère, et reflète les inquiétudes des Etats-Unis concernant l'accumulation des arriérés à l'Unesco, la nécessité d'une réforme en profondeur de l'organisation, et ses partis pris anti-israéliens persistants"".

Washington avait prévenu début juillet de son intention de réexaminer ses liens avec l'Unesco après sa décision de déclarer la vieille ville de Hébron, en Cisjordanie occupée, ""zone protégée"" du patrimoine mondial. Cette décision, qualifiée d'""affront à l'Histoire"", ""discrédite encore plus une agence onusienne déjà hautement discutable"", avait alors déclaré l'ambassadrice américaine à l'ONU, Nikki Haley.

L'inscription d'Hébron sur la liste du patrimoine mondial en danger et la caractérisation par l'Unesco d'Hébron comme ville islamique ont provoqué la fureur israélienne, les juifs revendiquant une présence de 4000 ans à Hébron.

Haut lieu de tensions, Hébron abrite une population de 200.000 Palestiniens et de quelque centaines de colons israéliens, qui sont retranchés dans une enclave protégée par des soldats près du lieu saint que les juifs désignent sous le nom de tombeau des Patriarches et les musulmans mosquée d'Ibrahim.

Le Premier ministre israélien Benjamin Netanyahu avait à l'époque qualifié de ""délirante"" la décision de l'Unesco.

Quelques mois plus tôt, l'Unesco avait identifié Israël comme une force d'occupation à Jérusalem.

Les Etats-Unis, grands alliés d'Israël, avaient déjà pris leurs distances avec l'Unesco. Ils avaient ainsi arrêté de participer à son financement en 2011 après que l'agence a admis les Palestiniens parmi ses Etats membres. Mais ils continuaient depuis à siéger au Conseil exécutif de l'Unesco, composé de 58 membres.

Selon le département d'Etat, un statut d'observateur permettrait de continuer d'apporter la ""vision"" et ""l'expertise"" américaines ""sur certains dossiers importants gérés par l'organisation"", notamment ""la protection du patrimoine mondial, la défense de la liberté de la presse"" et la promotion des sciences et de l'éducation.

Mesures contre l'anti-sémitisme

La directrice générale de l'Unesco Irina Bokova a immédiatement dit ""regretter profondément"" le retrait américain. ""L'universalité est essentielle à la mission de l'Unesco pour construire la paix et la sécurité internationales face à la haine et à la violence, par la défense des droits de l'Homme et de la dignité humaine"", a-t-elle estimé. ""C'est une perte pour la famille des Nations Unies. C'est une perte pour le multilatéralisme.""

Dans son communiqué, Bokova dresse un inventaire de mesures prises par l'Unesco en partenariat avec les Etats-Unis contre l'anti-sémitisme. ""Ensemble, nous avons travaillé avec le regretté Samuel Pisar, Ambassadeur honoraire et envoyé spécial pour l'enseignement de l'Holocauste, afin de partager l'histoire de l'Holocauste pour lutter contre l'antisémitisme et prévenir des génocides, avec la Chaire Unesco pour l'éducation au génocide au sein de l'Université de Californie du Sud et avec celle consacrée à l'alphabétisation au sein de l'Université de Pennsylvanie"".

Ou encore ""nous travaillons avec l'OSCE pour produire de nouveaux outils pour les éducateurs contre toutes les formes d'antisémitisme, comme nous l'avons fait pour combattre le racisme anti-musulman dans les écoles"".

En pleine élection

Cette semaine, le conseil exécutif des 58 pays membres doit désigner celui ou celle qui succédera à la Bulgare Irina Bokova, qui achève deux mandats marqués par des dissensions politiques et les difficultés financières de l'organisation. Il vote chaque jour depuis lundi, à l'issue de sa journée de travaux. Jusqu'à quatre tours de scrutin peuvent être organisés si aucun candidat n'atteint la majorité absolue. Si un cinquième vote devait être organisé, il porterait alors sur les deux arrivés en tête au 4e tour. Ce choix sera ensuite soumis à l'approbation de la conférence générale des 195 États membres le 10 novembre.

Les pays arabes ont aussi de leur côté revendiqué fermement la direction générale, pointant que leur groupe n'avait jamais occupé le poste. Néanmoins ils sont arrivés divisés sur la ligne de départ, avec initialement quatre candidatures.

Les candidats du Qatar et de la France sont arrivés en tête et à égalité mercredi à l'issue du troisième tour de scrutin pour l'élection. Alors que cinq candidats restent en lice, après le retrait mercredi du représentant du Vietnam, Hamad bin Abdoulaziz Al-Kawari, 69 ans, et Audrey Azoulay, 45 ans, ont chacun recueilli 18 des 58 voix du conseil exécutif de l'Unesco, selon les résultats officiels.

En filigrane de cette élection, figure donc la question israélo-palestinienne, avec des positions controversées de l'Unesco sur Jérusalem et Hébron, et l'adhésion en 2011 de la Palestine à l'organisation, qui a entraîné la suspension du financement des États-Unis. Or, ces derniers fournissaient près du quart du budget de l'agence, qui ""est fragile car elle n'a pas énormément de moyens financiers ni de moyens humains"", souligne-t-on de source diplomatique. L'Union européenne et ses États-membres en sont aujourd'hui le premier financeur (40% du budget).","Les Etats-Unis se retirent de l'UNESCO accusant l'institution d'être ""anti-israélienne""",http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2017/10/12/les-etats-unis-se-retirent-de-lunesco-accusant-linstitution-detre-anti-israelienne_a_23241145/

Almost nine years after undergoing a double mastectomy following a breast cancer diagnosis, the “Anchorman” actress is speaking out about the next steps she’s taken to ward off the disease.

“Two weeks ago, I had my ovaries and [fallopian] tubes removed,” Applegate said Wednesday on the “Today” show. “My cousin passed away from ovarian cancer in 2008. I could prevent that.”

“That’s how I’ve taken control of everything. It’s a relief,” she added. “That’s one other thing off the table. Now, let’s hope I don’t get hit by a bus.”

The 45-year-old revealed she tested positive for the BRCA1 gene mutation, which greatly increases the odds of developing cancer. There’s also a chance that Applegate’s daughter Sadie, 6, will inherit the gene, which has prompted a major lifestyle change for the family.

Experten und Politiker warnen vor einer nuklearen Aufrüstungsspirale, wenn Trump das Abkommen bricht

Donald Trump hat geschimpft und gedroht. Er hat den Iran einen Schurkenstaat genannt und das Atomabkommen verteufelt. Er hat gesagt, dass er sich nicht mehr daran gebunden fühlen könne.

Nun steht eine der bislang wichtigsten außenpolitischen Entscheidung des US-Präsidenten bevor. Bis zum Sonntag muss er dem Kongress mitteilen, ob sich Teheran an die Vereinbarung hält oder nicht.

Trump hat eine Rede angekündigt, sie wird für Freitag erwartet. Mehrere deutsche Politiker warnten bereits vehement vor einer Aufkündigung.

Außenminister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) erklärte zuletzt, er sei ""sehr besorgt"" über die Entwicklung – auch weil Nordkorea wohl kaum auf eine atomare Aufrüstung verzichte, ""wenn der einzige Vertrag, der einen solchen Verzicht ermöglicht hat"" aufgekündigt werden würde.

#Trump will offenbar raus aus dem Atom-Abkommen mit dem Iran. Außenminister @sigmargabriel ist besorgt - das hat auch mit #Nordkorea zu tun. pic.twitter.com/ZylvQippll — Bericht aus Berlin (@ARD_BaB) 9. Oktober 2017

Auch Grünen-Außenexperte Omid Nouripour warnte: ""Hat der Iran die Bombe"", würden bald auch ""Saudi-Arabien, die Türkei und vielleicht auch noch Ägypten nach der Bombe greifen"". Nouripour zufolge würde das die zahlreichen Konflikte im Nahen Osten ""auch noch nuklearisieren"".

Düstere Aussichten. Denn selbst wenn man die positiven Erfahrungen der USA der letzten Dekaden mit Atomwaffen als Abschreckung zum Maßstab nimmt: Eine solche Aufrüstung einer Krisenregion würde die internationale Bemühung um Frieden um Jahre zurückwerfen.

Die wichtigsten Fragen und Antworten vor dem Schicksalstag im Überblick:

1. Worum geht es in dem Abkommen?

Die Vereinbarung zwischen dem Iran einerseits sowie den USA, Russland, China, Frankreich, Großbritannien und Deutschland andererseits soll sicherstellen, dass Teherans Atomprogramm ausgebremst wird und so internationale Sorgen vor einer Bombe zerstreut werden.

Der Iran unterwirft dadurch seine Urananreicherung bis zu 25 Jahre lang einem mehrstufigen System von Beschränkungen und Kontrollen. Der Westen hob im Gegenzug die Wirtschaftssanktionen auf.

2. Was hat nun Trump genau vor?

Es gilt als derzeit wahrscheinlichstes Szenario, dass Trump erklären wird, dass das Abkommen nicht im nationalen Sicherheitsinteresse der USA ist und er es deswegen nicht erneut bestätigen kann. Das wäre aber noch nicht der Rückzug der US-Regierung aus dem Abkommen.

Trump würde es dem Kongress überlassen, was passieren soll. Das Parlament müsste innerhalb von 60 Tagen entscheiden, ob es Konsequenzen aus Trumps Schritt ziehen will. Dabei geht es etwa um die Wiedereinführung von ausgesetzten Sanktionen.

Aber schon mit seiner Positionierung gegen den Deal könnte der Präsident der Vereinbarung nach Einschätzung europäischer Diplomaten schaden. Es müsse ein Minimum an Bekenntnissen von amerikanischer Seite geben, heißt es.

3. Was sind Trumps Motive?

Der Republikaner und seine Regierung halten das Abkommen für problematisch. Es geht ihnen nicht weit genug. Zwar hieß es aus der US-Regierung zuletzt immer wieder, dass der Iran die technischen Vorgaben der Übereinkunft erfülle. Allerdings halten sie der iranischen Führung vor, dass ihre Politik in krassem Gegensatz zu den in dem Deal vereinbarten friedlichen Absichten stehe.

Sie sagen, Teheran fördere den Terrorismus in der Region, etwa durch die Unterstützung der Hisbollah im Libanon und der Hamas im Gaza-Streifen. Sie werfen der Regierung auch vor, Israel zu bedrohen.

Trump treiben daneben wohl vor allem persönliche Motive. Er sieht sich auf einem Feldzug, die politischen Entscheidungen seines Amtsvorgängers Barack Obama rückgängig zu machen. Wohl auch deshalb bezeichnete er das Abkommen wiederholt als ""schlechtesten Deal, der je gemacht wurde"".

4. Hält sich der Iran an die Auflagen?

Der 16. Januar 2016 markiert den eigentlichen Beginn des Abkommens. Damals attestierte die Internationale Atomenergiebehörde (IAEA), dass der Iran sein Nuklearprogramm drastisch eingeschränkt hat. Seitdem überwachen die Inspektoren der IAEA mit beispielloser Strenge, ob die Islamische Republik alle Vorgaben einhält.

In zwei Fällen überschritt Teheran minimal die Grenze für Schwerwasser, was umgehend korrigiert wurde. Das bisherige Fazit der IAEA: Der Iran hält sich an das Abkommen. Yukiya Amano, der Direktor der Organisation, bekräftigte diese Einschätzung am Montag noch einmal.

5. Was soll laut Abkommen bei Problemen passieren?

Eine ""Gemeinsame Kommission"" zur etwaigen Lösung von Streitfragen tagt regulär viermal im Jahr und kann im Bedarfsfall jederzeit einberufen werden. Zuletzt hatte sich der Iran beschwert, dass Trump mit seinem Kampf gegen das Abkommen die angestrebte Normalisierung der Wirtschaftsbeziehungen torpediere.

Teil des Abkommens ist auch der ""Snapback""-Mechanismus. Er sieht vor, dass ausgesetzte Sanktionen erneut verhängt werden können, wenn Teheran in signifikanter Weise das Abkommen verletzt. Sollte es zu diesem Schritt kommen, hat der Iran bereits im Text des Deals seinerseits einen teilweisen oder völligen Ausstieg aus dem Abkommen festgelegt.

6. Wendet Trump dieses Verfahren an?

Nein.

7. Wie könnte der Iran auf Trumps Entscheidung reagieren?

Sowohl Irans Präsident Hassan Rohani als auch sein Außenminister Mohamed Dschawad Sarif haben in den vergangenen Wochen mehrmals vor Provokationen durch Trump gewarnt. Ihrer Meinung nach versucht er, den Iran zu radikalen Reaktionen zu zwingen, um Teheran dann für das Scheitern des Abkommens verantwortlich zu machen.

Daher müsse man besonders behutsam vorgehen und alle weiteren Schritte mit den anderen Unterzeichnern des Abkommens absprechen, erklärte die iranische Regierung. Die erste Gelegenheit für solche Gespräche wäre das für Ende Oktober in Wien geplante Treffen der 5+1 Gruppe auf Vizeaußenminister-Ebene.

8. Ist es denn möglich, dass es zu neuen Verhandlungen über das Abkommen kommt?

Das gilt als sehr unwahrscheinlich. Teheran hat das ausgeschlossen. Auch in Europa ist der Drang, die Vereinbarung nachzuverhandeln, nicht sehr groß.

Möglich ist aber, dass Deutschland, Frankreich und Großbritannien andere Aktivitäten des Irans wie das Raketenprogramm getrennt davon in einem Maßnahmenpaket adressieren.

Er warnte vor einer inhaltslosen Politik und dem Abstieg der Volksparteien

Nun droht dem einstigen Hoffnungsträger ein Debakel bei der Wahl - auch, weil er seine eigenen Warnungen ignorierte

Als die Kameras aus sind, ziehen sich die beiden Konkurrenten auf den Studiobalkon zurück.

Gerade eben hatte der österreichische Kanzler Christian Kern im TV-Duell noch bekräftigt, seinen Konkurrenten von der rechten FPÖ, Heinz-Christian Strache, und ihn würden ""Welten trennen"".

Nun rauchen beide zusammen und plaudern. Die Szene beschreibt der deutsche Journalist Philip Oltermann für den britischen ""Guardian"" - und sie steht symbolisch für das, was nach diesem Sonntag in Österreich geschehen könnte:

Die rechte FPÖ könnte Teil einer neuen Regierung werden - auch dank der sozialdemokratischen SPÖ von Kanzler Kern. Explizit ausgeschlossen hat Kern eine Koalition mit den Rechtspopulisten nämlich nicht.

Vor rund eineinhalb Jahren, als der Österreicher die Kanzlerschaft übernahm, waren sein Anspruch in der Politik und sein Verhältnis zu den rechten und radikalen Kräften im Land noch anders.

Ein Abgleich seiner Antrittsrede von damals und dem Stand jetzt, wenige Tage vor der Wahl des Nationalrats, zeigt, wie sehr die österreichische Bundesregierung versagt hat.

”Der schrecklich fesche Herr Kern”

Im Mai 2016 trat Kern die Nachfolge seines Parteikollegen Werner Faymann an, der nach sinkenden Umfragewerten und innerparteilicher Kritik am restriktiven Kurs in der Flüchtlingspolitik Konsequenzen zog.

Kern versprach einen Neustart der Beziehungen in der Regierungskoalition und in der Politik allgemein. Der 51-Jährige schien der richtige Typ dafür zu sein.

Als Quereinsteiger aus der Wirtschaft - von 2010 bis 2016 war Kern Chef der österreichischen Bahn - galt er als Hoffnungsträger und als einer, der Dinge anpackt. Der ""schrecklich fesche Herr Kern"", sei ein ""Macher, den die Menschen mögen"", kommentierte ""Spiegel Online"" wenige Monate nach Antritt des Politikers.

Für viel Aufsehen sorgte schon seine Antrittsrede am 17. Mai 2017. Darin rechnete Kern nicht nur mit den Eliten des Landes ab, sondern formulierte auch eine optimistische Vision für die Zukunft Österreichs.

Eine deutliche Warnung

Kern prangerte die ""Inhaltslosigkeit"" der Politik an. Und warnte deutlich:

Wenn wir so weitermachen – und ich habe dabei besonders die Bundesregierung (in Österreich, Anm. d. Red.) im Auge – wenn wir dieses Schauspiel weiter liefern, ein Schauspiel der Machtversessenheit und der Zukunftsvergessenheit, dann haben wir nur noch wenige Monate bis zum endgültigen Aufprall. Wenige Monate, bis das Vertrauen und die Zustimmung in der Bevölkerung restlos verbraucht sind.

Dazu gelte es, kurzfristige und langfristige Trendwenden einzuleiten, damit Österreich wieder ein Land werde, in dem ""Aufstieg in der Gesellschaft nicht nur ein leeres Wort ist, und nicht nur wenigen vorbehalten bleibt.""

Kern mahnte auch an, dass die Art und Weise der Zusammenarbeit der verkrachten Großen Koalition aus seiner SPÖ und der ÖVP sich dringend ändern müsse.

Denn er sei davon überzeugt: ""Wenn wir jetzt nicht kapiert haben, dass das unsere letzte Chance ist, dann werden die beiden Großparteien nach dieser Regierung von der Bildfläche verschwinden - und wahrscheinlich völlig zurecht.""

17 Monate später ist vieles von dem eingetreten, vor dem Kern noch so energisch gewarnt hatte.

Der Schmutzkübel

Zwar sind die Volksparteien nicht von der Bildfläche verschwunden. Die konservative ÖVP führt in den Umfragen deutlich mit 33 Prozent. Dahinter folgen jedoch gleich die Rechtspopulisten der FPÖ mit 27 Prozent.

Kerns SPÖ ist nach einem Höhenflug nach Amtsantritt des ""feschen Kanzlers"" auf 23 Prozent abgestürzt.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: TV-Duell in Österreich: Eine Szene zeigt, was dem Land nach der Wahl blühen könnt

Ein Grund ist auch: Die Inhaltslosigkeit der Politik, vor der Kern so eindringlich warnte, beherrscht den Wahlkampf in Österreich.



Der Wettstreit der Parteien gleicht einer Schlammschlacht.

Die sogenannte Schmutzkübel-Affäre überdeckt alle Inhalte. Facebook-Seiten überzogen den ÖVP-Kandidaten Kurz mit falschen Anklagen, verbreiteten rassistische und antisemitische Hetze. Kerns Ex-Berater im Wahlkampf, der Israeli Tal Silberstein, soll die Seiten ohne Wissen der SPÖ organisiert haben.

Ein persönlicher Mitarbeiter von Kurz wiederum soll SPÖ-Zirkeln Geld angeboten haben, um Informationen über die Fake-Facebook-Seiten zu bekommen.

Die Atmosphäre zwischen der SPÖ und ÖVP in der Großen Koalition in Wien ist vergiftet - und das nicht erst, seit der Schmutz an die Öffentlichkeit dringt. Die Neuwahlen am Sonntag sind das Ergebnis eines monatelangen Streits.

Für Eskapaden sorgte etwa immer wieder ÖVP-Innenminister Wolfgang Sobotka, der Bundeskanzler Kern attackierte - und zusammen mit Kurz für einen Eklat sorgte, als er im Mai eine Sitzung des Ministerrats schwänzte.

Aber auch Kern selbst soll an dem schlechten Klima in Österreichs GroKo seinen Anteil gehabt haben - sagen zumindest seine Kritiker von der ÖVP. Sie unterstellen ihm einen Dauerwahlkampf und eine ständige Selbstinszenierung.

Und so attestierte die liberale österreichische Tageszeitung ""Kurier"" Kern nach einem Jahr im Amt im Mai 2017 eine gemischte Bilanz: Der Neustart der eigenen Partei sei ihm gelungen, er habe der SPÖ wieder ein schärferes Profil verschafft.

Doch: ""Die 'Stimmung im Land', die Kern vor einem noch 'drehen' wollte, ist am Boden.""

Österreichs ""New Deal""

Dabei hat die österreichische Bundesregierung unter Kern durchaus politische Erfolge vorzuweisen. Kern rief in Österreich einen ""New Deal"" aus, in Anlehnung an die Wirtschafts- und Sozialreformen von US-Präsident Franklin D. Roosevelt in den 1930er Jahren.

Dazu gehörte etwa die sogenannte ""Aktion 20.000"". Mit dem Projekt sollten Langzeitarbeitslose in (gemeinnützige) Jobs gebracht werden. Der Anstieg der Arbeitslosigkeit der Generation über 50 sei dadurch aufgehalten worden, sagte Sozialminister Alois Stöger (SPÖ).

Tatsächlich sinkt die Arbeitslosigkeit in Österreich seit März 2017 kontinuierlich. Kerns hat also innenpolitisch Zeichen gesetzt - und Erfolge gefeiert. Doch, dass die Stimmung in Österreich ""am Boden ist"", liegt ebenso an ihm.

Denn der ""Slim-fit-Kanzler"", wie Kern wegen seiner Vorliebe für maßgeschneiderte Anzüge genannt wird, hat sich die Themen von der FPÖ diktieren lassen.

Das rechte Diktat

Der österreichische Politologe Anton Pelinka bezeichnet Kerns Kurs gegenüber der österreichischen Zeitung ""Der Standard"" als ""FPÖ light"".

Als Beispiel nennt Pelinka auch die von Kern unterstützte Forderung, Kindern im EU-Ausland die Familienbeihilfe zu kürzen.

Oder den Brief des Kanzlers an Kommissionspräsident Jean-Claude Juncker im April, in dem er forderte, Österreich vom EU-Umsiedlungsprogramm von Asylbewerbern auszunehmen.

Der österreichische Journalist und Kern-Biograf Robert Misik erklärt gegenüber dem ""Standard"": Der Kanzler habe sich von Umfragen beeindrucken lassen, die ihn als zu weit links der Mitte verorteten.

Klar ist auch: Kern ist mit hohen Erwartungen gestartet, womöglich mit zu hohen. Schwierigkeiten bereitet ihm nun allerdings vor allem ein selbstgeschaffenes Problem: Den umstrittenen Berater Tal Silberstein heuerte Kern selbst als Wahlkampfhelfer an.

Laut Recherchen des österreichischen Magazins ""Profil"" und der Tageszeitung ""Presse"" soll Silberstein eine viel zentraler Rolle im Wahlkampf eingenommen haben, als Kern nun im Nachhinein gestehen wolle.

Silberstein habe den Wahlkampf zu einem Zweikampf zwischen Kern und ÖVP-Herausforder Kurz stilisieren wollen - auch mit schmutzigen Mitteln.

Sollten die Recherchen stimmen, Kern hätte Verrat an sich selbst begangen. So oder so: Statt auf seine Inhalte und seinen ""Plan für Österreich"" zu setzen, wie er vor eineinhalb Jahren ankündigte, hat er sich auf den österreichischen Intrigantenstadls eingelassen, der die Wiener Politik schon seit Jahren beherrscht.

Den Aufstieg des FPÖ-Politikers Strache hat er dennoch nicht verhindern können - und so seine eigene Macht verspielt.

Let's face it: what do you look for when you're in the market for a new smartphone? Sure, you may consider the storage space or the speed but when it comes down to it, the first question most people ask is 'how good is the camera?'.

It was the first question we asked when the iPhone 8 Plus was released a few weeks back and so we've been having a play to fill you in.

Portrait Mode was introduced with the 7 Plus but what's new is the introduction of Portrait Lighting. It pimps out the feature even further, but as a recap, Portrait Mode essentially lets you take cool portraits (hence the name) of a subject.

What it does is makes the the person or thing is in focus and the background or non important matter is out of focus. The result is a pic that looks super professional, like it was taken on a DSLR.

Now with the addition of Portrait Lighting you can play around with the brightness and shade even further to get a really good shot.

There are five lighting modes:

Natural Light . Your subject's face in sharp focus against a blurred background;

. Your subject's face in sharp focus against a blurred background; Studio Light . A clean look with your subject's face brightly lit;

. A clean look with your subject's face brightly lit; Contour Light . Dramatic shadows with highlights and lowlights;

. Dramatic shadows with highlights and lowlights; Stage Light . Your subject's face spotlit against a deep black background;

. Your subject's face spotlit against a deep black background; Stage Light Mono. Like Stage, but in classic black-and-white.

I snapped this pic of my friend Deni really quickly while walking down the street.

The one tricky thing to get used to with Portrait Mode is that it's a lot more 'zoomed in'. This is because the subject is meant to be a certain distance from you (fairly close but not too much), and then the background a certain distance from the subject, for the best result. This takes a little getting used to but definitely produces the best images.

Apple suggests shooting against a non-solid background to get the most out of the depth effect, so try to position your subject against a busy background or a colourful setting. It's also suggested that when using Stage Lighting, try shooting a photo slightly below your subject's face level.

These extra effects make this smartphone the ideal camera for parents, proud pet owners or anyone who enjoys taking photos, really.

It also has a really impressive video offering. It suggested you take video in landscape to get the full effect and there's a whole bunch of new features when it comes to filming, too. They welcome 4k video (which means it's faster and better quality) and they have improved on the slo-mo feature as well as the optical zoom -- the dual-lens camera means you can now get videos with optical zoom at 2x, so zooming in isn't totally grainy.

Racist abuse and threats to “bomb the mosque” feature heavily among the hate crimes, as do incidents of offenders smashing windows on buildings and parked cars.

Other records include offensive graffiti sprayed on to buildings, violent assaults on worshippers, two cases of arson and two cases of individuals leaving bacon on door handles at mosques.

Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott called the figures “deeply troubling”.

“Attacks on any religious group or minority are abominable,” she said, adding: “These anti-Muslim attacks will be condemned by all decent people.”

The data was obtained by the Press Association through Freedom of Information requests to UK police forces. The figures, based on 42 responses from 45 forces, also show:

25 forces saw a year-on-year increase in hate crimes directed at mosques, with the biggest rise reported by Greater Manchester Police (nine crimes, up from zero) and London’s Metropolitan Police (17 crimes, up from eight). Threats, harassment or other intimidating behaviour more than tripled, from 14 crimes in 2016 to 49 in 2017. Violent crime against individuals more than doubled from five recorded crimes against worshippers at mosques in 2016 to 11 crimes in 2017. Crimes recorded as vandalism or criminal damage increased from 12 in 2016 to 15 in 2017.

Britain endured a number of terror attacks claimed by Islamic State over the period in which the crimes were recorded, at London Bridge, Westminster and Manchester.

The figures come to light within weeks of separate incidents in which an imam and surgeon who treated Manchester bombing victims was stabbed outside a mosque in Cheshire and a 14-year-old boy was stabbed multiple times in the face and neck outside a mosque in Birmingham.

Other high-profile cases of hate crime at mosques this year include the Finsbury Park terror attack in June, a Manchester mosque gutted by fire in an arson attack in July and the sending of a white powder and bomb threats to three mosques across London in July.

More than 50 places of worship, almost half of them mosques, applied for the most recent round of anti-hate crime funding from the Government, which ended in June.

Applications for funding, intended to provide security measures, were made available to all places of worship in April and May but extended into June after terror attacks at the start of the summer.

Abbott called on the Home Office to publish data on hate crimes against all places of worship “as a matter of course” after “worrying reports of attacks on synagogues as well as mosques”.

She said: “Politicians have a particular responsibility in the language they use, the policies they advocate and the climate they create.

“There should be a unanimous message that violence against any section of our society is unacceptable.”

Tell Mama, a charity who monitor and record anti-Muslim incidents, said “sadly these figures have not come as a shock”.

The group’s director, Iman A’tta, told HuffPost UK that between June 2013 and May 2017 it had recorded 160 incidents against mosques.

“As anti-Muslim hatred has sadly become more vocal and noticeable, mosques are seen as the visible symbol of local Muslim communities and are therefore targeted. However, the impact of the wider Muslim community using the mosque is significant.”

Tell Mama told HuffPost that terrorism is a “major driver” for anti-Muslim attacks, but added there were other factors such as “inflammatory media headlines and far right extremism and rhetoric”.

“However, the largest impact on Muslim communities is through terrorism and that can’t be denied since some seem to believe that the media is the major cause of anti-Muslim attacks.

Inflammatory headlines may play a role, but they do not come anywhere near the real world impacts that Islamist terrorism causes. Sadly, British Muslims are then caught and squeezed between those who use their faith to murder and those who target them and those who use such situations to play to exclusionary mindsets.”

A Home Office spokesman said: “All forms of hate crime are completely unacceptable and the UK has some of the strongest laws in the world to tackle it.”

A report by Hope not Hate in August highlighted that Britons’ attitudes towards Muslims and Islam had “worsened” with more than half of all respondents to a new survey believing the religion “poses a threat” to the West.

“The fear and hostility displayed towards Muslims is deeply worrying, despite most people claiming that they stand firm against extremists’ attempt to conflate their heinous actions with that of an entire religion,” Hope not Hate (HnH) chief executive Nick Lowles said of the finding’s of the charity’s Fear And Hope 2017 report.",Hate Crimes Targeting Mosques In UK More Than Doubles In A Year,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/hate-crimes-targeting-mosques-in-uk_uk_59db1893e4b046f5ad9935c2

The Chancellor is set to ignore calls from colleagues who want to see the public spending taps turned on in his November statement.

Last month, the Chancellor urged his colleagues to send him ideas on how to attract the millions of under 47s who shunned the Tories in the General Election.

Messages on housing and education costs seemed to be getting through to Hammond, with the Tories using their Party Conference to announce extra cash for the Help to Buy scheme, a freeze in tuition fees and more money for social housing.

However, HuffPost UK has been told Hammond is holding private meetings with Tory MPs, and they are being warned is is unlikely there will be headline-grabbing announcements in November as a result of pessimistic economic forecasts by the Office for Budget Responsibility.

Treasury sources insisted the Budget process is still ongoing, and no firm decisions have been made.

One MP told HuffPost UK: “The truth of the Budget is that the OBR downgraded our productivity, and it’s going to be a safety-first Budget.

“He’s pretty determined to keep to the fiscal rules – that’s where we are on it.

The MP added: “Maybe now is the time to be cautious – the OBR put a kibosh on anything else.”

Another MP who gave a presentation on ideas for the Budget – which included areas where savings could be made alongside increased spending – told HuffPost UK they would be frustrated if the Chancellor was just going through the motions.

When asked if it would be a “safety first” Budget, the MP said: “I hope not. Why else would he be getting us to make presentations?”

Since Hammond’s call for ideas at a meeting of backbench Tory MPs in September, the OBR has revised down its prediction of the UK’s productivity.

In March, the OBR predicted productivity in the UK would grow by 1.7% - giving the Chancellor an extra £26billion for the public finances.

After the review, the OBR discovered it had over-estimated the UK’s productivity for the past seven years.

It has been calculated as much as two-thirds of the £26billion fund – which had been put aside as a Brexit war-chest - might not materalise.

The Tories’ conference announcements on housing and tuition fees were met with a muted response by many.

The free-market think tank The Adam Smith Institute described the extra £10billion being ploughed into the Help to Buy as “like throwing petrol on to a bonfire,” while the Institute for Public Policy Research said the scheme not only pushed up property prices but only benefited those who can afford to buy homes anyway.

The capping of tuition fees at £9,250 was branded “desperate” by Labour – who have vowed to abolish the charge entiterly.

SANTÉ - Les effets indésirables signalés depuis l'arrivée du nouveau Levothyrox sont dus à ""un déséquilibre thyroïdien"" causé par le changement de traitement et non à la nouvelle formule elle-même, selon les premiers résultats de l'enquête de pharmacovigilance publiés mercredi 11 octobre par l'Agence du médicament ANSM.

""Tous les effets indésirables témoignent d'un déséquilibre thyroïdien en lien avec le changement de traitement; aucun effet indésirable d'un type nouveau, qui serait spécifique de la seule nouvelle formule, n'a été retrouvé"", explique l'ANSM dans un communiqué.

""Tout changement de spécialité ou de formule peut modifier l'équilibre hormonal et nécessiter un réajustement du dosage"" qui peut prendre ""un certain délai"", poursuit l'Agence.

Au 15 septembre, ""14.633 signalements ont été reçus par les centres régionaux de pharmacovigilance (CRPV)"", selon l'ANSM.

""Sur ce total, les cas rapportés par les patients comme graves, c'est-à-dire déclarés comme ayant des conséquences sur la vie familiale, professionnelle ou sociale, et les cas les plus documentés, soit 5.062 cas, ont pu être enregistrés prioritairement dans la base nationale de pharmacovigilance (BNPV)"", poursuit-elle.

Sur ces 5062 cas, quatre sont des décès, mais ""le lien avec Levothyrox n'est pas établi"", est-il précisé dans le rapport de l'enquête, mis en ligne sur le site de l'ANSM.

Le nombre de signalements d'effet indésirables est inédit

""Le recueil des signalements et l'enregistrement dans la BNPV se poursuivent et feront l'objet de publications ultérieures"", précise l'ANSM en soulignant que ""les 14.633 signalements (...) représentent 0,6% des 2,6 millions de patients traités par Levothyrox nouvelle formule"".

""Le nombre de signalement d'effets indésirables avec Levothyrox nouvelle formule est inédit, avec un possible effet amplificateur du portail de signalement et des réseaux sociaux"", relève le rapport.

Les effets les plus fréquemment rapportés sont la fatigue, les maux de tête, l'insomnie, les vertiges, les douleurs articulaires et musculaires et la chute de cheveux.

Les 5062 cas analysés concernent à 90,7% des femmes (9,3% d'hommes).

Le rapport s'interroge sur les cas de ""certains patients qui présentent à la fois des signes d'hypo ou d'hyperthyroïdie"".

C'est l'une des raisons pour lesquelles ses auteurs souhaitent ""que soit mis en place un groupe de travail constitué de professionnels de santé, pharmacovigilants et patients afin de poursuivre les investigations"".

Une alternative au Levothyrox disponible le 16 octobre

La nouvelle formule du Levothyrox a été réclamée par l'ANSM au laboratoire Merck en 2012 afin, selon elle, de rendre le produit plus stable dans le temps. Le changement ne porte pas sur le principe actif mais sur d'autres substances, les excipients.

Face à la colère de patients signalant des effets secondaires, la ministre de la Santé Agnès Buzyn avait annoncé le 15 septembre le retour sous quinze jours de l'ancienne formule avant l'arrivée de médicaments alternatifs.

L'ancienne formule est arrivée dans les pharmacies le 2 octobre (sous le nom d'Euthyrox), mais pour une durée et dans des quantités limitées.

Après cette solution transitoire, l'ANSM a annoncé mercredi que le L-Thyroxin Henning (laboratoire Sanofi), destiné à offrir une alternative aux patients qui ne supportent pas le nouveau Levothyrox, serait disponible le 16 octobre (et à partir du 23 dans les territoires d'Outre-Mer selon le laboratoire).

Enfin, un autre médicament sera disponible à partir de novembre. Jusqu'à cette crise, le Levothyrox était en situation de quasi-monopole en France.

As-tu travaillé sur ce livre, parce que tu as déjà douté de l'utilité du métier de journaliste culturel?

Je ne me suis jamais remise en question en me disant que mon travail ne servait à rien. Par contre, après avoir rencontré tous les gens pour le livre, j'ai réalisé à quel point la portée de l'art était plus importante que je le croyais. Cela dit, j'ai une personnalité un peu nonchalante et j'ai tendance à dire qu'on ne sauve pas des vies. En réfléchissant à cette formule, j'ai réalisé que mon travail sert à quelque chose. Par exemple, le lendemain des attentats au Métropolis, je parlais d'un nouvel album et je me demandais c'était quoi le rapport de faire ça. Mais je pense qu'on a besoin de sortir de cette violence et cet événement dont on parle depuis trois heures. Ce n'est pas futile.

Tu as commencé ta carrière en 2007 au Grand Journal de TQS. Pratiques-tu ton métier pour les mêmes raisons 10 ans plus tard?

Au départ, j'étais plus une passionnée des arts qui voulait voir plein de spectacles. Aujourd'hui, je me concentre sur le thrill de faire découvrir des choses. Je me vois comme une curatrice de contenu. L'offre culturelle est tellement vaste que ça ne sert à rien de parler de tout. Je préfère choisir et prendre le temps de communiquer aux auditeurs ce que j'aime. Je ne vais pas perdre mon temps précieux en ondes à expliquer pourquoi une pièce dans un petit théâtre m'a déplu. En même temps, je ne suis pas une courroie de transmission qui sert à plugger les artistes en disant que tout le monde est beau et fin. Quand un spectacle très attendu est décevant, je dois le dire. Mais je préfère aider les gens à découvrir la culture.

Tu racontes dans le livre qu'en voyant Guy Nadon dans Variations énigmatique, à l'adolescence, tu as décidé de devenir «spectatrice professionnelle». Est-ce qu'une œuvre a déjà eu l'effet de réparer un morceau de ta vie, comme c'est le cas de plusieurs de tes intervenants?

Le monologue de Sophie Cadieux dans la pièce Cette fille-là. Je suis sortie de là avec l'impression de me réconcilier avec une partie de mon adolescence. Je n'étais vraiment pas malheureuse, mais j'étais dans la gang du milieu, ni la plus cool ni la plus rejet, et j'avais en tête qu'il fallait qu'on se tienne. Le personnage de Sophie raconte une histoire d'intimidation ultra intense et elle n'avait rien fait. Elle était amie avec les bully et, sans y avoir participé, elle se questionnait sur pourquoi elle n'avait rien fait. Je suis sortie de là en me disant que j'avais sûrement fait des affaires d'une grande immaturité au secondaire, qui avaient blessé des gens, que j'en prenais conscience, et que j'étais désormais une adulte capable de faire mieux.

De quelle façon as-tu récolté ces anecdotes inédites?

Quand je rencontrais des artistes dans le cadre de mon travail, je terminais les entrevues en leur demandant s'ils avaient ce genre d'expérience. Et parfois, je partais à la pêche en épluchant les commentaires sur les pages Facebook de certains artistes. C'était un travail de Colombo.

Est-ce que c'était rafraichissant de faire des entrevues avec des artistes sans rien promouvoir et de parler à des gens du public?

Tout à fait! Ça allumait vraiment les artistes. Ce sont des choses qu'ils n'ont pas toujours eu le temps de verbaliser. Et j'adore interviewer les gens du public. Je trouvais ça tripant d'entendre leurs histoires.

Sentais-tu que les artistes avaient eux aussi douté de l'utilité de leur travail un jour?

C'est une question à laquelle ils pensent tous. Les gens peuvent être très durs envers le milieu artistique. Peut-être parce que certaines personnes envient les artistes de faire ce qu'ils veulent de leur vie. On les traite de «maudits artistes» et de «téteux de subventions», alors que des entreprises comme Bombardier sont largement subventionnées, sans que les gens réagissent autant. Peut-être que c'est plus confrontant de savoir qu'un musicien est payé à gratter sa guitare. Alors, les artistes ont une perception parfois négative de leur travail. Dans le livre, Jean-Michel Blais raconte qu'il a arrêté de jouer du piano pendant un an, en se disant que c'était une affaire de bourgeois, et il est parti à l'étranger pour travailler dans un orphelinat. Mais quand il a recommencé à jouer, un homme lui a dit «ça fait 14 mois que je ne vais pas bien et ce soir, durant ton spectacle, c'était la première fois que je pensais à autre chose qu'à ma maladie». Ça remet les choses en perspectives!

Quelle histoire t'a le plus touchée?

J'ai au moins huit réponses à ça! C'est sûr que l'histoire du père qui a oublié son enfant dans sa voiture et qui a été touché par le livre Naufrages de Biz m'a marquée. Je l'ai rencontré un 22 décembre. Le 25, j'étais chez mes beaux-parents et je devais absolument écrire son histoire. Il fallait qu'elle sorte de moi, sinon je n'aurais pas passé un beau temps des Fêtes. J'aime aussi celle de Denis Villeneuve et du policier qui regarde ses films pour décrocher, après ses journées de travail de merde dans un coin très dur en Saskatchewan. C'est un exemple moins spectaculaire, mais ça illustre vraiment bien l'idée de faire œuvre utile.

Laquelle génère le plus de commentaires des lecteurs jusqu'à présent?

Celle de la maman qui s'est reconnue dans un épisode de la télésérie Ruptures (NDR : celui où des parents d'un enfant souffrant d'un trouble du spectre de l'autisme sont en détresse). Elle s'est reconnue dans leur histoire. Elle a réalisé qu'elle s'oubliait, elle aussi. Plusieurs personnes qui sont elles-mêmes des parents m'en ont parlé. Peut-être parce que plus de lecteurs avaient vu l'émission. Je pense d'ailleurs que le livre donne envie à beaucoup de gens de découvrir les chansons, les livres, les pièces, les toiles ou les films des artistes dont il est question.

Die am weitesten verbreitete lautet: Die Partner testen unterbewusst, ob sie zueinander passen

Im Video oben erklären wir euch, wie das biologisch gesehen funktioniert

Beim Zungenkuss tauschen Menschen Speichel miteinander aus und noch dazu etwa 80 Millionen verschiedene Bakterien. Das klingt alles andere als appetitlich und schon gar nicht romantisch. Aber warum küssen sich Menschen dann eigentlich so gerne mit Zunge?

Forscher haben dafür verschiedene Erklärungen gefunden. Die am weitesten verbreitete lautet: Beim Küssen können wir einschätzen, ob die andere Person gesund und fruchtbar ist. Denn unbewusst nehmen wir die Hormone unseres Kusspartners wahr. Daraus leiten wir ab, ob der andere Mensch zu uns passt.

Vor allem Testosteron ist gut aus dem Speichel des Partners zu erkennen. Das geschieht über Nase und Mund. Die Anthropologin Helen Fisher vermutet, dass Männer beim Küssen ihr Testosteron an die Frau übertragen wollen, um deren Sexualtrieb zu erhöhen.

Möglicherweise ist es nur eine Angewohnheit

Biologisch notwendig ist der Zungenkuss jedoch nicht. Shelly Volsche, Professorin für kulturelle Anthropologie an der University of Las Vegas im US-Bundesstaat Nevada fand heraus, dass Menschen, die keine Zungenküsse kennen, stattdessen an ihren Gesichtern knabbern oder diese aneinander kuscheln.

Das Team um die Professorin stellte fest, dass es den Zungenkuss gerade einmal in 46 Prozent aller menschlichen Kulturen gibt - und nicht, wie die Forscher erwartet hatten, in 90 Prozent.

Möglicherweise küssen sich viele Menschen also nur mit Zunge, weil es eine kulturelle Angewohnheit geworden ist. Oder - und diese Erklärung ist ein bisschen schöner - einfach nur, um zu zeigen, wie sehr sie sich mögen.

Doch Noch-Finanzminister Wolfgang Schäuble grätscht dem Franzosen mit einem eigenen Plan dazwischen

Das Duell der führenden Euro-Nationen wird wohl Deutschland gewinnen - mit möglicherweise fatalen Konsequenzen

Emmanuel Macron hat es eilig.

Der mit 39 Jahren jüngste französische Staatspräsident aller Zeiten ist kaum fünf Monate im Amt und hat bereits einen ehrgeizigen Plan zur Reform der EU vorgelegt

► Er fordert unter anderem einen eigenen EU-Haushalt, ein Euro-Finanzminister und ein Parlament für die Eurozone.

Doch nun grätscht Noch-Finanzminister Wolfgang Schäuble dazwischen. In einem inoffiziellen Arbeitspapier mit dem Titel ""Wegbereitung einer Stabilitätsunion"" hat er nun seine Vorstellungen zusammengefasst - die Macrons Plänen diametral gegenüberstehen:

► Der CDU-Politiker schlägt einen Ausbau des bestehenden Rettungsfonds ESM (Europäischer Stabilitätsmechanismus) zu einem europäischen Währungsfonds mit weitreichenden Kompetenzen vor. Der ESM ist Teil des sogenannten Euro-Rettungsschirms.

Beide Vorschläge würden Welten voneinander entfernt liegen, kommentiert die ""Welt"" beide Positionen.

""Schäubles zentraler Ansatz setzt auf mehr Überwachung und Disziplinierung der nationalen Haushalte in der Europäischen Währungsunion"", erklärt der Volkswirt Sebastian Dullien der HuffPost.

Macrons Ansatz würde die Euro-Zone hingegen stärker in Richtung eines traditionellen Bundesstaates bewegen. Doch wie wird dieser finanzpolitische Konflikt ausgehen?

Bundesregierung kann Schäubles Vorstoß nicht ignorieren

Schäubles Vorhaben sei ein ""vergiftetes Abschiedsgeschenk für den Euro-Raum"", kommentiert IMK-Vizechef Andrew Watt das brisante Papier. Für die ""Welt"" stellt Schäubles Vorschlag ein ""Affront gegenüber der Kommission und ihrem Präsidenten Jean-Claude Juncker"" dar.

Denn Schäuble schlage ""Pflöcke ein"", die die künftige Bundesregierung nicht so einfach ignorieren könne.

In den kommenden Wochen wollen sich Vertreter Deutschlands und Frankreichs über einen Fahrplan für Reformen der Euro-Zone verständigen.

EU-Kommission soll entmachtet werden

Volkswirt Dullien, Professor an der Hochschule für Technik und Wirtschaft in Berlin, erklärt, dass für Schäuble der ESM künftig eine zentrale Rolle spielen soll. Unter anderem soll dieser bei finanziellen Schwierigkeiten eines Mitgliedstaates einen Schuldenschnitt einleiten können und zudem - als Teil der Bankenunion - Mittel für die Banken-Restrukturierung bereitstellen können.



Dullien betont: ""Dieser Ansatz läuft auf eine Entmachtung der EU-Kommission und einer Stärkung des ESM heraus.""



Auffällig ist aus Sicht Dulliens, ""dass es weltweit keinen Währungsraum gibt, der nach den Vorstellungen Schäubles funktioniert."" Er bezweifelt deshalb, dass die Vorschläge ""zu einem sinnvollen Funktionieren der Euro-Zone führen"" werden.

Macron wird das Duell verlieren

Das Ziel von Frankreichs Staatschef dagegen: Mit einem eigenen Budget für den Euroraum will er öffentliche Investitionen zu tätigen. Und so verhindern, dass Drittstaaten - wie in der Griechenland-Krise - massiv die Investitionen der betroffenen Länder beschneiden und damit die Krise weiter verstärken.



Macron werde sich mit seinen Vorschlägen aber nicht durchsetzen, glaubt Dullien:

► Einerseits habe Deutschland faktisch ein Veto-Recht bei Reformen der Euro-Zone.

► Andererseits habe Berlin aufgrund der besseren wirtschaftlichen Lage und guter Staatsfinanzen eine stärkere Verhandlungsposition.

Der Volkswirt hält es aber für unwahrscheinlich, dass Frankreich einem Mechanismus der Schuldenrestrukturierung zustimmen wird.



Kommt es in Deutschland tatsächlich zu einer Jamaika-Koalition mit einem FDP- oder einem CDU-Finanzminister - wonach es derzeit aussieht - ""würde es in den kommenden Jahren keinen Fortschritt bei der Reform der Euro-Zone geben"", kritisiert Dullien.

Sollte die Euro-Krise wieder aufflammen, sind möglicherweise keine ausreichenden Vorkehrungen getroffen, um diese sinnvoll abzufedern. Im Extremfall könnte die Euro-Zone sogar auseinanderbrechen, warnt Dullien - mit verheerenden Folgen für die Export-Nation Deutschland.

Au lendemain de sa déclaration d'indépendance avortée -car immédiatement suspendue-, le président de la Généralité de Catalogne va devoir s'expliquer auprès du Premier ministre espagnol. Mariano Rajoy a pris la parole ce mercredi 11 octobre pour lui demander de clarifier sa position.

Le Premier ministre espagnol entend mettre fin à la confusion autour du statut de la région autonome, dont les membres du gouvernement ont signé hier une déclaration d'indépendance, aussitôt qualifiée de ""symbolique"" par le porte-parole du gouvernement catalan lui-même. Pour Mariano Rajoy, il s'agit surtout d'un préalable à l'application de l'article 155 de la Constitution, la procédure qui permet de suspendre l'autonomie d'une région.

Vers une réforme de la Constitution?

Dans un effort pour apaiser les esprits, le chef de Parti Socialiste espagnol (PSOE), principale force d'opposition, a annoncé ce mercredi un accord avec le chef du gouvernement conservateur Mariano Rajoy pour étudier une réforme de la Constitution et tenter de résoudre la crise catalane.

""Nous sommes convenus que l'heure est venue d'aborder la réforme constitutionnelle"", a déclaré Pedro Sanchez, précisant que le débat à la chambre des députés permettrait de discuter de comment ""la Catalogne reste en Espagne, pas de comment elle s'en va"".

""L'accord que j'ai avec le président du gouvernement est d'ouvrir la voie de la réforme constitutionnelle"", a expliqué le chef de PSOE. Il prévoit d'abord la formation au plus tôt de la commission de réforme territoriale pour étudier pendant six mois l'actuelle répartition des compétences entre les régions et le gouvernement central, avant d'entamer la procédure de révision de la Constitution.

Pedro Sanchez a exprimé l'espoir de trouver, lors du débat, un nouveau modèle des relations en pleine crise entre la Catalogne et le reste de l'Espagne. Il a cependant fermement condamné les efforts des dirigeants séparatistes catalans pour faire sécession et soutenu l'ultimatum de Mariano Rajoy leur demandant de clarifier si oui ou non ils avaient déclaré l'indépendance.

""Le bloc souverainiste cherche à gagner un peu de temps pour continuer à imposer son programme politique à l'ensemble de la société catalane et l'ensemble de la société espagnole"", a estimé le chef du PSOE, en condamnant la ""cérémonie de l'absurde qui s'est déroulée au Parlement de Catalogne"".

How Long Until The Next General Election? It Could Be Longer Than You Think The FTPA (as anyone who has got this far probably knows) means Parliament will sit for a fixed 5-year term rather than the Prime Minister of the day calling a General Election when it suits them (yes, yes, I know).

We Must All Echo Theresa May's Sense Of Duty And Public Service To Get Brexit Right I'm glad the Prime Minister decided to tackle what's been going on behind her back. Not for her sake, but for everyone else's.

Why Can't May Cosy Up To Trump Like Macron Did? What I find fascinating is the difference in tone many of these publications took when covering Theresa May's visit to Washington in January.

Government Needs To Listen To Business On Brexit As Downing Street discovered the hard way, a shielded and closed door approach will not work on an issue that affects so many in many different ways.

Junto a ella, más de una veintena de madres y padres víctimas de la violencia narran, con voz encendida por la furia o apagada de pronto por el nudo en la garganta que provoca la ausencia de uno de los suyos, la manera en que sus hijos fueron desapareciendo.

Lo hacen ante las organizaciones Brigadas Internacionales de Paz (PBI), Amnistía Internacional, Serapaz México y la Red Nacional de Organismos Civiles de Derechos Humanos (Red TDT), como parte de una Misión Civil de Observación realizada en Chilapa de Álvarez el pasado 19 de septiembre, a fin de visibilizar la escalada de violencia en la región.

Chilapa está entre los 50 municipios más violentos de México.

En Chilapa existe una macro criminalidad que deja al descubierto la complicidad del Estado y sus instituciones con los diferentes grupos o cárteles de la delincuencia organizada, garantizándoles una total impunidad para actuar"". Reporte del Centro Regional de Defensa de Derechos Humanos José Ma. Morelos y Pavón.

Todas las historias tienen en común que las víctimas son hombres, en edad productiva, y que, en la mayoría de los casos, son indígenas y de escasos recursos económicos.

Todos, además, no han sido investigados adecuadamente por las autoridades competentes y han sido las propias familias quienes han jalado los hilos de las averiguaciones de los hechos que ""uno nunca cree que le van a pasar a uno"".

Vista de la avenida principal de Chilapa.

UNO BUSCA CON 'LA MAÑA'

Jesús Pineda Mejía, de profesión optometrista, desapareció el 19 de julio de 2016. Salió de su casa para irse a trabajar en una de las campañas de visión que realizaba por distintos sitios del estado. Ese día acudiría a Chilpancingo, pero a las 9:42 de aquel día le envió a su novia Annie un inusual mensaje de whatsapp en el que le escribía que lo habían secuestrado y que lo buscara rumbo a Chichihualco, una población de Guerrero.

""Yo lo vi bañado, cambiado y todo, lo vi listo para irse a trabajar. Yo regreso como a las 10 am y mi trabajador me dice 'doña Rosa, están avisando que a Jesús su hijo lo levantaron' -- cuenta su madre Rosario Mejía y en un punto en que se le quiebra la voz--, le digo eso no es cierto, y seguí haciendo mis cosas, es algo que da miedo, nervios y son las cosas que uno no cree que le van a pasar a uno.

""Es una sensación de impotencia, qué hago, qué hago, dónde lo busco.""

Tras sobrepasar la incredulidad, Rosario empezó su indagatoria con personas que los mismos pobladores saben que tienen vínculos con ""la maña"", como se refieren al crimen organizado, ""porque sabemos que nos puede conectar y son a los primeros que recurrimos, por qué no sabemos con quién buscar"".

Fue hasta el tercer día que Rosario acudió a denunciar a la Fiscalía Especializada en Materia de Desaparición Forzada y Búsqueda de Personas Desaparecidas y lo que obtuvo por respuesta fue lo que casi todos los familiares de desaparecidos escuchan: que su hijo ""seguro andaba de borracho con sus amigos"".

LA DESAPARICIÓN FORZADA SE HACE EVIDENTE

El Centro Regional de Defensa de Derechos Humanos José Ma. Morelos y Pavón AC, el cual se ha dedicado a documentar el contexto violento de Chilapa y Zitlala Guerrero, señala que la desaparición forzada se hizo evidente tras la incursión de presuntos policías comunitarios que entre el 9 y 14 de mayo de 2015 detuvieron, y desaparecieron, a al menos 16 hombres pese a la presencia de la Gendarmería, el Ejército, la Policía Federal y municipal.

Fue tras estos hechos que las familias se unieron para comenzar la búsqueda de sus desaparecidos y se incentivó la visibilización y denuncia de otros casos ocurridos desde 2007.

Por su parte, la Comisión Ejecutiva de Atención a Víctimas (CEAV) ha dificultado la atención a las víctimas. En Chilapa, por ejemplo, desde principios de enero comenzaron a conformar un padrón de víctimas y, hasta ahora, los familiares de desaparecidos siguen sin recibir apoyo económico, denuncia el Centro Morelos.

NO SABEMOS NADA DE NINGUNO DE LOS DOS

Esmeralda Huaxtitlán Sixtos estudiaba la carrera de enfermería en el Conalep y tenía 35 años cuando desapareció al ir a buscar a su hijo Erick, del que tampoco se sabía su paradero. Erick Geovanni García Huaxtitlán tenía 18 años aquel 20 de octubre de un año atrás cuando ya no se supo más de ninguno de ellos.

""Él (Erick) iba a dejar normalmente a su mamá en la moto, pero de él ya no supimos en toda la tarde. Mi hermana regresa entre las 8 o 9 de la noche y pregunta a su otro hijo por su hermano, éste le dice que no lo había visto en todo el día. Le empezó a marcar a su teléfono y ya no le contestaba. Cerca de las 11 de la noche, salió a buscar a su hijo mayor, a esas horas ella salió y ya no regresó. Y hasta ahora, no sabemos nada de ninguno de los dos"", cuenta sin evitar el llanto la hermana de Esmeralda.

Fue hasta un mes después de la desaparición que la familia acudió a denunciar.

Andábamos dedicados a investigar con vecinos y familiares y no tuvimos respuesta y pues entre miedo y preocupación se nos pasaron los días; cuando denunciamos, nos daban largas y siguió transcurriendo el tiempo, hicimos la denuncia pero hasta después de un mes, por miedo, coraje, y la inseguridad, porque estando en una situación así, a veces la misma familia te dice que es tu problema y te las arregles como puedas.""

MÁS SEGURIDAD, MÁS VÍCTIMAS

El 27 de enero de 2016 en la región se implementó un megaoperativo con más de 3 mil elementos del Ejército, la Marina, la Policía Federal y la estatal, a fin de disminuir la cifra de secuestros y homicidios.

Si embargo, ese mismo año se contabilizaron sólo en Chilapa y Zitlala 205 asesinatos, 41 desaparecidos, 26 heridos en hechos violentos, ocho secuestros y se hallaron 56 cuerpos en fosas clandestinas.

De la cifra de muertos destaca que 23 fueron decapitados, 68 asesinados con arma de fuego, seis calcinados, 16 desmembrados y 33 perdieron la vida durante enfrentamientos.

TENÍA UNA SEMANA EN EL NUEVO TRABAJO Y LO MATARON CON OCHO TIROS

Kevin Castro Domínguez acabada de cumplir 18 años, era estudiante del Colegio de Bachilleres, hacía danza folclórica y recién había integrado un grupo de apoyo a personas con adicciones.

Tras dejar un empleo en una tienda Oxxo, entró a trabajar a un centro botanero. Llevaba tres días atendiendo el lugar cuando, por la noche, llegó una camioneta con hombres armados, se estacionó delante del negocio y dos hombres balearon el lugar.

""A dos clientes les dieron un balazo a cada uno, tomaron a mi hijo, lo agarraron de los cabellos –se deduce por la forma en que quedó el cuerpo— le dieron ocho balazos y no se moría, se murió en el hospital, yo creo esperaba a que yo llegara"", cuenta su padre Lamberto Castro.

INVESTIGACIÓN DE PROPIA MANO

La desaparición de su hijo Josúe Molina Rodríguez, de 30 años, llevó a María Guadalupe Rodríguez Narciso a convertirse en una obsesiva investigadora del caso de su hijo ante la omisión de las autoridades y en la aguerrida cabeza de una organización dedicada a la búsqueda de personas.

Hay una complicidad inmensa, grande, desde las altas autoridades hasta el último policía y la verdad sí estamos en una situación crítica y delicadísima."" María Guadalupe Rodríguez Narciso.

El colectivo que también comanda está investigando los casos de la gente viva, ""porque aquí todo mundo busca muertos, busca tumbas, pero de los vivos no nos preocupamos, cuando hay gente viva secuestrada, gente que está al servicio de la delincuencia.""

María cuenta que un joven que buscaba a su hermano en la sierra, encontró en una barranca de Chichihualco, muchos cadáveres, pero también gente viva en varios puntos de la sierra que presumiblemente es obligada a trabajar para grupos de la delincuencia organizada procesando la droga.

""Empiezo a rastrear esa información y la llevo a la PGR para investigar a esa gente, para bajar a esa gente viva, porque ahí podría estar mi hijo, los hijos de los compañeros. Me cerraron las puertas, recurro a mi Ministerio Público de PGR, para que también protegieran al muchacho, pero incluso ya nos estaban criminalizando diciendo que pertenecíamos al grupo de Los Rojos para que no nos hicieran caso.

""Él contó lo que sabía, habló sobre un autobús que no aparecía donde supuestamente irían los estudiantes normalistas de Ayotzinapa y que bajó de la sierra; por eso turnaron el caso a la Fiscalía de los 43, le tomaron su declaración, su denuncia, sin darle medidas de seguridad. La Fiscalía de los 43 declinó la competencia a SEIDO y ésta la regresó a la delegación PGR de Chilpancingo, donde están coludidos"", narra la activista.

El joven, que había declarado en mayo de este año, desapareció en julio. No se sabe nada de él.

De ahí lo que pasó es que el testigo desapareció, y estaba muy dispuesto a entrar a la sierra, a ir de guía y a señalar los puntos donde tenían a la gente."" María Guadalupe Rodríguez Narciso.

Así, continúan las narraciones de los familiares de los desaparecidos de Chilapa, con leves variantes y con el común denominador de investigaciones mal llevadas y la colusión de las autoridades. Y tras ellos, el sismo del 19 de septiembre de 2017 y, con él, otra vez el silencio sobre estas víctimas.","Chilapa, el municipio secuestrado: “Aquí todo mundo busca muertos, no gente viva”",http://www.huffingtonpost.com.mx/2017/10/11/chilapa-el-municipio-secuestrado-aqui-todo-mundo-busca-muertos-no-gente-viva_a_23239334/

Even as thousands of Rohingya Muslims are fleeing Myanmar to escape violence and persecution at the hands of the country's military and police, the chief of India's premier body on social sciences believes they should not be tolerated in India.

The Hindu today reported on the remarks made by Braj Bihari Kumar, who heads the Indian Council of Social Science Research (ICSSR), at a seminar recently organized by the Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR).

Speaking at the public event, Kumar said, ""This nation should not tolerate them as part of India.""

""This nation should not tolerate them as part of India.""

Earlier this year, Kumar succeeded prominent academic S.K. Thorat as the head of the ICSSR, an autonomous body established by the Indian government in 1969 to promote social studies research.

Kumar, 76, served has the editor of two journals, Dialogue and Chintan Srijan, published by Astha Bharati, a non-profit organisation dedicated to promoting ""India's unity and integrity.""

The online news outlet, Scroll, has previously reported on the opinions that Kumar has professed over the course of years, including, ""There is none in India, who has suffered more due to intolerance than Narendra Modi.""

Kumar's remarks come at a time when the Modi government is making a legal case to deport Rohingya Muslim refugees from India, branding them as national security threat. The central government's position has been condemned by human rights activists and lawyers who argue that even those who are not citizens are guaranteed protection under the Indian Constitution when they are on Indian soil.

""There is none in India, who has suffered more due to intolerance than Narendra Modi.""

Speaking at the ICHR event, Kumar said, ""We should like to know about the Rohingyas also. What is their record? In 1943, when war was going on between the British and the Japanese, the British government of Burma supplied arms and ammunitions to the Rohingyas to fight against the Japanese, and the Rohingyas turned the gun towards the Buddhists,"" he said.

""How can Burmese forget such enemies? They are not fools like Indians. The Burmese remember their enemies,"""" Kumar continued. ""My point is that we can't placate illegal migrants. We should not do it. This nation should not tolerate them as a part of India.""

The Hindu further reported that Kumar had also claimed that Rajput king Prithviraj Chauhan beat Ghori 17 times but did not kill him. The newspaper pointed out that history tells us there were only two battles.

At 90, Nayantara Sahgal stands tall among writers in India for her courage of conviction and belief in the secular spirit of the nation enshrined by the leaders who brought it into being. Both of these qualities are abundantly evident in her new novella, When the Moon Shines By Day, published recently by Speaking Tiger (Hardcover, ₹399), which reads like a chilling commentary on our time.

Although only 167 pages long, the story is packed with ideas, most of which Sahgal highlighted two years ago when she returned the Sahitya Akademi award in the wake of the murder of rationalist MM Kalburgi. Setting an example with her symbolic gesture, she opened the floodgates of dissent among intellectuals across the country, writing in a range of languages, who joined her in returning their awards to protest against vicious attacks on India's age-old tradition of debate, discussion and dissent.

The silencing of anti-establishment voices, brutally brought home by the recent murder of journalist Gauri Lankesh for instance, is captured with a lacerating irony by the title itself. Deceptively poetic, the phrase is evoked by the protagonist, Rehana, to explain to her friends her reason to continue working with Asians Against Torture, a human-rights organisation: ""Because people are tortured for refusing to agree the moon shines by day and the sun by night..."" The barbaric premonitions this admission opens up are borne out by the plot, which, in spite of its episodic fragments, conjures up a vision of pure hell.

The India that Sahgal sets her story in reminds us, with alarming familiarity, of the one we live in the here and now — except it's descended into a worse dystopia. The trappings of anarchy are cemented ever more firmly: books are banned, paintings destroyed and people get killed on the suspicion of carrying a suitcase made of cowhide, presided over by the all-pervasive eye of the Director of Cultural Transformation.

The latter's views on the vandalism of history are unambiguous. ""We cannot forget the pain of invasions,"" he informs a gallery owner on hearing a complaint of rampant hooliganism at a show, ""the Turks, Mongols, Mughals, foreigners who interrupted our Hindu history."" Wiping out ""that painful memory and returning our nation by all possible means to its racial and religious purity"" is, in his book, a matter of ""plain justice"".

If such passages strike as too unadorned, they also ring uncomfortably true, hitting home the heady reality of conflicts and confusions contemporary India is immersed in. Much like Sahgal, earlier this year, Prayaag Akbar brought alive the crises of being alive in this moment with a terrifying clarity in his novel, Leila. In a keenly-imagined dystopia, towards which present-day India seems to be inexorably hurtling, Akbar framed a story of an outcaste searching for her daughter and husband for nearly two decades, who were wrenched from her by the might of a police state, bent on preserving religious purity by condemning intermarriage.

In Sahgal's story, terror percolates into the genteel drawing-room conversations of Rehana and her friends, who gather for a book club, holding on to the vestiges of art and literature at a time neither can provide much consolation. Characters like Kamlesh, a bureaucrat with an interest in Mughal history, especially in the alleged depravities of Shah Jahan, including his incestuous relationship with his daughter, or Franz Rohner, a German historian of the Third Reich, act as foils to their title-tattle. The aroma of pekoe orange blossom tea at the ladies' book club gets fouled by the stink of violence, repeated sagas of bloodlust and massacre.

Exposed to the horrors of a dictatorial regime through her work with victims of torture, Rehana is the fiery conscience that shines through the darkness in which the novel is plunged. Even as she witnesses her lover Zamir's turbulent predicament for his religion and 'subversive' writing, the disappearance of her father's books on medieval history from public holdings, and the bottomless cruelty of everyday life, she manages to retain a humane curiosity about the world around her.

Rehana's friendship with Rohner is Sahgal's point of entry into larger historical questions about the fate of totalitarian regimes, comparing these with the ones in Europe of the 1930s and 40s. Such parallels may appear a bit stretched and Sahgal's detour into the past somewhat didactic, but the timing of the novel ameliorates such aesthetic grudges. In spite of the rough edges and choppy jump-cuts, Sahgal's wit and humanity glitters occasionally, especially in Rohner's bawdy wisecracks.

""Are they not the man who mounts his woman with no please-may-I, gallops to glory, rolls of his mount and snores himself to sleep?"" he says, memorably, on being asked his opinion about revolutions, saving a punch for the end. ""And the woman? Ah, the woman! She lies awake plotting how to kill him.""

You've probably heard of mindfulness. These days, it's everywhere, like many ideas and practices drawn from Buddhist texts that have become part of mainstream Western culture.

But a review published recently in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science shows the hype is ahead of the evidence. Some reviews of studies on mindfulness suggest it may help with psychological problems such as anxiety, depression, and stress. But it's not clear what type of mindfulness or meditation we need and for what specific problem.

The study, involving a large group of researchers, clinicians and meditators, found a clear-cut definition of mindfulness doesn't exist. This has potentially serious implications. If vastly different treatments and practices are considered the same, then research evidence for one may be wrongly taken as support for another.

At the same time, if we move the goalposts too far or in the wrong direction, we might lose the potential benefits of mindfulness altogether.

So, what is mindfulness?

Mindfulness receives a bewildering assortment of definitions. Psychologists measure the concept in differing combinations of acceptance, attentiveness, awareness, body focus, curiosity, nonjudgmental attitude, focus on the present, and others.

It's equally ill-defined as a set of practices. A brief exercise in self-reflection prompted by a smart-phone app on your daily commute may be considered the same as a months-long meditation retreat. Mindfulness can both refer to what Buddhist monks do and what your yoga instructor does for five minutes at the start and end of a class.

To be clear, mindfulness and meditation are not the same thing. There are types of meditation that are mindful, but not all mindfulness involves meditation and not all meditation is mindfulness-based.

Mindfulness mainly refers to the idea of focusing on the present moment, but it's not quite that simple. It also refers to several forms of meditation practices that aim to develop skills of awareness of the world around you and of your behavioral patterns and habits. In truth, many disagree about its actual purpose and what is and isn't mindfulness.

Researchers studying the efficacy of mindfulness treatments should compare them to credible alternative treatments, whenever possible.

What's it for?

Mindfulness has been applied to just about any problem you can think up -- from relationship issues, problems with alcohol or drugs, to enhancing leadership skills. It's being used by sportsmen to find 'clarity' on and off the field and mindfulness programs are being offered at school. You can find it in workplaces, medical clinics, and old age homes.

More than a few popular books have been written touting the benefits of mindfulness and meditation. For example, in a supposedly critical review Altered Traits: Science Reveals How Meditation Changes your Mind, Brain and Body, Daniel Goleman argues one of the four benefits of mindfulness is improved working memory. Yet, a recent review of about 18 studies exploring the effect of mindfulness-based therapies on attention and memory calls into question these ideas.

Another common claim is that mindfulness reduces stress, for which there is limited evidence. Other promises, such as improved mood and attention, better eating habits, improved sleep, and better weight control are not fully supported by the science either.

And while benefits have limited evidence, mindfulness and meditation can sometimes be harmful and can lead to psychosis, mania, loss of personal identity, anxiety, panic, and re-experiencing traumatic memories. Experts have suggested mindfulness is not for everyone, especially those suffering from several serious mental health problems such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.

Research on mindfulness:

Another problem with mindfulness literature is that it often suffers from poor research methodology. Ways of measuring mindfulness are highly variable, assessing quite different phenomena while using the same label. This lack of equivalence among measures and individuals makes it challenging to generalise from one study to another.

Mindfulness researchers rely too much on questionnaires, which require people to introspect and report on mental states that may be slippery and fleeting. These reports are notoriously vulnerable to biases. For example, people who aspire to mindfulness may report being mindful because they see it as desirable, not because they have actually achieved it.

Only a tiny minority of attempts to examine whether these treatments work compare them against another treatment that is known to work -- which is the primary means by which clinical science can show added value of new treatments. And a minority of these studies are conducted in regular clinical practices rather than in specialist research contexts.

A recent review of studies, commissioned by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, found many studies were too poorly conducted to include in the review and that mindfulness treatments were moderately effective, at best, for anxiety, depression, and pain. There was no evidence of efficacy for attention problems, positive mood, substance abuse, eating habits, sleep or weight control.

What should be done?

Mindfulness is definitely a useful concept and a promising set of practices. It may help prevent psychological problems and could be useful as an addition to existing treatments. It may also be helpful for general mental functioning and well-being. But the promise will not be realised if problems are not addressed.

The mindfulness community must agree to key features that are essential to mindfulness and researchers should be clear how their measures and practices include these. Media reports should be equally specific about what states of mind and practices mindfulness includes, rather than using it as a broad term.

Mindfulness might be assessed, not through self-reporting, but in part using more objective neurobiological and behavioural measures, such as breath counting. This is where random tones could be used to 'ask' participants if they are focused on the breath (press left button) or if their mind had wandered (press right button).

Researchers studying the efficacy of mindfulness treatments should compare them to credible alternative treatments, whenever possible. Development of new mindfulness approaches should be avoided until we know more about the ones we already have. Scientists and clinicians should use rigorous randomised control trials and work with researchers from outside the mindfulness tradition.

And lastly, mindfulness researchers and practitioners should acknowledge the reality of occasional negative effects. Just as medications must declare potential side effects, so should mindfulness treatments. Researchers should systematically assess potential side effects when studying mindfulness treatments. Practitioners should be alert to them and not recommend mindfulness treatments as a first approach if safer ones with stronger evidence of efficacy are available.

Southwest has even managed to tame the chaos of its unique no-advance-assignment boarding process: You get your boarding group and number when you check in, which you can do online starting 24 hours before departure; at the airport, you line up according to number, and get on the plane with a minimum of pushing and shoving.

At least for now, Alaska Airlines' Mileage Plan seems more generous than the big-line programs that are moving toward dollar-based earnings and rewards. You still get one mile for every mile flown, and the award chart mileage requirements are less than the effective requirements on the giant airlines. Alaska still has useful partnerships with Air France/KLM, American, British Airways, Delta, Korean, Qantas, and a few others. We don't know how long Alaska will retain its current system, but it's a winner as long as today's rules remain. If you accumulate miles or points through a credit card that allows transfers, such as American Express, the award chart for Air Canada's Aeroplan is more generous than current big lines' plans. But you get only partial mileage credit when you fly on Air Canada's lowest fares. Related: 6 Ways to Get the Best Coach Seat Every Time (Photo: Alaska Airlines)

Yes, JetBlue beats it by the measurements, but Virgin America keeps earning great survey ratings for its flashy decor, well-trained flight attendants, top inflight technology, and general flair. Obviously, lots of travelers like what it has to offer. You might like it, too. The ""Branson cool factor"" also applies to Virgin Atlantic and Virgin Australia. (Photo: Virgin America)

The nod for best ultra-low-fare carrier for coach-class service goes to Allegiant, not because of its base product—which is down there with Spirit in terms of sheer torture—but because it alone brings the only low-fare mainline service to dozens of communities where travelers would otherwise have to rely on regional flights to nearby hubs, with the usual hassle, wasted time, and high fares of hub connections. Allegiant's ""nowhere to somewhere"" business model gives travelers to/from communities as small as Hagerstown, Missoula, Owensboro, Provo, South Bend, and Stockton access to nonstop flights to 16 of the country's primary leisure travel destinations, including Honolulu, Las Vegas, Myrtle Beach, Orlando, and Phoenix. If you live in or near a big city, you'd never even think about Allegiant. But it's a no-brainer if you live in the sticks.

Southwest is the only airline to offer useful senior fares for travelers 65 or over. Senior fares aren't as low as Southwest's initial lowest ""Wanna Get Away"" fares for travelers of any age, but when those lowest-fare buckets sell out or when they're no longer available less than a week in advance, Southwest's unrestricted senior fares are usually a lot less than any remaining any-age fares.

JetBlue, which starts out with a 1- to 3-inch advantage for regular coach, retains a similar advantage for its extra-legroom cabin. And the price, capped at $90 for a transcontinental flight, is likely to be lower than the variable prices other airlines charge. This is a big advantage JetBlue has over Virgin America, the one airline that surveys usually place in the same class as JetBlue. On Virgin America, the extra-legroom seats, limited to bulkhead and exit rows, cost more than three times the regular-coach fare: more than $900 on a transcon, for example, compared with a base coach fare of $300. Yes, you get extras along with the legroom, but that huge fare premium is a deal breaker for someone who just wants enough space to use an e-reader or tablet comfortably.

Japan Airlines' new-design Sky Wider economy seats provide the roomiest international economy class you can currently find. Contrary to what most other airlines are doing, JAL is sticking with eight-across seats in its 787s and nine-across in its 777s. That's one fewer seat in each row than the current standard among most other lines, and the remaining seats are almost two inches wider than competitors' seats. The new cabins also offer an industry-leading 34-inch pitch, compared with the 30- to 32-inch pitch you find on most other intercontinental airlines. The onboard catering generally earns high marks, as well; economy travelers enjoy individual 10-inch screens, and the new 777s and 787s provide satellite-based Wi-Fi.

Norwegian flies 787s from a handful of U.S. cities to Scandinavia and from Los Angeles or New York to London/Gatwick. It recently started flying from Baltimore, Boston, and New York to Guadeloupe and Martinique. Fares are usually—although not always—lower than on the giant airlines, and its 787 product is on par with what the big competitors offer.

The giant airlines will charge you around $1,200 for a nonstop summer round-trip flight between New York and Paris in a cattle-car economy cabin. But two people paying $1,495 each can move up to an angle-flat business-class seat, with business-class cabin service, on La Compagnie, the niche French airline offering low-cost business-class service from Newark to London/Luton and Paris/DeGaulle. La Compagnie's current fare is almost $1,000 less than the premium economy fares on Open Skies or Air France. The price gap between regular economy and La Compagnie isn't always this small. But whenever it is, you sure feel better when you arrive in London or Paris after an overnight in business class than in economy. It's worth considering.

This version of events emerged as forensic pathologist Dr Akmal Khan, the state's second witness, testified in the murder trial of Jason Rohde.

He has pleaded not guilty to murder and defeating/obstructing the ends of justice by ""staging"" a suicide and providing police with false information.

READ: The Rohde Trial So Far: Colleague Who Tried To Revive Susan Testifies, Mistress Could Be Called Next

Khan has dealt with close to 100 suicide by hanging cases.

He visited the scene on July 24 2016 and wrote an incident scene report.

He recommended police investigate a possible homicide after noting ""odd"" blood stains in the room, scratches on her face and blunt force trauma injuries, which suggested a physical altercation.

Gruesome pictures

A photo of the hotel room showed it in a messy state. A piece of purple luggage lay open on the floor, the bed was unmade and there were red blotches in different areas.

""Usually, if you have blunt force trauma in the form of a fist or punch, then sometimes you would get an abrasion from a ring on the finger,"" he explained.

He thought of battered woman syndrome, where beatings were continuous and over prolonged periods, after seeing the injuries of different ages.

The stains indicated that her body may have been moved.

Khan wrote another report when he conducted a post-mortem exam two days later.

Gruesome pictures of Susan's body were projected on the wall.

Rohde, sitting in a seat opposite the dock, turned sideways and seemed uncomfortable.

Khan detailed the various haemorrhages and injuries on Susan's neck and concluded: ""It is a staging of a hanging.""

Judge Gayaat Salie-Hlophe asked what he meant by staged.

Manual strangulation

In reply, he said this was putting a ligature on afterward and pressing into the skin to make it look like a hanging.

""Because you don't how it is supposed to look, you get it wrong.""

He explained that friction abrasions were usually seen with an electric cord used for hanging.

The ligature mark Susan had on her neck, which did not slope upward to the point of suspension as with hanging cases, seemed to have been applied after death.

In most hangings, one would also expect a mark much higher up.

Khan conducted a bloodless neck dissection to check the marks in detail and confirm whether they were caused before or after death.

He found many haemorrhages were unrelated to the ligature. The left horn of the thyroid cartilage had been fractured.

This indicated ""a hand being applied to the neck with a squeezing type of action"", consistent with manual strangulation.

Khan found it was possible to open the locked bathroom door from the outside.

He felt it prudent to have the bathroom hooks tested to see if they could hold Susan's 52kg weight.

He said the pooling of blood in the body, which started around 30 minutes post-mortem, indicated she was lying on her back and not hanging when she died.

He estimated the time of death to be 5.40am on July 24 2016.

Nous venons de pays en guerre, ou au contraire de pays en ""paix"", où la plupart des événements douloureux nous parviennent par le biais des nouvelles et de la presse. Il y a des situations qui peuvent nous paraître lointaines jusqu'à ce qu'elles nous touchent nous aussi, en plein spectacle ou à la terrasse d'un café. Il y a des réalités que nous comprenons lorsqu'elles viennent nous toucher directement, simplement parce qu'à ce moment précis, nous entrons en contact avec la vie. On pense toujours que cela n'arrive qu'aux autres, jusqu'au moment où nos vies sont bouleversées à jamais.

La paralysie cède la place au fatalisme, au ""tout est fichu"", à ""ça ne changera rien"", alors on baisse les bras.

La vie d'aujourd'hui nous dit qu'il est très facile de fixer l'attention sur ce qui nous divise, sur ce qui nous sépare. On voudrait nous faire croire que nous enfermer est la meilleure manière de nous protéger du mal. Et pourtant, remontons un instant sur ce qui s'est produit avec la Résistance pendant la seconde guerre mondiale. Un rassemblement inouï face à l'adversaire, une fraternité qui a pris le visage d'hommes et de femmes allant au devant des difficultés et des peines d'autres hommes et d'autres femmes. Rien ne justifie d'abandonner son prochain, rien ne justifie le sang d'un frère.

Notre réponse à ce monde en guerre a un nom: elle s'appelle fraternité. Parce que nous ne voulons pas vaincre la haine par davantage de haine, la violence par davantage de violence, la terreur par davantage de terreur. Notre réponse, c'est l'entraide et le respect, quoi de plus naturel au fond?

Empêcher la destruction de richesse et favoriser la création d'emplois : les principaux arguments d'Emmanuel Macron et ceux du président du Medef se confondent désormais.","POLITIQUE - Les députés ont adopté ce jeudi en commission la mesure la plus controversée du projet de budget 2018, la transformation de l'impôt de solidarité sur la fortune en impôt sur le seul patrimoine immobilier. Le Macronisme n'a pourtant pas toujours été clair sur la question.

En novembre 2014, Pierre Gattaz profitait d'une conférence à Bercy pour lancer un énième appel à supprimer l'impôt de solidarité sur la fortune, le fameux ISF. Une demande du président du Medef qualifiée alors de ""provocation"" par Emmanuel Macron.

Le ministre de l'Économie de François Hollande répétait dans les médias que le patron des patrons français outrepassait son rôle en ""proposant toutes les semaines une nouvelle idée, aussi polémique soit-elle"". Une condamnation sur la forme mais aussi sur le fond, Emmanuel Macron assimilant cette exigence du Medef à une ""lubie"". Autrement dit, selon les définitions de l'Académie Française, du Larousse et du Robert, Pierre Gattaz exprimait une idée déraisonnable, une pensée absurde, un caprice extravagant.

Toutefois Le Figaro doutait à l'époque de la sincérité du ministre: ""On aurait tort de croire que le président du Medef et le ministre de l'Économie s'opposent sur l'ISF. Tous deux pensent que cet impôt, qui remonte aux années Mitterrand, est dépassé. Mais l'hôte de Bercy ne peut pas le dire quand le patron des patrons le dit un peu trop""? écrivait alors le quotidien. La suite de l'histoire donnera raison à cette analyse.

Et la ""provocation"" devint la solution

Emmanuel Macron attendra avril 2016 avant d'amorcer officiellement un premier virage en suggérant de privilégier ""le risque face à la rente"" en matière de fiscalité. Et d'annoncer après son départ de Bercy, en septembre 2016, qu'il souhaitait ""réformer"" l'ISF.

Le candidat d'En Marche! à la présidentielle précise, début février 2017, son projet de transformation de l'ISF en ""impôt sur la rente immobilière"". Des intentions proches de celles de Pierre Gattaz, chantre depuis des années d'une"" réforme"" de cet impôt, également favorable à ""taxer la rente"".

Empêcher la destruction de richesse et favoriser la création d'emplois : les principaux arguments d'Emmanuel Macron et ceux du président du Medef se confondent désormais. La vieille ""lubie"" s'est recyclée en habits neufs quand les ministres issus du parti présidentiel LREM, Benjamin Griveaux et Christophe Castaner, défendent aujourd'hui la refonte de l'ISF en donnant l'impression réciter les fiches de Pierre Gattaz, tant les similitudes sont nombreuses, comme le montre notre montage vidéo.

He’s now confirmed this to be the case, and it sounds like his “loner” character’s arrival in ‘Neighbours’ is to coincide with the beginning of a “dark” era for the usually cheerful soap.

Channel 5’s Commissioning Editor Greg Barnett commented: “With his good looks and Corrie years under his belt, Ryan is the perfect handsome devil. His arrival in Erinsborough marks the start of darker times for a particular Ramsay St favourite.

“Prepare to be gripped.”

Ryan added: “I was on holiday with my daughter when I got a phone call from my agent asking if I’d like to play this part…I spoke to the producer and found out more – it was very different from anything I’d played before – it was quite a deep, dark story, that really interested me.

“It’s a new challenge and I can’t wait to start filming.”

Ryan is best known for his portrayal of Jason Grimshaw in ‘Corrie’, a role he played for 16 years until making the decision to bow out last year.

Since leaving the ITV soap, he’s made an appearance on the reality show ‘Celebrity Island With Bear Grylls’, where he met his now-girlfriend, former ‘TOWIE’ star Lucy Mecklenburgh.

Le Hamas et le Fatah du président Mahmoud Abbas s'engagent ""à aider le gouvernement d'unité (...) à exercer ses pleines responsabilités dans la gestion de la bande de Gaza, comme c'est le cas en Cisjordanie"" d'ici cette date, affirme le communiqué du Caire, qui a fait office de médiateur dans les efforts de réconciliation entre frères ennemis palestiniens. Le mouvement islamiste Hamas et son rival palestinien du Fatah ont en effet signé ce jeudi au Caire un accord de réconciliation destiné à mettre fin à une décennie de déchirements dévastateurs, en se laissant deux mois pour résoudre les problèmes les plus épineux.

De nouvelles discussions en novembre

L'Autorité palestinienne, entité internationalement reconnue supposée préfigurer un Etat palestinien indépendant, devra à cette date assumer ""toutes les responsabilités"" dans la bande de Gaza, selon le communiqué. Les deux camps se donnent jusqu'à cette date pour régler tous leurs différends, ajoute le texte. Une nouvelle réunion est prévue au Caire le 21 novembre. Les détails de l'accord n'ont pas été divulgués dans les déclarations faites aux journalistes au Caire.

Dans ce qui serait une manifestation spectaculaire de ce rapprochement, le président de l'Autorité palestinienne Mahmoud Abbas devrait se rendre prochainement à Gaza, a déclaré à l'AFP Zakaria al-Agha, chef du parti Fatah de Mahmoud Abbas dans la bande de Gaza. Autre avancée de la réconciliation, 3000 policiers de l'Autorité palestinienne vont être déployés dans la bande de Gaza et aux frontières avec Israël et l'Egypte, a dit à l'AFP sous couvert de l'anonymat un haut responsable impliqué dans les tractations.

Par ailleurs Mahmoud Abbas devrait lever ""très bientôt"" les mesures financières prises en 2017 pour forcer le Hamas à la conciliation, a dit Zakaria al-Agha. La visite de Mahmoud Abbas dans la bande de Gaza serait la première depuis 2007.

Une quasi-guerre civile avec le Fatah en 2007

Le Hamas, vainqueur des législatives en 2006 mais privé de sa victoire sous les pressions internationales, avait évincé de la bande de Gaza l'Autorité palestinienne ainsi que ses forces de sécurité, au prix d'une quasi-guerre civile avec le Fatah en 2007. L'Autorité, dominée par le Fatah, n'exerce plus son pouvoir, limité, que sur la Cisjordanie, occupée par Israël et distante de Gaza de quelques dizaines de kilomètres.

Toutes les tentatives de réconciliation ont échoué depuis 2007, y compris celle qui avait donné lieu à un accord en 2011 au Caire. Isolé, confronté au risque d'explosion sociale mais aussi à un soutien amoindri du Qatar, le Hamas, par ailleurs soumis aux pressions du grand voisin égyptien, a fini par accepter en septembre le retour à Gaza de l'Autorité et de son gouvernement.

Le raccommodement a été matérialisé en grande pompe la semaine passée avec le premier conseil des ministres se tenant à Gaza depuis 2014. Le Hamas et le Fatah ont engagé mardi au Caire des tractations entourées du plus grand secret sur les modalités pratiques de la réconciliation.

Double enjeu

L'enjeu de la réconciliation, considérable, est double. Le plus immédiat est le sort des deux millions de Gazaouis, éprouvés par trois guerres avec Israël depuis 2008, les blocus israélien et égyptien, la pauvreté, le chômage et les pénuries d'eau et d'électricité. Au-delà, les divisions palestiniennes sont considérées comme un des principaux obstacles au règlement du conflit israélo-palestinien.

La légitimité du président Abbas, interlocuteur d'Israël et de la communauté internationale, est sapée par le fait que le Hamas, considéré comme terroriste par Israël, les Etats-Unis ou l'Union européenne et comme infréquentable par plusieurs pays arabes, préside actuellement aux destinées de deux cinquièmes des Palestiniens des Territoires.

Le Hamas attend la levée des mesures financières prises par le président Abbas pour le faire fléchir, comme l'arrêt du paiement de la facture d'électricité gazaouie à Israël. ""On reviendra dessus quand le gouvernement sera en mesure d'assumer ses responsabilités"", avait dit Mahmoud Abbas la semaine passée.

Evoquant l'éventualité que le Hamas reste en charge de la sécurité à Gaza, Mahmoud Abbas a aussi prévenu qu'il n'accepterait pas ""qu'on clone l'expérience du Hezbollah au Liban"". Le Hamas a signifié de son côté que la question de ses armes n'était pas négociable. Les parties doivent aussi régler le sort de dizaines de milliers de fonctionnaires recrutés depuis 2007 par le Hamas.

Le Premier ministre israélien Benjamin Netanyahu a prévenu que son pays n'accepterait de traiter avec un gouvernement parlant au nom de toutes les factions palestiniennes que si le Hamas démantèle son bras armé, rompt avec l'Iran et reconnaît Israël. Des conditions a priori impossibles à satisfaire pour le Hamas.

In the course of the work with adolescents and young people, the Population Foundation of India (PFI) has documented a churn in the status quo in states such as Bihar and Madhya Pradesh. Adolescent girls have come together in groups called Kishori Clubs to discuss the issues that nobody will talk to them about, such as child marriage, family planning, contraception, and menstruation. Through the use of social behaviour change communication materials and discussions at these meetings, the girls raised awareness and action on these issues and have even managed to bring a positive influence on the families who are still caught up in ignorant practices that are anti-girl and anti-woman.

By coming together in groups, they have created safe spaces for girls to talk not only about social issues, but also a place to share their dreams.

The girls are not shy and make no pretence of menstruation, and are aware of the need to be able to manage their own menstrual hygiene. In Hardiya village, Rajauli block of the Nawada district in Bihar, they have begun the conversation on menstrual health management and have a system where they pool their resources, contributing at least one rupee a day, ₹ 30 a month, to buy sanitary napkins for every girl in the group. This then becomes a 'bank of sanitary napkins' that will be used to distribute to girls who could not afford to pay. Due to the fantastic success of the initiative, it is now being scaled up in neighbouring areas.

In another example, the girls from the Kishori Club identified 45 cases of child marriage in the Kawakol, Rajauli and Singhwara blocks of Nawada and Darbhanga districts, also in Bihar. Subsequently, the group met and discussed the negative implications of child marriage with the adolescents and their parents. They made compelling arguments against early marriage and also explained to these families the benefits of delaying marriage – the opportunities it presents for these girls like being better prepared physically, mentally and financially. Most of these marriages were stopped.

These girls are creating a tectonic shift in the way they are perceived. By coming together in groups, they have created safe spaces for girls to talk not only about social issues, but also a place to share their dreams and goals or discuss the personal problems that they face at home. There are hundreds of similar, inspiring stories that come out from under the shadows of the mainstream. And more girls are realising that they can dream big and achieve these dreams, they too can move the world.

LUCKNOW -- The Allahabad High Court has acquitted the parents of Aarushi Talwar, who was found murdered nine years back in Noida, setting aside the CBI court's earlier order, in connection with the double murder case, which shook the nation in 2008.

A special CBI Judge, S. Lal, had earlier held Aarushi's parents, Rajesh and Nupur Talwar, guilty of conspiracy and murder of 14-year-old Aarushi and domestic help Hemraj.

The order, however, failed to bring a closure to the case and the public opinion remained divided, even after years of the conviction.

A high court bench, comprising Justice B.K. Narayana and Justice A.K. Mishra, had reserved its verdict, in September, in the appeal filed by Aarushi's parents, who were sentenced to life in jail.

On May 16, 2008, Aarushi was found murdered inside her bedroom in the flat in Jal Vayu Vihar - her throat slit with surgical precision.

It was initially suspected that house help Hemraj had killed Aarushi. However, the case took a shocking turn when Hemraj's body was recovered two days later from the terrace of the same flat.

The police then began to suspect the Talwars and said Rajesh had murdered the two after finding them in an ""objectionable"" position.

The accusations enraged the Talwars and friends, who accused the police of framing the dentist couple in order to cover up a botched investigation.

After widespread outrage, the case was transferred from the Uttar Pradesh Police to the CBI that exonerated the parents and suspected the Talwars' assistant Krishna along with two domestic servants, Rajkumar Sharma and Vijay Mandal.

In 2009, the CBI handed over the investigation to a new team, which recommended closing the case due to critical gaps in investigation.

Based on circumstantial evidence, it named Rajesh as the sole suspect, but refused to charge him due to lack of evidence.

Rajesh was first arrested by the Uttar Pradesh Police on May 23, 2008 after which he was lodged at Dasna Jail and let off on July 11, 2008.

On a November morning, two years ago, just a few days before ""Children's Day"", I was standing outside a Barista waiting for an Uber cab I had just ordered. I called the driver for the third time in 15 minutes.

""Arrey kidhar ho?"" I asked him exasperatedly.

""U-turn le ke aa raha hoon!"" he replied equally impatiently.

I hung up, and as I did I heard a thin voice ask, ""Joota polish?""

I looked down to see a boy who could not have been more than 10-years-old squinting up into the sun at me, with his shoe-shine kit slung over his shoulder, asking to polish my shoes.

He looked up scornfully from his polishing and said, ""Do I look like I go to school?"" I instantly felt like an idiot!

I pulled out a ten rupee note out of my pocket and handed it to him. He took a step back indignantly and said, ""I'm not begging."" I suddenly felt ashamed of myself and asked a bit gruffly, ""How much will you charge?""

The boy said, ""Whatever you want to give."" Smart little chap, I thought to myself.

I sat down on the steps of the Barista and started chatting to him as he began scrubbing my shoes.

""What's your name?"" I asked

""Honey,"" he replied.

""How many people in your family?'

""Just me and my mother.""

""What does your mother do?"" I asked him

""Nothing. She's not well, and so I have to work.""

Not quite sure what to say next, I asked him, ""Do you go to school?""

He looked up scornfully from his polishing and said, ""Do I look like I go to school?"" I instantly felt like an idiot!

""Where is your father?"" I asked him.

""Gone"", he replied. I did not probe further.

I looked at his dirty white shirt, and bleached brown hair as he applied the final touches of shoe wax to my shoes and a thought suddenly struck me.

""Have you eaten?""

""Not since last night. I'm starving,"" then he quickly added so as not to have to make me think too much, ""There's a place in the back of the market where they sell rajma chawal for people like me.""

For people like me?

The words stung me like a slap! For people like me?!

Something resembling anger rose up inside me. I pointed to the Barista behind me and said, ""Want to go here for lunch?""

Honey recoiled. ""No, no, no!"" he said. ""They'll never let me in there.""

""Of course they will,"" I said. ""You're my friend, right? I'm taking you for lunch.""

Honey frowned, not exactly sure if my saying I was his friend actually made me one.

""Come on,"" I said to him. ""Let's go."" And I opened the door to the Barista. The look on Honey's face said that either I was mad or he was. We walked into the Barista, me with my laptop bag slung over my shoulder and he with his shoeshine kit slung over his.

All conversation in the Barista suddenly ceased. A complete hush descended on the coffee shop. Even the sound of cutlery died. There were maybe 30 people in the cafe. Every pair of eyes stared at us as we walked to the counter.

""What would you like?"" I said. Honey pressed his nose to the glass. ""That!"" he said, pointing to a rich chocolate truffle pastry.

""One chocolate truffle for my friend please,"" I said to the chap behind the counter who had a wide grin on his face. He was, I guessed, not from a very affluent background himself. The cafe manager, on the other hand, looked like he was frozen in time and space and had no clue how to handle this.

I was starting to enjoy myself now.

""Where do you want to sit?"" I asked Honey, rather hoping he would choose to sit inside. But Honey, the empathetic soul that he was, looked around at the very obvious discomfiture of everyone else in the cafe and said, ""Let's just sit outside.""

We went and sat on the steps of the Barista as he wolfed down his chocolate truffle. He suddenly realised he hadn't offered me any. He held up the half-eaten pastry and said, ""Want some?"" I declined, and he happily went back to finishing it.

My taxi arrived, and I got up to go.

I slipped Honey a hundred rupee note. He said, ""So will I see you again? I'm here every day."" I said, 'Of course,"" and took my leave.

As I settled into the taxi, I heard a rather heavy knock on the window. I turned to see a burly chap in a pink shirt that I remembered seeing in the Barista. I rolled down the window. The big man said in a soft voice, ""I saw what you did there. That was very nice. Thank you.""

I honestly did not know what to say and fumbled for words and a response. Nothing came to mind. I can't remember what I said if anything. All I remember is that I felt a bit awkward and embarrassed.

As the taxi drove away, I turned to see the man in the pink shirt sit down on the steps next to Honey and start chatting to him.

I went back to that market a few days later with a bag of warm clothes for him and then a few times after that, but I never met Honey again. I asked around, but no one seemed to have seen him. It's been two years now. I have no idea what happened to that little chap.

I hope I meet him again.

Experten und Politiker warnen vor einer nuklearen Aufrüstungsspirale, wenn Trump das Abkommen bricht

Donald Trump hat geschimpft und gedroht. Er hat den Iran einen Schurkenstaat genannt und das Atomabkommen verteufelt. Er hat gesagt, dass er sich nicht mehr daran gebunden fühlen könne.

Nun steht eine der bislang wichtigsten außenpolitischen Entscheidung des US-Präsidenten bevor. Bis zum Sonntag muss er dem Kongress mitteilen, ob sich Teheran an die Vereinbarung hält oder nicht.

Trump hat eine Rede angekündigt, sie wird für Freitag erwartet. Mehrere deutsche Politiker warnten bereits vehement vor einer Aufkündigung.

Außenminister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) erklärte zuletzt, er sei ""sehr besorgt"" über die Entwicklung – auch weil Nordkorea wohl kaum auf eine atomare Aufrüstung verzichte, ""wenn der einzige Vertrag, der einen solchen Verzicht ermöglicht hat"" aufgekündigt werden würde.

Auch Grünen-Außenexperte Omid Nouripour warnte: ""Hat der Iran die Bombe"", würden bald auch ""Saudi-Arabien, die Türkei und vielleicht auch noch Ägypten nach der Bombe greifen"". Nouripour zufolge würde das die zahlreichen Konflikte im Nahen Osten ""auch noch nuklearisieren"".

Düstere Aussichten. Denn selbst wenn man die positiven Erfahrungen der USA der letzten Dekaden mit Atomwaffen als Abschreckung zum Maßstab nimmt: Eine solche Aufrüstung einer Krisenregion würde die internationale Bemühung um Frieden um Jahre zurückwerfen.

Die wichtigsten Fragen und Antworten vor dem Schicksalstag im Überblick:

1. Worum geht es in dem Abkommen?

Die Vereinbarung zwischen dem Iran einerseits sowie den USA, Russland, China, Frankreich, Großbritannien und Deutschland andererseits soll sicherstellen, dass Teherans Atomprogramm ausgebremst wird und so internationale Sorgen vor einer Bombe zerstreut werden.

Der Iran unterwirft dadurch seine Urananreicherung bis zu 25 Jahre lang einem mehrstufigen System von Beschränkungen und Kontrollen. Der Westen hob im Gegenzug die Wirtschaftssanktionen auf.

2. Was hat nun Trump genau vor?

Es gilt als derzeit wahrscheinlichstes Szenario, dass Trump erklären wird, dass das Abkommen nicht im nationalen Sicherheitsinteresse der USA ist und er es deswegen nicht erneut bestätigen kann. Das wäre aber noch nicht der Rückzug der US-Regierung aus dem Abkommen.

Trump würde es dem Kongress überlassen, was passieren soll. Das Parlament müsste innerhalb von 60 Tagen entscheiden, ob es Konsequenzen aus Trumps Schritt ziehen will. Dabei geht es etwa um die Wiedereinführung von ausgesetzten Sanktionen.

Aber schon mit seiner Positionierung gegen den Deal könnte der Präsident der Vereinbarung nach Einschätzung europäischer Diplomaten schaden. Es müsse ein Minimum an Bekenntnissen von amerikanischer Seite geben, heißt es.

3. Was sind Trumps Motive?

Der Republikaner und seine Regierung halten das Abkommen für problematisch. Es geht ihnen nicht weit genug. Zwar hieß es aus der US-Regierung zuletzt immer wieder, dass der Iran die technischen Vorgaben der Übereinkunft erfülle. Allerdings halten sie der iranischen Führung vor, dass ihre Politik in krassem Gegensatz zu den in dem Deal vereinbarten friedlichen Absichten stehe.

Sie sagen, Teheran fördere den Terrorismus in der Region, etwa durch die Unterstützung der Hisbollah im Libanon und der Hamas im Gaza-Streifen. Sie werfen der Regierung auch vor, Israel zu bedrohen.

Trump treiben daneben wohl vor allem persönliche Motive. Er sieht sich auf einem Feldzug, die politischen Entscheidungen seines Amtsvorgängers Barack Obama rückgängig zu machen. Wohl auch deshalb bezeichnete er das Abkommen wiederholt als ""schlechtesten Deal, der je gemacht wurde"".

4. Hält sich der Iran an die Auflagen?

Der 16. Januar 2016 markiert den eigentlichen Beginn des Abkommens. Damals attestierte die Internationale Atomenergiebehörde (IAEA), dass der Iran sein Nuklearprogramm drastisch eingeschränkt hat. Seitdem überwachen die Inspektoren der IAEA mit beispielloser Strenge, ob die Islamische Republik alle Vorgaben einhält.

In zwei Fällen überschritt Teheran minimal die Grenze für Schwerwasser, was umgehend korrigiert wurde. Das bisherige Fazit der IAEA: Der Iran hält sich an das Abkommen. Yukiya Amano, der Direktor der Organisation, bekräftigte diese Einschätzung am Montag noch einmal.

5. Was soll laut Abkommen bei Problemen passieren?

Eine ""Gemeinsame Kommission"" zur etwaigen Lösung von Streitfragen tagt regulär viermal im Jahr und kann im Bedarfsfall jederzeit einberufen werden. Zuletzt hatte sich der Iran beschwert, dass Trump mit seinem Kampf gegen das Abkommen die angestrebte Normalisierung der Wirtschaftsbeziehungen torpediere.

Teil des Abkommens ist auch der ""Snapback""-Mechanismus. Er sieht vor, dass ausgesetzte Sanktionen erneut verhängt werden können, wenn Teheran in signifikanter Weise das Abkommen verletzt. Sollte es zu diesem Schritt kommen, hat der Iran bereits im Text des Deals seinerseits einen teilweisen oder völligen Ausstieg aus dem Abkommen festgelegt.

6. Wendet Trump dieses Verfahren an?

Nein.

7. Wie könnte der Iran auf Trumps Entscheidung reagieren?

Sowohl Irans Präsident Hassan Rohani als auch sein Außenminister Mohamed Dschawad Sarif haben in den vergangenen Wochen mehrmals vor Provokationen durch Trump gewarnt. Ihrer Meinung nach versucht er, den Iran zu radikalen Reaktionen zu zwingen, um Teheran dann für das Scheitern des Abkommens verantwortlich zu machen.

Daher müsse man besonders behutsam vorgehen und alle weiteren Schritte mit den anderen Unterzeichnern des Abkommens absprechen, erklärte die iranische Regierung. Die erste Gelegenheit für solche Gespräche wäre das für Ende Oktober in Wien geplante Treffen der 5+1 Gruppe auf Vizeaußenminister-Ebene.

8. Ist es denn möglich, dass es zu neuen Verhandlungen über das Abkommen kommt?

Das gilt als sehr unwahrscheinlich. Teheran hat das ausgeschlossen. Auch in Europa ist der Drang, die Vereinbarung nachzuverhandeln, nicht sehr groß.

Möglich ist aber, dass Deutschland, Frankreich und Großbritannien andere Aktivitäten des Irans wie das Raketenprogramm getrennt davon in einem Maßnahmenpaket adressieren.

""Je rencontre des hommes comme Harvey Weinstein tout le temps"", lâche Léa Seydoux, 32 ans, dès la première phrase de sa tribune, publiée sur le site du quotidien britannique.

Elle relate sa rencontre, à un défilé à une date non précisée, avec le producteur, qui insiste illico pour la voir le soir-même. ""Il a flirté et m'a regardée comme si j'étais un morceau de viande"", écrit-elle, soulignant qu'il avait ""un air lubrique"".

Il parvient à la faire monter dans sa chambre d'hôtel pour un verre. L'assistante d'Harvey Weinstein, jusqu'alors présente, s'éclipse.

""Nous parlions sur le canapé quand il a soudainement sauté sur moi et a essayé de m'embrasser. J'ai dû me défendre. Il est grand, et gros, alors j'ai dû résister vigoureusement. Je suis partie, complètement dégoûtée, mais je n'ai cependant jamais eu peur de lui car je savais dès le début à qui j'avais affaire"", se souvient-elle.

""Tout le monde savait ce que Harvey faisait et personne n'a rien fait""

Après cette expérience, Léa Seydoux affirme avoir revu à plusieurs occasions l'inévitable producteur, qui selon elle opérait à la vue de tous avec quantité de jeunes femmes.

""Tout le monde savait ce que Harvey faisait et personne n'a rien fait. Il est incroyable qu'il ait pu agir comme ça pendant des décennies et garder sa carrière. C'est seulement possible parce qu'il a énormément de pouvoir"", dénonce l'actrice.

Le problème, toutefois, dépasse Harvey Weinstein, dit-elle. Elle-même a reçu des avances sexuelles de réalisateurs avec qui elle travaillait.

""Ce métier est basé sur l'apparence. Vous devez être désirable pour être aimée. Mais tous les désirs ne peuvent pas être assouvis, même si les hommes dans le milieu du cinéma croient le contraire"", conclut-elle, en espérant un changement de des mentalités.

Tribune également publié sur le blog de Michel-Edouard LeclercÀ voir également sur Le HuffPost:","J'ai écouté attentivement le Président de la République en conclusion de la première phase des Etats généraux de l'alimentation.

Premier sentiment: un grand soulagement.

Ouf ! Emmanuel Macron n'est pas tombé dans le piège que lui tendaient les représentants des multinationales en réclamant une réforme du seuil de revente à perte sur l'ensemble des produits de grande consommation.

Vous vous souvenez de ma question : ""En quoi augmenter le prix du savon fera-t-il les affaires du paysan breton ?"". Le Président connaissait donc la réponse : en rien. Bonne nouvelle!

En annonçant qu'il était favorable au relèvement du seuil de revente à perte sur les seuls produits alimentaires et selon les filières, Macron a dû décevoir pas mal d'actionnaires de nos concurrents ou des multinationales.

On verra dans quelques mois quel est le périmètre de ce qu'il appelle ""produits alimentaires"" et comment tout cela sera calculé (quelle part de lait dans l'Actimel ou dans le Ricoré ?), mais on en revient à des bases de discussion bien plus saines.

Deuxième satisfaction : le discours sur l'indispensable montée en gamme de la production agroalimentaire française. Emmanuel Macron fait preuve de volontarisme en voulant insuffler la réforme dans l'ensemble du secteur.

Aucune difficulté à me reconnaître dans le discours du Président sur les montées en gamme de produit, la hausse de la qualité, l'indispensable accélération sur la bio, la meilleure prise en compte du bien-être animal, les productions à label. Oui, trois fois oui. Tout cela est d'ailleurs dans la Charte E.Leclerc 2020.

C'est ce qu'attendent nos consommateurs quand ils sont prêts à payer un peu plus certains produits alimentaires : c'est pour de la qualité supérieure et avec la garantie que cela améliore le revenu des producteurs.

Troisième satisfaction : l'entrée dans les interprofessions des distributeurs. Voilà une bonne décision, que nous réclamons depuis de nombreuses années.

Reste à voir ce que le Président entend par là car évidemment pas question d'y jouer les rôles de figurants auxquels certains voudraient nous cantonner, en étant seulement invités à co-décider du seul plan de communication publicitaire sur le lait. On veut pouvoir dialoguer avec tous les acteurs, producteurs et transformateurs, pour mieux anticiper les demandes consommateurs (quantités, qualités, diversités...) et calibrer l'offre.

Sur l'encadrement des promotions, ce n'est pas une satisfaction mais une position issue d'un consensus devant une situation devenue - c'est vrai - un peu incontrôlée. Nous avions exprimé une position favorable à cette proposition lors des ateliers des EGA, même si nous avons quelques réserves.

Enfin, sur le prix de production choisi comme prix de départ, qui pour être contre ? Personne n'a à se réjouir de la situation du revenu de nombre de paysans. Donc évidemment le consensus peut se faire sur le principe. Il restera à savoir comment gérer quand les coûts de production français décrocheront du marché.

Finalement ce qui a manqué dans ce discours, c'est une approche plus globale sur la PAC. Car c'est quand même 10 milliards d'euros par an en plus du prix ! Ce devrait être un vrai levier de transformation et d'accompagnement. Européen convaincu et militant, je suis surpris que notre Président n'y ait pas consacré le temps que cela méritait. Peut-être qu'il y reviendra. Je l'espère car c'est indispensable.

Anupam Kher's newest appointment has led to an outpouring of praise from most quarters, except for the one that should matter to him the most – the students of Pune's Film and Television Institute of India.

The cheerleaders are helmed by his wife Kirron Kher, fellow actor and currently member of Parliament for the Lok Sabha from Chandigarh for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at the Centre.

Congratulations my dear @AnupamPkher for becoming FTII Chairman ! Know you will do a great job ! October 11, 2017

A chorus of approval followed, typically summarised by this piece, hailing the elevation of the actor as a step in the right direction. Few would disagree with the fact that Kher has a much more illustrious career than his predecessor Gajendra Chauhan.

A member of the BJP, Chauhan was appointed to the role in 2014, a decision that was widely criticised as a politically partisan move to 'saffronise' the campus. Apart from objecting to Chauhan's ideological leanings, FTII students and alumni pointed out his singularly unimpressive output as an actor.

Compared to towering film personalities like Gulzar, Shyam Benegal and Adoor Gopalakrishnan, who were allegedly in the running for the job, Chauhan seemed like a shockingly ill-judged choice, raising suspicions of nepotism driven by a political agenda.

In Kher's case, at least his acting record is indisputably solid: over 500 films, in several languages, both in industries in India and beyond, scores of stage appearances, and an active engagement with cinema. But, as any sensible employer should know, a shining CV doesn't necessarily make for an ideal candidate.

That statement is especially true in the case of those pursuing creative professions like acting or teaching, which involve an emotional investment quite unlike the impersonal chore of, say, a book-keeper's, and the interplay of one's personal politics and belief systems in the professional sphere.

Kher's public image over the last two years, gleaned from his social media activities, smacks of a stridently pro-BJP agenda.

In 2015, when a group of writers, film personalities and artists decided to return awards conferred on them by the government to protest against the rise of intolerance in India, Kher's response was tellingly abrasive.

Some more usual suspects who never wanted @narendramodi to become PM in d first place have joined the #AwardWapsi gang. Jai Ho.:) — Anupam Kher (@AnupamPkher) October 28, 2015

Instead of engaging with the substance of the gesture by the leading lights of India's intelligentsia, Kher decided to attack them for their criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, under whose watch, as chief minister, Gujarat saw one of the worst communal riots in modern India in 2002.

What's worse, instead of choosing the path of civilised debate and dissent, Kher decided to lump them into a conglomerate — the ""#AwardWapsi gang"" — trivialising their stance and its import. It's not that the matter ended with a sly tweet and an emoticon — Kher actually took to the streets to emphasise his disdain for the lot.

But this was only the beginning.

In February 2016, with student leaders Kanhaiya Kumar and Umar Khalid of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), taking the nation to storm with their anti-establishment politics, Kher let loose another malignant remark on Twitter, comparing the young men to cockroaches and vermin that need purging from people's home. He urged for a nationwide ""pest control"" programme, piling vile allegory upon allegory.

घरों में पेस्ट कंट्रोल होता है तो कॉक्रोच, कीड़े मकोड़े इत्यादि बाहर निकलते है। घर साफ़ होता है।वैसे ही आजकल देश का पेस्ट कंट्रोल चल रहा है। — Anupam Kher (@AnupamPkher) February 20, 2016

Days later, he tweeted photographs from the JNU campus, where he addressed the students and ""purified"" it of anti-national slogans chanted earlier by crying ""Bharat Mata ki Jai"".

While love for one's country is a perfectly reasonable feeling to cherish in oneself, it is unfair to impose it as the only acceptable standard of patriotism on others. Given his fractious association with students and institutes of learning, Kher should tread with care as he takes over the running of FTII.

Kher has repeatedly baulked at the slightest hint of the criticism of the ruling government and its policies. Be it to support PM Modi's decision to demonetise high-value currencies last November, which was greeted by widespread public panic, or to abuse 20-year-old pacifist Gurmehar Kaur, he has left no stone unturned to make his allegiances known.

But aside from his right-leaning politics, there is a much bigger concern with Kher's appointment, which his troopers seemed to have conveniently overlooked. He is the founder of a private acting school in Mumbai, which presents a conflict of interest for his new role at FTII — as though being married to a politician, who is a member of the ruling government, and being appointed to run a government-backed institution wasn't problematic enough already.

Kher isn't bothered much. As he told The Quint, ""I am not worried about any clash of interest. I prioritise my various commitments in a very systematic way."" Be that as it may, the students of FTII aren't making matters easy for him.

Within 24 hours of Kher's appointment, they have written an open letter to him, outlining the glitches in the system they are plagued with. From short-term courses running for commercial gains to irregularities over the hiring of staff to the allocation of funds for purchase of equipment to the change in the syllabus, the problems are manifold and require urgent attention.

Hopefully, the new chairman, currently busy pinning tweets of gratitude and basking in the cacophony of applause around him, will pay heed to their demands before long.

A solitary accuser is seen as an opportunist, a gold-digger. Twenty accusers cannot be dismissed so easily. The Weinstein saga is a vivid illustration of the dreary principle that only a community can bring down a man who enjoys a certain kind of power.

It took more than 20 women in all for the full measure of Weinstein’s monstrousness to become known, women who came forward by name with allegations against the Hollywood producer that range from sexual harassment to rape. And that’s to say nothing of the several women who shared their stories with The New York Times and New Yorker anonymously. (Weinstein, via his representatives, has told the press that “any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein” and that he considered these “relationships” to be “consensual.”)

Had it been a single accuser, Weinstein would not have been ousted from his own company. We can say this with some certainty because Ambra Battilana Gutierrez had gone to the cops with her story in 2015 and was only smeared in the tabloid press for her troubles. Even though the cops had audio in which the mogul admits to having groped Gutierrez, Weinstein was never charged.

A solitary accuser is seen as an opportunist, a gold-digger. Twenty accusers cannot be dismissed so easily. The Weinstein saga is a vivid illustration of the dreary principle that only a community can bring down a man who enjoys a certain kind of power. It has followed a by-now familiar pattern:

Step 1: A powerful man has a reputation in certain circles for predatory behavior toward women.

Step 2: After years of open secrets (and perhaps even individual stories trickling out in the press), a media outlet manages to report out the allegations, tying them all together.

Step 3: Social media signal boosts these allegations, and mass outrage ensues. The pressure leads to a loss of public standing or the loss of a job or maybe a lawsuit.

These high-profile cases signal a shift in women’s willingness to speak up about sexual harassment and assault, and the cultural reaction to such allegations. This can be attributed to a variety of factors: more transparency surrounding workplace protections, greater media attention to such incidents, and the way social media has changed how we consume and discuss those stories in the first place.

The contagiousness of social media responses can sometimes facilitate swift, sustained outrage. However, not every case of alleged sexual harassment or assault spurs mass anger, and not all that do translate into real consequences for the alleged perpetrator. (See: the President of the United States.) Even in this new era, it takes a critical mass of accusers and witnesses to bring a predatory creep toward the reckoning he deserves. And often the cries have to build up over years, until they are presented in one jarring exhibit.

After all, it’s far simpler to ignore a lone allegation, and there’s far more room to argue over a singular voice’s credibility and motivations ― all of which becomes more difficult when there are five or 15 or 60 eerily similar stories next to each other.

And yet, Trump has faced little-to-no recourse from his supporters and party, outside of some halfhearted condemnations. He was elected to the highest office in the nation. He has proceeded to institute policies that actively hurt women ― like expanding the global gag rule, allowing states to withhold federal funding from Planned Parenthood, and rolling back protections for women workers and the birth control mandate.

On Monday, RNC chair Ronna Romney McDaniel told Wolf Blitzer that the allegations against Weinstein and Trump are “not even comparable.”

So, what explains this dissonance?

As Rebecca Traister pointed out in The Cut, Harvey Weinstein’s power in the entertainment industry was beginning to show signs of waning. The same could be said about Bill Cosby, who has not (yet) received any legal consequences for the dozens of sexual assault allegations he faces, but whose legacy and reputation have certainly been destroyed.

In contrast, Donald Trump’s star and political power were both on the rise when women began speaking out in large numbers about his allegedly inappropriate conduct. And because the allegations flooded out in the midst of a vicious presidential campaign, it became even easier for Trump’s supporters to convince themselves that the stories were lies, part of a plot by the unconventional candidate’s many powerful detractors.

This speaks to an ugly truth about our cultural “progress” when it comes to grappling with sexual harassment and assault. We are willing to consider the validity of women’s narratives of sexual exploitation ― but only when forced to, and often only when we feel distanced from or oppositional toward the alleged perpetrator.

Essentially, the village doesn’t matter if a man is powerful enough to balance out the costs that might be incurred by keeping him around.

“There’s no evidence that America is unified about how serious and pervasive and damaging sexual violence is,” said Kristen Houser, Chief Public Affairs Officer for the NSVRC. “We’re happy to sit back in our seats and say, ‘Oh gosh, that’s horrible,’ but we as a culture have not yet decided that [sexual violence or misconduct] is a deal breaker. The closer that the perpetrator is to us ― either in reality or in terms of celebrity and hero worship ― [it becomes more] difficult to reconcile those things with allegations of wrongdoing.”",Why (Some) Powerful Creeps Are Finally Starting To Face Consequences,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-some-powerful-creeps-are-finally-starting-to-face-consequences_us_59db90bae4b046f5ad99c1e0

Demnach liegen an den zuständigen deutschen Auslandsvertretungen in Beirut, Amman, Erbil, Ankara, Istanbul und Izmir in dieser Zahl Terminanfragen für einen Familiennachzug zu syrischen und irakischen Schutzberechtigten vor.

Von Anfang 2015 bis Mitte 2017 hatte das Außenamt bereits rund 102.000 Visa zum Familiennachzug für Syrer und Iraker erteilt. Auf Basis dieser bisher erteilten Visa und der aktuellen Terminbuchungen schätzt das Ministerium, dass bis einschließlich 2018 etwa 100.000 bis 200.000 weitere solcher Visa hinzukommen könnten.

Für 2015 bis einschließlich 2018 geht es beim Familiennachzug zu Syrern und Irakern demnach also um einen grob geschätzten Umfang von 200.000 bis 300 000 Angehörigen.

Asylsuchende, die in Deutschland Schutz bekommen, dürfen Ehepartner und minderjährige Kinder zum Teil nachholen. Auch anerkannte minderjährige Flüchtlinge dürfen ihre Eltern hinterherholen.

Subsidär Geschützte haben bis 2018 keine Möglichkeiten, die Familie nachzuholen

Für eine bestimmte Gruppe mit eingeschränktem Schutzstatus, subsidiär Geschützte, hatte die große Koalition den Familiennachzug im März 2016 beschränkt und für zwei Jahre ausgesetzt: bis März 2018.

Das Außenamt ist dafür zuständig, Visa zum Familiennachzug zu erteilen. Zu laufenden Anträgen gibt es keine Statistik, erfasst werden aber die Terminanfragen zum Familiennachzug, die das Ministerium neben den Zahlen zu bisher erteilten Visa für die Schätzung der künftigen Entwicklung nutzt.

Von Januar 2015 bis Ende Juni 2017 hatte das Außenamt nach eigenen Angaben weltweit 230.000 Anträge auf Familiennachzug bewilligt. Diese Gesamtzahl betrifft aber Menschen aus allen möglichen Staaten jenseits der EU - und nur zu einem Teil Flüchtlinge.

Unter Flüchtlingen - also anerkannten Schutzberechtigten mit Anspruch auf Familiennachzug - bilden Syrer mit Abstand die größte Gruppe. Zwischen Anfang 2015 und Mitte 2017 gingen 102.000 Visa zum Familiennachzug an Syrer und Iraker, rund 3000 an Afghanen.

Speaking in the Commons this afternoon, the Prime Minister revealed £250million of taxpayers’ money had already been set aside to help departments plan for the UK leaving the EU without a trade deal.

She also announced the Treasury will soon set out how ministers can apply for extra cash to help with contingency planning.

Earlier today, Hammond told the Treasury Select Committee funds would not be handed over until “the very last moment” – despite the fact £250million has already been set aside.

At Prime Minister’s Questions shortly after the Chancellor’s appearance, May was asked to confirm “that all monies necessary will be allocated as and when required” to prepare for ‘no deal’.

May replied: “We are committing money to prepare for Brexit, including a no deal scenario.”

She added: “The Treasury has committed over £250million of new money to departments like Defra, Home Office, HMRC and DfT in this financial year for Brexit preparations, and in some cases departments will need to spend money before the relevant legislation has gone through the House.

“I can tell the House that the Treasury will write to departments and the Public Accounts Committee explaining this process shortly.

“So, where money needs to be spent, it will be spent.”

After Prime Minister’s Questions, a No 10 spokesman twice declined to answer if May’s announcement was a contradiction of Hammond’s position.

The Chancellor is becoming increasingly unpopular with pro-Brexit Tory MPs, with many seeing him as determined to water down or delay the UK’s exit from the EU.

Speaking on the BBC’s Daily Politics show this afternoon, Tory backbencher Bernard Jenkin said he “was very pleased to see the Prime Minister making absolutely clear” that departments would have the money they needed to prepare for ‘no deal’.

Asked by Andrew Neil if the Prime Minister had put Hammond in his place, Jenkin said: “She’s cleared up some of the ambiguity that the Chancellor left, yes, how can I put it more diplomatically than that?”

He claimed “there is a Treasury mindset” that is very “jaundiced” about Brexit, and that a more positive approach was needed.

In his appearance before the Treasury Select Committee this morning, Hammond said he was “not proposing to “allocate funds to departments in advance of the need to spend.”

He added: “We should look in each area at the last point at which spending can begin to ensure that we are ready for a day one, no deal scenario and that’s when we should start spending hard-earned taxpayers money, because every pound we spend on contingent preparations for a hard customs border is a pound that we can’t spend on the NHS or social care or education or deficit reduction.

“I don’t believe that we should be in the business of making potentially nugatory expenditure until the very last moment when we need to do so.

“We will be ready, we will spend the money in a timely fashion to ensure that we are ready, but we will not spend it earlier than necessary just to make some demonstration point.”

It took 10 years, eight pregnancies, six miscarriages and a great deal of pain to become a mother of two. Eight years on from the birth of my first child, it's only now that am I beginning to make sense of my fraught transition into motherhood.

When we started our journey to parenthood we were busy in good careers, happy in marriage, young, fresh and keen. Like many, we rejoiced in the set of double blue lines on the pregnancy stick. We told our nearest and dearest, and booked the relevant medical appointments. We had no reason to worry when we went for the 12-week scan, but at that moment our story grew dark. With no prior warning, the eyes of the ultrasound technician changed and she called for assistance. I knew. I went cold and my husband nearly fainted in shock. Their words will never leave us: ""I am sorry there is no heartbeat.""

That was just the start. Our lives became consumed by a further five ill-fated pregnancies, including complicated and extremely painful ectopic pregnancies; numerous operations; endless tests and samples; plus two rounds of IUI. As well as years of physical strain, the emotional turmoil was immense - so much so that I have blocked much of it out of my mind. At the time, we were left to wander aimlessly in our anxious state, offered no professional supervision and didn't have access to the kind of support that's now available on social media. We were lost and felt very alone.

I found it hard to deal with the things people would say to us. Even professionals would state, ""at least you can get pregnant"", or ""it just wasn't meant to be this time"", or ""perhaps you are too stressed"". With no other explanations, I began to believe it was all my fault. I tried everything to change it - I gave up alcohol and caffeine, ate healthily, reduced my working hours, took up reflexology and even got a dog! And just when I had given up all hope, pregnancy number seven stayed put. Cruelly, we lost our beloved dog in a tragic accident when I was six months pregnant.

I was terribly anxious throughout my pregnancy and never dared believe it would be OK. But, after a traumatic birth and a difficult first few weeks, we took home our beautiful, healthy baby boy. Three years later, we had another son. I will be eternally grateful that we were able to have children in the end. Even to this day, I pinch myself when I see them sleeping.

What do I see looking back now?

I see a young couple who suddenly changed from being open with full hearts, to being closed and struggling. We struggled to keep positive; to keep our careers going forward; to deal with profound and repeated loss and uncertainty; and to remain upbeat while others around us were having babies. We were full of negative self-talk, confused by the lack of answers and tormented by questions like ""why us"", and ""what have we done to deserve this?"" It was very bleak.

What has reflection taught me?

It's only recently that I've felt able to reflect on that time properly and understand what it has taught me. While I'd never have wished to go through that experience, it equipped me with stronger compassion, a deeper insight and a greater understanding of how to deal with life's big questions. It had a profound impact on me as a person and led me to take a completely different career path - retraining as a coach to help other people through change.

Knowing what I know now, I often wonder what I would say to my younger self in the midst of that despair. The list is endless but key things stand out:

You can't control what is happening, or not happening. Don't torment or blame yourself looking for answers and try to live in the present as much as possible.

You are not alone. There are many people going through the same experience. Reach out to others, be open about your pain and you'll find others open up too.

Work on positivity. It's not easy when you are at the lowest possible point, but negativity and isolation are unhelpful and a waste of crucial energy. Find the environment and tools which nurture you and refuel your strength.

Accept help from the now countless support agencies, you will empower yourself to heal and move forward. Grief for the unseen loss is important.

Most of all, this experience never leaves you - it will find you at the most unexpected times. But it will also give you strength when you need it most, and skills that you'll carry through life.

But according to health experts, we are potentially putting ourselves in harm's way when trying on Halloween costumes.

According to WTOL, doctors have reported an increase in head lice because there are so many shoppers trying on masks and wigs, and it only takes one affected person to create a lice infestation.

OK, now we're even more terrified.

""We have a lot of people going into stores right now, trying on masks, trying on costumes, and trying on wigs,"" Cherie Sexton, a paediatric nurse practitioner, told the news outlet.

""A lot of people don't give much thought into the fact that several people could've tried it on before them.""

This is making us re-think that Pennywise costume.

For the uninitiated, head lice are parasites found on our heads, and can be spread by personal contact or the sharing of items such as combs, brushes, hats, clothing, and, apparently, Halloween costumes.

As such, all family members can become infected if just one member of the family has it — usually via a school-age kid — and they should all be treated with a specialty comb and a kit from a drugstore, which should include an over-the-counter shampoo.

All family members can become infected if just one member of the family has it.

But it's hard to tell whether Halloween costumes have lice unless you look really closely, and even then they can be tough to find as there are usually only a few of them. So, how do you go about buying a Halloween costume without catching lice?

WTOL suggests putting your costume or wig in a sealed plastic bag for 48 hours before wearing it, as head lice will usually die within 24 to 48 hours. After this period, throw dryer friendly items in the dryer on high heat for 45 minutes. And when you're ready to wear the costume, put on a swim or wig cap to cover your hair and scalp — this will make it difficult for lice to penetrate.

It's also important to note that the risk of a lice infestation can last for up to a week.

""It can go up for seven days, so if your child has been to a Halloween costume party, or they've been to a sleepover and somebody called and said there was somebody with lice there, make sure you check your child for the next seven days,"" said Sexton.

If you do find out that you, or your kids, have lice, there are natural ways to get rid of the pesky bugs. Olive oil, for example, can get rid of lice through suffocation. Coat the infected person's head in the oil, put a shower cap on their head and get them to sleep with it on. Lice can actually hold their breath for hours (scary!), which is why the oil should stay on the head overnight.

Check the head thoroughly with a fine comb.

Another common way of getting rid of lice without using a shampoo is by combing the hair with a fine comb. This should be used in combination with olive oil, as lice eggs can't be smothered. (Again, scary!) After sleeping with the oil on the head, separate the hair into sections and go through it slowly with the comb. It's important that you buy an actual lice comb, as regular combs won't do a proper job. Comb out the lice or eggs and throw them out.

And yes, you'll want to do this for at least a week.

But if you're really scared of catching lice, it may be best to just avoid a store-bought costume altogether and create one yourself.

The events were an idea from the nonprofit Crescent Peace Society, which has been seeking to raise awareness and improve understanding of Muslim cultures through interfaith events and dialogue since its founding in 1996.

The volunteer-run group was started by a handful of Muslim parents after the Oklahoma City bombing, when some of their kids were afraid to return to school because classmates said they were responsible for the attack.

Since then, the group has been organizing annual interfaith dinners, local “visit a mosque” events, and a yearly iftar to break the Ramadan fast ― all with non-Muslim community members so they can get to know Muslims face-to-face and counter misconceptions.

But late last year, almost exactly two decades after the group’s founding, Trump won the presidency with a campaign full of anti-Muslim rhetoric. Crescent Peace Society, which is based in the suburb of Overland Park, Kansas, received a wave of requests from neighbors around the Kansas City area “who wanted to do something for the Muslim community but didn’t know how ― or had never even met a Muslim,” the group’s president, Ahsan Latif, told HuffPost.

That’s when he started the monthly “Meet a Muslim” events, inviting non-Muslims to sit around a table with Muslims and just talk ― about current events, their families, their faith, anything. The events, which are free and open to the public, have been at locations including an Islamic Center, a church and a synagogue. The first drew about 200 people and subsequent events have brought in about 150 each.

“I was surprised by my own misconceptions, particularly about the lives of women within the Muslim religion,” participant Becky Plate, who is non-Muslim, told HuffPost by email of her experience at one event. “I consider myself a pretty well-informed individual ... but even I had allowed news stories, about things like women secretly learning to drive in Saudi Arabia, to color my opinions.”

For Latif, this type of myth-busting is exactly what the events are all about.

“It distills our mission down to one event: getting to know people on a person-to-person basis,” Latif said. “It’s harder to demonize someone or think they’re monolithic when you actually get to know them.”

“We speak as average people, not as mosque officials,” he added. “So people get to know who regular people are who practice the faith.”

Crescent Peace Society Muslim and Jewish community members speak at a ""Meet a Muslim"" event at a synagogue in March.

Latif, a 36-year-old attorney who had attended the organization’s annual dinners when he was younger, became president of the group three years ago after “one of the aunties asked me to ― and I don’t like to say no to the aunties,” he said.

Latif usually kicks off the events with a short introduction about the group and Islam in general and then hands control back to the tables ― which each have at least one Muslim “moderator” ― to carry on their own, more intimate discussions.

The tables all have handouts to help guide conversation, with facts about Islam and Muslims in Kansas City and the U.S. After an hour or so, the Muslim moderators rotate to new tables. Latif said he makes a point of ensuring a diverse group of Muslims are present, with moderators including everyone from an Iraqi refugee to a Somali-American couple to an African-American recent convert, “so they can see we come in all different looks and ethnicities,” he said.

Table moderator Zehra Shabbir, who is Muslim and has been a member of Crescent Peace Society for four years, has attended several events. She was “surprised” both by the level of concern for and solidarity with Muslims she saw from non-Muslim attendees, as well as by some of the misconceptions people had about Islam, including everything from the veil to women’s rights.

“How can there be such a negative outlook on a group of people that nearly 60 percent of Americans have never even spoken to?” Shabbir told HuffPost by email. “That stat alone makes initiatives like this important. We all fear the unknown, but that fear can be broken once you sit down with someone different and just talk to them.”

Jennifer Bustos-Gomez This photo was shared to the Crescent Peace Society Facebook page in June by a community member who had attended an interfaith event. It included the comment: ""Gracious, warm hospitality accompanied by amazing cuisine. Thank you for giving us the chance to break bread together. This is exactly how real communities are built, made stronger. We were honored to be your guests.""

The Crescent Peace Society’s “Meet a Muslim” events are one of a handful of similar initiatives that have sprung up across the country since the election. One Muslim couple started a “dinner with your Muslim neighbor” project in Seattle, for instance, and a Muslim veteran has been traveling the country with a sign reading “I’m Muslim and a U.S. Marine, ask anything.”

When asked whether such projects place undue responsibility on Muslims to have to humanize themselves to non-Muslims, particularly in an environment of increased fear among the Muslim community, Latif demurred.

“There’s a lot of discussion in progressive circles on whose job it is to humanize people, and I understand it’s off-putting to explain, ‘I’m just a human being just like you are,’” he said. “But we’ve found in our work that waiting for other people to do the work doesn’t get anything done. You have to take that first step and hope that other people will join you.”

“If we don’t speak, then other people write the narratives for us,” he added.

Amid a recent rise in anti-Muslim hate groups nationwide ― and spate of hate crimes in recent years in the Kansas City area ― Latif recognizes the effect and reach of the group’s events are small. But even if they touch only a few hundred people, he believes they still have value.

“There are so few Muslims and so much said about them,” Latif said. “Even just meeting people who [already] support us, they can say to their extended families: ‘I’ve met a Muslim person and this is what I found out,’ so it’s a ripple that hopefully reverberates further out.”","In Face Of Islamophobia, This Group Hosts ‘Meet A Muslim’ Events In Kansas",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/meet-a-muslim-crescent-peace-society-kansas-city_us_5981d9dfe4b09d24e9944d8f?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009

Gunn posted a powerful note on Facebook, headlined “On Sexual Predators In Hollywood (and the World),” that highlighted the pervasiveness of sexual assault and harassment. The director starts the note by explaining he was discussing the allegations against Weinstein with female friends and was horrified by how casually the women spoke of abuse they’ve endured.

″And then another round of stories started, of these women being grabbed and molested and abused by bosses and managers and agents,” Gunn said. “And then another round started: endless incidents of these women being subject to the unsolicited sexual advances of men, ranging from your every day entitled Hollywood scumbucket douchebag to attempted rape.”

Gunn criticized “everyone who enabled [Weinstein] to get away with such behavior.”

The 65-year-old Weinstein was fired from his own production company on Sunday night, but many have criticized the board of The Weinstein Company for not acting sooner amid years of rumors about his behavior. The New York Times set off the furor with a story last Thursday that detailed numerous allegations of sexual harassment by Weinstein spanning decades. The article said Weinstein had agreed to at least eight private settlements with women.

A former New York Times reporter, Sharon Waxman, claims that while working for the paper in 2004, she tracked down evidence of Weinstein’s misconduct. But, Waxman said, pressure from the influential filmmaker and actors Matt Damon and Russell Crowe resulted in her story being “gutted.”

Gunn, in his post, said that while Hollywood was “rife” with sexual predators, it’s widespread “EVERYWHERE.”

“When someone is coerced sexually it not only affects that person, but the lives of those around that person, like rows of dominoes falling in every direction,” Gunn said. “It demolishes trust and comfort in all of society.

Konzernchef Spohr spricht von einem großen Tag

Offen ist, ob Easyjet den Rest bekommt

Die Lufthansa übernimmt große Teile der insolventen Fluggesellschaft Air Berlin. Beide Unternehmen unterzeichnen am Donnerstag einen entsprechenden Kaufvertrag, wie Lufthansa-Chef Carsten Spohr am Donnerstag in Berlin ankündigte. Für 12.00 Uhr sei der Notartermin geplant. ""In der Tat ist das heute ein großer Tag, den wir in ein paar Stunden mit der Unterschrift besiegeln"", sagte Spohr.

Air Berlin - die nach Lufthansa bisher zweitgrößte deutsche Fluglinie - hatte Mitte August Insolvenz angemeldet. Der Flugbetrieb seitdem war nur durch einen Kredit des Bundes über 150 Millionen Euro gesichert.

Die Geschäftsführung hatte drei Wochen lang exklusiv mit dem deutschen Marktführer Lufthansa sowie mit dem britischen Billigflieger Easyjet über den Verkauf von Teilen des hoch verschuldeten Unternehmens verhandelt. Fraglich war zuletzt, ob auch eine Einigung mit Easyjet gelingt.

Gestrandeten Passagieren soll geholfen werden

Spohr hatte der ""Rheinischen Post"" gesagt, Lufthansa werde von Air Berlin ""voraussichtlich 81 Flugzeuge übernehmen, 3000 Mitarbeiter einstellen und dafür in Summe 1,5 Milliarden Euro investieren"". Er bekräftigte damit Pläne des Unternehmens.

Aus Sicht Spohrs wird das Aus für Air Berlin und andere Anbieter die Ticketpreise nicht nach oben treiben. ""Denn der Wettbewerb wird sich in Europa und auch weltweit verschärfen"", sagte er der Zeitung. ""Wir gehen von weiter sinkenden Preisen aus.""

Im Konzern werde man sich mit der Tochter Eurowings selbst Konkurrenz machen. ""Da wo es bisher nur Lufthansa und Air Berlin gab, wie beispielsweise zwischen München und Köln, kommen nun Eurowings-Flüge als Ersatz für Air Berlin hinzu.""

Spohr kündigte zugleich ein Angebot an, ""um im Ausland gestrandeten Passagieren der Air Berlin die Heimreise zu einem fairen Preis anzubieten, sofern wir die Kapazitäten dafür haben"". Aus Lufthansa-Kreisen hieß es dazu, es sei schwer zu schätzen, um wie viele Passagiere es dabei gehe.

Was die Kamera aufgezeichnet hat, seht ihr oben im Video

Was eine Überwachungskamera nachts in einer Schule aufgenommen hat, erinnert auf den ersten Blick an einen Horrorfilm. Die Aufnahmen stammen aus der Deerpark Christian Brothers School im irischen Cork. In dem Überwachungsvideo ist zu sehen, wie eine Tür plötzlich zuknallt.

Dann fängt einer der Spinde an, sich zu bewegen und wackelt wild hin und her

Bei einem anderen Spind springt die Tür auf und Blätter fliegen heraus. Zuletzt fällt wie von Geisterhand noch ein Warnschild um.

Seiner Meinung nach sei die Schule ein gruseliger Ort. Einige Schüler berichten, dass Gegenstände verschwinden würden und sie angeblich ab und zu komische Geräusche hören würden. Dass es in der Schule jedoch tatsächlich spukt, darf angezweifelt werden. Viel wahrscheinlicher ist, dass sich ein paar Schüler einige Scherze erlaubt haben.

Das gilt auch für das Überwachungsvideo. Entweder handelt es sich hier um einen gut inszenierten Scherz oder jemand, der sich gut mit Spezialeffekten auskennt, hat seiner Kreativität freien Lauf gelassen.

En una época en la que chavitas de 24 años se autonombran directoras generales de sus propias empresas (conformadas únicamente por ellas, cabe mencionar), no pude evitar preguntarme porque yo, a mis 20 y 16, nomás no me creo CEO... ¡ni de mi propia vida! #sufrocomoprecious

No sé si vivas en la CDMX o no, pero las últimas semanas han sido realmente atípicas, por no decir caóticas. Por mi parte, después del temblor estuve tres días enclaustrada en San Juan del Río con la empresa donde trabajo, tratando de descifrar, entender y resolver el futuro de la industria editorial (digo ""enclaustrada"" pero la verdad es que la pasé muy bien y sí me dio tiempo de ir a correr un día).

Al regresar del mencionado kickoff estuve en la Riviera Maya durante cuatro días. El viernes sí fui a la oficina, pero de eso que nada más lees mails... y típico que lees tres y llegan cinco, ¿así cómo? Pero bueno. De lunes a miércoles, misma historia; súmale que todavía no agarraba bien el rollo de la nueva rutina –de cuando llega un jefe nuevo– ¡cuando me volví a ir!, esta vez a Culiacán a recoger un premio, del cual te contaré en otro post. La cosa es que no estás tú para saberlo, pero yo sí para contarlo: me siento fuera de control.

Eso de vivir el día a día esperando ""que la vida me sorprenda"" ha estado 'cool', pero hasta cierto punto.

No solo porque me súper enamoré de un niño que me hace sentir como el emoticón de los ojitos de corazón 😍, sino porque mi productividad –desde antes de que temblara– se fue a pique. Yo le echo la culpa al síndrome del burnout y al hecho de que durante dos meses fui exprimida cual naranja, hasta que quedé exhausta, sin energía, creatividad, sentido del humor, alegría ni esperanza. Bueno, exageré, pero sí me sentía drenada. Cansada de estar cansada y harta. Bien bonito #not.

Por eso platicar con la coach Jessica Vázquez sobre cómo volverme la CEO de mi vida me entusiasmó. Porque pienso que, fuera de la salud, no hay nada más feo que sentir que la vida te vive, que las riendas de tu vida las llevaría mejor un caballo de carreras desbocado y sin jinete, en fin, entiendes mi punto.

Eso de vivir el día a día esperando ""que la vida me sorprenda"" ha estado cool, pero hasta cierto punto. Como dice mi novio (sí, la verdad sí me creo mucho jijiji): me urge un sistema que me garantice el éxito no solo a nivel profesional, sino personal. Está bien ser espontánea y flexible y cuanto adjetivo en tendencia me quiera adjudicar, peeeeero también se tiene uno que trazar metas y objetivos, y trabajar cada día para avanzar hacia ellas aunque sea un poquito.

Sin el afán de balconearme, lo que me dijo Jessica fue que el Board of Directors (consejo directivo) de mi empresa –o sea yo– tiene que estar conformado por:

· La mente: la voz chinga-quedito de la razón y el juicio

· El corazón: las emociones, mensajeras con sugerencias e indicaciones

· El cuerpo: las sensaciones físicas que también se manifiestan

· El espíritu: la parte más sabia y serena (y olvidada la mayoría del tiempo)

Ojo: todos los integrantes son igualmente importantes y deben trabajar en perfecto equilibrio. Yo, honestamente, tiendo a ser súper emocional y de repente se me sube lo kabbalista.

Una vez trazado el plan de acción (clarividencia previa requerida), hay que empezar a usar un score card. Traducción: hay que llevar un registro de acciones concretas, comportamientos observables, súper específicos, que nos llevan al punto donde queremos estar. Porque no es lo mismo decir ""sigo llegando tarde"", a reconocer que antes eran 60 minutos de retraso y ahora son 15. La motivación –y respectiva celebración– son distintas. Quizá siga siendo impuntual, pero hay mejoría y eso también cuenta. La objetividad es básica #niNOaldrama.

De acuerdo con Jess, vivir la vida con soberanía que todos soñamos es posible si tenemos 3 simples cosas: 1) curiosidad, 2) amabilidad y 3) coraje.

Un último tip para el proceso de introspección: lanza al aire una pregunta que te quite la paz, respira profundamente (inhala y exhala al menos 10 veces) y empieza el juego del por qué / para qué . Ejemplo: Quiero una carga de trabajo más balanceada. ¿Para qué? Para rendir más y hacer las cosas con más cuidado. ¿Para qué? Para sentirme orgullosa de mi trabajo y en paz con mi jefe. ¿Para qué? (...)

Luego de responder dos o tres veces, empezarás a conectarte con tu verdadero Ser, ese que te dará las Verdaderas Respuestas que no tienen nada que ver con juicios, expectativas y carencias, sino con certeza, amor y abundancia.

¡Suerte a los valientes!

Η Angelina Jolie μίλησε μέσω email με τους The New York Times και ανέφερε ότι κατά την δεκαετία του '90 ο Weinstein τις είχε κάνει ορισμένες «προτάσεις» που η ίδια είχε αρνηθεί.

«Είχα μία κακή εμπειρία με τον Harvey Weinstein όταν ήμουν νέα, και ως αποτέλεσμα επέλεξα να μην δουλέψω ξανά μαζί του και να προειδοποιώ άλλους όταν το έκαναν. Αυτή η συμπεριφορά απέναντι στις γυναίκες, σε οποιοδήποτε τομέα, οποιαδήποτε χώρα, είναι απαράδεκτη.»

Την εμπειρία της μοιράστηκε και η Gwyneth Paltrow, η οποία ανέφερε ότι την κάλεσε ο ίδιος στη σουίτα του για μίτινγκ, λίγο αφού ο παραγωγός την προσέλαβε για τον πρωταγωνιστικό ρόλο στην ταινία «Emma», σε ηλικία 22 ετών.

Η Paltrow ισχυρίζεται ότι ο Weinstein, έβαλε τα χέρια του πάνω της προσπαθώντας να της κάνει μασάζ και την προσκάλεσε στο υπνοδωμάτιό του. Η Paltrow έφυγε αμέσως και είπε για το περιστατικό στον τότε σύντροφό της, Brad Pitt, ο οποίος σε μία πρεμιέρα πήγε στον γνωστό παραγωγό και του είπε να «μην ακουμπήσει την Paltrow ξανά». Ο Weinstein έγινε έξαλλος και για πολύ καιρό της φώναζε.

Η Rosanna Arquette, δήλωσε με τη σειρά της ότι μία φορά ο Weinstein της είχε ζητήσει να περάσει από το Beverly Hills Hotel για να πάρει το σενάριο και στη συνέχεια να ανέβει στο δωμάτιό της, όπου εκείνος της υποδέχτηκε με τη ρόμπα και παραπονέθηκε ότι πονάει ο αυχένας του, ζητώντας της να του κάνει μασέζ. Η Arquette προσπάθησε να του συστήσει μία επαγγελματία μασέρ, αλλά εκείνος άρπαξε το χέρι της και το πήγε κοντά στον καβάλο του. Η Arquette του είπε ότι δεν είναι «αυτό το κορίτσι» και έφυγε από το δωμάτιο.

Η Heather Graham δήλωσε ότι ο Weinstein την είχε καλέσει στο γραφείο του και της είχε προτείνει να κάνουν σεξ σε αντάλλαγμα για έναν ρόλο σε μία από τις ταινίες του.

Ακόμα και γυναίκες που δεν έχουν βιώσει σεξουαλική παρενόχληση από τον Weinstein, έχουν μιλήσει ανοιχτά για την υπόθεση.

Η Cate Blanchett που έχει συνεργαστεί με τον Weinstein δήλωσε:

«Κάθε άντρας σε θέση εξουσίας που νομίζει ότι είναι δικαίωμά του να απειλεί, εκφοβίζει ή να παρενοχλεί σεξουαλικά οποιαδήποτε γυναίκα που συναντά ή συνεργάζεται μαζί της, πρέπει να γίνεται υπόλογος. Δεν είναι ποτέ εύκολο για μία γυναίκα να βγαίνει μπροστά σε τέτοιες καταστάσεις και μέσα από την καρδιά μου υποστηρίζω εκείνες που το έχουν κάνει.»

Η Lena Dunham ζήτησε και από τους άντρες του Χόλιγουντ να μιλήσουν ανοιχτά:

«Είμαστε εδώ, μέρες αργότερα, περιμένοντας από του πιο ισχυρούς συνεργάτες του Weinstein να πουν κάτι. Οτιδήποτε. Δεν θα ήταν μόνο δώρο στις γυναίκες που έχουν πέσει θύματα,, αλλά και ένα μήνυμα σε όλες τις γυναίκες που βλέπουν από κοντά την βιομηχανία. Χρειάζονται ένα σημάδι ότι δεν εγκρίνουμε την κατάχρηση εξουσίας και το μίσος προς τις γυναίκες, που είναι η κινητήριος δύναμη πίσω από τέτοιου είδους συμπεριφορά».

Να σημειωθεί ότι ο George Clooney, έχει ήδη τοποθετηθεί σχετικά με το θέμα στο The Daily Beast.

«Δεν υπάρχει τίποτε να πει κανείς, πέρα από το ότι μπορεί να το υπερασπιστεί.»

Παραφωνία σε όλα τα παραπάνω σχόλια αποτελεί η δήλωση που έκανε η καλή φίλη του Weinstein, Donna Karan, και η οποία άφησε να εννοηθεί ότι μπορεί να έφταιγαν και οι ίδιες οι γυναίκες που «πήγαιναν γυρεύοντας».

The cake represents a growing appetite for spot-squeezing content. A dermatologist called Dr Pimple Popper (aka Sandra Lee) has 2.5 million followers who tune in to watch her squeeze spots, blackheads and drain cysts on a daily basis.

People are divided by the edible creation. John Legere tweeted a photo of the cake and added: “There are just some things we don’t need in life...”

Tony Pizza (who clearly loves a good pun) tweeted: “A pus of this cake will please anyone who eats zit.”

Ο όμιλος China Evergrande του 59χρονου Σου έχει αξία 43 δισεκ. δολαρίων, αν και το συνολικό του χρέος ξεπερνά τα 100 δισεκ. δολάρια. Χάρη στην αύξηση της αξίας των ακινήτων, ο πλούτος του Σου αυξήθηκε κατά 30 δισεκ. δολάρια τον τελευταίο χρόνο και ο ίδιος βρέθηκε στην κορυφή της κατάταξης των πλουσίων που συντάσσει κάθε χρόνο η Hurun Report και που δόθηκε σήμερα στη δημοσιότητα. Η Evergrande, της οποίας οι μετοχές έχουν ενισχυθεί κατά 480% φέτος, τώρα κατατάσσεται ως η τρίτη μεγαλύτερη στη χώρα ανάπτυξης ακινήτων βάσει πωλήσεων.

Ο Σου έχει σημαίνοντα ρόλο και εντός του κυβερνώντος Κομμουνιστικού Κόμματος. Ο ίδιος είναι μέλος του Κινεζικού Λαϊκού Συμβουλευτικού Συνεδρίου, του ανώτατου συμβουλευτικού οργάνου. Και το Κρατικό Συμβούλιο, το υπουργικό συμβούλιο της χώρας, του απένειμε τον τίτλο «Εθνικό Πρότυπο Εργαζομένου» - μια από τις υψηλότερες τιμητικές διακρίσεις για τους πολίτες στην Κίνα.

Ο Σου αποφοίτησε από το Wuhan University of Science and Technology το 1982 και του απονεμήθηκε τιμητικός διδακτορικός τίτλος στο εμπόριο από το University of West Alabama το 2008.

Ίδρυσε την Evergrande το 1996, την οποία εισήγαγε στο χρηματιστήριο του Χονγκ Κονγκ το 2009 με την αρχική δημόσια προσφορά της να συγκεντρώνει περίπου 6 δισεκ. δολάρια Χονγκ Κονγκ (767 εκατ. δολάρια). Η εταιρία έχει χτίσει χιλιάδες σπίτια για τη μεσαία τάξη στην Κίνα ενώ το 2010 βρέθηκε στο επίκεντρο της δημοσιότητας όταν αγόρασε την ποδοσφαιρική ομάδα της Γκουανγκτζόου έναντι 100 εκατ. γιουάν (15 εκατ. δολαρίων).

Bis 2030 sollten 15 Prozent aller Neuwagen mit einem Elektromotor oder anderen emissionsfreien Antrieb ausgestattet sein

Die EU-Kommission plant nach einem Bericht der ""Frankfurter Allgemeinen Zeitung"" eine Quote für Elektrofahrzeuge.

Bis 2030 sollten 15 Prozent aller Neuwagen in Europa mit einem Elektromotor oder anderen emissionsfreien Antrieben ausgestattet sein, berichtet die Zeitung. EU-Energiekommissar Maros Sefcovic bestätigte dies am Mittwoch aber noch nicht. Erst in November werde man ""ehrgeizige Vorschläge"" vorlegen.

Man prüfe mehrere Optionen, sagte Sefcovic auf die Frage nach einer Quote oder anderen Mitteln zur Förderung der Elektromobilität.

""Wir wollen das richtig machen""

""Wir wollen saubere Fahrzeuge - Fahrzeuge ohne Emissionen - voranbringen"", betonte er. Die Industrie rufe nach flexiblen Lösungen. Erwogen werde unter anderem ein System, bei dem Hersteller Pluspunkte für Fahrzeuge mit wenig oder gar keinen Emissionen auf den Markt bringen. Noch prüfe man mögliche Auswirkungen.

""Wir wollen das richtig machen."" Er sagte aber auch, Studien gingen von einem Anteil von 25 Prozent Elektrofahrzeugen bereits 2025 aus.

Klares Signal an den Markt

Die ""FAZ"" berichtete, zu den für November angekündigten Plänen zähle die E-Quote. Dies solle ein klares Signal an den Markt werden.

Die Quote solle für jeden einzelnen Hersteller gelten. Unabhängig davon sollten Hersteller verpflichtet werden, den CO2-Ausstoß ihrer Neuwagen zwischen 2021 und 2030 um ein Drittel zu verringern.

Momentan gilt für die Vorgabe, den CO2-Ausstoß bis 2021 im Durchschnitt auf 95 Gramm je Kilometer zu senken.

Am Sonntag wird in Niedersachsen gewählt

CDU-Spitzenkandidat Peter Althusmann will den SPD-Ministerpräsidenten Stephan Weil schlagen

Um nahbar zu wirken, hat er nun der ""Bunte"" ein Interview gegeben - ein Fehler, der schon mal einen Politiker eine Wahl gekostet hat

Bernd Althusmann tanzt, er wippt, er schnippt mit den Fingern. Gezwungen wirkt das, richtiggehend unangenehm sogar.

Es ist Althusmanns persönlicher Wahlsong, zu dem er da rhythmisch die Hüfte anwinkelt: ""Wir haben was Großes vor"". Die CDU Niedersachsen hat dazu ein Video auf Youtube hochgeladen, voller nichtsaussagender Hochglanzaufnahmen von lachenden Menschen und Textzeilen wie: ""Wir müssen den Weg gehen, wir müssen es wagen.""

Zu Politikstil und Inhalten von Bernd Althusmann liefert das Video keine Erkenntnisse. Doch dem CDU-Politiker scheint es eh mehr um das Tanzen zu gehen. Diesen Eindruck vermittelt Althusmann zumindest in einem aktuellen Interview mit der Illustrieren ""Bunte"".

Darin offenbart er intime und private Momente aus seinem Familienleben. Politikinteressierten sollte das wie ein Déja-Vu vorkommen.

Althusmann: ""Ich möchte durch mein Leben tanzen""

So berichtet der CDU-Spitzenkandidat etwa, wie er sich nach öffentlichen Terminen gerne entspannt.

Natürlich zuhause mit seiner Frau - aber nicht einfach so. ""Manchmal fangen wir auch an, im Wohnzimmer zu tanzen – nur wir zwei"", sagt Althusmann. ""Ihr Lebensmotto lautet: Ich möchte durch mein Leben tanzen. Das ist auch meines geworden.""

Deswegen tanze er auch in seinem Wahlkampfvideo, sagt Althusmann zu ""Bunte"": ""Leichtigkeit und gute Laune tun gut."" Wie sein Tanzen seinem Bundesland Niedersachsen konkret helfen soll, lässt Althusmann offen.

Dafür erzählt er von seinem Spitznamen ""Panzer"", einer Schlange, die am Elektrozaun seines Hauses in Namibia ""verkohlt"" sei. Und von seiner Familie.

Althusmann ist zum zweiten Mal verheiratet, insgesamt hat er fünf Kinder - drei leibliche und zwei Stiefkinder, erfährt der ""Bunte""-Leser. Durchaus kritisch sehe der CDU-Kandidat dieses Patchwork-Leben, schreibt die Illustrierte. ""Zwei Familien zu haben ist auf jeden Fall verdammt anstrengend"", klagt Althusmann.

Und imitiert damit einen Fehltritt, der in Schleswig-Holstein dem SPD-Spitzenkandidaten Torsten Albig die Chance auf das Amt des Ministerpräsidenten kostete.

Althusmann: ""Es kann plötzlich zu Ende sein""

Auch Albig hatte der ""Bunte"" ein Interview gegeben, auch er hatte über sein Familienleben gesprochen - und auch er hatte sich über seine geschiedene Ehe ausgelassen. Seine Frau sei nicht mehr mit ihm auf Augenhöhe gewesen, hatte Albig der ""Bunte"" berichtet. Es sei stets unterwegs gewesen, während sie als Mutter im Haushalt gearbeitet habe.

Albig erntete für diese Aussagen heftige Kritik, kurz darauf verlor er die Landtagswahl. Althusmann riskiert mit seinem ""Bunte""-Interview einen ähnlichen Gang der Ereignisse.

Doch der CDU-Politiker wurde darauf offensichtlich gut vorbereitet.

Immer wieder betont er im Interview, welchen Respekt er vor seine Ex-Frau hätte - überhaupt vor Frauen, die als Mütter und Hausfrauen wichtige Dienste für die Gesellschaft leisten würden. An einer Stelle sagt Althusmann wie in Reaktion auf Albigs Aussage über seine erste Ehe: ""Der Respekt ging nie verloren, sie war immer auf Augenhöhe mit mir.""

Dennoch: Mit seinem ""Bunte""-Interview hat sich der CDU-Spitzenkandidat wohl keinen Gefallen getan.

In Niedersachsen liegt er derzeit in den Umfragen knapp hinter seinem Konkurrenten Weil. Kleinigkeiten werden also über die Wahl entscheiden - auch der Eindruck eines hüftsteif durch sein Wohnzimmer tanzenden Ministerpräsidenten kann Wähler vergraulen.

Althusmann gibt sich in der ""Bunte"" jedoch gelassen: ""Wer in die Politik geht, muss wissen, dass es plötzlich zu Ende sein kann."" Immerhin: Zum Tanzen wäre dann wieder mehr Zeit.

Its ""two checked bags at no extra charge"" and ""no ticket-change penalty"" policies make Southwest a clear winner for being nice to customers. Fortunately, at least so far, Southwest seems to have convinced Wall Street that those passenger-friendly policies gain more revenue in total customers than it would gain by imposing fees and losing customers. With other giant carriers charging checked bag fees of $25 a pop, even one checked bag gives Southwest a $50 round-trip fare advantage. Southwest has even managed to tame the chaos of its unique no-advance-assignment boarding process: You get your boarding group and number when you check in, which you can do online starting 24 hours before departure; at the airport, you line up according to number, and get on the plane with a minimum of pushing and shoving.

At least for now, Alaska Airlines' Mileage Plan seems more generous than the big-line programs that are moving toward dollar-based earnings and rewards. You still get one mile for every mile flown, and the award chart mileage requirements are less than the effective requirements on the giant airlines. Alaska still has useful partnerships with Air France/KLM, American, British Airways, Delta, Korean, Qantas, and a few others. We don't know how long Alaska will retain its current system, but it's a winner as long as today's rules remain. If you accumulate miles or points through a credit card that allows transfers, such as American Express, the award chart for Air Canada's Aeroplan is more generous than current big lines' plans. But you get only partial mileage credit when you fly on Air Canada's lowest fares. Related: 6 Ways to Get the Best Coach Seat Every Time (Photo: Alaska Airlines)

Yes, JetBlue beats it by the measurements, but Virgin America keeps earning great survey ratings for its flashy decor, well-trained flight attendants, top inflight technology, and general flair. Obviously, lots of travelers like what it has to offer. You might like it, too. The ""Branson cool factor"" also applies to Virgin Atlantic and Virgin Australia. (Photo: Virgin America)

The nod for best ultra-low-fare carrier for coach-class service goes to Allegiant, not because of its base product—which is down there with Spirit in terms of sheer torture—but because it alone brings the only low-fare mainline service to dozens of communities where travelers would otherwise have to rely on regional flights to nearby hubs, with the usual hassle, wasted time, and high fares of hub connections. Allegiant's ""nowhere to somewhere"" business model gives travelers to/from communities as small as Hagerstown, Missoula, Owensboro, Provo, South Bend, and Stockton access to nonstop flights to 16 of the country's primary leisure travel destinations, including Honolulu, Las Vegas, Myrtle Beach, Orlando, and Phoenix. If you live in or near a big city, you'd never even think about Allegiant. But it's a no-brainer if you live in the sticks.

Southwest is the only airline to offer useful senior fares for travelers 65 or over. Senior fares aren't as low as Southwest's initial lowest ""Wanna Get Away"" fares for travelers of any age, but when those lowest-fare buckets sell out or when they're no longer available less than a week in advance, Southwest's unrestricted senior fares are usually a lot less than any remaining any-age fares. (Photo: Southwest Airlines)

JetBlue, which starts out with a 1- to 3-inch advantage for regular coach, retains a similar advantage for its extra-legroom cabin. And the price, capped at $90 for a transcontinental flight, is likely to be lower than the variable prices other airlines charge. This is a big advantage JetBlue has over Virgin America, the one airline that surveys usually place in the same class as JetBlue. On Virgin America, the extra-legroom seats, limited to bulkhead and exit rows, cost more than three times the regular-coach fare: more than $900 on a transcon, for example, compared with a base coach fare of $300. Yes, you get extras along with the legroom, but that huge fare premium is a deal breaker for someone who just wants enough space to use an e-reader or tablet comfortably.

Japan Airlines' new-design Sky Wider economy seats provide the roomiest international economy class you can currently find. Contrary to what most other airlines are doing, JAL is sticking with eight-across seats in its 787s and nine-across in its 777s. That's one fewer seat in each row than the current standard among most other lines, and the remaining seats are almost two inches wider than competitors' seats. The new cabins also offer an industry-leading 34-inch pitch, compared with the 30- to 32-inch pitch you find on most other intercontinental airlines. The onboard catering generally earns high marks, as well; economy travelers enjoy individual 10-inch screens, and the new 777s and 787s provide satellite-based Wi-Fi.

Norwegian flies 787s from a handful of U.S. cities to Scandinavia and from Los Angeles or New York to London/Gatwick. It recently started flying from Baltimore, Boston, and New York to Guadeloupe and Martinique. Fares are usually—although not always—lower than on the giant airlines, and its 787 product is on par with what the big competitors offer.

The giant airlines will charge you around $1,200 for a nonstop summer round-trip flight between New York and Paris in a cattle-car economy cabin. But two people paying $1,495 each can move up to an angle-flat business-class seat, with business-class cabin service, on La Compagnie, the niche French airline offering low-cost business-class service from Newark to London/Luton and Paris/DeGaulle. La Compagnie's current fare is almost $1,000 less than the premium economy fares on Open Skies or Air France. The price gap between regular economy and La Compagnie isn't always this small. But whenever it is, you sure feel better when you arrive in London or Paris after an overnight in business class than in economy. It's worth considering.

MUMBAI -- In a bizarre statement, Gulzar Azmi, the Secretary of Jamiat Ulama on Tuesday said that if everyone wants equality on the basis of gender, then why men and women don't carry pregnancy for four and half months each.

This statement from the cleric came days after Union Minority Affairs Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi proposed a Haj Policy that will allow women above 45 to travel in a group of at least four, without a male member.

While talking to ANI, the Jamiat Secretary said, ""The decision to allow Muslim women aged above 45 years to go on Haj alone is entirely illegal and is an intervention in Islam. It is clearly stated in Quran that a woman cannot go on Haj alone.""

""From the time this government has come to power, they tend to touch upon such issues that make Muslim anxious which makes the people of our religion believe that this government is against Muslims. The promises that were made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi have not been fulfilled yet, so to divert the attention they raise issues against Muslims,"" Azmi said.

Touting Islam as a religion which respects women the most, Jamiat Secretary said, ""I do not understand which religion respects women more than Islam.""

Questioning the issue of gender equality, Azmi said, ""If we talk about equality then there should be equality even in carrying a child in womb. Then a man should carry the baby for four and half months and the women for rest of the half time. Then only one can say that there is equality. First there should be equality in the birth process then other aspects of equality should be implemented in Islam.""

Azmi even warned the government regarding the consequences if they forcefully implement the decision to allow Muslim women aged above 45 years to go on Haj.

""Muslim clerics across the country have announced that the decision is illegal and we will never accept it. If the government forces us to accept this decision, then Muslims will have to hit the streets to protest against the government,"" he said.

Vor drei Jahren half ihr das FBI, der schrecklichen Situation zu entkommen

Jetzt will sie mit einem gemeinnützigen Projekt dafür sorge, dass andere Mädchen nicht Dasselbe durchmachen müssen

Vielen erschien Emmy Myers in der High School wie die Vorzeige-Schülerin schlechthin. Sie turnte, machte Leichtathletik und war in der Landwirtschafts-AG.

Doch ihr Leben nahm eine dunkle Wende - sie wurde drogensüchtig und Opfer von Sex-Handel.

Heute will die 28-Jährige aus Wisconsin andere Menschen darauf aufmerksam machen, dass dieses Schicksal jeden ereilen kann - und dass die Menschen, die Frauen und Mädchen kaufen, aus jeder sozialen Schicht kommen können.

""Das passiert nicht nur in Filmen, sondern auch normalen Menschen im echten Leben"", sagte Myers der HuffPost.

Menschenhandel nimmt in den USA stark zu. 2016 stiegen die Fälle im Vergleich zum Vorjahr laut der National Human Trafficking Hotline um 35,6 Prozent an.

Die Opfer werden gezwungen, körperliche Arbeit zu verrichten oder gegen ihren Willen mit Fremden Sex zu haben.

Armut und Arbeitslosigkeit helfen dem Menschen-Handel

Dass der Menschenhandel ansteigt, hat laut Experten mehrere Gründe. Jarrett Luckett, Geschäftsfüher der Organisation Exploit No More, sieht vor allem Armut und Drogenkonsum als Faktoren an.

Exploit No More unterstützt Menschen, die Opfer von Sex-Handel wurden. Luckett arbeitet gemeinsam mit Myers daran, über Sex-Handel in den Städten aufzuklären und auf die Gefahr aufmerksam zu machen.

""Armut und Drogen machen die Opfer anfälliger, in die Falle des Sex-Handels zu tappen"", sagte Luckett der HuffPost.

Diese beiden Probleme sind daran schuld, dass Myers Geburtsstadt Milwaukee zu einem Knotenpunkt für Menschenhandel geworden ist.

Milwaukee ist ein perfekter Ort für die Händler. Sie können ihre Opfer an viele größere Städte in der Nähe transportieren - etwa nach Chicago und Madison. Weit verbreiteter Heroinmissbrauch und die hohe Arbeitslosenrate in Milwaukee helfen den Händlern, ihre Opfer zu ködern.

Sex-Handel hat sich in Milwaukee so weit verbreitet, dass die Stadt auch ""Harvard der Zuhälter"" genannt wird.

Jeder kann zum Opfer werden

Myers Geschichte zeigt, dass Händler aber auch Erfolg haben können, wenn die Opfer aus einer guten Familie kommen. Sie wuchs als das aufgeweckte, fröhliche Kind auf, das sich alle Eltern wünschen.

In der Zeit zwischen ihrem dritten und sechsten Lebensjahr aber wurde sie von einem Freund der Familie mehrfach missbraucht. Einen Großteil ihrer Kindheit über machte sie sich Vorwürfe.

Myers wurde mehrfach verhaftet. Sie hat ein Strafregister, aber keine Einstufung als Schwerverbrecherin. (Foto: Emmy Myers)

Sie glaubte, sie sei selbst daran schuld, dass er sich immer wieder an ihr verging. Die Zweifel seien so stark geworden, dass sie angefangen habe, Drogen zu nehmen, sagt Myers. Und irgendwann sei sie einem manipulativen Menschenhändler in die Hände gefallen.

Ihre ersten Erfahrungen mit Drogen habe sie in der High School gemacht, erzählt sie. In ihrem letzten Jahr an der Schule wurde das Geld knapp und sie begann zu strippen, um ihre Sucht zu finanzieren. Nach der High School steig sie auf Heroin um und war zwei Mal in einer Entzugsklinik - das alles geschah, bevor sie 20 Jahre alt war.

Mit 24 versuchte sie erneut, clean zu werden und zog ausgerechnet mit ihrem gewalttätigen Drogendealer zusammen. Er wusste von ihrer Situation und bot ihr an, sie unter seine Obhut zu nehmen und sich um sie zu kümmern. Er stellte ihr eine Wohnung zur Verfügung und versorgte sie mit Kleidung und Essen.

Myers konnte sich nicht wehren

Dass er plante, sie für Sex zu verkaufen, ahnte sie nicht. Er erstellte eine Werbeanzeige auf Backpage.com, einer Seite, die Produkte und Dienstleistungen anbietet. (Dieses Jahr musste die Firma ihren Bereich für Erwachsenen-Werbung schließen, da sie wegen Unterstützung von Prostitution und Menschen-Handel unter Verdacht steht.)

""Ich hätte niemals gedacht, dass ich mich jemals verkaufen würde"", sagt Myers. ""Aber als ich an diesem Punkt angelangt war, gab es keine Ausweg mehr"", sagt Myers. ""Zuhälter wissen, was sie tun. Sie geben vor, dich zu lieben. Sie finden heraus, wie du tickst und wovor du am meisten Angst hast.""

Als Myers sich wehrte, drohte ihr der Dealer. Er sagte, wenn sie nicht einwillige, würde er ihre Neffen töten. Er konfiszierte ihren Personalausweis und nahm ihr das wenige Geld, das sie noch hatte.

Ihr Zuhälter und seine Freundin brachten Myers zu Hotels in verschiedenen Städten. Dort musste sie sich schon um 6.30 Uhr mit Männern treffen, bevor diese zu ihren Meetings gingen. Bis spät in die Nacht musste sie mit den Klienten Sex haben. Damit sie sich nicht wehren konnte, verabreichte der Dealer ihr permanent Drogen.

""Es sind häufig die Männer, die in ihrem Umfeld anerkannt sind""

Gewissermaßen hatte sie ""Glück"" - keiner der Männer, mit denen sie schlafen musste, war ihr gegenüber gewalttätig. Viele von ihnen waren erfolgreiche Geschäftsmänner. Viele von ihnen hatten Familie.

""Das überrascht viele Menschen am meisten"", sagt Myers. ""Es sind nicht immer die großen, fetten, ekligen Typen. Es sind häufig die Männer, die in ihrem Umfeld anerkannt sind.""

Einen Monat später wurde Myers in Milwaukee verhaftet - für eine Sache, die nichts mit Sex-Handel oder Prostitution zu tun hatte. Die Anzeige gegen sie machte das FBI auf sie aufmerksam. Die Ermittler boten an, ihr zu helfen und sie aus dieser Situation zu befreien.

2013 musste sie für etwa einen Monat ins Gefängnis und ging danach erneut in eine Entziehungsklinik - zum dritten Mal. Nachdem sie wieder draußen war, fiel sie erneut für kurze Zeit dem Sexhandel zum Opfer.

Heute will die 28-Jährige darauf aufmerksam machen, dass jeder Opfer von Sex-Handel werden kann. (Foto: Emmy Myers)

Ein halbes Jahr später war sie wieder im Gefängnis - dieses Mal für sieben Monate. In dieser Zeit durfte sie arbeiten gehen (Anm. d. Red.: In den USA gibt es Integrations-Programme für Insassen. Sie können an ihren Arbeitsplatz zurückkehren, werden aber streng überwacht. Nach ihrer Schicht müssen sie zurück ins Gefängnis.).

Nach dieser Zeit im Gefängnis zog Myers für zwei Monate in eine soziale Einrichtung für Gewaltopfer. Mit Hilfe eines Übergangsprogramms fand sie eine eigene Wohnung.

Die Aufklärung in den großen Städten ist wichtig

Heute hat Myers seit drei Jahren keine Drogen mehr genommen. Sie hat ein Strafregister, ist aber nicht als Schwerverbrecherin eingestuft - zu ihrem großen Glück.

Viele, die in Amerika Opfer von Sex-Handel geworden sind, haben Prostitutions-Vorwürfe in ihrem Register stehen - und das, obwohl sie dazu gezwungen wurden.

Sie haben keine Möglichkeiten, ihre Register löschen zu lassen. Das bedeutet: Für sie ist es beinahe unmöglich, eine Arbeit oder eine Wohnung zu finden.

Derzeit arbeitet Myers als Pflegerin in einem Altersheim. Zusätzlich engagiert sie sich für ihr gemeinnütziges Projekt, mit dem sie Fälle von Sex-Handel verhindern will.

Sie erzählt ihre Geschichte in Schulen, Kirchen und anderen Gemeindeeinrichtungen. Sie klärt Ärzte, Schüler, Studenten, Eltern und Ordnungsämter auf, spricht über die Realität des Sex-Handels und erklärt, wie man ein solches Schicksal verhindern kann.

Ärzten erklärt sie beispielsweise, dass sie auf blaue Flecken an sonderbaren Stellen achten sollen und dass mehrfache Fehlgeburten sie ebenso stutzig machen sollten wie Patienten, die nicht wissen, wie viele Geschlechtspartner sie hatten oder die nicht genau angeben können, wo sie wohnen.

Diese Aufklärung sei entscheidend, um den Sex-Handel aufzuhalten, bestätigt Luckett.

""Diese präventive Arbeit ist wichtig, damit andere Menschen nicht in 'dieses Leben' abrutschen - sie sollen nicht auch noch durch diese Hölle gehen"", sagt er. ""Es lässt sich nicht pauschal sagen, wie ein Menschen-Händler aussieht - oder wie ein Opfer aussieht. Das macht es besonders schwer. Aber es gibt Zeichen, die einen davor warnen.""

Für eine bestimmte Gruppe mit eingeschränktem Schutzstatus, subsidiär Geschützte, hatte die Große Koalition den Familiennachzug bis März 2018 ausgesetzt. Die CDU/CSU will ihnen auch über diesen Termin hinaus den Familiennachzug verbieten.

Immer wieder werden Flüchtlinge in Deutschland für hohe Vergewaltigungszahlen beschuldigt

Jüngst veröffentlichte Zahlen des bayerischen Innenministeriums befeuerten die Debatte

Nun zeigt eine aufwendige HuffPost-Recherche: Die Wirklichkeit sieht weit weniger dramatisch aus

Es muss ein schreckliches Martyrium gewesen sein: Mitten im Ortskern von Höhenkirchen-Siegertsbrunn bei München sollen zwei Flüchtlinge im September hintereinander ein 16-jähriges Mädchen vergewaltigt haben. In der Folge diskutierten viele Menschen in der Region über angeblich zunehmende Sex-Attacken durch Flüchtlinge - und nicht nur dort.

► Geschürt wurde die Angst durch Horrorzahlen, die vor der Wahl die Runde machten: Bayerns Innenministerium hatte gewarnt, die Zahl der Vergewaltigungen habe im Freistaat drastisch zugenommen.

► Und in der ZDF-Sendung „Klartext, Herr Schulz“ war in einer Zuschauerfrage sogar von einem Anstieg der Sexualdelikte von Flüchtlingen um 500 Prozent in nur vier Jahren die Rede.

Die Schlagzeilen verbreiteten sich rasch.

Dass die erste Meldung so nicht haltbar ist und die zweite nach Ansicht vieler Experten ebenfalls schlicht falsch ist, ging im Vorwahl-Getöse weitgehend unter. Das Bild vom Vergewaltiger-Flüchtling war im Kopf mancher Deutscher nicht mehr wegzubekommen – und dürfte wohl eine Ursache für den massiven Wahlerfolg der AfD sein.

Denn wer genauer schaut, was wirklich hinter den Zahlen steckt, merkt: Die Wirklichkeit sieht weit weniger dramatisch aus – für die Behauptung, dass durch die Zuwanderung die tatsächliche Zahl an Sexualstraftaten deutlich ansteigt, gibt es jedenfalls keinen Beweis.

► Die HuffPost hat überprüft: Nehmen die sexuellen Übergriffe in Deutschland tatsächlich zu – und wenn ja, geht das Plus auf Flüchtlinge zurück?

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Bayern diskutiert über Vergewaltigungen durch Zuwanderer - das sagen Experten dazu

Das Vergewaltigungs-Risiko stieg seit 2011 geringfügig an

Zwar ist die Zahl der bei der Polizei registrierten angezeigten Sexualstraftaten 2016 gestiegen – doch das heißt nicht zwangsläufig, dass auch die tatsächliche Zahl an Übergriffen zugenommen hat.

Ein Anstieg könnte Experten zufolge beispielsweise auch an einer erhöhten gesellschaftlichen Sensibilität für das Thema und einem damit einhergehenden veränderten Anzeigenverhalten liegen.

Eine sogenannte Dunkelfeldstudie des Kriminologischen Forschungsinstituts Niedersachsens (KFN) zeigt: Die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass eine Frau zwischen 16 und 40 Jahren in den letzten fünf Jahren Opfer sexueller Gewalt wurde, lag im Jahr 2011 bei 2,4 Prozent.

Derzeit liegt dieser Wert nach Erkenntnissen des Kriminologen Christian Pfeiffer bei etwa 2,6 Prozent. Zum Vergleich: 1992 war das Risiko mit 4,7 Prozent sogar fast doppelt so hoch wie heute.

In den repräsentativen Dunkelfeldstudien wurden Frauen nach ihren Erfahrungen gefragt – sie erfassen deshalb auch Delikte, die nicht angezeigt wurden.

Pfeiffer, der mit Kollegen derzeit der Frage nachgeht, ob Zuwanderer mehr Sexualdelikte begehen als Einheimische, betont: Anders als in Medien kolportiert, lasse sich nicht sagen, dass Flüchtlinge bei den Sexualverbrechen ""besonders schlimm auffallen"".

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Wie Medien über Flüchtlinge und sexuelle Gewalt berichten halte ich für unverantwortlich - es verhöhnt vergewaltigte Frauen

So denkt ein syrischer Flüchtling wirklich über Frauen

Sex-Attacken durch Flüchtlinge insbesondere in deren Unterkünften

Dennoch unterstellen rechte Hetzseiten Flüchtlingen massenhafte Vergewaltigungen. Der Begriff ""Rapefugee"", eine Mischung der englischen Worte für Flüchtling und Vergewaltiger, fand sogar Einzug bei Wikipedia.

Dabei halten sogar Kritiker der deutschen Flüchtlingspolitik, wie Rainer Wendt, Chef der Deutschen Polizeigewerkschaft (DPolG), die Darstellungen für übertrieben.

""Die Behauptung, dass Eingewanderte haufenweise Frauen vergewaltigen, ist einfach nur Unsinn"", erklärt Wendt. Zwar gebe es eine kleine Minderheit an Zugewanderten, die mit Sexualstraftaten auffällig werden. Das sei ""natürlich ein Problem"".

Doch die Opfer seien ""vor allem die Bewohnerinnen der Flüchtlingsheime"". Das sei nicht ""weniger schlimm"", aber die Gefahrenlage der einheimischen Bevölkerung steige eben - anders als mitunter behauptet - durch diese Fälle nicht an.

Das Risiko, Opfer einer Sexualstraftat zu werden, sei nirgendwo größer als in den Flüchtlingsunterkünften selbst, weiß auch Martin Rettenberger, Direktor der Kriminologischen Zentralstelle in Wiesbaden.

So hat allein die Berliner Polizei im vergangenen Jahr 71 Sexualdelikte von Zuwanderern gezählt, die in einem Wohnheim für Geflüchtete begangen wurden.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Flüchtlinge und sexuelle Übergriffe: Wo ist der Zusammenhang?

Anteil der angezeigten Flüchtlinge deutlich gestiegen – aber gab es tatsächlich mehr Übergriffe?

Fakt ist: Im Jahr 2015 registrierte die Polizei hierzulande laut Bundeskriminalamt 46.081 Straftaten gegen die sexuelle Selbstbestimmung – hierbei sind auch erfolglose Versuche erfasst. Im vergangenen Jahr waren es 47.401. Dies entspricht einem Plus von 2,9 Prozent.

Die Zahl der angezeigten Vergewaltigungen und sexuellen Nötigungen stieg sogar von rund 7000 um 12,8 Prozent auf rund 7900 im vergangenen Jahr – allerdings gab es mit 1132 erfassten Fällen geringfügig weniger gemeldete ""überfallartige Vergewaltigungen"" als noch 2015.

Über 37.400 Sexualdelikte, also mehr als vier Fünftel, wurden im vergangenen Jahr von der Polizei aufgeklärt. In 3404 dieser Straftaten wurde laut BKA mindestens ein Zuwanderer als Tatverdächtiger ermittelt – das sind 9,1 Prozent aller Verdächtigen und damit doppelt so viele als noch 2015.

Im Jahr 2012 war nicht einmal jeder zwanzigste Verdächtige ein Zuwanderer (1,8 Prozent). Als Zuwanderer definiert das BKA Asylbewerber, Geduldete, Bürgerkriegsflüchtlinge oder illegal in Deutschland lebende Migranten. Ihre Zahl nahm seit 2014 rasant zu. Alleine schon deshalb spielen sie in der Kriminalitätsstatistik eine zunehmend größere Rolle.

Bei den angezeigten Fällen von Vergewaltigung und schwerer sexueller Nötigung war in mehr als jedem siebten Fall (14,9 Prozent) ein Zuwanderer der Tatverdächtige – damit sind sie bei diesen Delikten im Vergleich zur Durchschnittsbevölkerung stark überrepräsentiert.

Bei den Tatverdächtigen für überfallartige Gruppen-Vergewaltigung, deren Zahl von 80 im Jahr 2015 auf 90 im vergangenen Jahr zulegte, machten Zuwanderer zuletzt sogar die Hälfte aller Verdächtigen aus.

""Verzerrte Statistik“ - Mehmet wird häufiger angezeigt als Max

Experten raten jedoch zur Vorsicht: Die BKA-Zahlen sagen nichts darüber aus, ob Flüchtlinge tatsächlich mehr Sexualstraftaten begehen.

Unklar bleibt etwa, ob ein Verdächtiger später auch verurteilt wurde, also seine Schuld zweifelsfrei erwiesen wurde. Die Zahlen sind Sicherheitsexperten zufolge stark abhängig von Ermittlungsschwerpunkten und Anzeigeverhalten. Sie sind keineswegs ein Abbild der tatsächlichen Kriminalität im Land.

""Nach den Silvester-Übergriffen von Köln ist die Sensibilität für Sexattacken gestiegen"", sagt Rettenberger. Er geht davon aus, ""dass seitdem Taten bei der Polizei angezeigt werden, die Frauen vorher gar nicht gemeldet hätten"".

Der Deliktanstieg könne demnach statt eines echten Zuwachses ""eine Verschiebung aus dem Dunkelfeld ins Licht der Öffentlichkeit sein"".

Für Pfeiffer, der viele Jahre Direktor des KFN war, ist jedenfalls klar: ""Man kann aufgrund der Polizeistatistik nicht einfach sagen, dass Flüchtlinge mehr Sexualdelikte begehen als Deutsche."" Es gebe ""viele Verzerrungsfaktoren"".

Der wohl Wichtigste: ""Fremde werden weit häufiger angezeigt als Einheimische"", betont Pfeiffer. Er verweist auf Studien des KFN: Wenn Max ein Sexualdelikt begehe, werde er von Anna zu 18 Prozent angezeigt – ist Mehmet der Täter liege die Wahrscheinlichkeit bei 44 Prozent, also gut zweieinhalbmal so hoch.

""Bei Flüchtlingen dürfte dieser Wert noch viel höher sein"", sagt er. In der Kriminalstatistik seien Zuwanderer alleine schon deshalb überrepräsentiert. Rettenberger geht ebenfalls davon aus, ""dass Flüchtlinge, weil sie Fremde sind, häufiger angezeigt werden"".

""Junge Männer sind überall auf der Welt krimineller""

Zudem sind besonders viele junge Männer als Flüchtlinge nach Deutschland gekommen. ""Und diese Altersgruppe ist auch unter den Deutschen – wie wohl in jedem anderen Land – für überproportional viele Straftaten verantwortlich"", erläutert Pfeiffer.

So stellte dem Kriminologie-Professor zufolge die Gruppe der 14- bis 30-Jährigen bundesweit im Jahr 2014 gerade einmal 9,3 Prozent der Bevölkerung. Sie war jedoch für mehr als jede zweite Gewaltstraftat (51 Prozent) verantwortlich. Demnach begingen junge Männer bereits vor der Flüchtlingskrise fünfmal so viele Gewaltdelikte wie der Durchschnitts-Bürger.

Bei Sexualdelikten seien die Zahlen ähnlich hoch, weiß der Forscher, der von 2000 bis 2003 für die SPD niedersächsischer Justizminister war.

Hier rächt sich offenbar der erschwerte Familiennachzug. ""Wer Frau und Kinder bei sich hat, begeht weniger Straftaten"", so Pfeiffer.

Zwar ist es Pfeiffer und Rettenberger zufolge ein Problem, dass viele Flüchtlinge aus Macho-Kulturen kämen. Doch klar ist den Experten zufolge auch: Die weit überwiegende Mehrheit der Menschen mit einem traditionellen oder gar mittelalterlichen Frauenbild wird nicht gewalttätig.

Pfeiffer gibt zu bedenken: Die große Zahl der Zuwanderer mit Bleibeperspektive wisse genau, dass jede Straftat ihre Chance, ""sich hier dauerhaft etwas aufzubauen, zerstören kann"". Dies vermindere bei vielen de Bereitschaft, Straftaten zu begehen.

Aus Sicht Rettenbergers machen auch die Lebensumstände manche Flüchtlinge zu Tätern. Denn vielen Asylsuchenden fehlen zunächst in den Erstaufnahme-Einrichtungen die soziale Integration, ein geregelter Tagesablauf und eine Arbeitsstelle. ""Unmut und Frustration sind die entscheidenden Quellen für Aggressivität und sexuelle Gewalt"", sagt der Kriminalpsychologe.

Die bayerische Mär von der massenhaften Zunahme an Vergewaltigungen

Ein Problem ist Experten zufolge die schlechte Kommunikation vieler Politiker, die glauben mit Zuspitzungen zur Flüchtlingskriminalität punkten zu können.

Selbst Polizeigewerkschafts-Chef Wendt sagt: ""Mit Kriminalstatistiken sollte man keinen Wahlkampf machen.""

So musste Landesinnenminister Joachim Herrmann die bayerische Vergewaltigungs-Statistik bereits kurz nach deren Vorstellung relativieren. Der CSU-Mann hatte behauptet, bayernweit habe im ersten Halbjahr mit 685 im Vergleich zum Vorjahr 48 Prozent mehr Vergewaltigungen gegeben.

Allerdings handelte es sich, wie das Ministerium später einräumen musste, um eine nicht einfach mit dem Vorjahr vergleichbare Zahl. Denn in der Statistik tauchen nach einer Gesetzesverschärfung seit diesem Jahr anders als noch 2016 nun auch sexuelle Nötigungen auf. Dies sowie ein verändertes Anzeigenverhalten sind nach Ansicht von Fachleuten wesentliche Ursachen für den Anstieg – doch bei der ersten Vorstellung der Zahlen war davon keine Rede.

Doch was kann der Staat gegen die vorhandenen Probleme unternehmen?

Pfeiffer empfiehlt, diejenigen Flüchtlinge, die wie etwa viele Nordafrikaner keine Bleibeperspektive haben, noch deutlich stärker als bislang mit freiwilligen Rückkehrprogrammen zur Ausreise zu bewegen. Wendt präferiert dagegen eine ""konsequente Abschiebung von Sexualstraftätern unter den Flüchtlingen"".

Diese schadeten ja auch den ""tatsächlich Verfolgten“, da das Misstrauen in der Bevölkerung sonst weiter zunehme. Klar ist aber auch: Bei manchen Bewohnern von Höhenkirchen-Siegertsbrunn wird es dauern, bis ihre Angst vergeht.

When audio emerged of Trump bragging about using his celebrity status to grope women, Biden tweeted that what he was talking about was sexual assault.","In the past year, more and more women have been coming forward to talk about how powerful men have used their high positions to sexually assault and harass them. What the accusations against President Donald Trump, former Fox News CEO Roger Ailes, former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly and movie producer Harvey Weinstein have shown is that this behavior is pervasive, and it is often covered up for years by people who know what’s going on.

In 1991, sexual harassment was not a thing people were talking about ― until Anita Hill, a reserved law professor, testified to the Senate on Oct. 11 about what Clarence Thomas had done to her when she had worked for him. Thomas was up for a spot on the Supreme Court, and he had the full force of the Republican Party standing behind him.

While women’s groups stood behind Hill, many men in the Senate ― at that time, there were only two female senators ― dragged her through the mud, questioning her credibility, whether she wanted it and wondering why she continued to work for Thomas if his behavior was really all that bad. Depressingly, those sorts of attacks are still pulled out when women today report sexual harassment.

Hill was also left out to dry by some Democrats who were supposed to be her allies. While they may not have gone after her in the way that the GOP senators did, they also showed extra deference to Thomas and left many women questioning whether they helped her as much as they could have. One of those men was Joe Biden, who was then chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.

But Hill’s testimony also electrified women in the United States, who for the first time saw someone publicly calling out what so many of them endured in the workplace. She sparked a political movement that led to an increase in the number of women serving in Congress.

“There are more people willing to come forward now. There’s obviously strength in numbers. We have to deal with this as a society. It’s a legal issue, but it’s also a social and cultural issue that we still haven’t figured out,” Hill wrote in an op-ed Tuesday, commenting on the Weinstein revelations. “Even as late as 1991, people didn’t talk about this kind of behavior to their closest relatives or spouses. Over the past 25 years, we’ve raised public consciousness that this is a reality of women’s experiences that occurs on multiple levels. It occurs in the workplace and the street, it occurs online and it occurs when women are looking to get jobs or looking to get promoted.”

Below is the story of what Hill faced and examinations about the role of Biden and other Democrats in Thomas’ confirmation to the Supreme Court. The story was first published on Jan. 12, 2017.

Joe Biden Is A Hero Among Women’s Rights Groups. But It Wasn’t Always That Way. Many women were upset at the way he managed the Anita Hill hearings in 1991.

WASHINGTON ― Joe Biden will leave a legacy of staunch advocacy for women’s rights when he steps down as vice president in a week. He was a leader in passing and renewing the 1994 Violence Against Women Act and has been the chief advocate of the Obama administration’s national campaign to combat sexual assault on college campuses.

Those achievements, among others, were no small reason he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom Thursday, the nation’s highest civilian honor.

Biden touted his role in elevating the seriousness and pervasiveness of sexual harassment in a September 2015 speech, noting that his work dated as far back as 1991: “During the Clarence Thomas hearings, one of the things that emerged was the issue of sexual harassment. ... It was the thing that no one wanted to touch. I remember saying to my colleagues, ’This is so much bigger than a single judge.’”

Advocates say Biden is now one of their strongest champions on issues of violence against women. But they remember a different, more complicated story of Thomas’ confirmation hearings, where Biden played a less heroic role. As the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee in October 1991, Biden was essentially the last line of defense in Thomas’ nomination to the Supreme Court.

When Anita Hill, a law professor and Thomas’ former employee, described how he had harassed her by pressuring her to date him and carrying on inappropriate sexual conversations, it was Biden who had the power to make sure her allegations received the consideration they deserved. They didn’t, and Thomas remains on the court today as one of its most conservative justices.

In the years since the hearings, there has been much debate over the way Biden handled them. Even those who applaud Biden’s more recent work for women’s rights regret that he didn’t fight harder to defend Hill against the GOP onslaught. In particular, there’s still resentment over the fact that other women who could have strengthened Hill’s credibility never testified.

“In some respects, I was deeply disappointed with his performance and with the performance of every member of that Judiciary Committee at the time,” said Marcia Greenberger, co-president of the National Women’s Law Center. “And in fact, I felt devastated by the whole process as it unfolded.”

An aide to the vice president pointed to Biden’s record on women’s rights over the years as what his legacy will be as he steps down.

“The VP has been a stalwart champion of women,” the aide said. “He is the author of one of the most important pieces of legislation aimed at helping survivors of gender-based violence: The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). He championed it from original drafting to enactment, and has been instrumental in its reauthorization ever since.”

But as his career in public office potentially draws to a close ― or at least enters a new phase ― Biden’s legacy may be best understood as an evolution, from the missteps of the Thomas hearings to his later accomplishments.

‘If That’s Sexual Harassment, Half The Senators On Capitol Hill Could Be Accused’

Even before Hill’s sexual harassment allegations became public, Thomas was a controversial choice to replace legal titan Thurgood Marshall, the first and only African-American to serve on the Supreme Court.

There were questions about Thomas’ fitness for the position and whether he truly was, as President George H.W. Bush called him, the “best qualified [nominee] at this time.” Thomas had worked in civil rights at the Department of Education for one year and then chaired the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for eight years before Bush nominated him for a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 1990. Bush named him to the highest court 16 months later, on July 1, 1991.

Women’s groups expressed concern about Thomas’ weak record on women’s issues and civil rights long before they knew the name Anita Hill. But on Sept. 28, the Senate Judiciary Committee went ahead and voted 7-7 to send Thomas’ nomination to the full Senate without an endorsement.

Behind the scenes, however, there was far more going on than the public realized. Hill had worked with Thomas for two years, at both the Department of Education and the EEOC. During that time, Hill said Thomas repeatedly tried to pressure her into dating him, talked about the pornography he enjoyed watching and made other sexually explicit comments (including an infamous joke about pubic hair on a can of Coke).

Hill initially planned to stay silent about her experiences, but she started to tell friends what Thomas had done to her after the White House announced his nomination, according to Jane Mayer and Jill Abramson, the authors of Strange Justice, the most in-depth look at the Thomas proceedings. Hill was not some diehard partisan who wanted to take down Thomas, but rather a reluctant witness who felt a duty to provide officials with information that might be helpful.

Word about a woman Thomas had harassed started to reach Senate aides. Eventually, it reached Biden, just days before the committee’s planned Sept. 28 vote.

According to Mayer and Abramson’s account, although Biden later said he recognized from the beginning that Hill’s accusations were “a giant incendiary bomb,” he didn’t act like they were. “[N]either he nor any other senator had spoken to Hill in an effort to draw an independent judgment about her credibility,” they wrote.

None of the Senate leaders ― including Democrat George Mitchell, the majority leader, and Republican Bob Dole, the minority leader ― saw any reason to delay the committee vote so there could be further investigation.

It wasn’t until after the vote, on Oct. 6, when the press got ahold of the story and publicly identified Hill, that the members of the all-white and all-male Senate Judiciary Committee in Washington truly seemed to realize what they had on their hands. And even then, many senators didn’t seem to know what to do ― or thought they couldn’t stop the nomination from moving forward. Mitchell had already scheduled a vote of the full Senate for Oct. 8 at 6 p.m.

“They were pretty far along in the process and their position, as I recall it, was that it was too late,” said Kim Gandy, who was a national officer with the National Organization for Women at the time. “It was disruptive to the process and they had passed that point already, which didn’t seem like a good reason to us.”

Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) may have summed up senators’ reaction to Hill’s allegations best when he reportedly declared, “If that’s sexual harassment, half the senators on Capitol Hill could be accused.”

There weren’t many women in Congress at that time ― just 29 in the House and two in the Senate ― but they were outraged that Mitchell refused to delay the vote on Thomas. They wanted Biden’s committee to reopen the hearings and allow Hill to testify.

“What disturbs me as much as the allegations themselves is that the Senate appears not to take the charge of sexual harassment seriously,” said Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.), who was then the only female Democratic senator.

On the day of the scheduled confirmation vote, a number of female House members took to the floor to deliver 60-second speeches in support of Hill. When Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) spoke out and demanded a delay on Thomas’ nomination, angry male congressmen said her words should be struck from the record and she should be censured for the day. Women across the country flooded the phone lines in the offices of Mikulski and Sen. Nancy Landon Kassebaum (R-Kan.), the only other female senator at the time, calling for a delay.

That same day, seven female House members marched across the Capitol and demanded to talk to Mitchell, who was then in his weekly caucus meeting. The women were barred from entering, until one of Mitchell’s aides eventually came out and told them he’d talk to them.

Rep. Louise Slaughter (D-N.Y.) was part of that historic moment, and told The Huffington Post that they also talked to Biden and demanded Hill be allowed to tell her story. That conversation didn’t go well, she said.

“He basically said we didn’t need to stay because she wasn’t going to speak,” said Slaughter. “No, it was not good. The whole thing was a bad scene.”

Under strong public pressure, Mitchell eventually convinced Republicans that without a delay, 10 Democratic senators who had previously said they would vote for Thomas would switch sides.

Biden was under pressure from Republicans as well ― primarily Sen. John Danforth (R-Mo.), Thomas’ chief sponsor. Biden initially wanted a two-week delay, but Danforth convinced him that fairness demanded the proceedings to move faster. Biden scheduled Hill’s testimony for Oct. 11, and agreed that the Judiciary Committee would not take another vote before sending Thomas to the full Senate on Oct. 15. He also said he would keep questions about Thomas’ general sexual conduct ― such as his interest in pornography ― out of the hearings.

“Joe bent over too far to accommodate the Republicans, who were going to get Thomas on the court come hell or high water,” Metzenbaum later told Mayer and Abramson.

Biden also handed a major victory to Republicans in agreeing to let Thomas testify both before and after Hill ― most crucially, scheduling his response to her allegations for 9 p.m. on a Friday, when millions of people were tuned in for their primetime broadcast.

In her 1997 memoir, Hill said she felt Biden betrayed her in doing so. She wrote that three days earlier, Biden had told her over the phone that she had the “option to testify whenever I wish … first and last.”

“What I did not know was that between the phone call and the eve of the hearings, he had given the same assurances to Judge Thomas,” she wrote. “Nor had anyone informed me how long Judge Thomas might testify or when I could expect to be called.”

Biden had originally planned to have Hill close out the hearings. But he gave in to pressure from Thomas’ handlers, who threatened the Supreme Court nominee would hold a press conference saying he had been denied the opportunity to defend himself.

“I must start off with a presumption of giving the person accused the benefit of the doubt,” Biden told The New York Times two days before Hill was set to testify. “I must seek the truth and I must ask straightforward and tough questions, and in my heart I know if that woman is telling the truth it will be almost unfair to her. On the other hand, if I don’t ask legitimate questions, then I am doing a great injustice to someone who might be totally innocent. It’s a horrible dilemma because you have two lives at stake here.”

The Other Witnesses

Biden’s most divisive and perhaps most significant decision was not calling the other three women who could have strengthened Hill’s allegations against Thomas to testify. While the women’s interviews with committee staff were entered into the record, that did not have the same impact as public testimony.

One of the women was Angela Wright, who worked with Thomas at the EEOC. She said Thomas asked her about the size of her breasts, pressured her to date him, commented on the physical appearance of women in the office and showed up at her apartment one night without warning. Unlike Hill, however, Wright said she considered Thomas’ behavior obnoxious but not sexual harassment.

Wright had complained of Thomas’ unwanted behavior toward Rose Jourdain, a colleague at the EEOC at the time. As Mayer and Abramson wrote in their account of the trial, Jourdain independently remembered the “bra size” incident and also recalled Wright telling her Thomas had talked about the sexiness of her legs.

Sukari Hardnett was the third woman. She worked for Thomas at the EEOC after Hill left but said Hill’s account of his behavior rang true.

“Clarence Thomas pretends that his only behavior toward those who worked as his special assistants was as a father to children and a mentor to proteges. That simply isn’t true. If you were young, black, female and reasonably attractive, you knew full well you were being inspected and auditioned as a female,” she said in her statement, adding, “Women know when there are sexual dimensions to the attention they are receiving. And there was never any doubt about that dimension in Clarence Thomas’s office.”

There have been several justifications offered for not having these women testify, with no senator willing to take the blame. Biden and his supporters have pointed the finger at the rest of the committee, Hill and her legal team, and Wright personally.

Biden has maintained that he was eager to hear from Wright, but the committee voted 13-1 against calling her; he was the lone supporter, he said. One of his top aides, however, told Mayer and Abramson that that wasn’t true ― Biden, like the other senators, simply wanted the hearings to be over. Metzenbaum later said he didn’t recall such a vote and didn’t “think Biden was anxious to bring Angela Wright on.” Former Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.), said he also didn’t remember any senators who wanted Wright to testify.

Biden and his top staffers have also said that Hill and her legal team opposed having Wright testify, because Wright did not consider Thomas’ behavior to be harassment.

“They believed that Anita Hill’s testimony was so strong standing on its own that no matter how good anyone else was, it would be diluted,” Biden said in a 1994 interview. “It would take away from it.”

But Charles Ogletree, a Harvard law professor who was part of Hill’s legal team, has strenuously denied this claim, calling it “absolutely, unequivocally, categorically, and positively false.”

Biden has also suggested that Wright didn’t want to testify. “[T]here’s a myth that’s grown up that we somehow denied her,” Biden recalled in a 2009 interview for Jules Witcover’s biography. “We had her in town to testify, we expected her to testify, we prepared her to testify; she chose not to testify. She had her own reasons. I don’t know exactly what they were. And people say, well, why didn’t you have her testify anyway? Well, that’s like calling a hostile witness in a case.”

Indeed, there is a letter from Biden to Wright dated Oct. 13, 1991, in which he stated it was his “preference” that she testify, but that by the “mutual agreement” of Wright and the members of the committee, she was released from the subpoena and her interviews would be put in the record instead. Wright signed the letter, acknowledging agreement with its content.

Gil Middlebrooks, Wright’s attorney, remembered a slightly more complicated version of events, as he told The Washington Post in 1994. It was true that Wright was a reluctant witness; she didn’t want to come forward, and repeatedly pointed out to Senate staffers that they had approached her, not the other way around. But Middlebrooks insisted that Wright was always willing to testify if the committee members truly wanted her to do so.

“These people didn’t want to hear from us,” Jourdain summed up to Mayer and Abramson. “Thomas’s supporters didn’t want another woman, especially one with some of the same looks, age, and brains, telling a similar story as Anita Hill. And then, on top of that, she’s got a credible backup witness. Nobody wanted to deal with this.”

Many Hill supporters also wanted testimony from an expert on sexual harassment, to lend expertise on the subject that was sorely lacking among the men on the committee. Biden said in a 1994 interview that he wanted this to happen, too.

“I wanted a panel on sexual harassment to come and testify, so we could put in context what we were talking about,” he said. “And it was decided by the Hill people that they didn’t want that panel to come on. Again, there was a feeling ― communicated to me secondhand ― that Anita Hill had won this thing. She had made her case. And I kept saying, ‘wrong, this ain’t over.’ I was very disappointed.”

Dr. Louise Fitzgerald, a psychologist and academic who had extensively studied sexual harassment, was reportedly ready to testify. Hill’s legal team said they conveyed her willingness to Senate staffers, but legislators never took them up on the offer. Fitzgerald did not return a request for comment for this story.

“I just don’t think [the hearing] was designed to really bring out the record,” said Susan Deller Ross, who was a member of Hill’s legal team. “The Republicans acted like prosecutors, and the Democrats acted sort of oblivious. So there was no one really ensuring that they actually investigated the issue in depth.”

While Biden saw himself as Hill’s ally ― albeit one in a tough spot ― she saw him as someone who ultimately let her down.

“There were three women who were ready and waiting and subpoenaed to be giving testimony about similar behavior that they had experienced or witnessed. He failed to call them,” she told HuffPost Live in an interview two years ago. “There also were experts who could have given real information as opposed to the misinformation that the Senate was giving ... and helped the public understand sexual harassment. He failed to call them.”

‘Flatfooted Judgment Calls’

Mayer and Abramson characterized Biden’s chairmanship of the hearings as made up of a number of “flatfooted judgment calls.” The Democrats on the committee, they wrote, “were in almost total disarray, especially compared with the well-organized Republicans.”

There were little moments, like not declaring Sen. Orrin Hatch’s (R-Utah) unsubstantiated speculation that Hill had made up her story based on the plot of “The Exorcist” and a 1988 court case in which a black woman alleged sexual harassment against her supervisor to be out of order. And then there were bigger issues, like having the three additional women testify and giving in to GOP demands on the timing of the hearings and testimony.

The main reason the hearings went the way they did seemed to be the committee’s desire to move on. But Republicans were also better-prepared. As Maureen Dowd wrote in The New York Times at the time, “The Democrats made a pass at figuring out what had happened in the case. The Republicans tried to win. While the Democrats were pronouncing themselves flummoxed by two diametrically opposed stories, the Republicans had already launched a scorched-earth strategy against Professor Hill.”

Republicans tapped Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) as their lead questioner, which Mayer and Abramson reported was a politically genius move on the part of Hatch and Danforth. Specter, a lawyer and former district attorney, had opposed Robert Bork, President Ronald Reagan’s failed 1987 Supreme Court nominee, and he reportedly didn’t think Thomas was all that qualified for the job. So they gave Specter a starring role in the proceedings, which he took up gladly.

“As soon as [Specter] saw himself as the star prosecutor, he couldn’t resist,” Biden told Mayer and Abramson. “They knew his personality better than he did.”

Hill, meanwhile, had no such advocate among the Democrats. She alone had to deal with accusations that she was an erotomaniac, as well as vindictive, delusional and a liar.

Democrats also seemed uneasy about going after Thomas too hard because they recognized there was a racial element at play. Thomas lacked the legal experience and accolades of previous Supreme Court nominees, but Democrats didn’t want to make the second black Supreme Court nominee in history seem unintelligent.

“The thing that got him approved was that the Democrats were scared to death,” Vince D’Anna, a member of Biden’s team during the Thomas confirmation battle, told Witcover. “They just wanted this thing to be over with ― ‘Let’s be done with it; let’s vote. Nothing good is going to come from it.’ There were no profiles in courage on that committee.”

Biden, too, has said he didn’t think Thomas would have been confirmed if he had been white, calling it “a cynical ploy by President Bush.”

“Thomas was the one in my view engaging in racism, and I not only mean racism in terms of playing the race card, but racism in trying to reinforce the stereotypical notion about black women,” Biden told Witcover. “That was the sin I don’t forgive the guy for, and those who were making his case.”

Hill declined an interview for this piece, but her thoughts on Biden were made abundantly clear in her 1997 memoir. On the first page of the first chapter, she described Biden as someone who “chooses his words carefully” and has a “rather remarkable smile ― a grin that spreads from ear to ear in an instant, disclosing perfectly straight teeth.” That isn’t meant as a compliment.

Hill recalled an Oct. 8 phone call in which Biden tried to convince her he was on her side: “The only mistake I made, in my view, is to not realize how much pressure you were under. I should have been more aware. … Aw kiddo, I feel for you. I wish I weren’t the chairman, I’d come be your lawyer,” she recalled him saying.

But Hill said she feels like she was left out to dry.

“Most evident from the televised Judiciary Committee hearings was the fact that I sat in that hearing room without a patron on the panel. That image still resonates,” she wrote in a 1995 essay. “My sin was not simply that I did not have a patron. Nor was it simply that I rejected patronage offered to me, since none was offered. My initial sin in the eyes of the senators was that I dared to come to the body on my own, that I did not actively pursue patronage at the outset.”

Thomas didn’t come away with a significantly better impression of Biden, believing that the chair had privately offered him his support only to eventually vote against his confirmation. After Thomas eventually won, Biden reportedly left a very gracious congratulatory message on Thomas’ answering machine, which was “greeted by a less than gracious response” from Thomas, according to Danforth’s book on the hearings.

Up until the end, Biden refused to go after Thomas’ character ― even after all he heard from Hill and what he knew of the other women’s experiences. Although he voted against Bush’s nominee in the final count, he said on the Senate floor, “For this senator, there is no question with respect to the nominee’s character.”

“I could have brought in the pornography stuff,” Biden said in a 1992 interview. “I could have decimated him with that. I could have raised ― and with more legitimacy than what [the Republicans] were doing ― but it would make a lie of everything I fought for. ... To go back and say because the guy was 20 years old and he watched pornography at Yale, that that means that there’s a nexis between that and whether or not he spoke of pornography 20 years later? It’s outrageous. But compelling.”

Twenty years earlier, Biden had lost his wife and infant daughter in a car accident just as he was about to enter the Senate. He was very private about the incident and almost never mentioned it, giving him an understanding about the fact that there are certain issues people just don’t want to discuss.

Mayer and Abramson also pointed to Biden’s more recent experience during the 1987 confirmation fight over Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork, when the press went after the Delaware senator for plagiarizing a British politician’s speech. Reporters dug into Biden’s past, unearthing an instance of plagiarism in law school and exaggerations of his academic record. Biden ended up dropping out of the 1988 presidential race over the issue, even though he had been considered a top contender in the Democratic primary. He had little appetite to give others that same treatment.

The Anita Hill Legacy

Biden seemed pleased with his performance in the Thomas nomination hearings in an interview with Mayer and Abramson for their 1994 book, noting that polls showed that as much as 86 percent of the country knew who he was, and a majority of people believed he had been “fair.”

“That’s a highly unusual exposure rate for a senator,” he said. “Most voters can’t name their own senator. But now everywhere I go, I get recognized.”

Since then, Biden has admitted the hearings weren’t perfect. But he’s never given a full apology, as many Hill supporters would like him to do.

In 1992, The Washington Post asked Biden whether Democrats should have been more aggressive.

“In my gut I regret it, in my intellect I don’t,” he said. “Because it would have made a lie of everything I say I believe.”

Hill said in an interview with Time last year that she believed the hearings made it harder to deal with sexual harassment because they “influenced how employers would react to sexual harassment, how universities would react to it, and we’re still trying to dig out from that.”

“The Senate, instead of reflecting the best practices that had been developed at that point, lapsed into combativeness,” she said. “The hearings showed people what happens when representatives don’t make a real attempt to get to the bottom of issues and to understand how sexual harassment works.”

One thing Biden said in his 2015 speech at Ohio State that was absolutely right was that the hearings ignited the country. They certainly galvanized women to action, as a record number ran in the 1992 elections, citing their anger that Hill had faced a panel of white men who seemed to understand so little about what she went through.

Four more Democratic women ― Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein of California, Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois and Patty Murray of Washington ― won election to the Senate that year. Twenty new Democratic women were elected to the House, and the pro-choice Democratic group EMILY’s List grew from 3,000 to 24,000 members. It was dubbed the “Year of the Woman.”

The Hill hearing “electrified the country,” Slaughter recalled. “I don’t think there’s any question about it.”

Moseley Braun and Feinstein also took seats on the Judiciary Committee, but not without a misstep by Biden. The chairman hand-delivered a dozen red roses to Boxer with the note, “Welcome to the Senate Judiciary Committee.” News reports at the time described the moment in highly gendered language ― that Biden had tried to “woo” Boxer but was “scorned” and that Biden was “going courting” while the new senators were “playing hard to get.”

Those women haven’t forgotten Hill and her impact. Boxer, who retired last year after 24 years in the Senate, acknowledged Hill in her farewell speech last month.

“Without her, I never would have been elected to the Senate,” Boxer said. “Anita Hill courageously told her story to the all-male U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, breaking the silence on this painful issue.”

Hill, too, has said she owes a debt of gratitude to the support she received from female politicians at the time.

“I will say: if those women from Congress had not marched over to the Senate and demanded a hearing, I do not think it would have happened,” Hill told Time magazine last year. “That, to me, is leadership. And that’s why we need more women in leadership positions. We haven’t even come close in terms of representation to a critical mass.”

In this new session of Congress, Feinstein is the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee ― the first woman in history to hold that position.

‘The Cause Of My Life’

Win McNamee/Getty Images Joe Biden made combatting violence against women a central part of his time as vice president.

Biden’s mismanagement of the Thomas nomination and Hill’s allegations is a sharp contrast to the work he’s done on women’s rights in the years since, particularly when it comes to ending violence against women ― “the cause of my life,” as he has called it.

“He’s been a really positive ally, and he’s opened doors at the White House to these issues in a way that has not existed in my history,” said Gandy, who is now president of the National Network to End Domestic Violence.

“I can’t name another elected official with the national platform that he has who has been any more passionate or any more effective than he has,” Greenberger said. “I give him a great debt of gratitude for his championing of these issues at the same time that I remain very disappointed with what happened during those Thomas hearings.”

One of Biden’s most noteworthy accomplishments is the landmark Violence Against Women Act. Biden shepherded that bill through the Senate, leading to its eventual passage in 1994. The law provided a comprehensive national strategy for dealing with the crisis, including increased penalties for offenders, protections for women who come forward, and funding and support for coordinated community response.

Congress has reauthorized VAWA three times since then, including after a tough legislative fight in 2012 and 2013, in which some Republicans opposed including protections for undocumented immigrants, same-sex couples and Native Americans.

“The Violence Against Women Act in 1994 was very hard to pass. … This was not a slam dunk by any stretch of the imagination,” Feminist Majority Foundation President Ellie Smeal said. “And [Biden] made it an issue. It wouldn’t pass without him, there’s no question about it.”

Slaughter, one of the original co-authors of the legislation, also praised Biden’s work.

“He’s a great guy,” she said. “He’s a real soldier in the field for the Democratic Party.”

Even before Obama won the 2008 election, Biden made clear he wanted the administration to combat sexual assault. The vice president created a new position, White House adviser on violence against women, to ensure that the issue continued to get attention.

“That was a real turning point, I think, in terms of the attention that the issue would receive at the highest levels of the White House,” Gandy said.

Biden has also sought to address the scourge of sexual assault on college campuses ― a problem that affects 20 percent of women and 5 percent of men, according to a recent Washington Post-Kaiser Family Foundation poll of current and recent college students. Biden toured schools around the country and urged them to change how they deal with violence.

“We are the first administration to make it clear that sexual assault is not just a crime, it can be a violation of a woman’s civil rights,” he said in 2011 in a speech at the University of New Hampshire in Durham.

Biden’s speech coincided with a letter the Department of Education sent to colleges and universities outlining new guidance about Title IX, the federal statute prohibiting sex discrimination in education programs that receive federal funding. That letter made clear that school administrators had an obligation to act on sexual violence.

“If a school knows or reasonably should know about student-on-student harassment that creates a hostile environment, Title IX requires the school to take immediate action to eliminate the harassment, prevent its recurrence, and address its effects,” read the Obama administration’s letter, which also threatened to pull a school’s federal funding if the government determined it was not taking steps to address the problem. As of last July, the Education Department had more than 250 ongoing investigations at postsecondary institutions.

In 2014, the White House started a task force to combat student sexual assault and a nationwide campaign to raise awareness. A key part of the strategy was to get men more involved in the efforts, a move away from a culture that so often places the responsibility for sexual assault on women.

“He helped bring a lot of men into it, which is also necessary if we’re ever going to reduce these numbers of sexual assaults on college campuses,” Gandy added.

Biden also spoke out forcefully against Trump and his treatment of women during the 2016 election. When audio emerged of Trump bragging about using his celebrity status to grope women, Biden tweeted that what he was talking about was sexual assault.

The words are demeaning. Such behavior is an abuse of power. It’s not lewd. It’s sexual assault. –Joe — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) October 8, 2016

“I’m tired of new politicians who want to go to Washington to demean women,” Biden said in a speech in Nevada a few days later.

Biden will leave the White House with a far different image than many women had of him in 1991. He is extremely popular in the Democratic Party, able to connect with a wide range of voters in a way that many other politicians envy. There is even talk that he could run for president in 2020.

Women’s rights activists say that whatever he does, they hope he stays involved in their fight. Gandy called the Thomas hearings part of Biden’s history, but not his legacy, and Smeal said his leadership on women’s rights “so surpasses” what happened in 1991.

“I think it takes a big heart and an open mind to evolve, to learn,” Greenberger said. “And I think that Vice President Biden has demonstrated that in many contexts, but nowhere more clearly than in his strong championing of laws and policies to protect those who have been the subject of sexual assault, sexual harassment, sexual mistreatment.”","26 Years Ago, America Started Talking About Sexual Harassment Thanks To Anita Hill",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/anita-hill-26-years-sexual-harassment_us_59deaf0fe4b0fdad73b1e9bf?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009

Many online were outraged at the coverage Yiannopoulos received just days after his Nazi links were reported.

Just days later, he and Breitbart were linked to neo-Nazis in an explosive investigation featuring video footage of Yiannopoulos singing karaoke with white nationalists. Among that group was Richard Spencer, a noted white supremacist who helped organise the tiki torch-lit Unite The Right rally in Charlottesville in August. In the video, the group can be clearly seen performing Nazi salutes right in front of Yiannopoulos.

Despite this revelation, Yiannopoulos has this week received tame treatment and interrogation in multiple mainstream Australian media outlets, is being represented by one of Australia's top celebrity publicists who says the controversial speaker ""talks a lot of common sense"", and is being slowly co-opted by Australia's own conservative media outlets who claim he is ""ahead of the curve"".

Yiannopoulos was a hugely controversial figure well before the Nazi video emerged. He was one of the leading figures in the 'Gamergate' saga, a prolonged and targeted campaign of harassment and abuse of women in the video game industry; he was permanently banned from Twitter for harassment of Ghostbusters actress Leslie Jones, who he described as 'barely literate' and a 'black dude'; and lost both his position at Breitbart and a planned book deal in February this year after previous comments resurfaced where he appeared to endorse paedophilia. Since leaving Breitbart, he has toured American colleage campuses and inspired riots ahead of his speaking engagements. He calls feminism a ""cancer"" and compared Islam to AIDS.

An exhaustive Buzzfeed report, published on October 6 (AEDT), sets out in great detail through leaked emails and correspondence the claim that Breitbart and Yiannopoulos ""smuggled Nazi and white nationalist ideas into the mainstream"". Breitbart's executive chairman is Steve Bannon, who left the company to work as chief strategist to U.S. President Donald Trump, and recently returned to that position.

""For more than a year, Yiannopoulos led the site in a coy dance around the [alt-right's] nastier edges, writing stories that minimized the role of neo-Nazis and white nationalists while giving its politer voices 'a fair hearing',"" Buzzfeed reported, but most disturbing would be the video (above) showing white nationalists including Spencer performing Nazi salutes as Yiannopoulos sings karaoke.

Inside Bannon's ""killing machine"": Private emails show how Breitbart thrives on the alt-right's most vicious racism https://t.co/dVx09tyyKl — BuzzFeed News (@BuzzFeedNews) October 5, 2017

In a statement to Buzzfeed, he claimed his ""severe myopia"" meant he did not see the Nazi salutes being performed by several people right in front of him. But Australian media outlets including Sunrise, Fairfax, KIIS FM and Alan Jones on Macquarie Radio saw clear to interview Yiannopoulos, while high-profile agent Max Markson became his publicist for the upcoming speaking tour.

""The world has changed over the last two years with Brexit and Donald Trump and I think Milo talks a lot of common sense, as does Andrew Bolt and Mark Latham,"" Markson told Mumbrella in an interview published October 3.

​​​​""Milo is amazing. He is incredibly articulate, witty, funny and politically incorrect.""

Markson later tweeted a link to his comments on October 6, the same day the Buzzfeed expose was published.

Right wing agitator Milo Yiannopoulos 'talks a lot of sense', says publicist Max Markson https://t.co/wIUUHmdJDL via @21stCent_News — Max Markson (@maxmarkson) October 6, 2017

Days later, despite the Nazi links, despite the shopping list of prior vile controversies, Yiannopoulos was interviewed by at least five large mainstream Australian outlets -- on morning TV show Sunrise, in Fairfax Media, on news.com.au, on KIIS FM with Kyle and Jackie O, and with Alan Jones on Macquarie Radio.

Sunrise hosts David Koch and Monique Wright were described in press as having a ""fiery"" clash with Yiannopoulos, but essentially just read out a list of his controversial quotes and asked him to explain them further. Fairfax described him as a ""virtuous troll"" whose aim is to ""reveal hypocrisy through ridicule"".

On KIIS FM, he joked about killing feminists.

""We should dash their heads against a rock before they reach puberty,"" he said.

Many online were outraged at the coverage Yiannopoulos received just days after his Nazi links were reported.

It's not just Australia's mainstream press which is giving Milo a platform, however. He has featured on Andrew Bolt's show on Sky News several times, including as recently as last month.

Bolt launched a full-throated defence of Yiannopoulos in the wake of the Sunrise interview. In a blog post on October 9, Bolt said ""There are plenty of reasons to criticise Milo -- along with good reasons to applaud him"" and claimed ""it may actually be worth it just to hear what he has to say without being in such a frantic rush to smash him"".

Bolt did not mention the Buzzfeed report or the Nazi links.

The already published and aired interviews with Yiannopoulos will not be the last ones he does in Australia this week. As announced on Tuesday, he will appear alongside a media personality who is perhaps Australia's closest equivalent to America's alt-right commentators -- former Labor leader, former Sky News host, Mark Latham, who has his own string of controversies and resulting sackings.

Wednesday 8pm ADST, Mark Latham's Outsiders, interviewing Milo Yiannopolous about the Alt-Right, millennial freedoms and his Aust tour. — Real Mark Latham (@RealMarkLatham) October 9, 2017

The connection between Yiannopoulos and Latham isn't hard to work out. Markson represents them both, having helped plug Latham's book launch last week. Jones, who interviewed Milo this week, was the headline speaker at the launch of Latham's book.

""Trigger warning! Watch out snowflakes and goodbye political correctness and the PC police as Australia's Mark Latham and the worlds most controversial man Milo Yiannopoulos go head to head in an interview that gets to Milo's philosophy and ideas rather than outrage and sensationalism!"" reads the press release announcing that Milo will appear on Latham's talk show on website Rebel Media, a far-right platform based in Canada

""Milo Yiannopoulos is ahead of the curve when it comes to how the world thinks. He isn't left wing or right wing. He is a genuine Outsider and says what he believes is correct in today's ever changing world,"" Latham said in a statement.

Latham has also published a piece on Rebel, titled 'Don't Let Them Ban Milo From Australia', where he defends Yiannopoulos from the paedophilia comments but mysteriously fails to mention the Nazi links. He has started his own petition, which has been given a push by Bolt.

Yiannopoulos' appearance in Australia will be a rallying moment for Australia's small, disjointed and disparate answer to the far-right. While lacking in numbers and stature, a small number of blogs have sprung up in recent months trying to act as an Australian version of Breitbart.

A small network of websites, podcasts and online groups currently exist which publish material on ""fake journalism"", criticism of feminism, anti-Semitic and misogynist articles, and praise the work of American alt-right figures and publications. They are currently largely under-the-radar, with tiny followings in terms of viewers and social media fans, but are growing in number thanks to figureheads like Latham, who has appeared on and praised the podcasts.

While Milo's brand of incendiary, provocative and -- to borrow the name of his own speaking tour -- troll behaviour has so far failed to really take off in Australia, the media attention around his Australian visit may prove a true spark point for a local radical-right community to step out of the shadows.",How Australia Is Trying To Normalise Milo Yiannopoulos After Nazi Links,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/10/10/how-australia-is-trying-to-normalise-milo-yiannopoulos-after-nazi-links_a_23236755/

– Mon pyjama.

– T'es vraiment bizarre toi! m'a-t-elle dit en riant.

Au moins, elle trouvait ça drôle. Pourtant, je ne pouvais pas être plus honnête. Le pyjama, c'est la recharge suprême pour une personne introvertie. Quand j'ai besoin de recharger, j'ai pas envie de voir personne. J'ai pas envie de parler. J'ai pas envie d'avoir d'interaction sociale. J'ai juste besoin d'être dans mon monde.

Comme si je me branchais direct sur un générateur hyper puissant.

Je ne sens pas de stress, je ne sens pas de pression, je ne sens pas le regard des autres.

Il y a une espèce de bulle rassurante qui se crée autour de moi. C'est comme si tout le bien-être du monde tenait dans cette bulle-là. Je ne sens pas de stress, je ne sens pas de pression, je ne sens pas le regard des autres. Pis une maudite chance parce qu'avec le look de mon pyjama, ça m'aiderait pas à paraitre plus normale.

Parce que j'ai non seulement un pyjama, mais j'ai LE pyjama ultime. Un pyjama 'one piece' en gros moush moush avec une capuche qui donne l'impression que je suis un chat. Ouin je sais c'est super quétaine mais, en même temps, c'est super efficace.

Si je pouvais passer ma vie en pyjama, je le ferais.

Mon pyjama, c'est le confort. C'est être bien. C'est être moi-même. C'est comme un monde parallèle dans lequel tous mes malaises sociaux n'existent pas. Même mon anxiété a de la misère à m'envahir quand je suis dans cette bulle-là. Si je pouvais passer ma vie en pyjama, je le ferais. Je sais quand même vivre là, je respecte les conventions sociales de base faque je me retiens. Mais je fais partie de ceux qui vont des fois au dépanneur en pyjama parce qu'il me manque du lait le matin pis que j'ai pas envie de m'habiller pis que je m'en sacre un peu de ce que les gens vont penser en me voyant.

Évidemment, en dehors de ça, je ne le fais pas. Mais, dès que je peux, je m'habille en t-shirt pis en jogging ou, une coche en haut, en jeans. Bref, j'affectionne m'habiller en mou. Le mou c'est comme un niveau en haut du pyjama. C'est dans la même veine mais c'est acceptable socialement. Mais si mon pyjama était acceptable socialement, mon choix serait clair.

Moi, j'irais même dans un mariage en pyjama. Surtout dans un mariage. Parce que je pourrais traîner une partie de ma bulle avec moi pour survivre à cet événement-là. Je pourrais avoir l'impression d'être chez nous pis être bien même si je suis au milieu de plein de gens que je ne connais pas. Je me calmerais l'anxiété sociale à grands coups de bulle improvisée.

Vor drei Jahren half ihr das FBI, der schrecklichen Situation zu entkommen

Jetzt will sie mit einem gemeinnützigen Projekt dafür sorge, dass andere Mädchen nicht Dasselbe durchmachen müssen

Vielen erschien Emmy Myers in der High School wie die Vorzeige-Schülerin schlechthin. Sie turnte, machte Leichtathletik und war in der Landwirtschafts-AG.

Doch ihr Leben nahm eine dunkle Wende - sie wurde drogensüchtig und Opfer von Sex-Handel.

Heute will die 28-Jährige aus Wisconsin andere Menschen darauf aufmerksam machen, dass dieses Schicksal jeden ereilen kann - und dass die Menschen, die Frauen und Mädchen kaufen, aus jeder sozialen Schicht kommen können.

""Das passiert nicht nur in Filmen, sondern auch normalen Menschen im echten Leben"", sagte Myers der HuffPost.

""Lacey's Hope Project"" macht auf Sex-Handel aufmerksam

Sie hat eine gemeinnützige Aktion Lacey's Hope Project gestartet und spricht offen über ihre Erfahrungen. Der Name der Organisation ist eine Anlehnung an ihren damaligen Bühnennamen, mit dem sie auftrat, um gegen Geld zu tanzen.

Menschenhandel nimmt in den USA stark zu. 2016 stiegen die Fälle im Vergleich zum Vorjahr laut der National Human Trafficking Hotline um 35,6 Prozent an.

Die Opfer werden gezwungen, körperliche Arbeit zu verrichten oder gegen ihren Willen mit Fremden Sex zu haben.

Armut und Arbeitslosigkeit helfen dem Menschen-Handel

Dass der Menschenhandel ansteigt, hat laut Experten mehrere Gründe. Jarrett Luckett, Geschäftsfüher der Organisation Exploit No More, sieht vor allem Armut und Drogenkonsum als Faktoren an.

Exploit No More unterstützt Menschen, die Opfer von Sex-Handel wurden. Luckett arbeitet gemeinsam mit Myers daran, über Sex-Handel in den Städten aufzuklären und auf die Gefahr aufmerksam zu machen.

""Armut und Drogen machen die Opfer anfälliger, in die Falle des Sex-Handels zu tappen"", sagte Luckett der HuffPost.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Mädchen von 1000 Männern vergewaltigt - ihr Schicksal zeigt das tragische Ausmaß des Menschenhandels

Diese beiden Probleme sind daran schuld, dass Myers Geburtsstadt Milwaukee zu einem Knotenpunkt für Menschenhandel geworden ist.

Milwaukee ist ein perfekter Ort für die Händler. Sie können ihre Opfer an viele größere Städte in der Nähe transportieren - etwa nach Chicago und Madison. Weit verbreiteter Heroinmissbrauch und die hohe Arbeitslosenrate in Milwaukee helfen den Händlern, ihre Opfer zu ködern.

Sex-Handel hat sich in Milwaukee so weit verbreitet, dass die Stadt auch ""Harvard der Zuhälter"" genannt wird.

Jeder kann zum Opfer werden

Myers Geschichte zeigt, dass Händler aber auch Erfolg haben können, wenn die Opfer aus einer guten Familie kommen. Sie wuchs als das aufgeweckte, fröhliche Kind auf, das sich alle Eltern wünschen.

In der Zeit zwischen ihrem dritten und sechsten Lebensjahr aber wurde sie von einem Freund der Familie mehrfach missbraucht. Einen Großteil ihrer Kindheit über machte sie sich Vorwürfe.

Myers wurde mehrfach verhaftet. Sie hat ein Strafregister, aber keine Einstufung als Schwerverbrecherin. (Foto: Emmy Myers)

Sie glaubte, sie sei selbst daran schuld, dass er sich immer wieder an ihr verging. Die Zweifel seien so stark geworden, dass sie angefangen habe, Drogen zu nehmen, sagt Myers. Und irgendwann sei sie einem manipulativen Menschenhändler in die Hände gefallen.

Ihre ersten Erfahrungen mit Drogen habe sie in der High School gemacht, erzählt sie. In ihrem letzten Jahr an der Schule wurde das Geld knapp und sie begann zu strippen, um ihre Sucht zu finanzieren. Nach der High School steig sie auf Heroin um und war zwei Mal in einer Entzugsklinik - das alles geschah, bevor sie 20 Jahre alt war.

Mit 24 versuchte sie erneut, clean zu werden und zog ausgerechnet mit ihrem gewalttätigen Drogendealer zusammen. Er wusste von ihrer Situation und bot ihr an, sie unter seine Obhut zu nehmen und sich um sie zu kümmern. Er stellte ihr eine Wohnung zur Verfügung und versorgte sie mit Kleidung und Essen.

Myers konnte sich nicht wehren

Dass er plante, sie für Sex zu verkaufen, ahnte sie nicht. Er erstellte eine Werbeanzeige auf Backpage.com, einer Seite, die Produkte und Dienstleistungen anbietet. (Dieses Jahr musste die Firma ihren Bereich für Erwachsenen-Werbung schließen, da sie wegen Unterstützung von Prostitution und Menschen-Handel unter Verdacht steht.)

""Ich hätte niemals gedacht, dass ich mich jemals verkaufen würde"", sagt Myers. ""Aber als ich an diesem Punkt angelangt war, gab es keine Ausweg mehr"", sagt Myers. ""Zuhälter wissen, was sie tun. Sie geben vor, dich zu lieben. Sie finden heraus, wie du tickst und wovor du am meisten Angst hast.""

➨ Mehr zum Thema: ""Gewalt gegen Frauen ist eben unsere Kultur"" - ich setzte mich weltweit für Frauenrechte ein, diese Ausrede kann ich nicht mehr hören

Als Myers sich wehrte, drohte ihr der Dealer. Er sagte, wenn sie nicht einwillige, würde er ihre Neffen töten. Er konfiszierte ihren Personalausweis und nahm ihr das wenige Geld, das sie noch hatte.

Ihr Zuhälter und seine Freundin brachten Myers zu Hotels in verschiedenen Städten. Dort musste sie sich schon um 6.30 Uhr mit Männern treffen, bevor diese zu ihren Meetings gingen. Bis spät in die Nacht musste sie mit den Klienten Sex haben. Damit sie sich nicht wehren konnte, verabreichte der Dealer ihr permanent Drogen.

""Es sind häufig die Männer, die in ihrem Umfeld anerkannt sind""

Gewissermaßen hatte sie ""Glück"" - keiner der Männer, mit denen sie schlafen musste, war ihr gegenüber gewalttätig. Viele von ihnen waren erfolgreiche Geschäftsmänner. Viele von ihnen hatten Familie.

""Das überrascht viele Menschen am meisten"", sagt Myers. ""Es sind nicht immer die großen, fetten, ekligen Typen. Es sind häufig die Männer, die in ihrem Umfeld anerkannt sind.""

Einen Monat später wurde Myers in Milwaukee verhaftet - für eine Sache, die nichts mit Sex-Handel oder Prostitution zu tun hatte. Die Anzeige gegen sie machte das FBI auf sie aufmerksam. Die Ermittler boten an, ihr zu helfen und sie aus dieser Situation zu befreien.

2013 musste sie für etwa einen Monat ins Gefängnis und ging danach erneut in eine Entziehungsklinik - zum dritten Mal. Nachdem sie wieder draußen war, fiel sie erneut für kurze Zeit dem Sexhandel zum Opfer.

Heute will die 28-Jährige darauf aufmerksam machen, dass jeder Opfer von Sex-Handel werden kann. (Foto: Emmy Myers)

Ein halbes Jahr später war sie wieder im Gefängnis - dieses Mal für sieben Monate. In dieser Zeit durfte sie arbeiten gehen (Anm. d. Red.: In den USA gibt es Integrations-Programme für Insassen. Sie können an ihren Arbeitsplatz zurückkehren, werden aber streng überwacht. Nach ihrer Schicht müssen sie zurück ins Gefängnis.).

Nach dieser Zeit im Gefängnis zog Myers für zwei Monate in eine soziale Einrichtung für Gewaltopfer. Mit Hilfe eines Übergangsprogramms fand sie eine eigene Wohnung.

Die Aufklärung in den großen Städten ist wichtig

Heute hat Myers seit drei Jahren keine Drogen mehr genommen. Sie hat ein Strafregister, ist aber nicht als Schwerverbrecherin eingestuft - zu ihrem großen Glück.

Viele, die in Amerika Opfer von Sex-Handel geworden sind, haben Prostitutions-Vorwürfe in ihrem Register stehen - und das, obwohl sie dazu gezwungen wurden.

Sie haben keine Möglichkeiten, ihre Register löschen zu lassen. Das bedeutet: Für sie ist es beinahe unmöglich, eine Arbeit oder eine Wohnung zu finden.

Derzeit arbeitet Myers als Pflegerin in einem Altersheim. Zusätzlich engagiert sie sich für ihr gemeinnütziges Projekt, mit dem sie Fälle von Sex-Handel verhindern will.

Sie erzählt ihre Geschichte in Schulen, Kirchen und anderen Gemeindeeinrichtungen. Sie klärt Ärzte, Schüler, Studenten, Eltern und Ordnungsämter auf, spricht über die Realität des Sex-Handels und erklärt, wie man ein solches Schicksal verhindern kann.

Ärzten erklärt sie beispielsweise, dass sie auf blaue Flecken an sonderbaren Stellen achten sollen und dass mehrfache Fehlgeburten sie ebenso stutzig machen sollten wie Patienten, die nicht wissen, wie viele Geschlechtspartner sie hatten oder die nicht genau angeben können, wo sie wohnen.

Diese Aufklärung sei entscheidend, um den Sex-Handel aufzuhalten, bestätigt Luckett.

""Diese präventive Arbeit ist wichtig, damit andere Menschen nicht in 'dieses Leben' abrutschen - sie sollen nicht auch noch durch diese Hölle gehen"", sagt er. ""Es lässt sich nicht pauschal sagen, wie ein Menschen-Händler aussieht - oder wie ein Opfer aussieht. Das macht es besonders schwer. Aber es gibt Zeichen, die einen davor warnen.""

A review of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) data obtained through right-to-information requests shows banks' total stressed loans — including non-performing and restructured or rolled over loans — rose 4.5 percent in the six months to end-June. In the previous six months they had risen 5.8 percent.

While banks remain the main source of funding for India's companies, the stubborn bad debt problem has eaten into bank profits and choked off new lending, especially to smaller firms, at a time when an economy that depends on them is stalling.

India grew at its slowest pace in three years in April-June - a concern for the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who faces elections in 2019 and has pledged to create millions of new jobs before then.

Banks are having to take higher provisions to account for more defaulters being pushed into bankruptcy. And margins are likely to be squeezed further by proposed new rules to encourage commercial banks to pass on central bank interest rate cuts.

To be sure, the bulk of India's sour loans are in the state banks and stem from lending to large conglomerates, especially in steel and infrastructure. But analysts say the rise in bad loans among small firms, and even retail borrowing, is worrying and will do little to encourage new loans to help fuel growth.

""On the corporate side, we think it's a recognition cycle which is nearing an end,"" said Alka Anbarasu, senior analyst at Moody's Investor Service, referring to more bad loans being recognized as such, as banks come under pressure from the RBI and other regulators.

""But it's really those data points beyond corporate that are causing some worry.""

Anbarasu forecast weak quarters ahead for banks before profitability picks up, and several senior bankers from public sector lenders - which account for more than two-thirds of Indian banking assets - agreed the months ahead would be strained.

Stressed loans as a percentage of total loans reached 12.6 percent at end-June, according to the RBI data, the highest level in at least 15 years.

HIGHER PROVISIONS, WEAKER LOANS

Part of the issue for banks and the government is a strict provisioning regime: the RBI wants banks to provide for at least 50 percent of the secured loans to companies taken to bankruptcy proceedings, and 100 percent for the unsecured part.

A dozen of the biggest such cases account for nearly 1.78 trillion rupees, or a quarter of total non-performing assets.

For those companies, banks will need to provide 180 billion rupees on top of existing provisions, according to July estimates from India Ratings and Research, the local affiliate of Fitch Ratings.

More than 20 other sizeable companies are at risk of being taken to bankruptcy court.

Bankers say these and other pressures - including rising government bond yields that forced banks to post mark-to-market losses - have added to the squeeze, and hit new loans.

According to RBI data, new loans grew at just about 5 percent in the year to March, the lowest growth rate in more than six decades. Several banks have already cut back their loan books to conserve capital.

""What are they (RBI) thinking while they're taking these steps all at the same time?"" said a treasurer at a state-run bank, who didn't want to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue. ""Do they want banks to wind up their businesses, or do they want to save the banks?""

Treasury income accounted for 22.7 percent of banks' operating profits in the last financial year, doubling its share from a year earlier, India Ratings estimates.

""The almost zero treasury income will hit provisioning ability and, in turn, make it more difficult for weaker banks to give loans as capital becomes more scarce,"" said Soumyajit Niyogi, an associate director at the rating agency.

A senior policymaker, who requested anonymity as the discussions are not public, said the government would have to help to sufficiently capitalize the banks.

Fitch Ratings estimates Indian banks will need $65 billion of additional capital by March 2019 to meet Basel III global banking rules. Moody's expects the top 11 state lenders alone will need nearly $15 billion. The government has just $3 billion left in its budget for bank recapitalization.

""We think capitalization is the biggest challenge for the banks at the moment, given that earnings will remain subdued and will not support any capital generation,"" said Moody's Anbarasu.

Today is World Post Day. Its purpose is to remind the world about the Post's role in the everyday lives of people and businesses and its contribution to global social and economic development. This was mooted by an Indian, Anand Mohan Narula, in 1969 at a Universal Postal Union Congress held in Tokyo. Since then, World Post Day has been celebrated on October 9.

I had never heard of it before, but I am all in favour of the day. A celebration to commemorate India Post and honour its indefatigable postmen. There was a time when the postman was my friend. I was in my teens and had 33 penpals from different parts of the country. The postman came twice a day, at 8.30 am, and 2.30 pm. I used to wait for the sound of the curtains rustling as he pushed the mail in through the letter slot of our door. The soft 'plop' it made as it fell onto the floor was the highlight of my day.

I would spend a few luxurious moments guessing where the letters were from. The beautiful Bengali girl studying in Santiniketan? Or the rugged Nepali from the old Ghoom Monastery in Darjeeling? Maybe it was from Madras, Raipur, Meerut, Jammu, Bhopal, or even Jhumri Telaiya that was originally in Bihar and is now in Jharkhand. I had pen pals my age, of both sexes, with whom I would shyly share the fantasies of youth, and boldly exchange black-and-white photos taken on Agfa and Kodak gravure cameras. The postman was the go-between. Our friendly neighbourhood messenger.

Nobody I knew, got packages in the mail, nor money. Telegrams, by some strange design, only arrived in the dead of night.

At Diwali and Christmas, the postman would knock on the door grinning in greeting. It was customary to give him what was known as baksheesh. He would be accompanied by the postmen who did the VVP (Value Payable Post) a.k.a the Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra and Snapdeal of those days, and do the Money Order rounds. The fellow who cycled up in a tearing hurry with telegrams that only carried news of death from faraway places also came along those days. We only saw these postmen on festive occasions.

Nobody I knew, got packages in the mail, nor money. Telegrams, by some strange design, only arrived in the dead of night. And nobody grudged these postmen their baksheesh.

Today's generation will not know the romance of receiving mail through the post.

That was then. I haven't seen the postman in ages. I understand he mainly delivers government documents such as passports, driving licenses and Aadhar cards now. Instead, the courier man comes at odd hours with mail. I wake up every morning to find my Gmail inbox flooded with correspondence. The ping on my cell phone announces the arrival of a message on SMS or Whatsapp that beats the Express Telegram. So I wonder who uses India Post today.

I still look for its familiar squat red post-box patiently standing on street corners. Its mouth yawning wide and waiting for mail to be fed in. And then I am dismayed to see its stomach hollow and gaping open because some vagrant or druggie has cruelly broken its door to sell as scrap metal. I feel a twinge of regret and sadness. Today's generation will not know the romance of receiving mail through the post. Or the nail-biting anxiety of the school exam results coming home at the end of the summer vacation.

Everything is done online or sent by email. But in cities like London and New York, I find post-boxes gaily painted in red and blue, which tells me the Post Office is active there. I take pictures with them like they are old friends. When I can, I buy attractive postcards and mail them to myself. Just for the thrill of hearing the curtains rustle again back home, as the postman drops the mail in through the letter-slot that will fall with a soft 'plop' on the floor.

On October 2, the 148th birth anniversary of M.K. Gandhi, millions of Indians awoke to visuals of Prime Minister Narendra Modi paying homage to him at Rajghat. Gandhi's favourite prayers were played on the radio, and black-and-white documentaries were shown across television channels. However, this saccharine and dutiful homage to the Father of the Nation only hides the stark fact that Gandhi is, in fact, dead to India, to 'official' India.

What did Gandhi stand for and how is his legacy faring in today's India? Above all, the Mahatma believed in the power of dialogue. The situation in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, a blood-red blot on India's soul, embodies the absence of dialogue and epitomises the power (and failure) of brute force. What would Gandhi have thought of pellet guns being used by Indian security forces against unarmed protesters that have ended up blinding hundreds? How many hunger strikes would he have undertaken to end this scourge?

Gandhi used religious symbols to unite India's diverse communities, reading from the Bible, the Koran and the Gita in his prayer meetings. Today, only Hindu religious symbols are used.

Gandhi held that the success of any policy should be measured by whether or not it benefited the poor. On September 17th, Prime Minister Modi celebrated his birthday with the 'gift' of the Sardar Sarovar Dam, aspiring to be the world's largest dam. Originally conceived of to benefit the drought-prone districts of four states, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Maharashtra, the waters of the dam are now being disproportionately directed towards a few chosen corporates and companies like Coca-Cola and the Tata Nano car. The waters will submerge areas inhabited mostly by tribals, the poorest of Indians. Despite decades of promises of rehabilitation packages to the displaced, the ousted tribals continue to be short-changed.

Gandhi believed that the Press had a particularly critical role to play in a democracy, and he founded and edited several regional and English language publications. In India today, subtle and blatant methods are regularly employed to intimidate critics of the government, from the murder of journalists to the forced resignation of independent editors. Gandhi used religious symbols to unite India's diverse communities, reading from the Bible, the Koran and the Gita in his prayer meetings. Today, only Hindu religious symbols are used in the public sphere, with the express purpose of polarising different communities.

Although it is true that Gandhi was devoutly opposed to cow slaughter, he never accepted that his religion could be forced on non-Hindus in India. He was also keenly aware of Hindus who ate beef, and who traded in cow hides for business. He repeatedly pointed out that India was home to multiple religious communities: Muslims, Parsis, and Christians, with different culinary tastes and traditions. Today's India, with its cow vigilantes roaming the streets day and night is a travesty to everything Gandhi represented.

And yet, Gandhi lives

Gandhi lives in Prime Minister Modi's movement for a clean India, the Swacch Bharat Abhiyan, which was inaugurated on his birthday in 2014. Gandhi emphasised the dignity of manual labour and in setting a personal example, the ministers in the Modi government are more interested in photo-ops with brooms than in practising rules of sanitation.

Gandhi lives in the desire of Prime Minister Modi to willfully appropriate one of his signature campaigns to empower the poor: the use of homespun cotton, or Khadi. Earlier this year, a photograph of Modi replaced the classic picture of Gandhi spinning cotton in the 2017 calendar and diary published by the Khadi Village Industries Commission, a body created by parliament in 1956 to promote khadi and associated village industries. The attempt to erase Gandhi's association with something so quintessentially Gandhian signifies that the current Indian government wants to be associated with anything iconic, great or small, even if the comparisons are inept.

Unrelated to government propaganda, however, among millions of Indians, Gandhi lives. In the 1970s, he was the inspiration behind the Chipko movement, when forest-dwellers who were adversely affected by commercial logging tied themselves to trees to protest the depredations of contractors and successfully showed the power of peaceful protest. He has been the inspiration behind the numerous water satyagrahas, peaceful protests by tribals who have stood immersed in the waters of the Narmada to protest increasing the height of the dam that would destroy their homes and livelihoods with little-to-no compensation.

Gandhi lives on in the peaceful march of activists to the homes of victims of cow vigilante violence, even if their caravan of love has met with opposition of the sort that Gandhi, too, encountered in his marches to meet victims of communal violence. And Gandhi lives in the silent but powerful protest of journalists who met on October 2 to speak out against the targeting of journalists across India.

Across the world, Gandhi's ideas of peaceful protest have been put to work and given renewed meaning by African-Americans during the civil rights movement in the United States, by Green Party workers in Germany, protesters during the Arab Spring, student protesters, antiwar activists everywhere, and most recently, by women marchers in the United States.

Gandhi's physical death

The renewed and repeated death of Gandhi in, and by, 'official' India is of a piece with the sanitizing of his life, and indeed, his death. In Battle for Peace (2007), the Gandhian educationist Krishna Kumar wonders why busloads of schoolchildren who visit Rajghat, the official memorial to Gandhi, are never taken to Birla House, the place of his carefully planned assassination at the hands of a Hindu right-wing fanatic, Nathuram Godse (whose name is now being obliterated from school textbooks). Indian and foreign dignitaries also never visit Birla House. Kumar concludes that a 'silent agreement... has shaped India's life since Gandhi's assassination,' and that entails not asking difficult questions such as the reasons behind Gandhi's assassination.

Yet this was not always the case. In the immediate aftermath of Gandhi's assassination, the offices of the Hindu Mahasabha, an organisation to which his assassin Godse owed allegiance, were closed and its papers confiscated (later housed in the manuscripts section of the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library). Thousands of workers of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), another Hindu right-wing organization, were arrested, and the organisation was banned.

The ban on RSS worked only to a limited extent

A year later, RSS workers were released from prison. They now worked in secret to strengthen the Hindu community, and when they collected donations, they learned not to keep written records. Meanwhile, the Gandhi murder trial commenced, and Godse's fiery and unrepentant defence of his actions reportedly brought tears to the eyes of those in the courtroom. Years later, one of the judges who served the death sentence on Godse, Justice G. D. Khosla, would record that, ""had the audience of that day been constituted into a jury and entrusted with the task of deciding Godse's appeal, they would have brought in a verdict of 'not guilty' by an overwhelming majority.""

Therein lie the clues to why Gandhi's death has been the subject of such deafening silence. Godse's statement to the court was published posthumously and promptly banned by the Indian government led by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. There was to be no discussion; the wounds were too raw, the absence of guilt too unsettling.

As the years passed, many roads were named Mahatma Gandhi Marg, and many more Gandhi statues built across India. But the message of the Mahatma for an inclusive India was neglected, especially as the RSS soon found itself in government, in alliance with so-called secular parties, from 1977-79. The ideological question of ""dual membership"" (to the RSS and the Janata government) would go on to break India's first non-Congress coalition government. In the politicking and horse-trading of these years, there was simply no place for any sustained examination of the ambivalent place of Godse in India.

In his life and practice of politics, Gandhi embodied dialogue, even if he used the hunger strike to occasionally end negotiations. It is also important to underline that Gandhi's own practice of continuous reflection and self-critique, that led to dramatic reversals of opinion on important questions of Hindu social reform and inter-caste marriage, are in sync with the practice of academics who question several of the myths surrounding his status as Mahatma. As other contemporary Indian figures such as the anti-colonial revolutionary Bhagat Singh and constitutionalist B.R. Ambedkar find their space in the nationalist pantheon, Gandhi as Mahatma continues to resonate among diverse groups of people in India, and around the globe. In contemporary India, it is this quality of dialogue and reflection that is sought to be stifled, with ever-renewed vigour.

Elisabeth Galli stieg daraufhin aus der CDU aus – und erklärt in der HuffPost, warum

Für die CDU in Sachsen wurde die Bundestagswahl zur Schmach. Im Vergleich zum Wahljahr 2013 verloren die Konservativen fast 16 Prozent, die AfD wurde zur stärksten Kraft im Land.

Sachsens CDU-Ministerpräsident Stanislav Tillich reagierte mit der Forderung nach einem vehementen Rechtsruck auf die peinliche Wahlschlappe. Ex-Ministerpräsident Kurt Biedenkopf kritisierte Tillich scharf, es fehle ihm an ""Vorbildung"". Auch an der Parteibasis wandten sich viele Christdemokraten gegen Tillich und seinen geforderten Ruck nach rechts.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: So erklärt der Chefredakteur der ""Leipziger Volkszeitung"" den Wahlerfolg der AfD in Sachsen



Die Dresdner Rechtsanwältin Elisabeth Galli, zuvor Mitglied im Kreisvorstand der Stadt, entschied sich gar, aus der CDU auszutreten.

Über den geforderten Rechtsruck sagt Galli der HuffPost: ""Wenn man das will, verabschiedet man sich als Partei von seinen Werten."" Die von Tillich geforderte Verschiebung einer CDU Sachsen nach rechts folge der AfD, setze ihrer Marktschreierei aber nichts entgegen.

""Wenn CDU sich Pegida entgegen gestellt hätte, hätte die AfD sie nicht überholt""

Tillich will offenbar von der AfD lernen.

Die CDU-Aussteigerin Galli sieht das größte Versäumnis der Partei im Gegensatz zu Tillich darin, sich nicht entschieden von den Rechten abgesetzt zu haben. ""Es ist ein unverzeilicher Fehler, sich hier nicht von vornherein klar distanziert zu haben"", sagt Galli der HuffPost.

Und weiter: ""Was wäre das für ein Bild gewesen: die sächsische CDU stellt sich gemeinsam mit den Bürgern Pegida entgegen und für unsere Demokratie, in erster Reihe Herr Tillich."" Die Lokalpolitikerin glaubt nicht, dass die Bewegung Pegida ""dann jemals dieses Ausmaß erreicht hätte und ich glaube auch nicht, dass die CDU dann von der AfD überholt worden wäre"".

Die Dresdnerin hatte ihren Austritt auch bei Twitter öffentlich gemacht und für ein enormes Medienecho gesorgt.

Tillich habe außerdem keine Vision für sein Bundesland, kritisiert Galli. Auch Sachsens ehemaliger Ministerpräsident Kurt Biedenkopf hatte seinem Nachfolger vorgeworfen, zu ""scheu"" zu agieren – und über Kompromisse zu regieren.

So habe die CDU in Sachsen die Unsicherheit der Menschen nicht ernstgenommen, glaubt Biedenkopf: ""Wenn Tausende Lehrer und Pflegekräfte fehlen, in Dörfern kein Bus mehr fährt und kein Arzt oder Laden mehr zu finden ist, dann muss man nicht nach rechts oder links rücken, sondern Probleme lösen.“

The remnants of the hurricane is expected to reach the UK on Monday, coinciding with the 30th anniversary of the Great Storm.

The Met Office has warned that the unsettled weather could cause disruption.

The west of the country will see the worst of the weather, with winds of between 60mph and 70mph forecast.

Ophelia is the tenth consecutive Atlantic tropical story to attain hurricane strength this season, the Met Office said.

It will coincide with the 30th anniversary of the Great Storm of 1987, which hit southern England overnight on October 15. The storm caused damage estimated at £1 billion and claimed 18 lives.

The Met Office said that the Great Storm of October 15 and 16, 1987, was a “wake-up call” for weather service providers and helped to identify gaps in severe weather forecasting capability.

Met Office forecaster Alex Burkhill said: “Ophelia became a hurricane overnight and the forecast track takes it eastwards towards Iberia for the weekend.

“After that, indications are that by that point it will then have weakened and be no longer a hurricane or tropical storm, it will be extratropical.

“But then it will continue its way towards the British Isles, probably reaching us very early next week.”

Burkhill said cold sea temperatures mean Ophelia will not be strong enough to be categorised as a hurricane when it hits Britain.

But he added: “It’s definitely something that we are keeping an eye on, for the possibility of some disruptive weather early next week.”

The unsettled weather looks likely to continue into Tuesday due to a separate band of low pressure, and will remain changeable throughout the rest of the week.

Despite the weather warnings for next week, some parts of the UK are set to experience a rise in temperatures this weekend, with some areas in the south east of the country experiencing 24C (75F).

À un peu plus de deux semaines de l'échéance prévue par la loi spéciale qui avait mis fin à la grève dans l'industrie de la construction, les négociations viennent d'avorter dans le secteur résidentiel, a appris La Presse canadienne.

Après des pourparlers avec l'Alliance syndicale tenus jusqu'en soirée mercredi, la partie patronale qui négocie pour ce secteur, l'Association des professionnels de la construction et de l'habitation du Québec (APCHQ), a claqué la porte, a-t-elle confirmé jeudi matin.

Au cours d'une entrevue, le vice-président Développement stratégique et communications de l'APCHQ, François-William Simard, a reproché à l'Alliance syndicale d'avoir renié sa parole, parce qu'elle aurait refusé de signer une entente qui avait été convenue entre les parties à la fin de la journée.

«Mercredi, on a négocié toute la journée. Il y a plusieurs contre-offres qui ont été faites de part et d'autre. Ce qui est le plus intéressant, c'est qu'on a accepté la dernière contre-offre de la partie syndicale», a affirmé M. Simard.

«On dit que le ridicule ne tue pas, et bien heureusement, parce que c'est invraisemblable ce qui s'est passé: ils ont refusé de signer une entente de principe sur leur propre offre», en affirmant qu'ils voulaient consulter ensuite leur fiscaliste pour bien évaluer leur offre, a relaté M. Simard.

Estimant qu'elle perdait alors son temps, l'APCHQ s'est retirée de la table de négociation et elle a demandé au gouvernement de mettre fin à la médiation qui avait été entreprise dans son secteur.

«On a le sentiment malheureusement qu'on nous a fait perdre notre temps. Il n'y a aucune volonté de régler finalement», a laissé tomber le porte-parole patronal.

La loi spéciale qui avait été adoptée pour mettre fin à la grève, le 30 mai dernier, donne aux parties jusqu'au 30 octobre pour s'entendre, à défaut de quoi les questions non résolues seront soumises à l'arbitrage.

Dans le secteur résidentiel, c'est donc la question salariale qui sera soumise à l'arbitrage, puisque les autres clauses avaient fait l'objet d'une entente, a indiqué M. Simard.

Le temps presse donc pour l'ensemble de l'industrie, en vue de renouveler les conventions collectives qui concernent quelque 165 000 ouvriers dans l'ensemble du Québec.

Une entente de principe complète était tout de même intervenue, à la fin de septembre, dans le secteur du génie civil et voirie, entre l'Alliance syndicale et l'Association des constructeurs de routes et grands travaux.

En plus du résidentiel, deux autres secteurs de l'industrie n'ont pas encore réglé, à savoir l'industriel, de même que le commercial-institutionnel. Les conventions collectives dans ces deux secteurs sont négociées entre l'Alliance syndicale et l'Association de la construction du Québec.

L'APCHQ compte 17 000 membres entrepreneurs.

The unnamed 16-year-old, who has since recovered, went to hospital in Texas when she felt short of breath the next day.

A series of tests lead doctors to diagnose her with three separate conditions, which they believed could be linked to her overzealous cheering.

Her story recently appeared as a case study in the Journal of Emergency Medicine.

EMPICS Entertainment

The doctors noted that while the girl was breathing quickly, her breathing sounded normal.

However, they noticed signs of crepitus - a cracking or clicking sensation that occurs under the skin - when they pressed down around her neck and chest.

Speaking to Live Science, report author Dr J. Mack Slaughter Jr. described the sensation as “feeling Rice Krispies”.

Following x-rays the doctors diagnosed the girl with pneumothorax, which is the term given when air builds up between the outside of your lung and the inside of your ribcage. This is also known as a collapsed lung.

After further examination she was also diagnosed with pneumomediastinum, which is when abnormal gas or air is contained within the mediastinum (the space in the chest between the lung sacs).

Finally, doctors identified rogue air in a third place, near the back of the throat, and diagnosed her with pneumoretropharyngeum.

The team said there was no evidence to suggest an underlying lung condition caused the three problems and noted that shouting could have prompted the damage, although this was impossible to conclude for certain.

“Spontaneous pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and pneumoretropharyngeum are uncommon diagnoses individually, and furthermore, the combination of all three diagnoses has yet to be described in medical literature,” they said in the report.

Commenting on the case study, GP Dr Clare Morrison, from online doctor service MedExpress, said it’s important to remember the girl’s experience is extremely rare.

“I cannot think of another time when lungs have collapsed due to screaming at a pop concert - but there’s a first time for everything,” she told HuffPost UK.

“So it’s important not to panic and for parents to get too judicious.”

She said smokers and recreational drug users have a higher chance of a pneumothorax - or lung collapse - than the general popualation.

“Also, if you’re suffering from a condition like asthma or pneumonia, your chances increase,” she added.

She pointed out that symptoms of a collapsed lung include:

Chest tightness

Tiredness

Rapid heart rate

Nasal flaring

Blue-coloured skin

“A small pneumothorax will likely go away on its own - you could only need oxygen treatment and rest,” Dr Morrison added.

“Often a needle will be used to pull the air out from around the lung so it can expand fully. If the pneumothorax is large, a chest tube will be placed between the ribs into the space around the lungs to help with draining the air and allow the lung to re-expand.

“In such an instance, you could need to stay in hospital. In some more extreme cases, patients may need lung surgery.”

Happy Birthday, baby girl!","To my littlest love, on your first birthday:

Tomorrow you turn one and my heart feels as though it could explode. In all honesty, I have dreaded this day. This year has flown by, each month faster than the last, each day a blur. I tried to stop, or at least stall time repeatedly. Tomorrow is a milestone for us both, and one that I celebrate for you, but mourn for me. Tomorrow you will be considered a toddler, and my baby days are over. You are my last baby.

You have grown so much this year despite my best efforts to slow you down. I begged you to stay little, but you grew anyway. I pleaded with you to stay curled up on my chest, as you rolled off. I longed for you to stay still, as you crawled away and played with your toys instead. I was convinced I was all you'd ever need, but you found comfort and entertainment in your siblings, your daddy, the nanny... and #allthesnacks.

Tomorrow, you are one. But, here I sit, in the shadow of your bedroom window nursing you to sleep. I stare at your cheek, the outline of your ear, your fine wisps of hair, your eyelashes. My heart aches knowing these days are numbered. ""I will breastfeed until they are one,"" I said about each of my babies. Tomorrow, you are one. I am officially abandoning that idea — I am not ready; and neither are you. We have made up the rules as we go, changing them along the way! You have given me grace, sweet baby. You have done everything slower than your brother and sister, and for that I am endlessly grateful.

Tomorrow, you are one. Soon, you won't need me to cuddle you to sleep. Soon, you won't need me to comfort you in the night. Soon, you won't need me to nourish you in a way only I can do. Soon, you will walk, and you will run. Baby girl, soon, you will fly! You will chase after your brother and sister, and then your dreams. Soon, you will be your own person, doing your own things. I will be your biggest cheerleader, your endless supporter.

Tomorrow, you are one. Today, tomorrow and every day, as long as I live, I will love you and cherish you. You have added so much love and joy to our family. I never knew something was missing, until you filled the space. I never knew I had so much love to share until you and your brother and sister taught me the infinite ability of my heart to grow. When you were born, it grew: it grew, and it grew, and it grew! So today, filled with love to the point of explosion, I know it has the ability to grow a little more.

Tomorrow, you are one.

Tomorrow. You. Are. One. I still can't believe it.

But today, you are not yet one. Today, you are still my baby.

In the words of the subtly ingenious Robert Munsch, ""As long as I'm living my baby you'll be.""

Happy Birthday, baby girl!

Love always,

Mom.

Ihre Haut ist dünn und verletzlich. So wie die Flügel eines Schmetterlings. Es gibt nur wenige Momente im Leben der Zwölfjährigen, in denen sie ihre Krankheit vergessen kann. Die meisten davon erlebt sie an einem Ort, der im ersten Moment nicht danach klingt, als könnte es für ein an Epidermolysis bullosa leidendes Mädchen ein Happy Place sein: auf dem Rücken eines Pferdes.

Knöpfe oder Nähte, kleine Stöße. Dinge, die uns im Alltag begleiten und passieren können, stellen für Alinas Haut eine enorme Gefahr da. Eine unbedachte Bewegung, ein Moment der Unachtsamkeit – und schon reißt ihre Haut auf. „Unser Leben ist ein einziges Aufpassen“, sagt Alinas Mutter, Michaela Schierholz. Kleinigkeiten, die gesunde Menschen kaum kümmern, können für ihre Tochter gravierende Folgen haben. Selbst in der Schule. Wenn sie zu lange am Stück schreibt, fängt ihre gesamte Hand an zu bluten.

Und dann äußert Alina den Wunsch, reiten zu wollen. Reiten. Einer viel größeren Gefahr könnte sich Alina kaum aussetzen. Wo doch selbst der Gartenschlauch im heimischen Garten, über den sie im vergangenen Sommer gestolpert war, für Wochen voller Kummer und Sorgen gesorgt hatte. Doch auf dem Rücken von Therapiepferd Maggy ist die Zwölfjährige ein ganz normales Mädchen. Nur ein kleines Fell, das auf dem Sattel liegt, und zu harte Stöße dämpfen soll, unterscheidet sie von anderen pferdeverrückten Fast-Teenagern.

„Wenn ich auf Maggy reite, merkt sie sofort, wenn ich unsicher bin. Dann hält sie sofort an.“ Alina findet ihr Glück auf Maggys Rücken. Und allmählich ist auch Mama Michaela deutlich entspannter, wenn sie zum Reitunterricht fahren. „Anfangs bin ich tausend Tode gestorben“, erzählt sie. Immer hatte sie bange Fragen im Hinterkopf: Was passiert, wenn Alina vom Pferd fällt? Was, wenn im Stall etwas passiert? Passiert ist in den anderthalb Jahren, in denen Alina nun schon Reitunterricht nimmt, aber noch nichts.

Michaela Schierholz vertraut nicht nur Maggy, sie sieht auch, wie das Reiten ihre Tochter verändert hat. Alinas Gleichgewichtssinn hat sich deutlich verbessert. Die Folge: Sie fällt seltener hin als noch vor der Verwandlung zum „Pferdemädchen“. Und selbstbewusster ist die Zwölfjährige geworden. Nicht nur in der Arbeit mit dem Pferd. Sondern generell. „Maggy ist einfach toll“, sagt Alina. Das zarte Mädchen und das massige Kaltblut. Ein Bild voller Gegensätze – und voller Liebe.

Porträt: Reit-Therapiezentrum der Stiftung Synanon Berlin

Einmal in der Woche, immer freitags, fahren Alina und Mama Michaela auf den Hof der Stiftung Synanon in Berlin-Frohnau. In dieser Einrichtung werden unter anderem Suchtkranke betreut. Und seit drei Jahren wird dort auch heilpädagogisches Reiten angeboten. 13 Kinder und 3 Erwachsene mit unterschiedlichsten Krankheiten nehmen hier regelmäßig Reitunterricht. Autisten, Querschnittsgelähmte, Gehörlose, eine Frau mit multipler Sklerose und Alina.

Sie alle vereint, dass sie ein Leben leben, das sich zu einem großen Teil in Arztpraxen, Krankenhäusern und bei Physiotherapeuten abspielt. Doch der beste Therapeut, darin sind sich alle einig, heißt Maggy. Die 18-jährige Tinker-Stute ist eins von drei Therapiepferden auf dem Hof. Fernab vom Großstadt-Lärm schafft dieses sanfte Wesen etwas, das ihren Reitern weder Ärzte noch Medikamente geben können. Einen Moment der Freiheit, in dem sie den Augenblick genießen – und ihre Krankheiten keine Rolle spielen.

Auch Reitlehrerin Petra Mächold sieht, dass sich Alina in den vergangenen anderthalb Jahren verändert hat. „Ihre ganze Körperhaltung war zusammengekauert. Sie hatte permanent Angst, sich zu stoßen.“ Wer heute sehe, wie selbstbewusst und gerade Alina auf dem Pferd sitzt, könne sich kaum vorstellen, dass sie einmal anders gewesen ist. Was Alina beim Reiten am meisten Spaß macht? „Galoppieren natürlich! Da fühl ich mich so herrlich frei.“

Das einzige Manko: Hippotherapien werden nicht von Krankenkassen übernommen. Weil laut Bundesministerium für Gesundheit „ein therapeutischer Nutzen der Hippotherapie nicht nachgewiesen ist und die Therapie daher als nicht verordnungsfähiges Heilmittel zu führen ist“. Das heißt: Betroffene, die diesen Weg der Therapie gehen wollen, müssen ihn aus eigener Tasche bezahlen oder versuchen, ihn über Spenden zu finanzieren.

Directed by Raja Krishna Menon, who previously directed the Akshay Kumar blockbusterAirlift, Chef, is a film about Roshan Kalra, an Indian chef, working abroad. Roshan gets fired for assaulting a White man who had complained about the quality of food served. The chef who has a son back in India travels to Kochi to spend some time with him and learns that his ex-wife, a professional dancer, is dating a rich landlord. What ensues is a journey of self-realization for Roshan as he tries to start afresh while desperately trying to mend his old relationships. With a cast that also includes Padmapriya Janakiraman, Sobhita Dhulipala, Svar Kamble, Milind Soman, and Chandan Roy Sanyal, Chef is a remake of a 2014 American film of the same name, directed by Jon Favreau.

Although Chef is a modern slice-of-life film it offers much more. Without relying heavily on flashbacks, the movie succeeds in presenting us with the back stories of the key characters. For example, we are told how a young Roshan had run away from his house with the dream of becoming a cook and struggled to survive until he finally fulfilled his dream. This is achieved quite effectively through voiceovers, dialogues, and without any flashbacks. It is precisely what a film likeJab Harry Met Sejallacked. Today, Bollywood films are breaking free of the conventions while experimenting with more unconventional narrative tropes.

Chef is a cute little film about life, and what it takes to follow one's dreams. Saif Ali Khan shines in this flawed film marred by occasional pacing issues. The acting is solid all around. Chef features some memorable performances from the likes of Padmapriya Janakiraman, Svar Kamble, and Milind Soman. The film features a cameo from a promising young actor named Abhishek Kumar who is quite active on the Delhi theatre circuit, certainly one to look out for. Perhaps, the only weakling in the acting department is actress Sobhita Dhulipala who fails to match the intensity she exuded inRaman Raghav 2.0. The screenplay is rather weak but the direction and cinematography more or less make up for what the film lacks in the writing department. Chef is not your run-of-the-mill commercial entertainer but it is certainly a film that has enough to keep one engaged for the most part.

EU-Unterhändler Barnier beklagt eine ""Blockade"" der Gespräche durch die Briten

Der angestrebte Zeitplan gerät in Gefahr

Die Brexit-Verhandlungen haben ihr erstes Etappenziel klar verfehlt. Es gebe nicht genug Fortschritt, um die wichtige zweite Phase der Gespräche zu starten, stellte EU-Unterhändler Michel Barnier am Donnerstag fest.

Im Streit über die Schlussrechnung beim EU-Austritt Großbritanniens sprach Barnier gar von einer ""Blockade"". Brexit-Minister David Davis betonte hingegen, es gebe ""erhebliche Fortschritte"". Er appellierte an die EU, die Verhandlungen jetzt auszuweiten.

Der endgültige EU-Austritt der Briten steht bereits fest: Ende März 2019 will das Land die Europäischen Union verlassen. Ursprünglich wollten die Unterhändler wichtige Fragen der Trennung bis Mitte Oktober klären und danach über die künftigen Beziehungen sprechen. In nun mehr fünf Verhandlungsrunden gelang das aber nicht.

Barnier hofft auf Fortschritte

EU-Chefunterhändler Michel Barnier. Quelle: dpa

EU-Unterhändler Barnier sagte, er hoffe auf entscheidende Fortschritte in den kommenden zwei Monaten. Gelingt dies nicht, würde ein umfassendes Austrittsabkommen immer unwahrscheinlicher - ein Szenario, das vor allem die Wirtschaft auf beiden Seiten fürchtet.

Knackpunkt sind finanzielle Forderungen der EU für gemeinsam eingegangene Verpflichtungen in der mehr als 40-jährigen Mitgliedschaft des Vereinigten Königreichs.

Die britische Premierministerin Theresa May habe zwar versprochen, finanzielle Zusagen einzuhalten, sagte Barnier. In der fünften Verhandlungsrunde sei dies seit Montag aber nicht konkret unterfüttert worden. ""In dieser Frage stecken wir in einer Blockade"", kritisierte der EU-Vertreter.

Brexit-Minister Davis stellte klar, dass Großbritannien die finanziellen Zusagen erst im Zusammenhang mit den künftigen Beziehungen verhandeln wolle. In diesem Punkt sind sich beide Seiten also noch nicht einmal über die Abfolge einig.

Rechte der EU-Bürger in Großbritannien

Brexit-Minister David Davis. Quelle: dpa

Darüber hinaus ging es auch in dieser Runde um die künftigen Rechte der rund 3,2 Millionen EU-Bürger in Großbritannien und der 1,2 Millionen Briten in der übrigen EU. Hier stellten beide Seiten Fortschritte fest, aber auch noch viele Unstimmigkeiten.

Das gleiche gilt nach Darstellung von Davis und Barnier bei der Frage, wie die künftige EU-Grenze zwischen Irland und dem britischen Nordirland durchlässig gestaltet werden kann.

Davis machte deutlich, dass er die von der EU gewünschte Aufteilung in zwei Phasen nicht mehr akzeptiert. Der EU-Gipfel solle nächste Woche beschließen, Barniers Verhandlungsmandat auszuweiten, sagte er. Dass dies geschieht, gilt als sehr unwahrscheinlich.

Die 27 bleibenden EU-Länder geben sich bisher nach außen sehr einig. Sie sehen die Abfolge vor allem als Hebel, die Finanzforderungen durchzusetzen. Andernfalls würden sofort Milliardenlöcher im noch bis 2020 laufenden EU-Finanzrahmen klaffen.

""Kein Deal wäre ein sehr schlechter Deal""

Die zweite Phase der Verhandlungen dürfte dann aber noch komplizierter werden - deshalb will man sich dafür auch mehr Zeit nehmen. Dabei geht es um die von Großbritannien gewünschte ""tiefe und besondere Partnerschaft"" - also vor allem ein Handelsabkommen, aber auch die Zusammenarbeit in Sicherheits- und anderen Fragen.

Darüber hinaus soll über eine Übergangszeit gesprochen werden, um den Bruch für die Wirtschaft, aber auch für Bürger und Behörden sanfter zu gestalten.

Bis Oktober 2018 soll eigentlich alles in einem umfassenden Austrittsabkommen geregelt sein, das rechtzeitig vor dem Brexit Ende März 2019 ratifiziert und in Kraft gesetzt werden soll. Gelingt der Übergang in Phase zwei nicht bald, wird dieser Zeitplan zunehmend unrealistisch. Die britische Premierministerin Theresa May vertritt öffentlich die Ansicht, kein Abkommen sei besser als ein schlechtes.

Die EU verweist hingegen auf mögliche chaotische Folgen - von langen Staus an den Grenzen bis zu hohen Einfuhrzöllen auf beiden Seiten.

Supprimer les allocations familiales pour les plus riches afin de les redistribuer aux plus modestes.

Depuis que son gouvernement a confirmé la suppression de l'ISF, Emmanuel Macron a désormais l'étiquette ""président des riches"" qui lui est collée dans le dos. Ses troupes cherchent donc le moyen de gauchiser l'image et certains imaginent que le budget de la Sécurité sociale (PLFSS) est le bon prétexte pour rééquilibrer celle donnée par le projet de loi de finances.

L'idée est simple: continuer à donner 32,87 euros par mois à un foyer qui gagne environ 8000 euros par mois (65 euros quand on gagne environ 6000 euros) n'a aucun sens alors que cette somme représente beaucoup pour une personne au Smic. ""C'est une bonne question"", a convenu Edouard Philippe ce mercredi 11 octobre au soir lors de l'échange qu'il fait chaque semaine avec des internautes sur Facebook.

Olivier Véran met les pieds dans le plat

C'est Olivier Veran, ex-député PS et rapporteur spécial de la commission des affaires sociales qui a lancé le débat en premier. Il veut poursuivre le travail engagé par François Hollande et Marisol Touraine qui ont diminué le montant versé aux familles les plus riches, soulevant alors de grandes interrogations et une levée de bouclier, essentiellement à droite. Dans Le Figaro, fin septembre, le député de l'Isère a affirmé vouloir supprimer les allocs pour ceux qui touchent plus de 6000 euros par mois pour les redistribuer aux familles modestes, en particulier pour les familles monoparentales.

Il ajoutait aussitôt qu'il n'est cependant pas question de mettre ce sujet en débat dans le PLFSS mais se dit favorable à une réflexion sur le sujet.

Seulement, selon les informations du HuffPost, la suppression de cette universalité était bien prévue dans la première mouture du PLFSS préparée durant l'été par Bercy. Une option rejetée par Emmanuel Macron qui ne veut pas se lancer dans un tel chantier au détour d'un débat budgétaire. C'est ce qu'il a rappelé lundi 9 octobre lors d'une réunion à l'Elysée avec les membres En Marche de la commission des Affaires sociales. Et qu'Edouard Philippe a répété ce mercredi soir. ""On va se poser cette question, mais après un vrai bon débat, et pas simplement le soir au détour d'un amendement budgétaire qui n'aurait pas été complètement mesuré dans ses implications"", a confirmé le premier ministre.

""Pas autant un symbole de gauche que cela""

""Nous sommes ouverts au débat, c'est pourquoi j'ai initié une mission sur la refonte plus globale de la politique de la famille et pas seulement le versement des allocations familiales"", précise Brigitte Bourguignon, la présidente de la Commission des Affaires sociales. La création de cette mission qui réfléchira par exemple à la question du quotient familial a été officialisée il y a quelques jours.

Mais pourquoi donc, une telle hostilité alors même qu'Emmanuel Macron n'est pas opposé par principe à la suppression des allocations familiales pour les plus riches et que Bruno Le Maire a fait part de son ouverture sur le sujet?

""Ce n'est pas autant un symbole de gauche que cela, répond un bon connaisseur du dossier. A la gauche de la gauche, on y est opposé car revenir sur l'universalité des allocs, c'est revenir sur le consensus de 1945 qui a prévalu à la création de la Sécurité sociale et qui fait que tout le monde a droit aux allocations, en partie pour encourager à la natalité"".

Ne pas toucher à l'universalité des allocations est en effet la position que défendait par exemple Pierre Laurent, le patron du PCF lors du débat initié par le gouvernement précédent. Ce mercredi encore c'est Ségolène Royal qui faisait par de son hostilité alors même qu'elle appartenait au gouvernement qui a ouvert la brèche.

Un amendement présenté par des ""kamikazes""?

Lancer le débat dès maintenant, ce serait courir le risque d'ouvrir un front des mécontentements à droite, où la fronde conservatrice promet d'être importante, mais aussi à gauche ce qui réduirait considérablement l'effet recherché.

Pourtant, malgré les mises en garde des deux têtes de l'exécutif, Le HuffPost a appris que plusieurs parlementaires de La République en marche ne comptent pas suivre à la lettre la consigne présidentielle. Un amendement devrait bien être déposé par une poignée de députés qui veulent aborder la question dès cet automne. ""Ce sont des kamikazes, déplorent-on en haut lieu. Je pense que nous arriverons à ramener certains à la raison mais il y a tellement de brèches que ça parait impossible de toutes les colmater.""

En clair, le débat que le gouvernement espérait reporter de quelques mois pourrait bien avoir lieu dans les prochains jours.

""Nous modifierons la loi pour inverser la formation du prix qui partira du coût de production"" a déclaré le chef de l'Etat à mi-parcours des Etats généraux de l'alimentation, à Rungis.

L'ambition du président est de trouver les moyens de mettre un terme à la paupérisation de la profession agricole, tout en répondant à la forte nécessité de transformation du secteur pour répondre aux attentes sociétales et environnementales des Français. ""Nous devons repenser collectivement une nouvelle France agricole"" a-t-il lancé aux agriculteurs, industriels, distributeurs et élus réunis sur le marché de gros de Rungis.

La loi devrait être présentée et adoptée via des ordonnances ""au premier semestre 2018"" a dit le président de la République, en souhaitant une ""transformation profonde"" du secteur, et en exigeant que chaque filière de production agricole (lait, viande, céréales, etc..) lui présente ""d'ici la fin de l'année"" sa ""stratégie"".

""Nous ne devons pas avoir une approche uniforme"", il continuera d'y avoir une ""pluralité productive"", et des ""dynamiques régionales"" qui doivent rester fortes, a-t-il ajouté en citant le bio, les labels, les régions, et notamment les ""territoires ultramarins"", qui seront ""accompagnés"" dans cette transformation. ""Je souhaite que la distribution et les industriels participent"" à ce travail, a-t-il précisé.

""Arrêt"" de certaines productions

Sur le plan technique, la décision de relever le seuil de revente à perte (SRP) de la grande distribution, très attendue par les agriculteurs, dépendra du bouclage des stratégies de chaque filière. Le seuil de revente à perte est le prix minimum en dessous duquel les distributeurs n'ont pas le droit de vendre.

Le président a réaffirmé son engagement de campagne d'atteindre ""50% de produits bio ou locaux d'ici 2022 en restauration collective"", un objectif qui va permettre de modeler, selon lui, les schémas de production en France et relancer l'agriculture et l'agroalimentaire. ""Vous devez vous organiser dans les territoires pour changer les modèles productifs"", a-t-il dit.

Ce changement de paradigme passe par un ""arrêt"" de certaines productions, qui ne correspondent plus au goût des consommateurs et ne s'inscrivent pas dans la concurrence internationale. Emmanuel Macron s'est engagé à clarifier le droit à la concurrence, les agriculteurs étant tétanisés par le risque d'être accusés d'entente commerciale comme c'est arrivé par exemple pour ""le cartel des endives"".

Il a aussi cherché à rassurer les éleveurs et producteurs de viande bovine, inquiets des négociations commerciales en cours avec les pays du Mercosur en Amérique Latine, en indiquant que selon lui cette négociation ne pouvait pas aboutir sur la base d'un mandat donné en 1999.

GANDHINAGAR -- The Gujarat High Court on Monday commuted the death sentence to 11 convicts, in connection with the 2002 Godhra train burning case, into life imprisonment.

On 1 March, 2011, the special SIT (Special Investigation Team) had convicted 31 people under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections related to murder, attempt to murder and criminal conspiracy. It had acquitted 63.

Out of these 31, 11 people were sentenced to death. 20 were sentenced to life imprisonment.

Those acquitted included the prime accused, Maulana Umarji, the then president of Godhra Municipality, Mohammad Hussain Kalota, Mohammad Ansari and Nanumiya Chaudhary of Gangapur, Uttar Pradesh.

Around 58 people lost their lives when the S-6 coach of Sabarmati Express was torched at the Godhra Railway Station on 27 February, 2002. The incident had triggered large-scale riots in Gujarat in which around, reportedly, 1,000 people were killed.

The Nanavati Commission appointed by the Gujarat Government into the Godhra incident had concluded that the fire in the S-6 coach of the Sabarmati Express was not an accident and that it was set ablaze.

The Gujarat High Court completed hearings on the case in 2015.

Last week, the Gujarat High Court gave the then Chief Minister Narendra Modi and 60 others a clean chit in the case, citing lack of ""prosecutable evidence"" against them.

During their chat, Winslet talked about how she took the reins during a sex scene between her and Elba, since she had more experience in the area than her co-star or their director, Hany Abu-Assad.

And that’s when Winslet learned something new about Elba. While Winslet was directing, Elba had one simple request.

“‘Keep your socks on,’” the actress recalled Elba telling her. “I’m like, keep my socks on? Everything else is off. What’s with the socks?”

She then revealed a deep truth about Elba. “He was like, ‘I got a foot thing.’”

Elba immediately followed up her statement by saying to Norton, “I got a thing, you know. Just a thing.”

These days, interracial relationships are incredibly common. According to Pew research, about 17 percent of new marriages and 20 percent of cohabiting relationships are interracial or interethnic. And about one-quarter of Americans have a close relative in an interracial marriage.

The numbers of interracial unions may be rising, but couples in the relationships still encounter a lot of questions ― and some of them are straight-up rude. Below, interracial couples share 10 questions and misconceptions they’re sick of hearing.

1. “You don’t date within your own race?”

“I get asked this question frequently from other members of my community and it frustrates me. Yes, I have dated black men and I’ve dated other minorities as well. I don’t have a preference when it comes to the color of my partner’s skin; I looked more for compatibility and personality when I was single ― something I wish other people would take the time to learn. All that matters at the end of the day is that you and your partner see eye-to-eye on most of the important issues in this life. I know race can affect people’s opinions on those topics, but for us ― and probably for others in most interracial relationships ― it never becomes a big problem.” ― Vladimir Sabajo, who lives in New York City and runs the YouTube channel VladixDean with his partner Dean Carter

2. “Is your home life different because of your differences?”

“We’re not your average heteronormative couple, but we still interact with each other in almost the same manner. We have shared interests, we share cleaning responsibilities around the house, and we even have the occasional disagreement just like any two people living in close quarters. The fact that we are both men and are both from different racial backgrounds does not affect our daily life as much as most people assume. For instance, we both hold steady jobs but many people assume that because I’m white and feminine, that Vladimir takes care of me financially. It’s a mindset that is rooted in both misogyny and racism: It’s based on the idea that black skin equates to hypermasculinity and that white skin equates to fragility. This kind of thinking dehumanizes both parties and creates unnecessary stereotypes that can be damaging to relationships.” ― Dean Carter

3. “Wow, you look so exotic.”

“Do you really need to double take every time we hold hands? We don’t feel like we look that shocking, and we’re certainly not interesting enough to be gawked at in public. The stunned staring is really unnecessary, and honestly pretty disturbing when you’re on the receiving end of it. We’re not on display, we’re just a couple.” ― Ariana Offray, who lives in Los Angeles, California and runs the YouTube channel Ariana Raw with her partner Hannah Glover

4. “Are the cultural differences a problem?”

“Cultural differences aren’t a negative thing. We’ve found that they’ve made our relationship stronger and helped us grow as individuals. They haven’t torn us apart.” ― Bethany Struble, who lives in Los Angeles California with her partner Peter Adrian Sudarso and runs the YouTube channel Bethany Struble Vlogs

Peter Adrian Sudarso Peter and Bethany

5. “What do you have in common?”

“We’re of different races but one of the main reasons we get on so well as a couple is because of how similar we are. We have similar values, mindsets and interests. If anything, being in an interracial relationship actually shows you how likeminded you are to someone of a different race.” ― Kimmy Kimani, who lives in the U.K. and runs the YouTube channel James and Kimmy with her partner James Alexander Hobbs

6. “Do you want kids who look like you?”

“People (even within our own families sometimes) ask us if we will adopt babies that ‘looks like us.′ Thing is, we are already an ‘unconventional’ family and we are aware that our family will look different anyway. Hence we do not care for the ethnicity of our children. They will be loved and welcomed like any other child would be in any other family.” ― David Levesque, who lives in Toronto, Canada and runs the YouTube channel HueDavid with his husband Huey Tran

7. “Are you going to have babies? Mixed babies always look cute.”

“Yes, our kids will be cute if we so chose to have them but that’s because all babies are cute. Our baby being ‘mixed’ doesn’t make them any cuter than someone else’s child.” ― Harsh Patel, who lives in New Jersey and runs the YouTube channel Harsh and Des with his partner DesTynee Covington

Harsh Patel Harsh and Des

8. “You’re married to a white man. Does he make more money than you? ”

“First off, thanks for assuming that I would marry a man based off his income. Second, do you think a man of another race is not capable of making a lot of money? Third, do you think white men are so undesirable that the only way I’d be interested was if they were wealthy? This is by far the worst question I’ve been asked about being in an interracial marriage because it’s loaded with not only one but many insults. I married this man because I love him...end of story.” ― Jackie Iadonisi, who lives in Los Angeles with her husband Nick Iadonisi and runs the YouTube channel Jackie’s Adventures

Jackie Iadonisi Jackie and Nick

9. “Don’t you deal with so much prejudice?”

“Yes, we live in a globalized world now, but not everyone is open to the idea that two different worlds could come together in the name of love. This is hard, but we don’t take it personally when other family members need a moment to digest our relationship. We’ve learned that some might be overly joyed and fascinated by an interracial couple, while others might take longer to accept or have their prejudices dissolved.” ― Henrik Stenberg, who lives in Sweden and runs the YouTube channel Henrik and Rachel with his partner Rachel Otieno

Henrik Stenberg Henrik and Rachel

10. “Isn’t it so hard dealing with different backgrounds?”

“At the end of the day, our differences are not a big a deal. We are in a relationship, just like everyone else. It’s really no different. In some ways, it’s harder and in some ways, easier, but that’s mostly because of who we are as people, not necessarily what backgrounds we come from. The same way you may not like being stared at and questioned about your lifestyle (or personal life), neither do we. We do understand that we stand out visually, but at the same time, realize we are people doing people stuff...just like you. It might not be that exciting or exotic to hear but really, it’s the truth.” ― Wendy Joseph, who lives in New Jersey with her partner Daniel Hennessey and runs the YouTube Channel Wendy’s Curls",10 Things Interracial Couples Wish You'd Stop Asking Them,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/interracial-couples-wish-youd-stop-asking-and-wondering-about_us_59dce1dae4b0b34afa5c869b

In what does not bode well for the senator in this citizen by descent case, the Justices have been repeatedly questioning relevance, ""where this argument is taking us?"", ""what are we getting out of this?"" and ""can you bring us up to date?""

Justice Bell sums up the mood as regards to Malcolm Roberts' legal argument: ""What are we getting out of this?"" #Citizenship7 — Adam Gartrell (@adamgartrell) October 12, 2017

Now remember, the High Court has previously found, under cross examination, Roberts -- who was born in India in 1955 to a Welsh father and an Australian mother -- was a dual-British citizen when he nominated and was elected in 2016.

This is already a technical breach of Section 44 of the Constitution, but the full bench of the High Court is still to rule on the case of Roberts as well as the six other federal politicians; Barnaby Joyce, Matt Canavan, Fiona Nash, Nick Xenophon, Larissa Waters and Scott Ludlam.

Roberts is attending the High Court on Thursday and his legal representative, Robert Newlinds QC, quickly argued that the previous cross-examination of the senator had ""misfired"" and there has been ""nonsense arguments"" and then, essentially described the potential for kicking him out of parliament for being an Australian immigrant as ""un-Australian"".

The QC for the anti-immigration party argued to the High Court's full bench, there should not be a distinction between Australian born citizens and Australian immigrants or foreign born Australians, that being born overseas was almost irrelevant.

Anything else for Newlinds was ""a fundamentally un-Australian notion"".

What was he? Well it was put that it does not matter that he was born in India, in fact, it was a ""dangerous distraction"".

""We are here because he father is welsh, No one is suggesting he was an India"".

Justice Virginia Bell asked, ""is it your submission that Senator Roberts is a natural born Australian? Newlinds flung his hands in the air and responded, ""he is a natural born Indian, whatever that means"".

The Commonwealth argues politicians born overseas should have been aware there was a risk they were dual citizens.

But Roberts lawyer then claimed that the UK was not a foreign power, or at least has only been one since 1986, but this change in view had happened without ""flag-waving and clarion calls."" His assertion was that Roberts was a British subject, but also Australian.

Newlinds says the UK didn't become a foreign power until 1986, suggested in previous High Court cases #Citizenship7 — Matthew Doran (@MattDoran91) October 12, 2017

The key here, for Roberts and his team, was that Roberts father came to Australia in 1962 as a British citizen and became an Australian solely by ""setting up a domicile"".

That, it is argued how things were done back in the day for British subjects.

The other back in the day argument was that body politic - or general Australian population - in the 1970s did not view Britain a ""foreign power"", so Roberts was ""entitled to put of his mind that he was a British citizen.""

The senator, Newlinds said, always thought he was an Australian and in 1994 his dad came home with a citizenship certificate and he ""did not think it was a big deal"" and he did not get any extra rights or duties.

Newlinds saying the moment Roberts got a citizenship certificate, he didn't gain any extra rights or duties #Citizenship7 — Matthew Doran (@MattDoran91) October 12, 2017

The argument exasperated the justices who urged a hurry on during the third and final day of hearings into the dual citizenship statuses.

How does this take us to 2016, when Roberts nominated for parliament while knowing he was a dual citizen?

Justice Bell wanted to know.

""Putting to inside what people may or may not have thought, we are to determine this on the facts that have been found. It is just unclear to me where this argument is taking us?"" she asked.

Roberts put that It would be different Roberts had stood for nomination in 1987, but, Justice Bell, said in exasperation, ""we are dealing with a nomination in 2016?""

It was tendered he knew prior to 1974 that he was a British citizen, but Newlinds said Roberts did not know in 2016 he was British citizen, but he had the ""wit to think he might be"".

""His state of mind was embedded and set in 1974 and it doesn't change,"" nNewlinds told the court.

It is then, he argued, that Roberts took ""reasonable steps"" to renounce citizenship. It just happened to be after he nominated and had tried email accounts that were non-existent.

The Justices want to get to 2016. At one point, it was put ""we are in 1898, we have a long way to (get to 2016).""

The Chief Justice Susan Kiefel stated in frustration, ""I don't understand the relevance to the case,"" ""what are we getting out of this?"" and ""can you bring us up to date?""

Because with an estimated 1 in 6 people in the UK experiencing a common mental health problem every week, according to The Mental Health Foundation, this is a conversation that lots of people need to be having.

But at what point should you start sharing? And what reaction can you expect?

Dr Anshumen Bhagat, GP and founder of the doctor-on-demand app GPDQ, says: “Healthy relationships are built on trust and honesty. If a relationship is getting serious, it would be important to continue deepening that trust by sharing who you really are with your partner, including mental health.”

So we asked three experts, and two people who have been through the experience themselves, to answer the questions you need answering.

How soon should you discuss your mental health?

It might seem too personal to share on the first date, or even the second, but once you are more comfortable and committed to each other is probably the right time. “Bring it up when the relationship starts to feel important to you,” says Relate counsellor, Barbara Bloomfield.

A spokesperson from Anxiety UK agreed that there is no deadline but it is about when you feel comfortable: “Some may feel ready to talk straight away, for others it may take weeks or even months.”

Shea Wong, who has bipolar disorder, and is a supporter of ‘Time To Change’ tells HuffPost UK: “Each relationship is different, so don’t feel as though your medical disclosures have to occur on a certain time frame. I chose to approach it from an emotional standpoint - my feelings were strong enough and I was considering a future with someone - then is a good time to begin discussing your mental health issues, especially if they are chronic.”

How should you bring up the conversation?

Dr Bhagat recommends that before you dive right in (or get drunk and decide to launch into an emotional rant), why not write down the things you want to share so you are prepared?

“Always remember, those who haven’t ever struggled with mental health issues won’t understand it fully, so it may take a while to explain.”

Once you have your ideas together, find a time when you’re not going to be interrupted and are in private, so you can be candid and explain fully.

How should you phrase that conversation?

“You could start by discussing your relationship with your own mental health, how you’ve learned to live with the condition and what makes you feel better,” says Bloomfield.

If you want to angle the conversation so you can gauge their reaction before putting all your cards on the table, then she suggests asking: “Do you know many people with mental health problems?”

When you bring it up, speak with confidence and without shame.

How much should you be sharing with them?

Once you’ve started sharing, you might find it difficult to know when to stop.

Wong, explains that based on her own experience, you should be thinking of yourself as an educator teaching a student.

“You don’t want to overwhelm them, but at the same time you don’t want to be so stingy with details that they fill in the blanks with their own pre-conceived ideas,” she says.

“Give a general overview of the illness: What it does to the brain, how it generally affects you, how you handle it, and then encourage them to ask questions as they are ready to take on more info. Always leave them understanding that there are no bad questions, and you are here to help them understand.”

What do you want to achieve by telling your partner?

One thing you might want to consider before telling your partner, is what you want their response to be, and how you hope this might help you or change the way you deal with your illness or relationship.

Gina Hadden, 33, who has OCD, says that telling her partner Sam helped her to gain knowledge and educate herself about getting the right help.

“He encouraged me to be open about my illness so now I bring awareness to it and write about it publicly.”

But one thing you must be aware of, is making sure you aren’t looking for your partner to solve your problem. Dr Bhagat says: “Ultimately, only you are responsible for your behaviour and for managing your mental health. It’s completely okay to ask your new partner for support, but don’t make them feel responsible, as this could add pressure and strain to the relationship. The best thing to ask for is their patience and understanding, as you work out how to deal with it together.”

How do you deal with your partner’s reaction?

Everyone hopes that the person will be accepting straight away, but that’s not always realistic. Some people may have prejudices and may not be willing to give you a chance, others may need a little time to comprehend what you’ve told them.

Dr Bhagat said: “Try not to expect a certain reaction, but just be prepared for lots of questions and do your best to help them understand.

“If the reaction isn’t what you hoped for, don’t blame yourself, and most importantly, don’t let that put you off telling other prospective partners.”

Help To Buy Will Help To Bury Home Ownership, And The Tories' Hopes For A Political Resurgence With It Tackling the housing crisis will take time, reform won't deliver immediate benefits and will need longer than one parliamentary term to make a real difference. Yet instead of offering the bold reform needed the Conservatives have gone for the easy option. But Help to Buy is not the answer, instead it will help to bury the next generation's aspirations for home ownership and the Tories' hopes for a political resurgence with it.

The Conservatives Have Run Out Of Ideas Of How To Repair Our Broken Justice System Crisis after crisis rocked the justice system this summer.

The Road To Hell Is Paved With Good Intentions On the face of it, Universal Credit is a good idea. The benefits system is ridiculously complex, simplifying it is common sense. Except people are not simple, they don't fit into boxes. My sister-in-law and my brother could not have more different needs, experiences and circumstances. The idea that one (fairly inflexible) thing could simply suit them both is a system designed by someone who has not met a very broad range of people.

Tory Conference Diary, Day 2: More Evidence That The Government Have Run Out Of Ideas Party Conferences are traditionally an opportunity for each side to have their moment in the sun.

Auch Gwyneth Paltrow und Angelina Jolie beschuldigen den Mann

Doch nun ergreift Ex-Teeniestar Lindsay Lohan für ihn Partei

Dass Hollywood-Produzent Harvey Weinstein mittlerweile untragbar ist, sollte eigentlich außer Frage stehen. Immerhin haben sich in den vergangenen Tagen fast 30 Frauen zu Wort gemeldet und angegeben, von dem Filmmogul sexuell belästigt worden zu sein. Zu den Betroffenen zählen auch bekannte Schauspielerinnen wie Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie und Ashley Judd.

Believe women. (via @amandadecadenet) Ein Beitrag geteilt von HuffPost Women (@huffpostwomen) am 10. Okt 2017 um 14:05 Uhr

Doch Ex-Teeniestar Lindsay Lohan, bekannt aus Filmen wie “Girlsclub” oder “Ein Zwilling kommt selten allein”, schlägt sich nun auf die Seite von Weinstein. In einem Video, das die heute 31-Jährige auf Instagram postete, verurteilt sie den Gegenwind, den der Produzent gerade von allen Seiten erfährt. “Harvey Weinstein tut mir sehr leid. Ich finde das, was gerade gegen ihn läuft, falsch”, sagt Lohan in die Kamera.

Man sollte meinen, es sei eine gute Sache, wenn Männer, die ihre Machtposition missbrauchen, um Frauen zu belästigen, zur Rechenschaft gezogen werden. Während Donald Trump, gegen den im November ähnliche Vorwürfe erhoben worden waren, es trotzdem bis zum Präsidenten der Vereinigten Staaten gebracht hat, wurde Weinstein inzwischen von seinem eigenen Filmstudio gefeuert.

Lohan: “Er hat mich nie belästigt”

Die Vorwürfe gegen Weinstein werden täglich mehr. Doch Lohan hält fest: “Harvey und ich haben mehrere Filme zusammen gedreht und er hat mich nie belästigt.” Anscheinend ist es für die Schauspielerin unvorstellbar, dass nicht jeder Mensch dieselben Lebenserfahrungen gemacht hat, wie sie.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: An den Mann an der Ampel, der mich fragte, ob ich Sex mit ihm will

Aber: Sie erkennt nicht nur die Vorwürfe der Frauen, die Weinstein beschuldigen, nicht an. Nein, sie kritisiert auch noch seine Frau Georgina Chapman, die sich inzwischen von ihm getrennt hat. “Ich finde Georgina sollte zu ihrem Mann stehen.”

Zwar hat Lohan das Video später gelöscht, doch “Buzzfeed”-Autorin Lauren Cap hatte es bereits heruntergeladen und auf Twitter veröffentlicht.

Derweil haben sich Hollywoodgrößen wie Meryl Streep klar von Weinstein distanziert. Jennifer Lawrence, die für den von Weinstein produzierten Film “Silver Linings Playbook” 2013 einen Oscar bekam, sagte: “Diese Art von Verhalten ist absolut abscheulich und unentschuldbar.”

Jamie Lee Curtis, die in der Teeniekomödie “Freaky Friday” Lindsay Lohans Mutter spielte, veruteilte Weinsteins Handlungen in einem HuffPost Blog. Gleichzeitig erhofft sich die Schauspiel-Ikone, dass sich dadurch etwas in unserer Gesellschaft ändert. “Vielleicht werden weitere sexuelle Belästigungen ans Tageslicht kommen - sei es von einem Politiker, dem Präsidenten, einem Regisseur, Filmstar, Manager oder irgendeinem anderen, der sich in diesen beschissenen ""Milliardär-Männer-Club"" einreihen kann, der bald zu einem armseligen Ende kommen wird!”

Y los humoristas de la gran revista satírica francesa, que son de los editorialistas más serios y heroicos del mundo, en la diana del fanatismo y el yihadismo internacional, sentencian. ""Los catalanes, más tontos que los corsos"".

Ante el desafío de la Generalitat, Mariano Rajoy por fin ha dado el paso que se le demandaba: ha activado el artículo 155 (¿y concordantes?) de la Constitución para intervenir la Generalitat y encarrilar a la región catalana de vuelta a la legalidad constitucional.

Al margen de las reacciones de la 'corte de los milagros' separatista, aún aturdida por el imprevisto zig-zag de su asimismo imprevisto pequeño timonel, es insufrible el cinismo de la galaxia podemita cuando se pone beatífica, angélica e inocente. Da igual que sea el núcleo que se agrupa alrededor de Pablo Manuel Iglesias, o esa sinuosa, ambigua y verborreíca Ada Colau, que cansada de tanto poner una vela a Dios y otra al diablo ha acabado por ponérsela a sí misma. Vayamos primero con el caudillo de 'Podemos', el hombre orquesta del populismo que se ha apoderado de aquel movimiento espontáneo, transversal, bienintencionado aunque cabreado, que fueron las mareas de indignados.

Aquella operación de trasvase de la indignación de los de abajo hacia una organización al estilo bolchevique fue como un ensayo del estraperlismo de Convergencia, que logró convertir, con los más tradicionales instrumentos de la retórica y la mentira, un estado de malestar ciudadano contra ellos en un sentimiento 'nacional' de humillación. La carta escondida en la manga de Artur Mas era la independencia como elixir milagroso...y oportuna cortina de humo antes de que en 2018 desaparezca el secreto bancario en Andorra.

Cuando un grupo sedicioso da, o intenta dar un golpe de Estado, sea cual sea el ámbito de la sublevación, y romper la unidad nacional consagrada en las leyes que rigen a ese Estado, unas leyes democráticas, una Constitución sometida a referéndum y votada masivamente, hay que dar por supuesto la reacción represiva y de autodefensa del Estado. El 'alzamiento' marca el punto de ruptura unilateral del diálogo, tal como se concibe el diálogo en las democracias: dentro de las instituciones y con sometimiento a las normas. ¿Alguien se imagina que en vez de que el Rey Juan Carlos pusiera en posición de firmes y a la orden a los Capitanes Generales y altos mandos de las FAS y el gobierno se subsecretarios, presidido por Francisco Laína, mandara entrar en el Congreso a liberar a los diputados secuestrados el 23-F el Estado hubiera negociado con Tejero una reforma de la Constitución para asemejarla al Fuero franquista?

La democracia es algo más prosaico y reglado: consiste en que se respeten las normas que caen en cascada, desde la Constitución hasta las leyes de la circulación.

Hay que acudir a los maestros de la ciencia política, por ejemplo, a los consejos de Maquiavelo: ""El que tolera el desorden para evitar la guerra (o la revolución, apunto yo), tiene primero el desorden y después la guerra (o la revolución, insisto)"".

Ante la hábil campaña de intoxicación y propaganda de los nuevos golpistas, apoyados por el habitual pirateo informático ruso de la era digital, procede dejar clara una cosa principal: Es falso que el voto sea la única exigencia democrática, la palomita de la paz constituyente. El espíritu santo democrático. Y que cualquier salida para atajar la rebeldía tiene que pasar por un consenso con los rebeldes para cambiar a su gusto las reglas del juego. Decía De Gaulle que lo importante en política es sentar un precedente. Y si en la política española se sienta este precedente, el país sería absolutamente ingobernable e imprevisible. Los actuales niveles de excentricidad se convertirían en simple subnormalidad. Según Paracelso, ""el veneno es la dosis"", y aumentar el porcentaje de estupidez más allá de los límites del postureo esnobista nos llevaría al caos irremediable. Pedro Sánchez debería reflexionar sobre ello.

La democracia es algo más prosaico y reglado: consiste en que se respeten las normas que caen en cascada, desde la Constitución hasta las leyes de la circulación.

Llegados al punto de la insurrección, el Estado actúa siempre de la misma forma: advirtiendo primero, y empleando después la fuerza que el Gobierno de la nación está legitimado para utilizar, de manera proporcional a la amenaza. Nunca la fuerza puede ser inferior al riesgo, porque en ese caso, el riesgo crece en proporción directa, corregida al alza, a la incapacidad de disuasión y neutralización de la amenaza. Y ante una declaración unilateral de independencia por parte de los golpistas, sea a plazos o en diferido, que nadie se rasgue las vestiduras: es jurídicamente inevitable la detención de los cabecillas y sus colaboradores. Y, ver los tanques en la calle si la situación lo requiriera.

¿Dónde está el cinismo insufrible de Pablo Manuel Iglesias y los suyos? En que actúan igual que los curas que le dicen a los feligreses que someten a controversia su comportamiento, ""no hagas lo que yo hago, sino lo que yo digo"".

Gracias a YouTube y al invento mágico de los 'smartphones' no se ha podido ocultar por los conspiradores la realidad de las provocaciones, los insultos, la desobediencia, las agresiones tumultuarias de la masa convertida en populacho a los agentes de la Autoridad, el desacato abierto y desvergonzado a los tribunales, las leyes tomadas a pitorreo callejero, las amenazas y agresiones a policías y guardias civiles, los piquetes que empezaron a dividir en dos a la ciudadanía catalana, creando las condiciones objetivas para una guerra civil 'blanda'....

Ahora el desafío es imponer la Ley y el orden y revisar lo que se ha hecho mal para hacerlo bien, empezando por el principio: ajustar las tuercas del sistema autonómico.

¡Hay que dialogar!, claman aún, pese a las evidencias, las almas puras y bondadosas. La policía, en todos los países, no está para dialogar. No es esa su función, sino la de los políticos. El diálogo tiene sus cauces, que al agotarse abren la puerta a la disuasión, primero, y a la represión, después. El operativo del Estado cumplió todos los trámites: el presidente del Gobierno –con independencia del análisis sobre la gestión de la crisis, que se remonta a hace más de una década- advirtió repetidamente de que el Estado actuaría en defensa de la unidad de España y de la Constitución y del Estatuto de Autonomía de Cataluña, con todos los medios a su alcance. Si no le creyeron ese es el problema de los incrédulos, o los hipócritas; lo mismo advirtió el Tribunal Constitucional y la Fiscalía General; luego, el gobierno envió cuatro mil agentes antidisturbios de refuerzo, a bordo de dos buques de crucero utilizados como 'casas cuartel' flotantes. Los heridos o contusionados por las porras lo fueron porque se encontraban en franca rebeldía haciendo frente a las fuerzas de la ley y el orden.

No hay duda a estas alturas del enredo de que la progresión de la desestabilización era la estrategia diseñada por los 'autores intelectuales' de la subversión, que consumaron el primer acto de la enésima parte del golpe en el preciso momento en que el Parlament aprobó las leyes que derogaban de facto la Constitución y el Estatuto, y encajonaron la democracia entre paréntesis.

Todos los países europeos han tenido, en algún momento, que recurrir a la porra, a la formación policial cerrada, inventada por las legiones romanas, para defender el orden constitucional y la seguridad de todos sus ciudadanos. Lo tuvieron que hacer en la Europa crispada por las tácticas desestabilizadoras y expansionistas de Moscú en la 'guerra fría. El Kremlin movió como peleles a los bondadosos y altruistas pacifistas durante la 'crisis de los misiles' desatada por... la URSS al romper el 'statu quo'. Aquellas algaradas – como las de Mayo del 68 en París- fueron reprimidas según métodos estrictamente profesionales, que, lógicamente, ocasionaron más lesiones y tropezones que el método bondadoso de isopos con agua bendita. La disolución de grupos neonazis en Alemania, siempre acaba con contusionados. Lo mismo que las protestas por los recortes en Atenas sin que Podemos, o los restos de IU, pidiera beato espíritu misionero. Cada reunión del G-20 es una nueva ocasión de comprobar cómo actúan las unidades especiales de la policía de los diferentes países sedes hasta conseguir el control absoluto de la situación. Ahí tiene Rufián un buen álbum de fotos para ilustrarse, aunque lo que ""natura non dat, Salamanca non prestat"".

La verdad es que la porra al servicio de la democracia ha contribuido decisivamente a proteger las libertades de las sociedades europeas. El problema es que todo tiene que hacerse en su momento, y sin complejos. Y aquí se ha dejado pasar irresponsablemente el tiempo. Ahora el desafío es imponer la Ley y el orden y revisar lo que se ha hecho mal para hacerlo bien, empezando por el principio: ajustar las tuercas del sistema autonómico para que la descentralización no desemboque en reinos de taifa y en anarquía. Porque la subversión comenzó, como un calabobos, cuando por simples cuentas de equilibrio electoral se toleró el primer chantaje nacionalista y cuando se miró para otro lado mientras se sembraba el odio y la mentira.

Ahora, a ajustar el Sistema, con 'seny'.

External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj has made a name for herself by coming to the help of Indians trapped in difficult situations in a foreign country, and foreigners with a similar plight in India. People have taken to tweeting at her, knowing that there's a good chance she will spot their appeal and direct her ministry to take action.

The latest beneficiary of this is a 24-year-old Russian who was forced to beg outside a temple in Kanchipuram, Tami Nadu, due to an unfortunate banking incident. According to a report in The Hindu, A. Evangelin has been travelling through India since 24 September. On Tuesday, 10 October, he arrived in Kanchipuram in Chennai. When he tried withdrawing some money from an ATM, somehow, his card got blocked, leaving Evangelin with no money to fend for himself.

Left with no option, Evangelin decided to join the beggars outside a temple so he could raise some money. The incident was reported to the local police, who promptly arrived at the temple to investigate.

On seeing his travel documents and a valid visa, a sub-inspector gave him Rs 500 to help him go back to Chennai and contact the Russian Consulate for help, reported India Today. On learning of Evangelin's plight through the papers, Swaraj quickly tweeted, ""Evangelin - Your country Russia is our time-tested friend. My officials in Chennai will provide you all help.""

However, yesterday, on 11 October, a Russian Consulate official told PTI that Evangelin had not contacted them, nor had he answered their calls to his mobile phone when they tried to contact him. If he gets in touch, ""We will assist him in a proper way,"" PTI quoted Yury S Belov, Vice-Consul (press and public relations) of the Russian Consulate as saying.

In another incident, yesterday, Swaraj directed the Indian Embassy in Riyadh to reach out to an Indian woman who claims to be in danger in Saudi Arabia at the earliest after a video of her begging for help from Bhagwant Mann, the Aam Aadmi Party's MP from Sangrur district in Punjab, started circulating online.

In the video, the woman cries uncontrollably as she details her torture at the hands of her employers for the past one year. She claims that she has been living in Dawadmi, located about 200km from the capital city of Riyadh, as a slave and is ill-treated and fears for her life. She also alleges that when she managed to escape and went to the police for help, they too beat her up and took her back to her employers. She pleads with Mann to rescue her, the way he had helped other Indians trapped in a similar situation.

Earlier this year, in June, Mann had, with the ministry of external affairs, helped rescue and bring back 20 Indian youths stuck in Saudi Arabia in deplorable conditions after receiving an SOS video from them on Facebook.

Mann is aware of the woman's call for help — he retweeted an Aaj Tak news report about the video — but as of now, there has been no statement on the matter from him.",Sushma Swaraj Comes To The Aid Of Russian Man Spotted Begging Outside Kanchipuram Temple,http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/10/12/sushma-swaraj-comes-to-the-aid-of-russian-man-spotted-begging-outside-kanchipuram-temple_a_23240835/

The comments come as a separate poll found that more than nine in 10 health and care leaders across England are “concerned” about their organisation’s ability to cope this winter.

NHS England boss Simon Stevens last month warned hospitals to be prepared for a “pressurised” flu season following a heavy outbreak in the Southern Hemisphere during winter there.

Mr Stevens said the health service was reviewing the situation in Australia and New Zealand, where hospitals were forced to close their doors to new patients and people faced long waiting times.

But Dr Scriven said that despite talk of preparations, doctors on the frontline feel as though there is “nothing new other than crossed fingers”.

“Over the last two to three years we haven’t had to deal with any major outbreaks of infection such as norovirus or flu, but this year we are predicting a bad flu season that will overwhelm us after what we’ve witnessed in Australia and New Zealand,” he said.

“For all the talk of preparations, on the ground it feels as though nothing’s new this year other than crossed fingers – which is fair comment as the government has failed to tackle effectively the issues behind the pressures we face.”

“If, as we expect, we see a flu outbreak, I think the NHS – in terms of both beds and clinical staff – will break far worse than last year and elective activity will almost certainly cease for several months.”

Meanwhile NHS Confederation surveyed 131 health leaders – including chief executives and non-executive directors of organisations including NHS acute hospital trusts, community services and mental health trusts – to find out how concerned they were for their organisation’s ability to cope during the forthcoming winter.

It found that 57% admitted they were “extremely concerned” while an additional 35% were “concerned”. Just 8% said they were confident their organisation would cope well throughout the season.

“The health and care system in England is in a fragile state and it is fair to say many organisations will struggle to meet expectations over the next few months,” said Niall Dickson, chief executive of NHS Confederation – a membership body for NHS providers and commissioners.

“Last year it was said that the service was ‘just about coping’, but for many of our members this year looks more challenging.

La mesure, à l'étude depuis plusieurs mois au sein des services de la mairie, a été annoncée aux représentants des divers groupes politiques lors du comité de pilotage du Plan Climat de la Ville. Elle s'inscrit dans le cadre des initiatives amorcées lors de la Cop21, où plusieurs grandes capitales ont pris l'engagement d'atteindre 0% d'émissions de CO2 d'ici 2050.

""Dans le cadre de l'élaboration de son nouveau plan climat air énergie territorial, la Ville de Paris va inscrire un objectif de fin du diesel sur son territoire en 2024 et de l'essence en 2030"", déclare-t-elle dans un communiqué.

La capitale devancerait ainsi l'objectif du gouvernement qui a annoncé en juillet la fin des ventes des véhicules essence et diesel pour 2040. ""Si l'on veut qu'il soit atteint, cela implique que la sortie du diesel et de l'essence intervienne plusieurs années avant en zone urbaine, et en particulier dans les grandes villes"", précise la mairie dans son communiqué.

""Le temps presse""

""Nous avons planifié cette sortie des véhicules thermiques"" parce que ""le temps presse tout simplement"", a confirmé sur franceinfo le maire-adjoint chargé des transports Christophe Najdovski. ""L''idée c'est de planifier à long terme la fin des véhicules thermiques, donc des énergie fossiles à un horizon 2030. Il s'agit d'une stratégie qui vise à définir une ville neutre en carbone à moyen et long terme"", a-t-il déclaré, affirmant que la mairie se plaçait dans une position d'anticipation.

Cette disparition programmée des voitures à essence se ferait en faveur des véhicules électriques et du développement des transports en commun, avec notamment la création du Grand Paris. Comme le précise franceinfo, rien n'est encore joué cependant. Le plan climat doit encore être étudié avec l'ensemble des mairies d'arrondissement début novembre, avant d'être présenté et débattu au Conseil de Paris, aux alentours du 20 novembre.

Mais la mesure risque de faire grincer des dents les automobilistes parisiens, déjà ulcérés par les diverses initiatives de la maire PS, qui souhaite limite au maximum la présence des voitures de particuliers dans la capitale.

Not first loves, but coming out - to a parent, best friend or sibling, perhaps. It's something many of us remember quite vividly in fact, if tales from friends and total strangers are anything to go by. These are, after all, moments that will go on to shape our experiences of the world, our relationships and ourselves.

I can still relive, with crystalline clarity, the time I told my older sister 13 years ago, aged 16. A freezing January morning, the two of us were smoking on the bench outside our parents' house, blowing that dense, unending winter smoke that appears twice as thick because of the condensation on your breath. I often struggle to remember what I did three weekends ago. Yet somehow, even the most insignificant details from my outing remain wholly in focus: like the fact we weren't sitting on the bench, but on the frail backrest, our feet where our backsides should have been; or that I was sitting to the left of my sister, staring dead forward through the garden and into the field beyond, not wanting to make eye contact as I collected myself to say those words: I'm gay.

She was, and always has been, awesome.

Roll on a couple of years and it was mum's turn. Driving home from halls after the first term of university - giddy and exhausted from those immersive first weeks as a fresher where you get to recast your identity, fuelled by alcohol and free of the shackles of expectation. I felt some comfort also knowing that in a week or two I'd be back in halls, away from any potential awkward feeling.

So I told her. And sure, it was harder than telling my sister which is perhaps why it took a full two years longer to do. While my sister had expressed excitement at being able to tell her friends she had a gay brother (2004's hottest accessory, clearly), mum was a little more cautious - accepting, absolutely, and certainly not surprised, but maternally fearful that her son might live on the margins, unhappy, childless and alone. Things had been different when she was my age, and any concerns she aired came only from a place of love (and love is all she's shown me ever since).

Even after we'd arrived home and parked in the pitch-black driveway, we continued to talk, and afterwards I asked her to keep quiet, to give me a little time before crossing the last person off the big list: my father.

My relationship with my father was always a good one. The older I got, the more it developed from one of father-son to something closer, resembling a friendship. Sunday lunches and afternoons spent in the pub, drinking and smoking together, concocting weird and wonderful recipes using black pudding. He took an interest in my life at university and my life in general. So why was it so hard to come out to him?

Looking back I guess there were a number of reasons. As the only son perhaps I felt I had a duty to uphold - a precious relay baton that carried the genes and the family name was being passed to me, the same way I, my dad and grandfather all have John somewhere in our names. And my gayness meant somehow dropping that baton, and he might be the most let down.

Couple this with casual, everyday homophobia that was - and still is - so rife, not just in school but everywhere, and it's no surprise that many young gay men grow up battling feelings of shame and inferiority. These are feelings that would boil fervently to the surface whenever the time came to discuss my own sexuality with the important men in my life, and telling my father was the pinnacle I'd work towards, the more confident I became.

When it comes to building confidence and putting off important things, there's really no place like university. Miles from home I could live openly and honestly, trickle feeding only the necessary information back - grades, swimming personal bests, batshit escapades from a year abroad in Paris and Russia, more black pudding recipes. But never the fact I was gay. The time was never right.

But the plaster needed to come off. What if I met someone, for example? Four years of university were drawing to a close, and had given me enough 'coming out practice'. Soon I'd be back home. No more hiding. Time to come out.

Then three weeks before the end of university, in May 2010, dad suddenly died. During the final running leg of a triathlon the walls of his heart - thickened from years of Iron Man training - constricted, triggering something akin to a fatal heart attack. And needless to say, from that Sunday on, everything changed. All priorities that dominated the everyday - final exams, graduation ceremonies, a love life, finding a job - suddenly became inconsequential, worthless.

Grief is processed in a million different ways, and I'm by no means an expert, but in the context of a death without warning, one thing you're forced to analyse, sometimes agonisingly, is the final communication you had with the deceased. Bluntly, did they die while you were on good terms? Had you fought? If you had one more chance - one final pint down the pub - what would you talk about? I count myself lucky (relatively speaking, of course) in that we had left on great terms having celebrated his birthday a month before. I still have the thank you letter he sent me.

My family also penned letters that would go into his coffin the morning of his cremation, along with hairs cut from our dogs, a few rollies and a bottle of homemade sloe gin that the undertaker later removed and gave back to us because of regulations (we were ultimately grateful to have the bottle to hand as we said our final goodbyes). Writing that letter though, locked in my room, was the first time since he passed that I truly allowed myself to cry loud and uncontrollable tears. And among these most final words, coming out, unsurprisingly, didn't feature.

In fact, I never thought about it again until about three years later when an ex asked at 4am and quite out of the blue whether I missed my father. It seemed like an odd question really, because of course I did, but for the first time the two worlds collided: Dad would never meet this guy that I was so crazy about, or any guy for that matter. In a few seconds I had pictured the whole thing. They would have got on, shared an enthusiasm for endurance sports (the thing that ultimately had killed him) and whisky, probably. They'd have taken the piss out of one another and what had been a sticky subject would be instantly smoothed, laughed over. It would finally feel natural and good and now I'd never know it and neither would dad, so of course I drunkenly fell to pieces.

And now on this day each year I ask myself again: Why was it so hard to tell him while he was alive?

Perhaps I didn't give him enough credit. I know in my heart of hearts that he would have been cool, and maybe that's the hardest thing to reconcile. That's who he was: cool and funny. A natural born crowdpleaser. While I'm fortunate now to be surrounded by the best friends, family and colleagues someone could ask for, it makes me angry that I wasn't strong enough while I had the chance.

""I am still me, but this is who I love."" It's that simple. Why did that feel at times like the hardest thing to say; it should be one of the easiest.

Something that should only be celebrated - love - can feel like a source of shame. So much so that it robbed my father of truly knowing who I was, and stopped me from having a more open relationship with him. And it's bullshit. Being LGBTQ means being part of something amazing and anyone who says otherwise is wrong. There is no shame. There's equally no shame in waiting to share this part of yourself, because it belongs to you.

It's been seven years since we lost dad, and I'll be 30 next week, so I guess this is a little belated catharsis - a reminder to myself to never hide, a way of making up for missed opportunities, or, dare I say, an attempt to impart whatever wisdom the last seven years might have taught me. Because I wish I knew then what I know now - that it gets much, much easier.",I Never Came Out To My Dad.

Although Du Plooy's lawyer tried to justify his bail saying that his client was not a flight risk and would be safer at home, the magistrate decided to deny bail.

The case will resume on October 19.

Du Plooy's lawyer said his client felt threatened at the time and that was why he resorted to shooting at Tshukudu and his friends.

However, investigating officer Captain Ratane Monyai said it was not possible for the group to have posed a threat to the accused because there were no signs of damage to his bakkie. Monyai said Spense and his friends were trying to direct cars to avoid the protesters.

""Where the shooting incident was, there was no rioting,"" he said.

The officer then said the accused should not be granted bail because his life could be in danger as community members are still extremely angry.

“Because I was being stitched up on theatre still, she held my daughter before I even got to,” she continued. “I’m so angry and upset about this.

She explained she had a long recovery due to complications during the birth so only now, six weeks on, has she really had a chance to process what happened that day.

The lack of awareness of this growing problem is a big issue. shutterstock.com

Breast cancer is a growing epidemic in India. It could kill 76,000 women a year by 2020, according to a recent study. It claimed more than 70,000 lives in 2012. At the heart of the issue is the country's rapid economic development, which has made Indian women more susceptible to the disease, without building the infrastructure to prevent and detect it. But the good news is that boosting breast cancer awareness and encouraging early detection could play a significant role in reducing it.

India's rapid economic expansion has it forecast to become the world's fourth largest economy by 2020 and set to surpass China as the world's fastest growing economy. This feat of development has lifted millions out of poverty. But economic growth has brought with it other challenges – including breast cancer.

Growing risk

Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide and represents 25% of all cancers in women. In fact, there appears to be a link between breast cancer and development. Developed economies in the West such as in North America and Oceania rank at the top of the rates of incidence.

So, India's development brings with it new health risks for women. In Western countries, breast cancer incidence increases with age, whereas in India, the rate of incidence seems to affect the urban working women demographic the most (China is experiencing a similar trend). The blame for this catastrophe seems to lie with India's economic development and rapid urbanisation.

Modern day India's booming economy has led to rapidly expanding numbers of women in education who go on to pursue careers. This has led to the Westernisation of Indian women in a way that increases their risk of developing breast cancer: urban Indian women who work start having sex later, have fewer children and breastfeed them less than their rural counterparts – all factors which increase the risk of developing the cancer, over a lifetime. These women also tend to have a more Western diet, which leads to obesity, another factor that increases the risk of breast cancer.

To make things worse, a recent study showed that these women seek medical care extremely late – despite the fact that they are better educated and, to a certain extent, have greater economic independence. The reasons for this appear to be poor awareness of the early indicators of breast cancer and a lack of knowledge about how to self-examine. They also have limited access to helpful information. Altogether this results in a delay in seeking care and diagnosis.

My research with colleagues Vijay Pereira and Munyaradzi Nyadzayo also suggests that cultural issues may be a factor in why women do not access health services. Some are reluctant to consult male doctors. Many women are also dependent on other family members to get the required medical help because breast care is still a culturally taboo subject and rarely discussed. This often results in delays in seeking help.

The way forward

There are both economic and moral reasons to address this issue. Urban, working women – the group that is most at risk of breast cancer – play a significant and growing role in India's burgeoning economy. Many are employed in new technology and telecomms industries that have sprung up as a result of foreign direct investment from Western firms.

India also has a larger economic value at stake from advancing gender equality than other emerging economies. A report by financial services firm McKinsey found that employing more women in the workforce would add US$2.9 trillion to the country's annual GDP by 2025. So if a healthy female Indian workforce is a strategic advantage in sustaining its thriving economy, the Indian government has another reason to take ownership of women's healthcare.

Legally the Indian Constitution guarantees everyone's ""right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health"". Further, an Indian citizen's right to health, is integral to the right to life, which is also enshrined in the constitution. So the government has a legal obligation to provide health facilities.

By changing the current health policy to include early planning of breast cancer awareness campaigns the Indian government could initiate an important strategy to reach women at risk. Our research into the issue shows the government should invest in community nurses because they are more effective than national advertising campaigns. Through their local community knowledge they gain the trust of husbands and fathers in overcoming cultural barriers to promote self-examination and encourage the women in their families to seek early diagnosis.

Der Befreiungskampf um Mossul hat die einstige Hochburg des IS stark verwüstet

Die Altstadt ist zerstört - und die Menschen kämpfen um ihr Überleben

Khaled al-Dschaburi kann sich noch genau daran erinnern, wie dieser Platz früher aussah. Dort drüben die Gemüsehändler, daneben Restaurants und Cafés, das Leben pulsierte.

""Es war immer voll hier, das ist das Zentrum Mossuls"", sagt der grauhaarige Mann mit einer Stimme, die von Zigaretten heiser geworden ist. Er ist hier aufgewachsen, er hat hier gespielt, er kannte jeden Winkel. Bab al-Tub, wie der Platz heißt, war seine Heimat.

Jetzt blickt Khaled nur noch auf zerbombte Häuser, die entstellten Skeletten gleichen, auf Berge aus Schutt und Steinen, staubig, grau und leer.

Khaled ist noch immer fassungslos. ""Es ist sehr schwer zu glauben, dass all das hier passiert ist"", krächzt er, als er mit seinem Wagen weiter durch die Trümmerlandschaften Mossuls fährt, wo er als Projektmanager des UN-Entwicklungsprogramms arbeitet.

Mossul war einst wichtigste Hochburg des sogenannten Islamischen Staates (IS) im Irak. Nach dem Sieg gegen die Terrormilz liegen weite Teile in Trümmern. Die Altstadt ist kaum noch zu retten - und die Menschen kämpfen täglich ums Überleben.

""Die schlimmste Schlacht seit Stalingrad""

Ein Kämpfer einer schiitischen Miliz in Mossul

Die Millionenstadt im Norden des Irak war drei Jahre lang das Zentrum der Terrormiliz IS. Von hier aus überrannten die Extremisten im Sommer 2014 große Teile des Landes. Hier zeigte sich IS-Chef Abu Bakr al-Bagdadi in der Großen Moschee das erste und einzige Mal öffentlich, um ein ""Islamisches Kalifat"" auszurufen.

Als vor einem Jahr die Offensive irakischer Sicherheitskräfte zur Befreiung Mossuls begann, ahnten viele, dass es ein langer und schwerer Kampf werden könnte. Sie sollten Recht behalten.

""Das war seit Stalingrad die schlimmste Schlacht in einem urbanen Zentrum"", sagt ein internationaler Helfer, der ungenannt bleiben möchte.

Besonders schwer haben die Kämpfe, Granaten und Bomben den Teil Mossuls getroffen, der westlich des Flusses Tigris liegt. Die Straßen führen vorbei an zertrümmerten Häusern, in denen sich Schutt türmt, die Fensterscheiben zerschossen, riesige Löcher klaffen in den Wänden. Manche Gebäude haben die tragenden Mauern verloren und sind wie tot zur Seite gekippt.

Die Altstadt ist ein Geisterviertel

Auch drei Monate nach dem Sieg über den IS in Mossul riegeln irakischen Sicherheitskräfte die Altstadt im Westteil ab, wo sich die Extremisten bis zum Schluss verschanzten. Unter den Trümmern verbergen sich unzähligen Sprengfallen, die IS-Anhänger dort versteckt haben.

Auf dem Weg zur Großen Moschee liegen Autos und Kleinlaster in einem Krater übereinander gestapelt, wohl die Spuren eines Luftangriffs der US-geführten internationalen Koalition.

Doch es ist nicht nur der Anblick von zerstörten Häuser und zertrümmerten Wagen, der unheimlich wirkt. Das Inferno des Kriegs hat die Altstadt in ein Geisterviertel verwandelt, leer von Menschen, von Grün, von Leben, von Hoffnung. Über den Straßen liegt eine verstörende Stille, eine beängstigende Ruhe nach dem Sturm.

""Wo sollen wir hin?""

Muaijad Dschasim geht mit seiner Familie durch die zerstörte Altstadt von Mossul. Quelle: dpa

Eine Familie - Vater, Mutter, kleiner Sohn - läuft einsam über eine der Straßen. Sie wohnten da drüben in einem Trümmerhaus um die Ecke, sagt Muajad Dschasim, graue Haare, tiefe Falten im Gesicht, 47 Jahre alt. ""Wir haben keinen anderen Ort"", sagt er. ""Wo sollen wir hin?""

Während in Ost-Mossul langsam das Leben zurückkehrt, gleicht der Westen einer toten Stadt ohne Strom und Wasser. Für die Altstadt gebe es praktisch keine Hoffnung mehr, sagt der internationale Helfer.

Zu sehr hätten Kämpfe und Luftangriffe das Gebiet zerstört: ""Das lässt sich nicht mehr reparieren. Es muss von Grund auf neu aufgebaut werden. Die irakische Regierung muss eine Entscheidung fällen.""

Jahrzehnte von Aufbauhilfe liegen vor den Menschen

Das UN-Entwicklungsprogramm UNDP geht davon aus, dass 15 Viertel im Westen der Stadt, einst Heimat für 250.000 Menschen, völlig zerstört sind. Rund eine Milliarde Euro seien nötig, nur um die lebenswichtigste Infrastruktur in Mossul wieder instand zu setzen.

Das UNDP-Wiederaufbauprogramm, eines der größten in seiner Geschichte, konzentriert sich zunächst auf Strom- und Wasserwerke, Krankenhäuser, Schulen sowie Straßen. Um den Menschen etwas Arbeit zu geben, finanziert es Straßenreiniger.

Deutschland ist dabei nach den USA der größte Geldgeber für das Programm. Das Entwicklungsministerium gibt unter anderem Geld für das Trinkwassernetz und den Wiederaufbau der Universität.

Trotz der Hilfe dürfte es Jahre, wenn nicht Jahrzehnte dauern, bis in viele Viertel West-Mossuls Leben zurückkehrt. Auch im Allgemeinen Krankenhaus dort gleicht die Arbeit einem täglichen Kampf ums Überleben. Was dort fehlt?

""Beim letzten Mal dachte ich, sie töten mich""

Hassan Ibrahim, Leiter des Allgemeinen Krankenhauses in West-Mossul. Quelle: dpa

Klinik-Leiter Hassan Ibrahim, 60 Jahre alt, muss überlegen: ""Ich weiß gar nicht, wo ich anfangen soll.""

Er habe kein eigenes Budget, sagt Hassan Ibrahim, sondern sei abhängig von Geldgebern aus dem Ausland, Katar hat einiges gespendet, Deutschland gibt ebenfalls Geld. Doch es herrsche akuter Mangel an Medikamenten, um die Hunderte von Patienten zu versorgen, die täglich kämen, sagt Mediziner. Nutzen können die Ärzte ohnehin nur das Keller- und Erdgeschoss.

Die oberen Etagen sind zerstört vom Krieg, die Wände schwarz und verbrannt, das Dach von Granaten aufgerissen, der Fahrstuhl läuft seit langem nicht mehr.

Allerdings sind das nur die materiellen Schäden. Die verletzten Seelen der Menschen schmerzen wahrscheinlich noch mehr.

Der IS habe seinen Bruder und Neffen getötet, sagt Hassan Ibrahim. Ihn selbst hätten sie vier Mal vor Gericht gezerrt, wegen ""unsinniger"" Vorwürfe. ""Beim letzten Mal dachte ich, sie töten mich"", sagt der Arzt. Er flüstert, als er das erzählt. Die Angst ist noch lange nicht verschwunden.

À travers les témoignages inspirants de l'animatrice Kim Rusk, de la chanteuse Marie-Mai, du chef Danny St Pierre, des hommes d'affaires Dominic Gagnon, Étienne Crevier et de l'ancien joueur des Alouettes de Montréal, Étienne Boulay, avoir un TDAH est tout sauf un obstacle.

Health With A Purpose As it stands currently, it seems that the 'good health industry' in all its guises is profiting greatly from distorting our sense of purpose.

Alas Yogi Adityanath, you have failed us.

When the media was filled with gasps of horrors at a fiery sadhu being handed the reins of Uttar Pradesh, I was secretly excited to learn he was only 5'5"".

The most popular adjective used for the new chief minister of Uttar Pradesh was ""diminutive"".

The New York Times called him ""diminutive, baby-faced"". PTI called him ""diminutive, shaven-headed"" as did Indian Express. The Telegraph described him as a ""diminutive figure in saffron"".

As a height-challenged man myself, I secretly root for my equals, the Jyoti Basus and Pranab Mukherjees, the little men who scuttle their way to the top. I revel in their elevation to power and fortune. I mourn when they get elbowed out at the end. I enjoy the thought that their fans and devotees must look down on them in order to look up to them.

This height challenge is not a figment of my insecurity. Anyone following the Donald Trump reality show knows that size matters. It turns out Trump thought Senator Bob Corker at 5'7"" was too short to be his Secretary of State. Now that Corker has uncorked on him to the New York Times, Trump has taken to taunting him as ""Liddle Bob Corker"". It's always a steeper climb to the top for smaller men, at a disadvantage everywhere except in economy class of airlines.

The current government seems especially keen on statues, the bigger the better.

So it comes as crushing news that the diminutive Adityanath also wants to walk in the footsteps of giants. He will gift us a Lord Ram statue which will be 100 metres tall. Et tu Adityanath? Then fall the League of Diminutive Men. The Age of Pranab-da and Jyoti-babu is truly at an end.

I thought the fiery Adityanath was a David who wanted to slay myriad Goliath. But he turns out to want to be a Goliath himself.

Humanity has a thing for big statues all the way back to the Colossus of Rhodes. But it's a curious thing that these days in India we are hellbent on statue building whereas in much of the world we seem to live in an age of statue toppling. The biggest news in the last decade or so when it comes to statues have been about the ones coming down -– the Confederate heroes of the American South, the Bamiyan Buddhas of Afghanistan, Saddam Hussein in Baghdad, Cecil John Rhodes in Capetown, Cecil John Rhodes in Capetown, Mahatma Gandhi in Ghana. One must be careful about statues. Statues are erected to honour one singular figure. They tend to be brought down in a cathartic rage by nameless masses buzzing with anger.

India it seems to want to buck that trend. The current government seems especially keen on statues, the bigger the better. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was 5'5"" in life. But generations to come will remember him as almost 600-feet tall. Chhatrapati Shivaji was 1.68m according to the Internet. But his Arabian Sea version will be taller than the Statue of Liberty at 190 metres. After laying the foundation stone, Narendra Modi tweeted, ""Shiv Smarak is a fitting tribute to him & his greatness."" It's just that we like to measure greatness not just in deeds but in metres and inches. And the latter is easier, more quantifiable, its wow factor better suited for instant gratification. This history being writ large.

In this government's case, this act of magnification seems even more critical, a special kind of urgency. The BJP has always been on the lookout for heroes from the freedom struggle it could claim for itself. Luckily for it, the Congress with its Nehru-Gandhi fixation had pretty much neglected most other giants in that pantheon. The BJP has latched onto Sardar Patel, a Congressman through and through, and blown him up to 600 feet to show their outsized devotion to him. They want to claim him as their big name.

But times have changed. ""Acche Din"" is no longer as shiny a slogan. The government's leaders are scraping for crumbs of compliments from Nobel laureate Richard Thaler who thought demonetisation was a good idea.

But it's also true that in those heady days of 2014, we yearned to dream big after the measured calibration of Manmohan Singh. Prem Panicker writes in Buzzfeed that Modi's messianic arrival was turbocharged.

One day we heard poverty would be eliminated. The next day the Supreme Court was asked to take a quick decision on MPs with criminal backgrounds. FDI decisions. Bank accounts for all. Bureaucracy shake-ups. Black money. SMART. Make in India. Digital India. Donald Trump said ""We are going to win so much you may even get tired of winning."" Panicker writes that looking back at the first heady days of ""Acche Din"", ""it felt like we were already living Trump's boast two years before he articulated it"". The giant statues were somehow in keeping with the giant claims. Make in India and make it big.

But times have changed. ""Acche Din"" is no longer as shiny a slogan. The government's leaders are scraping for crumbs of compliments from Nobel laureate Richard Thaler who thought demonetisation was a good idea. It's truly a crumb of cold comfort since in the very next tweet Thaler had said, ""really? Damn"" when he heard about the Rs 2000 note. Even with a decimated and ineffective opposition, the government is more petulant these days, fighting off querulous elderly marg-pradarshaks in its own midst and university students and octogenarian writers. And it's equally ignominious to have to take shelter in the shade of a Robert Vadra to defend the business of a Jay Shah when you once claimed the moral high ground of a party with a difference.

When small children keep dying in Gorakhpur's hospitals, the Big Ram seems not just incongruous but a misplaced priority. Now the statues increasingly appear to be reminders of ossified hubris, the frozen blimps of ""Acche Din"" promises.

Read more about the Sears Canada story from Samfiru Tumarkin LLP here.","One of our country's longest-running commercial retailers — Sears Canada Inc. — has announced that it will seek court approval to liquidate all of the company's remaining assets, leaving a staggeringly large number of Sears employees wondering what they will have to show for the years of service they gave to the company. The answer, for many, is nothing, and considering how many employees have been and will be impacted by these bankruptcy proceedings, one is compelled to ask how it is possible that this has been allowed to happen.

In June of this year, Sears Canada filed for creditor protection under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act, which allows failing companies the opportunity to restructure their affairs. Once so protected, Sears Canada was legally permitted to engage in mass layoffs without satisfying any of its obligations to provide severance pay.

At the time that it filed for protection, Sears terminated approximately 2,900 employees and paid them nothing. Under Canadian law, terminated employees are not considered secured creditors (i.e. those who would be first in line to be paid upon termination), and if they receive anything at all, it is likely to be pennies on the dollar of what their true entitlements are.

We are not talking about the corporate executive who can make do without a golden parachute and fall back on substantial savings.

Harsh reality for long-serving employees

Now with this most recent announcement, an additional 11,500 employees will be left without a job and without any severance payments to help them survive through what is projected to be a lengthy period of unemployment. Many Sears Canada employees have been with the company for decades, have an outdated resume and now face unemployment in the context of an unfriendly, highly competitive job market.

We are not talking about the corporate executive who can make do with a golden parachute and fall back on substantial savings. We are talking about the 60-year-old man who has worked in the electronics department since he was 35 years old, or the 45-year-old single mother who took a job in customer service straight out of high school — individuals who, without the veil of bankruptcy ""protecting"" Sears Canada from paying severance, would be otherwise entitled to two years of severance pay, inclusive of continued enrollment in benefits plans and receipt of pension contributions.

Hardship fund: adding insult to injury

Adding insult to injury was the establishment of the $500,000 ""hardship fund,"" created by Sears Canada to provide some money to the employees who were terminated in the first round of layoffs back in June. While this initially sounds quite generous for a company that has no legal obligation to provide any payments whatsoever, $500,000 spread over all of their terminated employees amounts to just less than $200 per employee.

Those that do apply and qualify for payments under the hardship fund then find that this nominal amount is characterized as income, which would impact their ability to collect employment insurance and may even lead to repayment obligations if they had already been in receipt of EI when awarded the money from the fund.

Although what has transpired here is not technically illegal, there is a deep, pervasive sense of unfairness here.

Further to all of this is the fact that the hardship fund was also funded by pulling money out of the $9.2 million that was earmarked for executive retention bonuses, which would understandably lead many to ask how it is possible that a company under bankruptcy protection can leave almost nine million dollars in the coffers for executive bonuses while paying their long-serving employees less than $200 as severance pay.

Better protection for employees

Although what has transpired here is not technically illegal, there is a deep, pervasive sense of unfairness here. Such a feeling is generally a sign that something went awry, that our laws do not accurately reflect the values that we hold as a society.

So, what can change? Perhaps the CCAA should be amended such that the termination of employees without severance does not present itself as the cheapest and easiest way for a company to ""reorganize"" its financial affairs. Or terminated employees should be classified as secured creditors such that they are paid out once the company liquidates its assets. Or the directors and officers of these companies should be held personally liable for the unpaid severance of terminated employees in the event that any kind of financial mismanagement can be established as the cause of the insolvency.

There are many possible permutations of a solution to this issue. Unfortunately, none of them will help the roughly 15,000 Sears Canada employees who are being impacted by these proceedings now, but the hope is that we can take our collective sense of unease at what has happened to them, and use that to facilitate enough change such that it never happens to anyone else.

Les autres, je les ignorais.

J'ai entrepris la lecture de divers ouvrages concrets sur la psychologie et la communication interpersonnelle.","Mes pupilles marron ont initialement croisé la lumière du jour en 1966, à cette époque lointaine où la détection et les interventions précoces étaient pratiquement inexistantes. Le mot autiste ne couvrait pas l'éventail multicolore actuel de profils d'individus tout aussi uniques les uns que les autres. Seuls les cas considérés très prononcés d'autisme étaient diagnostiqués pendant qu'enfants et adultes dits « légers à modérés », comme moi, passaient bien en dessous du radar de repérage des professionnels. J'étais âgée de plus de 25 ans lorsque les critères se sont élargis et fixés suffisamment pour inclure de plus en plus de personnes réellement sur le spectre autistique.

Âgée d'aujourd'hui 51 ans, j'ai principalement arpenté mon cheminement solitaire en autodidacte et j'ai appris la vie et l'autonomie par essais et erreurs. Ces dernières se sont avérées malheureusement mille fois plus nombreuses que les succès qui auraient pu m'épargner maintes égratignures sociales et de multiples déconfitures relationnelles et professionnelles. J'ai donc été durant plus de 45 ans ma propre intervenante, mon coach de vie attitrée, mon unique point de référence. La personne que je suis devenue, je l'ai fabriquée sans le moindre mode d'emploi approprié. J'ai avancé à tâtons, sans cane blanche et sans chien guide. Et j'ai toujours trébuché.

J'ai obtenu d'une psychologue spécialisée en autisme, et dépistant particulièrement bien le profil féminin, mon diagnostic d'autiste Asperger.

J'ai obtenu d'une psychologue spécialisée en autisme, et dépistant particulièrement bien le profil féminin, mon diagnostic d'autiste Asperger. Nous étions en l'an 2012, cette année redoutée d'une potentielle fin du monde selon le calendrier maya. Mais pour moi, ce fut ma vraie naissance.

Une gamine solitaire, fermée et mutique

Enfant, j'étais entièrement fermée au monde extérieur, ce qui m'amène à penser selon l'éclairage actuel que mon autisme était alors bien plus prononcé que celui d'une autiste Asperger. Je reviens de loin. De vraiment très loin. Aucun contact social n'était initié de ma part vers mes semblables, peu importe leur âge ou leur attitude envers moi. Les autres, je les ignorais. Ou plutôt, je ne les percevais que d'une manière vaporeuse et immatérielle. Mais je ne ressentais aucun vide ou manque.

J'ai vécu mes années d'école primaire ainsi, parfois accolée en solo à un terne mur de briques rouges dans la cour de récréation, parfois avec quelques camarades tolérant ma compagnie muette.

Durant les années de la petite école, j'ai absorbé de nombreux reproches par mes enseignants sur ma non-participation aux sports d'équipe, aux travaux de groupes et sur mon incapacité à prendre ma place. J'ai vécu mes années d'école primaire ainsi, parfois accolée en solo à un terne mur de briques rouges dans la cour de récréation, parfois avec quelques camarades tolérant ma compagnie muette.

Les remontrances familiales, celles des autres enfants et celles du corps professoral ont été très néfastes pour moi. Je connaissais ainsi trois mille cinq cent quarante-huit pièges à éviter, mais aucune sortie de secours rassurante pour atteindre la lumière au bout du labyrinthe. Je me suis refermée entièrement, comme un coffre dont on verrouille le métallique cadenas et qu'on jette la clé au loin énergiquement à bout de bras. Connecter avec moi était quasi impossible.

Une adolescente à demi-éveillée

À l'adolescence, ma vie a changé. C'est également durant cette période cruciale de développement identitaire que j'ai pris conscience de ma différence, mais sans savoir l'annoter. Je percevais vaguement que je n'étais pas comme les autres adolescentes qui s'éveillaient à la vie adulte. Mais il m'était impossible de mettre un index ou un annulaire sur cette différence.

J'ai entrepris la lecture de divers ouvrages concrets sur la psychologie et la communication interpersonnelle. J'ai expérimenté les méthodes proposées à l'intention des personnes non autistes, mais tout se soldait invariablement par de cuisants échecs. Je ne comprenais pas les bases innées de la communication interpersonnelle chez les non-autistes, les limites tolérées à la franchise trop crue et sans filtre, les mots appropriés lors de situations délicates, la lecture du non verbal qui fait comprendre si on est écoutée, acceptée ou si l'on doit battre en retraite sans demander son reste.

Un mutisme sélectif récidiviste se pointait en plein milieu d'une conversation bien amorcée.

Occasionnellement, une bonne approche de ma part se matéribalisait, puis elle se retrouvait ensevelie sous une multitude de gaffes sociales, de mots trop brusques. Un mutisme sélectif récidiviste se pointait en plein milieu d'une conversation bien amorcée. Puis traumatisée, je fuyais, je refusais les rencontres amicales, les sorties de groupe.

Une adulte en quête de connaissance de soi

Les calendriers annuels se succédaient durant des décennies, sans que je ne concrétise le moindre progrès social. Je ne maintenais aucun entourage hormis mon conjoint et je me dérobais autant que faire se peut à toute occasion de me retrouver en société. J'ignorais à ce stade que l'amalgame conversations légères/bruits ambiants/communication implicite m'épuisait au plus haut point, et ce, dans un intervalle variant de 20 à 30 minutes soutenues. Après, c'était la chute libre, l'effondrement interne et la paralysie.

Jusqu'en 2009, époque où j'ai découvert l'autisme au détour d'une lecture, je naviguais dans un néant total ignorant ma condition autistique. Je survivais, entre deux pertes d'emploi floues pour des raisons non clairement évoquées, mais qui n'étaient pas reliées à mon rendement professionnel confirmé impeccable, entre des mini-amitiés avortées après une seule rencontre qui me laissaient le cerveau saturé de questions sans réponse logique. Ma différence non nommée m'apportait des rejets continuels sur des plateaux d'or et de platine. Je me cloîtrais alors par sécurité dans ma demeure, accolée à mon divan, convaincue d'une unique certitude : j'étais une mauvaise personne. Une créature malsaine.

Avancer seule sans se faire tenir la main

J'ai alors progressé énormément depuis quelques années au niveau de ma manière d'aborder les gens et de maintenir les contacts. Mais ce développement autodidacte est récent. J'avais donc, comme je disais précédemment, appris ce qu'il faut éviter de faire. Je n'avais dans le passé qu'une technique et demie pour m'exprimer : battre lâchement en retraite, mon option favorite, ou attaquer occasionnellement de front, en ligne droite avec effronterie et sans filtre social. Maintenant, je comprends davantage ce qui doit être fait et la manière de communiquer.

Par contre, plus je développe des aptitudes sociales, plus je me « conforme » aux attentes des personnes que je côtoie et qui ne me savent pas autiste, plus un autre piège létal se referme sur mes doigts. Comme on me perçoit d'un premier regard comme étant « normale », la barre des attentes se hisse vers le haut et chaque avancée de ma part m'oblige à cheminer vertigineusement en terrain acide. Cette apparence de normalité devient davantage une problématique qu'un avantage.

Miser sur les forces de l'autiste

Pour moi, un grand questionnement demeure au niveau des interventions et de l'intégration des personnes autistes : pourquoi s'entêter à les « rendre comme les autres? ». Cette demande irrationnelle pour la personne autiste, qui est souvent moins encline à suivre les tendances et à imiter les autres, crée un sentiment d'incapacité et d'inadéquation pour elle.

Il serait alors plus intéressant de viser à l'équiper mieux pour bien fonctionner en société selon ses capacités et selon les besoins sociaux de base.

Il serait alors plus intéressant de viser à l'équiper mieux pour bien fonctionner en société selon ses capacités et selon les besoins sociaux de base. On pourrait ainsi lui permettre de développer ses aptitudes de communication et de gérer ses surcharges sensorielles afin de lui permettre d'avoir un parcours de formation et une intégration sur le marché du travail qui soient satisfaisants et qui lui permettraient de s'épanouir comme tout individu. Mais pas en lui imposant des règles ne correspondant pas à sa nature propre, tout comme la petite conversation autour de la machine à café le lundi matin pour bavarder week-end en famille et recettes populaires.

Un apprentissage par cœur des attitudes à adopter ne lui permet pas la souplesse nécessaire pour s'adapter aux différents contextes de la vie.

On demande actuellement à l'autiste de se conformer à un code de langage qui ne lui est pas naturel, sans lui donner un mode d'emploi qui a du sens pour lui. Un apprentissage par cœur des attitudes à adopter ne lui permet pas la souplesse nécessaire pour s'adapter aux différents contextes de la vie. Pour bien connecter avec lui, il me semble nécessaire de faire une partie du chemin dans sa direction et de parler davantage son langage, au lieu de lui imposer d'avancer dans une société qui lui est étrangère et hostile. Il marche sur du sable mouvant sans aucune perche sur laquelle se raccrocher.

En utilisant ses champs d'intérêt spéciaux, on peut l'ouvrir davantage au monde et l'intéresser à ouvrir ses horizons. À la base, la personne autiste arrive tout équipée avec des acquis intéressants que beaucoup de personnes non autistes tentent de se réapproprier quand elles font du développement personnel : franchise, honnêteté, transparence, capacité à trouver des solutions alternatives autres que celles préconisées par les standards normaux, recherche et découverte de ses passions réelles.

Personnellement, avec mon intervenante actuelle, nous avons pris un accord. Elle m'a donc donné une mission : prendre le meilleur de moi-même et devenir une Asperger 5 étoiles. Je n'ai jamais aussi bien cheminé que depuis qu'on m'a octroyé cette douce bénédiction.

Growing up, I didn't specifically aspire to become an entrepreneur. I wasn't raised by executive parents, I didn't take business courses in school, and I had no particular influences in the startup ecosystem to expose me to the field. Looking back on my childhood, however, the signs of my business acumen and the characteristics that make me successful as a woman entrepreneur today become clear.

1. I started my first business at three years old

Like most children, I had a love for drawing as a toddler. Instead of just enjoying scribbling in my colouring books, I needed a greater purpose for my artistic talent and time. So, at the age of three, I started my own custom stationery business. I went door to door in my neighbourhood, showing my drawings and offering to create custom stationery sheets with my neighbours' names or favourite animals. Packages started at $1, and extra customizations were $0.25 each. I received several sales and went back home to fill the orders of my kind neighbours. The business lasted about two weeks until I realized the time it took me to complete the stationery was not worth the $1. This experience represents my first major business lesson — prices need to consider the cost of labour — and a sign of my entrepreneurial strengths. I excelled in the idea generation and marketing portion of starting a business; operations, however, were a necessity I would later need to learn or delegate.

2. I accepted any opportunity to turn my passions into projects

As a young girl, I had parallel interests in creative arts and science. Combining my passion for both, I developed a love for baking. Like most entrepreneurs, my ambition kicked in early, and instead of just learning to bake cookies, I was making souffles, strudels, pastries and a variety of gourmet baked goods at the age of seven. My school often held bake sales and one day I asked my parents if I could bake for others and set up shop too. Originally just excited for an excuse more and try new recipes, when my dad dismissed my idea, a new motivation for the idea emerged. Inspired to prove him wrong, I dedicated to set up shop on my driveway.

The following weekend was the annual garage sale day in my neighbourhood, making it a great day to launch my business and get exposure with foot traffic. So, I spent the Friday night concocting new creative dessert recipes to sell on the streets (to this day, my favourite was fudge-filled cookies 'n cream cupcakes!). Saturday morning, I sat at a table at the end of my driveway with a cash box and cupcakes in hand. By 12 p.m., I was sold out and I happily showed my dad the $100 I made that day.

3. I never let my age define my potential

An avid strategy game fan, I convinced my dad to teach me how to play poker at the age of 12. During a summer BBQ with my extended family, my older cousins and uncles started a Texas Hold'Em tournament. Excited for the opportunity to put my skills to the test — until this point, I was only allowed to play against my dad for candy — I eagerly joined the table. Thinking my interest was ""cute"" and that I would be out after a few rounds, I was allowed to play. So, there I sat, a 12-year-old girl at a table of 40-plus-year-old men and a fewer of my older cousins, ready for my hand to be dealt. To my delight and the surprise of all, I not only lasted a few rounds, I won the tournament. Rather than be intimidated by the challenge, I was motivated to have the opportunity to grow my experience, and I found the doubt of others added extra fuel to my fire.

4. I didn't let others take advantage of me

When I was 18 years old, I hosted my first independent fundraising campaign across Canada and the day before our closing event, the mall manager tried to cancel. The woman assumed I was older because of my professional tone in our calls and was shocked to learn my youth when we met. I got an email later that day from her saying that, due to ""unforeseen circumstances,"" she had to cancel my booth reservation for my event the next day. Rather than accepting this, I called her to resolve the situation and when she disregarded my calls, I went above her head, calling the head office. I explained the situation and within 30 minutes after speaking, I got an email from my local mall manager saying there was an error prior and we were good to go for the morning...

Suffice to say, this experience taught me a crucial lesson on the necessity for a leader, at any age, to know their worth, speak up and overcome adversity.

5. I remained true to my authentic self

Regardless of the industry, people will have opinions on how you should act, look, and be. I learned early on that being different was not a weakness, like others believed, but an asset. While I admit my style and personality are quirky and bold, it is a reflection of my brand and voice. At the beginning of my journey, I received a lot of adverse reactions and side-eyes in the boardroom. Eventually, though, the very traits that put my leadership credibility in question became a trademark characteristic of my brand. For me, this was my style, particularly my love for hair accessories. For others, these characteristics can be anything from a personality trait, a hobby or interest, or something else that represents who you are and what you stand for.

While it may be easy to conform, it is just as easy to lose yourself and your uniqueness in the process. In my experience, being authentic to who you are is an important step to building credibility and respect as a leader.",Signs That I Was Meant To Be An Entrepreneur,http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/kelly-lovell/signs-that-i-was-meant-to-be-an-entrepreneur_a_23235703/

If Diwali came around in July or August, firecrackers would not have caused as much pollution as they do in October or November. The main reason for the Delhi winter smog is the weather. The winds change in such a way they trap pollutants.

This is why Diwali firecracker pollution isn't a one-day affair that can be overlooked; at least in Delhi, meteorological conditions make sure the pollutants are trapped in the air for days. In 2016, there was a clear spike in air pollution in the days following Diwali.

This year, thanks to the Supreme Court, we'll have data to tell us the link between firecrackers and pollution. Banning the sale of firecrackers in Delhi NCR till 1 November, the Supreme Court said yesterday, ""We are of the view that the order suspending the licenses should be given one chance to test itself in order to find out as to whether there would be positive effect of this suspension, particularly during Diwali period.""

If the SC's ban on sale of firecrackers is strictly implemented across Delhi and NCR, it will help us compare the pollution figures around Diwali in 2015 and 2016. In both years, Diwali and the days after saw a significant spike. And this year, Delhi has a lot more pollution meters to gather data.

The Supreme Court's experiment of banning the sale of firecrackers is worth trying because already we have enough data to show that pollution does go up immediately after Diwali.

It is possible that by 1 November, we may find that banning firecrackers has not resulted in changing the annual spike in air pollutants. If that happens, we'll be able to conclude that Diwali firecrackers are an insignificant contributor. It may be a hint that the burning of harvest residue by farmers in Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh is a greater contributor.

The Supreme Court's experiment of banning the sale of firecrackers is worth trying because already we have enough data to show that pollution does go up immediately after Diwali. One study in 2015 found outdoor PM 2.5 particulates increase by as much as 3.5 times.

In 2016, people probably didn't burst any more crackers than they did in 2015. But meterological conditions were worse. Slow wind speed meant firecracker pollutants wouldn't disperse easily, leading to smog so strong that visibility dropped to 200 meters.

For days the smog wouldn't leave town. It came to be known as the Great Smog of Delhi.

Commuters drive amid heavy smog in New Delhi on October 31, 2016, the day after the Diwali.

NOT WORTH EVEN A DAY

Even if Diwali increases air pollution only for a day or two, that's not something Delhi can afford given Delhi's already unbearable pollution levels. Studies have shown the exceedingly high PM 2.5 and 2.10 levels are making people sick, shortening their lives, and could be causing as many as 8 deaths.

It is not reasonable to argue that if we are unable to stop farm fires, Diwali firecrackers must be allowed to pollute the air as well.

One study found 70% respondents in a resettlement colony in Delhi had respiratory problems after Diwali. PM 2.10 is dangerous because they are particles so small they enter the lung. PM 2.5 is fatal because they are particles that enter the blood from the lungs, a silent killer.

The impact of Diwali firecracker on respiratory health, especially that of infants, asthamatics and the elderly, is well documented. Last year, doctors in Gurgaon found respiratory diseases among children tripled after Diwali. This alone should be good enough reason to ban firecrackers. We are not even talking about the large numbers of children who suffer burns from firecracker accidents.

NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE

There are those who argue that farm fires weren't the main reason for the November 2016 smog, such as the Met department. ""Had farm fires been the reason for the smog, cities between Delhi and Punjab would have also witnessed low visibility conditions, but that was not the case,"" IGI Met director-in-charge R K Jenamani told The Times of India after Diwali in 2013.

Or perhaps the weather in Delhi NCR is particularly conducive to trapping pollutants?

The point is, we have a paucity of data and studies on pollution in Delhi and its suburbs. What we do have is often conflicting.

There is little doubt that all sources of pollutants must be brought down. Some argue that main cause of winter pollution is not Diwali firecrackers but road dust, forgetting that Diwali firecrackers turn into road dust.

Some argue the main cause is vehicular pollution, but the failed odd-even car rationing did not bear this out. During the odd-even experiment when pollution did decrease it was more on account of weather conditions. On poor weather days, the smog was as bad as ever.

It is not reasonable to argue that if we are unable to stop farm fires, Diwali firecrackers must be allowed to pollute the air as well. Similarly, farmers could argue why they are being punished when Diwali firecrackers are allowed.

NOT JUST FIRECRACKERS

It is factually incorrect to say that only Diwali firecrackers are being targeted. Last year, shocked by government inaction over tackling air pollution, the Supreme Court ordered the union environment ministry to come up with a plan in just 48 hours. Here is the plan.

Amongst the temporary or permanent bans the crackdown on pollution has seen is the banning of stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana – not so easy to implement because other means of stubble disposal are expensive. Punjab is threatening to deny loans to farmers to burn stubble, and Haryana is filing cases.

Other temporary bans have included those on cars on odd-even days, on trucks entering Delhi, on construction during peak pollution days, on a thermal power plant in the winters. It is therefore simply not true that Diwali firecrackers are being singled out.

A lot more needs to be done, surely. What's coming in the way is that both Modi and Kejriwal governments are not showing a sense of urgency and panic. Implementing the plan devised by the Supreme Court-monitored panel requires co-ordination between 16 government agencies. We can guess how smooth that process would be.

Polluting particles are present in the environment throughout the year. If the winter weather traps and circulates them in the air, the monsoon rains wash them down to the ground. Ultimately, Delhi will have to do mass scale water sprinkling and even think of artificial rain to make Delhi breathe-able in winters.

NOTHING HINDU ABOUT FIRECRACKERS

Those opposed to the banning of firecrackers also argue that it's an assault on Hindu religious rights. Originating in China, firecrackers have nothing to do with the Hindu faith and are not a religious requirement in Diwali. The festival of lights is not the festival of smoke and fury.

They say why doesn't the Supreme Court ban construction or motor vehicles altogether. Quite simply, those are necessities, and even they are often restricted in the fight against air pollution. Firecrackers are not a necessity.

It is hypocritical for one to champion animal rights on Bakra Eid but not on Diwali. Birds die, pets go into shock.

They also argue that Diwali firecrackers should not be banned unless sacrificial slaughter of animals during Bakra Eid is also banned. This makes little sense: sacrificial slaughter of animals does not increase PM 2.5 particles in the air. The morning after Diwali, the smog adversely affects everyone: Hindus and Muslims, human and animals.

It is hypocritical for one to champion animal rights on Bakra Eid but not on Diwali. Birds die, pets go into shock.

They further argue that banning firecrackers around Diwali alone is anti-Hindu. They should be banned throughout the year. People use them on New Year's eve for instance. Agreed. The Supreme Court has itself said this is a trial. If data shows substantially less pollution in Delhi NCR this Diwali as compared to last few Diwalis, the SC is likely to extend the ban permanently.",In Defence Of The Supreme Court’s Ban On Sale of Firecrackers In Delhi NCR,http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/10/10/in-defence-of-the-supreme-court-s-ban-on-sale-of-firecrackers-in-delhi-ncr_a_23238237/

My drinking career started at the age of 14. A child, innocent and naïve. Neither brain nor body fully developed. Legless at 10pm, vomiting at 6am.

Thirty-two years later, I am finally coming to terms with my addiction. I am addicted to alcohol, afflicted with alcohol use disorder (see the DSM-5). Or as Alcoholic Anonymous says, I'm an alcoholic.

I look at my beautiful, intelligent 11-year-old daughter and am filled with dread and horror that she could have the same experience only three short years from now, along with the resulting life-long negative outcomes.

Knowing that I have genetic predisposition to addiction, if there was one important message I could give my children it's Don't drink. Ever.

It was after the death of my father in the same year that I had my first drink, that my career with binge drinking really took off. At 16, I stopped for a while, when after several court appearances for underage drinking, the local magistrate threatened to fine my Mum, instead of me. After the death of my fiancé at 21, I dived back into the black hole of grief, and kick started a 25 year drinking career.

Thanks to a loving and supportive family, I started university at 24. Like many of my uni mates, I was a prodigious binge drinker throughout my 20s, which continued into my successful professional career in my 30s. I never during these times questioned my drinking behavior. Binge drinking, and the resultant hangovers, are a rite of passage in Australia.

Don't talk to a recovering alcohol addict about the scourge of methamphetamine on Australian society. It's got nothing on booze.

While both my pregnancies and breastfeeding years were mostly alcohol free, even then I didn't completely abstain. A wine spritzer here, a glass of champagne there, a few beers after the nightly breastfeed.

I have tried to pinpoint when my drinking got out of control.

Looking back, I now know that the combined stresses of moving our family to a new town, buying and running a small business with my partner, and the six-month process of diagnosing our then two-year-old son with autism was the downhill slide to every day, addictive drinking. These, coupled with social anxiety and introversion, made for a perfect storm. Like so many addicts, I continued to drink myself into oblivion so I didn't have to think or feel -- the stress, worry, anxiety, guilt.

What a terrible mother, you might be saying. Surprisingly, I continued to function. I am actively involved in my children's education, their extra-curricular activities, and the planning and implementation of therapy for my son. I work part-time running our successful small business. I am intelligent and educated; a kind and compassionate person. I love my children more than anything, they are what I live for.

But, there were always cracks in the armour. Nights where I managed to fulfill my role as a parent, but can't remember a damned thing about them. I thank God for my partner, who is an occasional, mostly moderate drinker.

When I finally realised that I was drinking too much at the age of 43, and decided I wanted to stop, or at least to moderate, I found I could not do either. No matter how hard I tried. I didn't realise it then, but I didn't control my addiction. It controlled me. And addiction is not a weakness of character. It is an insidious compulsion developed over time, and reinforced by electrochemical stimulus and hormonal responses.

Take nicotine, another addictive substance. I quit smoking when I was 35. Even though it was incredibly hard at the time. Honestly, compared to drinking, it was easy. Why? Because there was a widespread and visible health campaign warning about the risks of smoking, to myself and others.

Smokers became socially ostracised and marginalised. Not smoking became the new normal. I visited my GP and was given a prescription to help with the nicotine cravings. I rang the Quitline, day after day, whenever I felt the urge to smoke. I socially isolated myself from anyone that smoked for the next four months. And I beat that addiction.

But alcohol is altogether a different beast. I feel the same intensely overwhelming cravings to drink as I did to smoke. Every day I have to fight the physical and psychological compulsion to drink myself into oblivion. But unlike smoking, drinking is an integral part of our social melee.

I don't want to write an essay on the prevailing cultural attitude to alcohol in Australia, except to say I can think of few events that I attend as an adult where alcohol is not readily available, and the consumption of which is often actively encouraged.

But the widespread abuse of alcohol in Australia feels like the elephant in the room. In my experience, no one wants to talk about it. No one wants to hear it. I'm not sure why. My gut feeling is because partly not everyone becomes addicted to alcohol when they drink, so are unable to comprehend the problem. And many people, if they are addicted, do not want to admit it.

I 100 percent accept that I am responsible for my own behaviour, that I have to 'own' my addiction and work on fixing it. And I will continue to pursue and utilise as many resources as I can find. Support from a local GP that specialises in addiction; Alcoholics Anonymous meetings (I finally gathered up the courage to attend); weekly visits to my psychologist. Online social forums like Hello Sunday Morning, where people with alcohol addiction support each other, hopefully into sobriety. Podcasts focusing on addiction and recovery. Anything to regain my life as it was before I became an addict.

But let's face it -- it is going to take a lot of pain (as my psychologist says). The boozy culture in Australia is pervasive and inescapable. Australia is awash in it. Don't talk to a recovering alcohol addict about the scourge of methamphetamine on Australian society. It's got nothing on booze.

Elizabeth Dale said: “I’m completely disgusted with the new Dove advert.","A model who starred in the controversial Dove advert that was branded “racist” by many, has spoken out to say she is “not a victim”.

Lola Ogunyemi said as a Nigerian woman, born in London and raised in Atlanta, she has grown up aware that models with darker skin are rarely seen in the media, so she “jumped” at the chance to be the face of a global campaign.

“Having the opportunity to represent my dark-skinned sisters in a global beauty brand felt like the perfect way for me to remind the world that we are here, we are beautiful, and more importantly, we are valued,” she wrote in a piece for the Guardian.

She added that some of the clips circulating on social media do not show the full advert and as such, the ad’s message has been “misinterpreted”.

The Dove campaign, which appeared on Facebook in GIF form, showed a black woman, Ogunyemi, removing her t-shirt to reveal a white woman underneath.

The images went viral after American makeup artist Naomi Blake shared the photos on social media.

In the Guardian article, Ogunyemi said the full Dove TV advert intended to “highlight the fact that all skin deserves gentleness”. However, this message was lost in the 13-second clip that appeared on Facebook.

The model went on to suggest she did not know the images would be edited in this way.

“If I had even the slightest inclination that I would be portrayed as inferior, or as the ‘before’ in a before and after shot, I would have been the first to say an emphatic ‘no’,” she said.

In response to the backlash the advert received, Dove said in a statement: “This did not represent the diversity of real beauty which is something Dove is passionate about and is core to our beliefs, and it should not have happened.

“We have removed the post and have not published any other related content. We apologise deeply and sincerely for the offence that it has caused.”

The brand may have apologised, but for many this is not enough. In a HuffPost UK video, five black women spoke out about the advert, with many saying the apology fell short.

Elizabeth Dale said: “I’m completely disgusted with the new Dove advert. With their apology, they didn’t acknowledge anything or any wrong doing.”

Amel Mukhtar added: “It was incredibly racially insensitive and showed a vast ignorance of a history in which blackness has been linked to dirtiness, to uncleanliness.”

Ogunyemi said that while she agrees that Dove should have apologised for any offence caused, she believes the company could have “defended their creative vision” and the initial decision to use a dark-skinned model",Model At Centre Of 'Racist' Dove Ad Speaks Out: 'I Am Beautiful And I Will Not Be Erased',http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/lola-ogunyemi-model-controversial-dove-ad_uk_59dc94b9e4b0208970cf6791

CANBERRA -- A mystery hacker codenamed after a larrikin Australian soap opera character has been revealed as stealing sensitive, high-level information about a $1.1 trillion defence project created by an alliance including Australia, the U.S, UK and Canada.

The data about Australia's warplanes and navy ships was stolen from an Adelaide Defence subcontractor which had one I.T. specialist and used extremely easy passwords.

Given the name ""ATP ALF"" -- in reference to a +30 year character from the long-running Australian beachside TV program, ""Home and Away"" -- the hacker had managed to sit inside the system of the contractor for months before detection in November 2016, and stole information about programs such as the $17 billion F-35 Joint Strike Fighter project, the C-130 Hercules transport plane and the $4 billion P-8 Poseidon maritime surveillance aircraft project.

A state actor has not been ruled out and it has been reported that a hacking tool, known as the Chinese Chopper, was used. The stolen data was not classified military information, but it was described as ""commercially sensitive"".

The hack was discovered by a major Defence contractor.

According to Mitchell Clarke, an ASD incident response manager, the stolen documents for a Navy ship could let a viewer, ""zoom in down to the captain's chair and see that it's, you know, one metre away from nav chair"".

Perkins, also an accomplished mountain climber, was buried by the 150-foot-wide (46-meter-wide) slide. Kennedy, who was partially buried, pulled himself free and hiked out for help after he couldn't find his girlfriend.

The area had received a foot (0.3 metres) of snow since Oct. 1, which was on top of about 4 feet (1.2 metres) of dense snow that had fallen over the previous two weeks, according to the Gallatin National Forest Avalanche Center.

Hayden survived the avalanche but not the unbearable loss of his partner in life.

Kennedy, who grew up in Carbondale, Colorado, had been working on his EMT certification while Perkins completed a bachelor's degree in mathematics and education at Montana State University.

Kennedy was perhaps best known for climbing the Southeast Ridge in Patagonia's Cerro Torre in 2012 and removing many of the bolts placed by controversial Italian climber Cesare Maestri more than 40 years earlier.

Afterward, he and his climbing partner were accosted by locals and detained by police. But Kennedy's father, Michael Kennedy, who was editor of Climbing Magazine for more than two decades, beamed with pride.

""You made a courageous first step in restoring Cerro Torre to its rightful place as one of the most demanding and inaccessible summits in the world,"" the elder Kennedy wrote in an open letter to his son that was published in Alpinist Magazine in 2012. ""I never would have had the guts to take that step myself, even in my best days.""

Michael Kennedy, an accomplished mountaineer in his own right, also wrote to his son about losing multiple friends to the sport.

Piensas que la cita del martes pasado fue muy bien, no paran de chatear y han quedado en verse de nuevo. Y, de repente, esa persona desaparece. Se esfuma como una bolsa de plástico a merced del viento. Y nunca sabrás por qué.

Quizás te entren ganas de escribirle: ""¿Has muerto?"" o ""¿Qué pasa? ¿Me mandas una foto de la tortuga del novio de tu madre y al día siguiente desapareces?"" Quizás no tuvieras un vínculo emocional demasiado estrecho con esa tortuga, pero el hecho de que desaparezca sin más te causa dos días de ansiedad irracional mirando el celular cada dos minutos para ver la última hora de conexión en WhatsApp.

Puede que haya perdido el teléfono. O puede que la tortuga esté enferma y haya tenido que ir a toda prisa a darle su apoyo emocional en unos momentos tan complicados. Pero seguramente no es esa la explicación. La verdad es que no le importas y no quiere saber más de ti.

Todo el mundo debería tener el valor para decirle a alguien que no está interesado en seguir saliendo o hablando.

Pero ya eres bastante mayor y sabes que las cosas no siempre salen como a ti te gustaría. Sería más fácil asumir que te dijeran: ""¡Hey! He cambiado de idea, te odio a ti y a tus pantalones de rayas. No me vuelvas a hablar. ¡Gracias!"" Quiero decir, estaría muy culero que te lo dijeran, pero al menos ya sabrías algo.

Todo el mundo debería tener el valor para decirle a alguien que no está interesado en seguir saliendo o hablando, o que se le ha muerto el perro y ya no tiene la ilusión de seguir mandando fotos de sus camisetas tejidas a mano a una persona a la que solo ha visto una vez. No pasa nada, de verdad. Las camisetas eran una mierda de todos modos.

La peor parte de que alguien te aplique ""la ley del hielo"" es que no hay ninguna forma de afrontarlo con dignidad, salvo asumir que ahora le resultas abominable a esa persona y que deberías irte para buscar a alguien más que acabe aplicándote la del hielo también.

No dudes que te volverá a pasar, porque los humanos modernos son seres estúpidos que ven series mediocres y pasan más tiempo deslizando su dedo en Tinder que comunicándose en la realidad con la gente.

El miedo de que te ignoren te agobia tanto como ese compañero de trabajo que no deja de pedirte que te unas a su club de lectura de Game of Thrones. Le quita emoción a tus nuevas relaciones y cubre toda clase de chat con un aura oscura de ansiedad. Le arranca toda la diversión a las citas y te deja con un trastorno de la personalidad y con la obsesión de echarle un vistazo al celular cada dos minutos.

La página Psychology Today explica que ""el rechazo social activa los mismos mecanismos de dolor en el cerebro que el dolor físico"" y que cuando alguien te ignora, repercute en tu autoestima, hace que te pongas en duda a ti mismo. Te culpas a ti mismo, a tus lóbulos de las orejas torcidos y a esos seis chistes a los que recurres cada vez que quedas en verte con alguien nuevo. Te sientes como si fueras desechable, impotente e inútil.

En nuestra época, las personas ya no son personas: son una foto de perfil o un emoji sonriente.

La otra persona no tiene ni idea del martirio por el que te está haciendo pasar y encima se piensa que te ha salvado de una conversación incómoda. Siente que no te debe nada (solo han salido una vez, ¿por qué te preocupas tanto?), pero tú no lo ves así; eres una persona y tienes sentimientos, no eres un montón de palabras en una pantalla. Ese es el matiz que se le escapa a la otra persona.

En nuestra era de las redes sociales, las personas ya no son personas: son una foto de perfil o un emoji sonriente. Es demasiado fácil olvidar que nuestras acciones tienen una influencia real en las personas y que su efecto puede ser mucho más duradero que el dolor inicial del rechazo.

Sí, la persona a la que has ignorado lo superará. Es más, probablemente ni siquiera estaban hechos el uno para el otro, pero lo que nunca desaparece del todo es esa sensación de inseguridad cuando conozca a alguien nuevo. Al ignorar sus sentimientos, le ha dolido, por muy insignificante que te parezca lo que has hecho.

El hecho de que no puedas ver a la otra persona no significa que no exista. No puedes esperar que se esfume como un pedo en el viento.

O sea, si alguien entablara conversación contigo en persona, no le cruzarías la cara de una cachetada y te irías como si nada a no ser que fueras un pendejo (si eres de esas personas que se esfuman para ignorar a alguien, probablemente sí que lo seas). Ese tipo de interacción se percibe tan real como la que se hace a través de los celulares. El hecho de que no puedas ver a la otra persona no significa que no exista. No puedes esperar que se esfume como un pedo en el viento.

No tiene lógica creer que desaparecer del mapa es una buena forma de afrontar la situación. Ya sé que, estrictamente, no le debes nada a nadie, pero todo el mundo se merece el reconocimiento de que realmente existe y un respeto, aunque sea fan de Justin Bieber. Quién iba a decir que esos chistes de mierda que te llegan al celular proceden de una persona real, ¿eh?

Eres un cobarde sin sentimientos si ignoras a quienes te busca y tu estúpida tortuga también lo es. Esta resulta una situación del carajo, y tú eres un hijo de la chingada si eres de esas personas que lo hacen, tanto como el amigo todo idiota que te dice que si corres bajo la lluvia te mojas más.

Pero muchas gracias de todos modos, de verdad, porque prefiero pasar la noche del sábado viendo Netflix.

As a general principle, I don't like bans.

I don't like diktats, whether from courts or governments banning what I can eat, what I can drink or what books I can read or what I do in my bedroom.

In that vein, I don't like the Supreme Court telling me I can't buy fireworks for my Diwali even if it's only in Delhi NCR.

But what I like even less is twisting that story into being one of Hindu victimhood in their own country.

If there's a victim during Diwali, it's those with pulmonary diseases, it's those children with asthma, it's the elderly, it's street dogs and house pets. Actually it's everyone breathing in the smoky air heavy with particulate matter.

Now thanks to the noxious Diwali debate spurred by the Supreme Court argument, particulate matter has acquired a religion.

Writer Chetan Bhagat has fanned the flames.

Can I just ask on cracker ban. Why only guts to do this for Hindu festivals? Banning goat sacrifice and Muharram bloodshed soon too? — Chetan Bhagat (@chetan_bhagat) October 9, 2017

Banning crackers on Diwali is like banning Christmas trees on Christmas and goats on Bakr-Eid. Regulate. Don't ban. Respect traditions. — Chetan Bhagat (@chetan_bhagat) October 9, 2017

First off, it's not true that only Hindus burst firecrackers during Diwali. This is not a ban on Diwali, not even a sideways ban and to present it as such is plain mischief-mongering.

Secondly, there's a ban on sales, not on bursting crackers.

Third, the court has made it clear it's a one-time experiment for now to see if the ban has any impact on the air pollution. It said, ""We are of the view that the (November 2016) order suspending the licences should be given one chance... to find out whether there would be (a) positive effect of this suspension, particularly during (the) Diwali period.""

One could have legitimately raised many extremely valid concerns about this ruling without a knee-jerk communal bonfire.

Is this a case of judicial overreach, the nanny state trying to dictate everything we do, on par with the mandatory national anthem in movie theatres?

Why have a ban instead of enforcing stronger regulation?

Can such a ban be really effective since there's no ban on bursting fireworks?

Will this encourage a blackmarket in fireworks?

All perfectly valid arguments and not unlike the debate about the efficacy of the Delhi government's famous odd-even scheme to combat vehicular pollution.

If we had the sense to self-regulate, to understand the importance of common sense moderation it would not come to this pass.

Instead it's boiled down to this.

Bloody hell, how dare the court say Hindus don't have a right to be choked and deafened?

No one is arguing about the pollution spike post Diwali. No one is really contesting the particulate matters numbers. No one is denying that it affects children and elderly and the asthmatic. That would be hard to do in a city already gasping with air purifiers.

Instead the argument that Bhagat makes is that this is for one day only. So just choke and bear it, whiny asthmatics?

Actually before Bhagat went down the Bakr-Id whataboutery route, he raised a perfectly valid point. ""Come up with innovations not bans,"" tweeted Bhagat. Could there not be innovative steps to combat pollution instead of banning sale of fireworks? All bans, even with the best of intentions, set problematic precedents, a sledgehammer approach to a complicated issue. But that's exactly the problem. If we had the sense to self-regulate, to understand the importance of common sense moderation it would not come to this pass. But instead we think bigger, louder, flashier is always better, PM levels be damned. When we communalise the issue we make even less room for moderation. Thus when the court feels compelled to step in, it does so with a measure like this.

It's an open question whether this firework sale ban can be more than symbolic. But Jyoti Pande Lavakare, co-founder of Care for Air writes in Hindustan Times, that it is a ""tiny step"" but a great place to begin because ""it is a low-hanging fruit and relatively easier to enforce and control"" unlike burning of crop stubble, garbage or biomass.

Indeed one could also ask what's Diwali for everyone without a spike in asthma attacks?

The Bakhr-Eid whataboutery is an apples and oranges comparison. First off why assume that those who are troubled about firecracker pollution necessarily support wholescale animal slaughter? But the animal cruelty argument is different from particulate matter levels affecting the health of all strata of society. In that sense firecrackers are different from the Christmas trees of Christmas or the goats of Eid. If firecrackers were being burst all over the city at Diwali levels for Eid and the court refused to regulate it, that would be a valid point. But like all whataboutery it misses the larger point. Even if Eid rituals were problematic, is that any reason to persist in masochistically choking our lungs evermore each Diwali?

And speaking of whataboutery, it's ironic that those who insisted that the cattle market rules were all about environment and animal welfare and had nothing whatsoever to do with Muslims and eating beef, are now hellbent on insisting that the fireworks sales rules are all about Hindu festivals rather than particulate matter and environment.

""What's Diwali for children without firecrackers?"" laments Bhagat. He forgets that this ruling was in response to a petition filed on behalf of children aged between six years and fourteen months.

""Lovers built the Taj Mahal for their love. But I couldn't build a loo."" So says Keshav, the lead character of a new Bollywood movie, after his wife leaves him for failing to build a toilet in their home. The film, Toilet: Ek Prem Katha, is a commercial film in support of governmental campaigns to improve sanitation in India.

Access to sanitation has attracted more attention in India over the past few years thanks to the Swachh Bharat Mission (Clean India Mission). Launched in 2014, this project seeks to make the country free of ""open defecation"" – the practice of defecating outside – by 2019. The effort follows the Supreme Court of India which recognised sanitation as a fundamental right in the 1990s, and the UN General Assembly following suit much more recently in recognising sanitation as a distinct human right.

The project will be an immense challenge for India, which was responsible for 60% of the world's open defection five years ago. This is particularly a problem in the country's large rural areas. India has a huge population and a major lack of accessible toilets – both in private households and in public spaces. Roughly half of the rural population are estimated to lack proper access to sanitation. In rural areas, people often go to remote fields to relieve themselves – separate for men and women.

To reach the 2019 goal, the country will need both behaviour change and new infrastructure to succeed. As of now, India appears to be headed towards ensuring that every house has an individual toilet in the next couple of years. But this will only be an important first step in a series needed to ensure the country has interventions covering all dimensions of sanitation.

One of the most important challenges will be to build community and public toilets. In a number of places, community toilets are necessary because building individual toilets at home may not be feasible, for instance, because of lack of space. Also, they are necessary for people without a house, such as homeless people and migrant workers.

The need for community toilets is already recognised as part of current sanitation interventions but is often not implemented. And local authorities often lack the funds to pay someone to undertake the cleaning of the facilities once built.

Attitudes to gender and caste

India has to be careful so that the project does not interfere with its efforts to boost gender equality. Historically, campaigns pushing for more toilets to be built often cite the modesty of women as the main reason – toilets after all prevent women from exposing themselves in public.

This is also problematic as it places the burden of adjustment on women. Indeed, in many households that have built toilets, men do not even necessarily use them. This links with the broader issue of people resisting the introduction of toilets per se.

The regressive nature of such campaigns is now officially recognised with new governmental guidelines urging a rethink of behaviour-change tactics). Yet, much more needs to be done. As long as it is men who plan for toilets, the needs of women are either subsidiary or not taken into account at all.

Clearly, women have specific sanitation needs, for instance, related to menstrual hygiene. This needs to be fully integrated into any goals to boost sanitation – a challenge in a country where periods are associated with shame. Schemes for the provision of sanitary products constitute a definite step forward, but these are limited and environment-friendly disposal facilities and awareness campaigns are even more limited.

Attitudes to caste matter, too. Sanitation work is a very sensitive issue in India because it is mainly carried out by the lowest caste, Dalit – once called ""untouchables"". People from this caste even carry out manual scavenging, the inhuman practice of manually collecting human excrement from dry latrines to clean them – despite the fact that the practice is prohibited by law.

With millions of new toilets, more sanitation workers will be needed to carry out faecal sludge management. This will be difficult, as such jobs are stigmatised. Indeed, the conditions for such workers are often appalling – the media regularly reports on the deaths of sanitation workers who have entered sewers without any protective gear.

Clearly, one of the challenges India is facing is addressing this social stigma to make sanitation work an acceptable and safe career that is not reserved for a specific group in society. Mechanisation of the process could go some way to help ensure that workers do not need to enter the sewers.

Environmental threat

There are also risks to the environment. At present, the toilets that are built are mostly single pit latrines that will need to be emptied at least once every few years. Where the pits are lined at the bottom, the septage will need to be pumped out more regularly, and there need to be measures in place to ensure that it is not simply disposed of in neighbouring fields or rivers.

Where the pits are not lined, one of the concerns is the impact on groundwater quality. In the state of Kerala, where most houses have an unlined pit on one side of the house and a well used for drinking water on the other side, this is a particular problem. In a context where groundwater is the source of drinking water for around 80% of the population in India, the building of so many new toilets needs to be carefully planned.

Overall, the major progress that has been witnessed in access to sanitation over the past few years is a first step forward. It needs, however, to be linked to a series of other actions and an awareness of the social and cultural dimensions of sanitation. Without this, the country is unlikely to achieve full success.

Therapists say nothing livens up a couple’s sex life quite like channeling those hot-and-heavy early days through role playing.

If you need inspiration, watch this scene from “Modern Family,” where married couple Claire and Phil pretend to be strangers meeting up for a hookup. Things get a little dirty at the hotel bar (and later, super awkward at the hotel elevator, but that’s beside the point).

Below, marriage therapists from around the country share six reasons feigning an affair with your spouse could change your sex life for the better.

1. It’s a good reminder that your spouse is pretty damn sexy.

“So often, we take our partners for granted and get caught up in a negativity bias: we notice all of the things they aren’t doing or could do, versus what they already are. That probably doesn’t inspire you to show up as your best, flirty and sexiest self. So consider having an affair: Instead of hanging out in sweats or your most comfortable PJs, think about what you would wear and how you would greet and engage your partner if it was a first date or the man you’d want to have an affair with. Bring your A-game, leave your history behind for the night and step into the anticipation of what’s possible.” ― Megan Fleming, a New York City-based sex therapist and the author of Invisible Divorce: Finding Your Way Back to Connection

2. It helps keep the kinky, dirty, raunchy side of you alive.

“For most, long-term relationships dictate that the we should only be attracted to, fantasize about and be sexual with the person that we marry. We then trade in that dirty, animalistic side for a romantic love, which kills sex in the bedroom. This also lends to other societal conditioning about how you’re suppose to treat your spouse (case in point: the Madonna/whore complex). We feel bad treating someone we respect in a kinky or dirty way, yet oftentimes, these very visions are what entice us and arouse us. Role-playing is a great way for couples to reignite that which may have been lost, by stepping out of their role as dutiful wife, husband and caregiver and getting back to that place where they can throw caution to the wind and embrace that raw, lewd side of themselves.” ― Moushumi Ghose, a sex therapist and author of Classic Sex Positions Reinvented

3. Bringing something “forbidden” to the forefront can be surprisingly sexy.

“Many people may think this idea could be throwing gasoline on the fire ― and it is. But that doesn’t have to be a bad thing. If a couples is stable in their relationship and trusting, this could bring a new level of heat and beauty. When we bring in the forbidden and play with it consciously, it brings with it a strong sexual charge that drives arousal off the charts.” ― Keeley Rankin, a sex therapist in San Francisco, California

4. It gives you an opportunity to work on your flirting skills.

“Most of the long-term couples I see have forgotten the art of flirting and seduction. I often will create exercises for couples to take on new or fantasy roles which help them get back to playing with one another in a more erotic fashion. The scene in ‘Modern Family’ shows how important it is for couples to leave the domestic behind (both literally ― by going on a date to a location that elicits frisson, and psychologically ― by not discussing to-do lists, the kids schedule or finances). Many couples find their minds are not present to the erotic chase or the experience of teasing due to their minds being distracted by the day’s responsibilities and routines. Playing requires a kind of mindful focus to the role at hand.” ― Sari Cooper, a couple’s therapist in New York City and host of the web show “Sex Esteem.”

5. Dressing up for your spouse can pay off in a major way.

“Perhaps you don’t usually take the time to prepare at all for sex. Knowing you’ll be having a special getaway ― or meeting someone ‘new’ ― could inspire you to take that extra step. You wear that sexy lingerie, shave your beard (or anything else that needs a little trim), wear a scent that’s enticing or try out a new style of suit or dress. Then, you take the time to actually undress each other, enjoying each new layer as it is uncovered. Little things like that can be extremely arousing.” ― Celeste Hirschman, sex expert and author of Making Love Real, co-authored by Danielle Harel

6. It could open up your mind to new opportunities in the bedroom.

“This is an opportunity to try new things you’re not used to: explore new pleasures and play with dynamics of power. See how it feels both to give and receive in different ways. If it’s a ‘new’ or ‘side’ relationship, why not use that mindset to ask for what you want? Creating a little space for the unknown ― for wanting and longing ― can spice up any relationship.” ― Megan Fleming",The One Person It Always Pays To Have An Affair With,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/one-person-to-have-an-affair-with_us_59d6bd15e4b0f6eed34f4aaa

HALIFAX — Lindsey Hubley was diagnosed with flesh-eating disease four days after giving birth and is now a quadruple amputee, has undergone a total hysterectomy and has been forced to spend the first seven months of her son's life in hospital.

Now, she's taking legal action against the IWK Health Centre and several Halifax-area doctors for alleged wrongdoings in her care during the birth and her postoperative care.

She was very lucky to have survived. Ray Wagner, lawyer for Lindsey Hubley

Lawyer Ray Wagner said a statement of claim filed in Nova Scotia Supreme Court Wednesday alleges that the negligence of five doctors and the hospital caused or contributed to the health issues suffered by Hubley.

""She was very lucky to have survived,'' said Wagner in an interview on Wednesday.

Hubley, 33, gave birth to her son Myles on March 2 but was rushed to the hospital a day after being discharged and was later diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis, otherwise known as flesh-eating disease.

Lawyer says Hubley wasn't properly examined

Wagner said it's alleged part of the placenta was not removed at birth, and that she had a tear on her vagina that required sutures, which could have contributed to her health issues.

He said it's also alleged that when Hubley arrived back at the hospital on March 5 with abdominal pain — the day after being discharged following the birth — an examination was not performed. Hubley was diagnosed with constipation and sent home.

""Our allegations are that had she been properly assessed when she presented at the hospital ... a substantial part of the damage, if not all of it, could have been prevented,'' said Wagner.

The next day, she was rushed to the hospital after experiencing more pain and discolouration on her body.

She was later diagnosed with flesh-eating disease, and has since undergone multiple surgeries, including amputations below both of her elbows and knees and a total hysterectomy.

Myles and I make our way into the hospital pretty much every day ... our lives have been turned upside down. Mike Sampson, Hubley's fiancee

The allegations have not been proven in court, and the IWK did not comment on the claims Wednesday.

Hubley's fiancee, Mike Sampson, 34, who is also named as a plaintiff in the case, has not been able to work since the birth of Myles. He said ""life has been put on hold.''

""Myles and I make our way into the hospital pretty much every day to see mama,'' said Sampson in an interview Wednesday. ""Our lives have been turned upside down.''

Mother needs new kidney

But despite the horrific ordeal, Sampson said his fiancee has remained very positive.

""No mom should ever have to watch their fiancee and their son walk out the door every night for over 200 days,'' he said.

""She's incredibly positive ... She has an outlook that this process has taken her arms and her legs, but it's not going to take her happiness.''

Sampson said Hubley is no longer infected but does require more major surgeries — including a kidney transplant — however, they are hopeful she'll soon be able to start attending rehab.

If a “no deal” Brexit looked likely, the Opposition would instead force Theresa May to keep talking to Brussels until an agreement was sorted, a senior party spokesman said.

The intervention raises the prospect of a Parliamentary showdown for the PM if her negotiations with the other 27 EU leaders break down ahead of the Brexit deadline of March 29, 2017.

With a working majority of just 13, May could face a landmark defeat as Tory ‘Remain’ rebels would join with Labour to reject any move to put the UK on World Trade Organisation (WTO) tariffs.

The move came as May caved to pressure from Brexiteers in her Cabinet to step up plans for a “no deal” outcome, revealing she had set aside £250m for Government departments to prepare for all possibilities.

PA Wire/PA Images Cabinet Brexiteers Boris Johnson and Liam Fox.

In Prime Minister’s Questions, she also appeared to slap down Chancellor Philip Hammond, who had hours earlier warned that every pounds spent on the contingency plans was “a pound that we can’t spend on the NHS or social care or education or deficit reduction”.

When asked after PMQs if Labour would vote against a “no deal” outcome, a senior spokesman told HuffPost UK: “We would oppose that.

“If the Government comes back with that outcome, we will seek to push for continued negotiations to get the kind of deal that’s in the interests of the country.”

He added that Corbyn felt that falling out of the EU without any trade deal would be “the worst” option for the public, leaving the country at the mercy of Tory Brexiteers who want to turn the UK into a low-tax, low-regulation offshore nation.

The party would respect the EU referendum but would not give May a blank cheque to drive through a ‘cliff-edge Brexit’ that harmed jobs and growth.

Anadolu Agency via Getty Images Brexit Secretary David Davis and EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier.

Reports emerged of a row between Hammond and other ministers over ‘no deal’ plans at the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, hours after Brussels chief Donald Tusk issued a stark warning that more progress was needed in Brexit talks.

Tusk said that if the talks continue at a slow pace without progress, “then - together with our UK friends - we will have to think about where we are heading”.

Brexit Secretary David Davis tried to inject fresh momentum in the negotiations this week but Brussels sources said little new had been offered by the UK.

Davis and counterpart Michel Barnier are due to give an update on their talks on Thursday. Barnier is said to want to move on to trade talks soon but is being held back by Germany’s insistence that London pay a big ‘divorce bill’ first.

Meanwhile, No.10 refused twice to say whether May’s words in the Commons were a contradiction of Hammond’s insistence that ‘no deal’ spending should be a last resort.

The Chancellor is becoming increasingly unpopular with pro-Brexit Tory MPs, with many seeing him as determined to water down or delay the UK’s exit from the EU.

Speaking on the BBC’s Daily Politics show this afternoon, Tory backbencher Bernard Jenkin said he “was very pleased to see the Prime Minister making absolutely clear” that departments would have the money they needed to prepare for ‘no deal’.",Labour Will Vote Against A 'No Deal' Brexit If Theresa May Returns Empty Handed From Brussels,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2017/10/11/jeremy-corbyn-will-vote-against-a-no-deal-brexit-labour-says_n_18237434.html?utm_hp_ref=uk

Près de 2000 Noirs et quelques Blancs se pressent dans la Central United Church of Christ du révérend Albert Cleage, dans la soirée du 30 août 1967. Ils viennent participer au procès des policiers qui ont tué trois jeunes gens à l'Algiers Motel. Les policiers n'ont pas été inculpés et les médias ont refusé de s'emparer de l'affaire. En réaction, de jeunes radicaux, menés par Dan Aldridge et Lonnie Peek, organisent un ""Tribunal du peuple"". H. Rap Brown, président du Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, en a suggéré l'idée ""dans le but de révéler les faits et de faire la lumière sur ce qui s'est réellement passé"".

Le procès se déroule sous l'effigie d'une vierge noire de plus de cinq mètres de haut, peinte par Glanton Dowdell, un artiste local. Elle était auparavant installée sur le fronton de l'église ""afin de pouvoir imaginer que le fils de Dieu puisse avoir eu une mère noire"".

L'assemblée réunie entend l'affaire des trois policiers blancs, Ronald August, Robert Paille et David Sendak, et d'un agent de sécurité noir, Melvin Dismukes, accusés d'avoir, selon les témoins, ""exécuté"" trois jeunes Noirs, Carl Cooper (17 ans), Aubrey Pollard (19 ans) et Fred Temple (18 ans) à Manor House, annexe de l'Algiers Motel, à l'aube du 26 juillet, au quatrième jour de l'émeute raciale qui a secoué la ville.

L'avocat Milton R. Henry joue le rôle du procureur, Solomon A. Plapkin, celui d'un avocat blanc, et Russell L. Brown Jr., membre de la Central Church, l'avocat de la défense. Par crainte d'intimidation et de représailles policières, les témoins n'interviendront qu'à la dernière minute. Kenneth V. Cockrel Sr., diplômé en droit de l'université de Wayne et futur fondateur de la Ligue des travailleurs noirs révolutionnaires, est le juge (l'association du barreau de Detroit envisagera d'exclure les avocats ayant participé à ce procès.)

Les témoins rappellent les faits de manière très graphique. Rosa Parks, l'écrivain afro-américain John O. Killens et le libraire Edward Vaughn font partie du jury. Des journalistes français et suédois couvrent l'événement (leur confrères de Detroit y assistent, mais ne seront pas autorisés à publier des articles sur le sujet). Le jury reconnaît les accusés coupables de meurtre. La sentence est accueillie par une explosion de ""joie (...) car la vérité avait enfin éclaté"", se souviendra Dan Aldridge.

""Dans le 'Detroit' de Kathryn Bigelow et Mark Boal, l'activisme noir n'existe pas avant ces émeutes.""

Visuellement fort et impressionnant, le Tribunal du peuple a l'envergure d'un grand scénario. Pourtant, il est complètement passé sous silence dans Detroit, qui sort le 11 octobre en France. Écrit par Mark Boal, ce film de Kathryn Bigelow revient sur les meurtres de l'Algiers Motel pendant les émeutes raciales de 1967. Si le corps des Noirs y joue un rôle clé, on ne peut en dire autant des récits et de l'histoire des Noirs de Detroit. Pourtant encensé pour son ""travail de documentation"", le film déforme et brouille l'histoire du Detroit des années 1960, les événements de l'Algiers Motel et la vie quotidienne de la population noire en général.

Dans le Detroit de Kathryn Bigelow et Mark Boal, l'activisme noir n'existe pas avant ces émeutes. En réalité, un mouvement des droits civiques est à l'œuvre depuis longtemps, notamment sur le terrain de la ségrégation résidentielle et scolaire, de la discrimination à l'embauche et des violences policières. Quatre ans plus tôt, le 23 juin 1963, près de 200.000 Noirs ont défilé à travers la ville pour protester contre les inégalités et clamer qu'ils ne les toléreraient plus. Treize jours plus tard, un policier tuait Cynthia Scott d'une balle dans le ventre et deux balles dans le dos. Il n'a pas été inculpé. De jeunes militants ont manifesté en masse contre les violences policières.

On voit beaucoup de Noirs dans le film, mais la communauté noire est absente. À l'exception de la séquence où le groupe vocal ""The Dramatics"" attend de monter sur scène, on ne voit pas les gens s'amuser ou passer du temps en famille, ou aucun moment de leur vie quotidienne. Les premières images du film se déroulent dans un bar de nuit clandestin sans vraiment planter le décor. Cette nuit-là, des gens sont réunis pour célébrer le retour de deux vétérans du Vietnam, mais la joie et le sens de la fête sont occultés.

Pour Kathryn Bigelow et Mark Boal, la vie politique des Noirs semble n'avoir qu'une importance toute relative. Ce qu'il importe de montrer, et de banaliser, c'est leur mort.

Lorsque la police investit le bar, à quatre heures du matin, les clients résistent et refusent de se soumettre à l'ordre de dispersion. C'est un acte politique. À l'époque, les Noirs sont exclus de la plupart des restaurants et lieux de divertissements de Detroit et les entrepreneurs noirs ont du mal à trouver les capitaux et obtenir les permis nécessaires pour ouvrir un établissement. Les Noirs de la classe ouvrière fréquentent donc beaucoup ces lieux clandestins.

À l'instar de cette scène d'ouverture, Mark Boal n'a pas réussi à développer une intrigue cohérente ni à replacer l'histoire dans son contexte, en particulier pour les personnages centraux que sont Carl Cooper, Aubrey Pollard, Fred Temple et Melvin Dismukes. Nous ne saurons rien de leur vie de famille ou d'étudiants, leur femme, leur partenaire, leurs collègues ou leur communauté. Dépouillés de leur humanité, les Noirs de Detroit n'ont aucune capacité d'agir.

Mars Films

Le drame de l'Algiers Motel est totalement déconnecté d'un contexte politique plus général favorisant de tels actes. Les trois policiers sont montrés comme des brebis galeuses. Nulle évocation des services de police et du reste de la société permettant et cautionnant ce qui s'est passé. Au contraire, la plupart de ses collègues réprimandent Philip Krauss, le flic raciste, ou cherchent à l'éviter. Frank Schemanske, le juge qui a rejeté l'accusation initiale d'association de malfaiteurs contre les policiers, n'est même pas évoqué.

Élu du Michigan à la Chambre des représentants, John Conyers décrira les événements de 1967 à Detroit comme une ""émeute policière"". Mais puisque Kathryn Bigelow et Mark Boal se cantonnent à la version de la brebis galeuse, leur histoire n'aborde pas non plus cet aspect des événements. La police a procédé à des milliers d'arrestations, la plupart sans fondement. Au printemps 1968, la moitié des 3200 personnes accusées de pillage seront jugées. Soixante pour cent seront relaxées et seulement deux condamnées pour les faits ayant motivé leur mise en examen. Même si les commissariats et les prisons, très présents dans le film, débordent de Noirs, rien ne laisse présager qu'il s'agit d'arrestations arbitraires. L'unique librairie noire de Detroit, Vaughn's Bookstore, qui accueillait nombre de réunions militantes, a été incendiée par la police, qui a ensuite laissé l'eau couler et ainsi détruit la quasi-totalité des livres. Cette attaque visant un espace de la communauté noire n'est jamais mentionnée dans le film.

Le Tribunal du peuple étant absent du film, on ne comprend pas les raisons du procès qui a lieu deux ans plus tard, incarné essentiellement par un affrontement entre avocats blancs. Le film donne l'impression qu'il arrive tout naturellement, au lieu de montrer comment les Noirs de Detroit ont voulu empêcher que cet incident soit jeté aux oubliettes.

Ce qu'offre Kathryn Bigelow aux spectateurs, c'est un lynchage public. Nous sommes envahis par un fétichisme pour la violence exercée sur des corps noirs.

Etant donné le travail de documentation supposé des scénaristes, ces omissions majeures ne peuvent qu'être volontaires. L'arrogance du titre –marketing oblige selon Kathryn Bigelow– révèle que ses auteurs n'ont aucun scrupule à exploiter l'image de la ville et de la communauté noire. Pour Kathryn Bigelow et Mark Boal, la vie politique des Noirs semble n'avoir qu'une importance toute relative. Ce qu'il importe de montrer, et de banaliser, c'est leur mort. Quarante minutes sont consacrées aux tourments infligés à ces jeunes hommes, dans des scènes qui s'étirent jusqu'à la nausée. Ce qu'offrent Kathryn Bigelow et Mark Boal aux spectateurs, c'est un lynchage public. Envahis par un fétichisme pour la violence exercée sur des corps noirs, on a l'impression d'assister à des scènes de guerre où des hommes sont mutilés, battus, réifiés. Cette insistance sur la violence et cette fascination pour les corps d'hommes noirs rappellent étrangement le film ""Naissance d'une nation"" de D.W. Griffith, sorti en 1915, dans lequel les stéréotypes raciaux abondent. Les Noirs ne sont que des stéréotypes: émeutiers en colère, victimes sanglantes ou familles éplorées. La communauté, le travail, le bonheur, ou même une intrigue secondaire n'y trouvent que peu de place. Les implications dans la vie réelle d'un film comme celui-ci sont aussi désespérantes que les corps assassinés par la police qui s'affichent au quotidien. Quand bien même, il réussit à transformer cette histoire en spectacle.

Le film n'est pas simplement bâclé, mais véritablement dangereux, car c'est justement ce déni de vie, ce refus d'aborder les expériences et les perspectives de la population noire qui permettent au comportement brutal, à la discrimination raciale et à l'impunité des forces de police d'être si répandus, aujourd'hui encore, aux États-Unis.

Si vous voulez voir un film qui s'intéresse vraiment aux questions des violences policières envers la population noire ou à la véritable histoire de Detroit, n'allez pas voir celui-là.

Malayalam filmmaker Sanal Kumar Sasidharan's contentious film 'Sexy Durga' has finally been cleared by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), or, as it is more popularly known as, the Censor board. But not before the maker agreed to drop 'Sexy' from the title and mute 21 cuss words and sanitise the film and make sure it doesn't hurt the fragile sentiments of India's gatekeepers of culture.

The movie will now be released in theatres with a U/A certificate as S Durga with 21 audio mutes, but will retain its original title and audible abusive words when it is eventually screened online, reported Scroll.in.

The movie became a point of contention last month when it was refused censor exemption for screening at the Mumbai Film Festival because the Information and Broadcasting (I&B) Ministry felt that it may ""affect the law and order as it hurts the religious sentiments,"" claimed Sasidharan. Without the exemption, the film would not have been eligible to be shown without censorship at the festival.

Upset and angry by this institutionalised attempt to muzzle the creativity of artists, the filmmaker had criticised the decision, saying India is ""a land that's becoming like Iran"".

Sasidharan may have agreed to change the film's title and mute the words to ensure that the movie gets screened, his words make it amply clear what he really thinks about the CBFC-mandated cuts.

""""Sexy Durga"" will be released in Indian Cinemas as ""S Durga"". S is a letter open for your imaginations. Bakths are specially requested to not imagine it as ""Sexy"" as they will be cursed by Durga. Be nice and come and watch the film,"" he wrote in a Facebook post.

According to the filmmaker, the reason for naming the film 'Sexy Durga' was not to hurt religious sentiments or defame the Hindu goddess, but to point out the irony that on the one hand our society worships goddesses and on the other, we treat women around us so poorly.

""Now when I see the name, I feel really crazy because it is a representation of typical mindset,"" news agency IANS quoted Sasidharan as saying. About the abusive words that he's been made to mute, he says, ""It is just insignificant words. It was only to show that the characters are raw. The mutes are beeped so people will understand the words are something bad. That's more effective.""

S Durga, starring Rajshri Deshpande and Kannan Nayar, is the first Indian film in 23 years to win the Tiger Award at the International Film Festival Rotterdam (IFFR), where it premiered.

Emsflorenz. Der kleine Aufkleber am Bahnhof von Papenburg sagt viel aus. Denn es ist die Ems mit ihren Kanälen, die das Leben in der beschaulichen Stadt bestimmt. Hübsch ist es hier, die Grenze zu Holland ist nur ein paar Kilometer entfernt und die bekannte Meyer Werft baut ganz in der Nähe die berühmtesten Kreuzfahrtschiffe der Welt. Klar, der Name des Schiffsbauers ist vielen bekannt, nicht aber die Stadt selbst. Denn sie gehört eben nicht in die Größenordnung von Touristenmagneten wie Hamburg, Düsseldorf oder Münster. Papenburg ist die versteckte Schönheit unter den Reisezielen. Umso mehr lohnt es sich, das „Venedig des Nordens"" zu entdecken.



""Den ersten sien Dod, den Twedden sien Not, den Dridden sien Brot!"" Ludger Stukenbrock mit einem Stück Torf.

Ludger Stukenbrock ist geborener Papenburger. Durch und durch. Meist trifft man ihn in der Von-Velen-Anlage. Hier taucht er ein in die Vergangenheit und nimmt die Gäste mit. Er erzählt von den ersten Siedlern und auch von der einen oder anderen Moorleiche. Denn hier gibt es noch die Untiefen, das Moor, das einst erschlossen wurde, um auf den abgetorften Flächen Landwirtschaft zu betreiben.

Ab Mitte des 17. Jahrhunderts gruben die Bewohner ausgehend vom Fluss Kanäle von insgesamt 43 Kilometern Länge. Neben der Entwässerung des Moores dienten diese gleichzeitig als Wasserstraßen. Mit einfachen Plattbodenschiffen transportierte die frühere Bevölkerung den abgebauten Torf zu den ostfriesischen Ziegeleien und später nach Emden, Bremen und Hamburg. Auch der Weg zur Nordsee wurde dadurch frei.

Die Von-Velen-Anlage mit dem Papenbörger Hus.

Papenburg - das ehemalige Armenhaus

Die ersten Siedler lebten in erbärmlichen auf dem Hochmoor erbauten fensterlosen Hütten aus Birkenstämmen, Reisig und Heideplaggen. In der Mitte dieser Katen befanden sich die Kochstellen. Mensch und Vieh teilten sich den kargen Wohnraum. Erst viel später gab es einen bescheidenen Wohlstand, der zweifellos den ersten Siedlern zu verdanken ist. Gegen Ende des 18. Jahrhunderts fanden viele Papenburger Arbeit im Schiffbau. Zur Blütezeit des Werftwesens gab es 23 Werftanlagen. Auf einer längs des Kanals errichteten Helling wurde das Schiff auf Kiel gelegt und konnte dadurch ins Wasser gleiten.

Abgebaute Torf-Briketts.

Stukenbrock deutet auf einen Sumpf, der abgetrennt und gesichert ist. ""Wer hier reinfällt, kommt nicht mehr raus"", betont er. Und dann erzählt er von dem Jungen, der 1939 im Moor gefunden wurde. Sein Skelett wies eine Hüftdeformation auf. Nachforschungen ergaben, dass das Kind im 11. Jahrhundert lebte und stark gehbehindert war. ""Man hat den Jungen wohl umgebracht und im Moor verschwinden lassen"", mutmaßt Stukenbrock. ""Damals, zu Zeiten großer Not, konnte er nicht zum Überleben der Familie beitragen und man entledigte sich ihm."" Es gibt einige Menschen, die im Moor einfach verschwanden und nie wieder aufgetaucht sind.

Das Geschäft mit der Frische.

Landwirtschaft und Gartenbau stehen in der norddeutschen Stadt heute mit an vorderster Stelle. Die Gartenbauzentrale Papenburg steht für das Geschäft mit der Frische. Anfang der 1970er Jahre begann sie mit dem Anbau von Topfblumen, später, zu Beginn der 1980er Jahre mit Topfkräutern. Salbei, Rosmarin, Bleifuß, Minze und viele mehr. Allein 80 Millionen Topfkräuter werden von hier aus jährlich auf den Markt gebracht. Die Genossenschaft arbeitet mit selbständigen Gärtnern zusammen und fördert somit den Wohlstand der Region.



Papenburg - ein charmantes Städtchen.

Auf der Meyer Werft werden regelmäßig Führungen veranstaltet. Und die Gäste können den späteren Luxus erahnen, der die halbfertigen Ozeanriesen schon beim Bau umgibt. Hier sieht man ihre Gerippe und beobachtet Hunderte von Arbeitern, die einer neuen AIDA Form geben oder dem Disney-Kreuzfahrtschiff den letzten Anstrich verpassen. Es ist eine Welt der Superlative. Es lohnt sich, sie zu entdecken. Dabei zu sein, hautnah. Sich eine Reise über die Ozeane unserer Welt vorstellen. Einfach so. Träume werden hier wahr, nicht nur für die leidenschaftlichen Kreuzfahrt-Fans.

Am frühen Abend trifft man sich zum Boßeln. Nur Insider wissen, um was es da genau geht. „Ran an die Kugel und den Kopf einziehen!"", lautet das Motto. Und nach der Ausübung des hiesigen Volkssports geht es zum Grünkohlessen. Das muss sein. Denn Papenburg ist diesbezüglich nicht nur eigenwillig sondern auch lukullisch ein Genuss.

Das charmante Städtchen an der Ems hat viel zu bieten, nicht nur für Insider. Auch im Nachbarland weiß man Papenburg als Einkaufsziel zu schätzen.

""Gutes deutsches Mühlenbrot kaufen und leckere Tortenstücke essen"", lacht die 61-Jährige. Kees van Veen, ein ehemaliger Koch, schätzt die Auswahl an Küchenutensilien in dem nahen Laden. ""Hier werde ich oft fündig"", sagt der 68-Jährige. Neben Torten, Kochlöffel, eine große Werft und Millionen an Kräutertöpfen hat Emsflorenz noch viel mehr zu bieten. Einen kurzen oder langen Abstecher ist das Städtchen allemal wert.

Am Sonntag wird in Niedersachsen gewählt

CDU-Spitzenkandidat Peter Althusmann will den SPD-Ministerpräsidenten Stephan Weil schlagen

Um nahbar zu wirken, hat er nun der ""Bunte"" ein Interview gegeben - ein Fehler, der schon mal einen Politiker eine Wahl gekostet hat

Bernd Althusmann tanzt, er wippt, er schnippt mit den Fingern. Gezwungen wirkt das, richtiggehend unangenehm sogar.

Es ist Althusmanns persönlicher Wahlsong, zu dem er da rhythmisch die Hüfte anwinkelt: ""Wir haben was Großes vor"". Die CDU Niedersachsen hat dazu ein Video auf Youtube hochgeladen, voller nichtsaussagender Hochglanzaufnahmen von lachenden Menschen und Textzeilen wie: ""Wir müssen den Weg gehen, wir müssen es wagen.""

Zu Politikstil und Inhalten von Bernd Althusmann liefert das Video keine Erkenntnisse. Doch dem CDU-Politiker scheint es eh mehr um das Tanzen zu gehen. Diesen Eindruck vermittelt Althusmann zumindest in einem aktuellen Interview mit der Illustrieren ""Bunte"".

Darin offenbart er intime und private Momente aus seinem Familienleben. Politikinteressierten sollte das wie ein Déja-Vu vorkommen.

Althusmann: ""Ich möchte durch mein Leben tanzen""

So berichtet der CDU-Spitzenkandidat etwa, wie er sich nach öffentlichen Terminen gerne entspannt.

Natürlich zuhause mit seiner Frau - aber nicht einfach so. ""Manchmal fangen wir auch an, im Wohnzimmer zu tanzen – nur wir zwei"", sagt Althusmann. ""Ihr Lebensmotto lautet: Ich möchte durch mein Leben tanzen. Das ist auch meines geworden.""

Deswegen tanze er auch in seinem Wahlkampfvideo, sagt Althusmann zu ""Bunte"": ""Leichtigkeit und gute Laune tun gut."" Wie sein Tanzen seinem Bundesland Niedersachsen konkret helfen soll, lässt Althusmann offen.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: TV-Duell in Niedersachsen: SPD-Mann Weil gerät bei einer entscheidenden Frage ins Schwimmen

Dafür erzählt er von seinem Spitznamen ""Panzer"", einer Schlange, die am Elektrozaun seines Hauses in Namibia ""verkohlt"" sei. Und von seiner Familie.

Althusmann ist zum zweiten Mal verheiratet, insgesamt hat er fünf Kinder - drei leibliche und zwei Stiefkinder, erfährt der ""Bunte""-Leser. Durchaus kritisch sehe der CDU-Kandidat dieses Patchwork-Leben, schreibt die Illustrierte. ""Zwei Familien zu haben ist auf jeden Fall verdammt anstrengend"", klagt Althusmann.

Und imitiert damit einen Fehltritt, der in Schleswig-Holstein dem SPD-Spitzenkandidaten Torsten Albig die Chance auf das Amt des Ministerpräsidenten kostete.

Althusmann: ""Es kann plötzlich zu Ende sein""

Auch Albig hatte der ""Bunte"" ein Interview gegeben, auch er hatte über sein Familienleben gesprochen - und auch er hatte sich über seine geschiedene Ehe ausgelassen. Seine Frau sei nicht mehr mit ihm auf Augenhöhe gewesen, hatte Albig der ""Bunte"" berichtet. Es sei stets unterwegs gewesen, während sie als Mutter im Haushalt gearbeitet habe.

Albig erntete für diese Aussagen heftige Kritik, kurz darauf verlor er die Landtagswahl. Althusmann riskiert mit seinem ""Bunte""-Interview einen ähnlichen Gang der Ereignisse.

Doch der CDU-Politiker wurde darauf offensichtlich gut vorbereitet.

Immer wieder betont er im Interview, welchen Respekt er vor seine Ex-Frau hätte - überhaupt vor Frauen, die als Mütter und Hausfrauen wichtige Dienste für die Gesellschaft leisten würden. An einer Stelle sagt Althusmann wie in Reaktion auf Albigs Aussage über seine erste Ehe: ""Der Respekt ging nie verloren, sie war immer auf Augenhöhe mit mir.""

Dennoch: Mit seinem ""Bunte""-Interview hat sich der CDU-Spitzenkandidat wohl keinen Gefallen getan.

In Niedersachsen liegt er derzeit in den Umfragen knapp hinter seinem Konkurrenten Weil. Kleinigkeiten werden also über die Wahl entscheiden - auch der Eindruck eines hüftsteif durch sein Wohnzimmer tanzenden Ministerpräsidenten kann Wähler vergraulen.

Althusmann gibt sich in der ""Bunte"" jedoch gelassen: ""Wer in die Politik geht, muss wissen, dass es plötzlich zu Ende sein kann."" Immerhin: Zum Tanzen wäre dann wieder mehr Zeit.

Dane Lloyd, who is a 26-year-old candidate running in the Sturgeon River-Parkland byelection, started a Libertarianism-inspired Facebook group in 2009 with the intention to turn it into a ""big movement.""

""Libertarianism and the right to bear arms are synonymous since the freedoms of Libertarianism are guaranteed by a well armed citizenry,"" the then-18-year-old wrote.

Screengrab of a post from 2009.

In a statement to HuffPost Canada on Wednesday, Lloyd commented on the post and said his stance on firearms has since changed:

That statement does not reflect my current view and policy on firearm ownership in Canada. My policy on firearms is a commitment to cost-effective gun control programs designed to keep guns out of the hands of criminals while respecting the rights of law-abiding Canadians to own and use firearms responsibly, and includes measures like safe storage provisions, firearms safety training, and mandatory minimums for criminal use of firearms.

Lloyd, who self-describes his political views as ""very Conservative,"" beat out former party leadership contender Rick Peterson, local party organizer Jamie Mozeson, and ex-political staffer Luke Inberg for the Tory nomination.

Ambrose, the party's former interim leader, had endorsed Mozeson.

Past support for memorializing Confederate figure

In 2015, two years after Lloyd graduated from Trinity Western University, he shared his thoughts on a Russia Today story suggesting that he no qualms about memorializing the legacy of the U.S. Confederacy, as old social media posts suggest.

The story reported on Baltimore officials mulling a plan to remove Confederate general Robert E. Lee's name from a city park.

""This would be a real shame to see go through,"" the post on an account associated with Lloyd's name reads. He said the former Confederate general's ""actions at the end of the war did much to heal and unite a deeply divided nation.""

Baltimore eventually introduced legislation to rename the city park to Lake Roland.

The timing of the post preceded renewed public pressure to rename monuments linked to U.S. Confederate figures after a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va. this summer.

In another post, this time from 2014, Lloyd shared a link to a fundraising campaign by The Rebel to fight ""anti-Christian bigots on Nanaimo city council.""

""It just goes to show that when people actually stand up to intolerant anti-Christian rhetoric, common sense and justice will prevail,"" reads the post.

The Vancouver Island municipality stirred some controversy at the time for pulling a permit for the Leadership telecast, a so-called Christian conference, days before the event. One city councillor had an issue with the event sponsor's link to anti-gay views and ""support of the traditional family.""

Reaction to the event's cancellation was mixed: former NDP MP Jean Crowder and the Vancouver Island Rainbow Association praised council's decision, while right-wing pundit Ezra Levant blasted it, and one letter to the editor called it ""over-the-top panic.""

Lloyd did not respond to a request for comment for the views he expressed in these two posts.

Use of ' Feminazi' raises eyebrows

The Conservative candidate made headlines recently for another Facebook comment he made in 2009 in response to the University of Guelph's decision to shutter its women studies program.

""I'll probably get assassinated by the Feminazi's for saying that cutting this program is a good thing, saves a lot of wasted money on a useless program,"" he wrote. ""Way to go Guelph way to be politically incorrect.""

Lloyd explained himself to CTV News last week, saying: ""Sometimes you get in to emotionally charged debates and you say things that you regret and I would say that would not be a term I would use today.""

He told the broadcaster he didn't think an old social media post would affect his campaign.

Despite Lloyd being a new public figure, he has earned some political experience working under former cabinet ministers Ed Fast and Jason Kenney.

He is also a Canadian Armed Forces reservist and most recently worked as a political staffer for St. Albert—Edmonton MP Michael Cooper.

Scheer jokes about metaphorical shoes

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer joined Lloyd at an event in Stony Plain, Alta. on Tuesday to kick off his campaign.

Lloyd addressed a crowd of supporters by drawing parallels between himself and the Tory leader, noting how both men are ""strong Conservatives."" ​​​​​

""He's got big shoes to fill coming in after Rona Ambrose, she was a great member of Parliament,"" Scheer said.

After the crowd applauded his tribute to his predecessor, Scheer joked with supporters. ""I said Dane has big shoes to fill, they're not actually big shoes, they're metaphorically big shoes. I think he probably wears a few sizes bigger than Rona did.""

Sturgeon River-Parkland voters will head to the polls on Oct. 23.

""Estamos en un momento en el que las mujeres han de mandar un mensaje claro de que esto ha terminado.","El caso de Harvey Weinstein no parece tocar fondo, ni mucho menos. Tras las acusaciones de abusos sexuales al productor publicadas por The New York Times el jueves 5 de octubre, el martes 10 la actriz Asia Argento ha acusado a Weinstein de haberla violado en un largo reportaje publicado en The New Yorker que también recoge declaraciones de Rosanna Arquette o Mira Sorvino. Ahora, a esa larga lista de mujeres que han sufrido el acoso, se unen dos de las caras más reconocibles del mundo: las de las actrices Angelina Jolie y Gwyneth Paltrow.

Jolie y Paltrow lo han contado al diario The New York Times. ""Cuando Paltrow tenía 22 años"", arranca el texto, ""consiguió un papel que la convertiría de actriz en estrella: el productor Harvey Weinstein la contrató para el papel principal en la adaptación de Jane Austen Emma. Antes de empezar el rodaje, la citó en su suite del Hotel Península Beverly Hills para una reunión de trabajo que empezó sin sobresaltos. Acabó con el señor Weinstein toqueteándola y sugiriéndole que tendrían que ir a la habitación a hacerse unos masajes, cuenta ella misma"".

Angelina Jolie vivió algo parecido cuando estaba inmersa en la promoción de la película Jugando con el corazón (1998). ""Tuve una mala experiencia con Harvey Weinstein en mi juventud y, como resultado, decidí no volver a trabajar con él nunca más y advertir a otros cuando así lo hicieran"", ha contado Jolie, que entonces tenía apenas 23 años. ""Este comportamiento hacia las mujeres, en cualquier ámbito y en cualquier país, es inaceptable"", ha contado la actriz a The New York Times en un correo electrónico.

Angelina Jolie y su padre, el actor Jon Voight, en el estreno de 'Jugando con el corazón', el 10 de diciembre de 1998 en Beverly Hills, California.

Según el artículo, este era el procedimiento habitual del productor. ""Incluso en una industria en la que el acoso está presente desde lejos, el señor Weinstein es especialmente llamativo, según las actrices y sus exempleados [...]: sus asistentes cerraban las reuniones y acordaban un encuentro en una habitación de hotel"". Después venían las insistencias para masajes, tocamientos y, como en el caso de Argento, abusos con sexo oral y vaginal.

""Era una niña, había firmado [el contrato], estaba petrificada"", explica Gwyneth Paltrow al diario The New York Times y sobre el hombre que ""la acosó, le dio el empujón para iniciar su carrera y finalmente la ayudó a conseguir un Oscar"", un premio que llegó en 1999 por Shakespeare in Love. Como explica, la actriz rechazó las intentonas del productor y se lo contó a su entonces pareja, Brad Pitt, que se peleó con Weinstein. Poco después, el productor la amenazó para que no le contara nada a nadie. ""Pensé que me iba a despedir"", cuenta ella.

Paltrow asegura que veía a Weinstein como un mentor, que ""pensaba que era el tío Harvey"". Una vez que habló con Pitt del asunto, éste se acercó al productor en un estreno y le dijo que no volviera a tocar nunca más a Paltrow, como han confirmado representantes del actor a The New York Times. Al parecer, Weinstein llamó a Paltrow para discutir sobre el asunto y le gritó ""durante mucho rato"", por lo que ella temió perder el papel de Emma. ""Fue brutal""​​, asegura la que durante un tiempo fue llamada ""la primera dama de Miramax"", en referencia a los papeles que hacía para la productora de Weinstein.

""Se supone que debía guardar el secreto"", afirma la ahora empresaria, que con los años se ha distanciado de él. ""Lo mismo era generoso y te daba todo su apoyo y te alababa como te castigaba y te hacía sentir mal"", ha dicho. ""Estamos en un momento en el que las mujeres han de mandar un mensaje claro de que esto ha terminado. Este modo de tratar a las mujeres acaba ahora"", ha zanjado la ganadora del Oscar.

Aunque son sin duda las más conocidas, Paltrow y Jolie no son las únicas. Otras mujeres como Rosanna Arquette —""Cometes un tremendo error"", le dijo Weinstein después de que él la obligara a tocarle la entrepierna y ella se apartara—, Tomi-Ann Roberts —a la que pidió desnudarse y mostrarle el pecho, y que después dejó la actuación y ahora enseña psicología y en concreto trata sobre el acoso sexual—, Judith Godrèche —con quien quedó a desayunar en el Festival de Cannes en 1996 y a la que intentó arrancar el jersey—, Dawn Dunning —a quien le dio un papel en sus tres próximas películas... si aceptaba tener sexo en un trío, algo que ella rechazó— o Katherine Kendall han hablado. Esta última ha dicho que, cuando se citó con Weinstein en su apartamento, primero todo fue ""muy profesional"", estuvieron tranquilos, tomando algo, y vio fotos de su mujer en la pared. ""Hablamos de cine, arte y libros durante una hora. Pensé: me toma en serio"". Luego Weinstein fue al baño... y volvió en bata pidiendo un masaje. ""Todas lo hacen"", recuerda Kendall que le dijo, citando a una famosa modelo. Cuando ella se negó, él volvió a salir de la habitación y regresó desnudo.

""Literalmente me persiguió. No me dejaba pasar para llegar a la puerta"", recuerda Kendall al NYT. ""Me preguntó si podía verme el pecho, por lo menos"". Ella se negó y pensó que no podía creerse lo que le estaba pasando. ""Sólo era una reunión de trabajo"", recuerda. Aunque apareció en algunas películas, todo el episodio le quitó las ganas: ""Si hay que pasar por esto, no puedo hacerlo"".

Muchos recordarán el anuncio de los nominados a los Oscar de 2013, que hizo Seth MacFarlane (creador de Padre de familia) y que rememora el artículo del NYT. ""Enhorabuena"", anunció el cómico cuando llegó el turno de las actrices, ""ustedes cinco no tendrán que fingir más que les atrae Harvey Weinstein"". Y todos rieron.

Washington — India needs to grow at a faster pace, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said, while asserting that there was public support for the government's reform initiatives despite the difficulties arising from implementing GST, for instance.

""The obvious challenge to the country is to grow and grow fast. It has to grow at a much higher rate than we have been growing in recent history,"" Jaitley said in an address via video conference to the Berkeley India Conference prior to his departure for the US.

He is due to leave for the US on Monday to attend the forthcoming annual meeting of International Monetary Fund and World Bank here.

""I do hope that India is able to retain its growth rate once again and live up to the aspirations of its people because we must not forget that we not only have a large population to service, we have a very young population to service,"" he said.

""We have to grow at a much faster pace,"" he said, adding that a young and aspirational population wants change and reforms at a fast pace, and is impatient to see results.

""Time therefore is running against us,"" Jaitley said.

Pulled down by sluggish manufacturing, growth in the Indian economy, during the first quarter (April-June), fell to 5.7 per cent, clocking the lowest GDP growth rate under the Narendra Modi dispensation.

On reforms, the Finance Minister said the Goods and Services Tax (GST) has resulted in creation of a national tax structure.

""In the three months, you have all the check points in states disappeared, you have clear flow of goods and services which has started all over the country,"" he said.

Acknowledging issues related to compliance, Jaitley said the GST Council had noted these challenges and is taking steps to address them.

GST has been a ""reasonable smooth transformation,"" but there is scope for improvement, he said.

""I think in GST Council we have succeeded in creating India's first federal institution.""

On the demonetisation of high value currency, he said the Indian normal was to live with a high-cash economy and not pay taxes.

""You buy a property, you transact partly in cash, and in business you maintain two sets of accounts,"" he said.

""How can a country, which aims to be the fastest growing major economy in the world, which aspires to grow from a developing to a developed economy, continue with the normal of this type,"" he asked.

He said demonetisation had led to a sharp drop in insurgent and terror activities in states like Jammu and Kashmir and Chhattisgarh.

""You are having terrorist incidents, but the fact that you were finding 5,000-10,000 stone throwers being provided with money by the terrorist organisations, why is it that in the last eight-ten months it has not happened,"" he asked.

Luftfahrtunternehmer Niki Lauda kritisiert die Übernahme von Air Berlin durch die Lufthansa

Aufgrund der Monopolbildung erwartet Lauda steigende Flugpreise

Lufthansa sei außerdem nicht an Air Berlin selbst, sondern nur an den Flugstrecken interessiert

Im Interview mit dem Deutschlandfunk hat der Luftfahrtunternehmer Niki Lauda Kritik an der Übernahme von Air Berlin durch die Lufthansa geäußert.

Er wirft der Bundesregierung unter anderem vor, eine gezielte Monopolbildung in Kauf zu nehmen, wodurch die Preise für Flugtickets weiter ansteigen werden. ""Es kann doch nicht sein, dass wir Europäer plötzlich ein Monopol schaffen"", sagte der ehemalige Formel-1-Rennfahrer.

Auch andere Experten wie der Chef der Monopolkommission, Achim Wambach in der ""FAZ"" warnten vor einem solchen Monopol der Lufthansa. Bereits jetzt gebe es wenig Wettbewerb auf innerdeutschen Strecken. Das könne sich nicht nur in steigenden Preisen bei Flugtickets äußern.

""Auch die Bahn, die ja auf mittleren Strecken durchaus mit der Lufthansa konkurriert, muss sich dann weniger anstrengen und kann ohne große Sorge (...) ebenfalls die Preise anheben"", sagte Wambach.

Auch Lauda klagt: ""Wenn Sie sich in Deutschland die Inlandsstrecken anschauen, können Sie jeden Tag sehen, wie die Tickets teurer werden.""

Kritik am Vorgehen der Bundesregierung

Der 68-Jährige kritisiert im Interview die staatliche Unterstützung der Bundesregierung. Er glaubt, dass sich die Bundesregierung und der Vorstand von Lufthansa die Übernahme von Air Berlin abgesprochen haben.

Die Unterstützung von 150 Millionen Euro begründete die Bundesregierung im August mit dem Erhalt des Flugbetriebs. Niki Lauda hingegen hält einen anderen Grund für entscheidend.

Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel habe den Flugbetrieb von Air Berlin nur deshalb aufrecht erhalten wollen, damit Lufthansa die Slots, die bisher Air Berlin besaß, übernehmen kann.

► Slots werden an die Fluggesellschaften vergeben und sind bestimmte Zeitfenster, in denen eine Airline starten oder landen darf. Mit dem Kauf von Air Berlin sind nun der größte Teil der Slots in der Hand von Lufthansa.

Die Mitarbeiter haben für Lufthansa keine große Bedeutung

Lauda kritisierte außerdem, die Lufthansa sei nicht in erster Linie am Unternehmen Air Berlin interessiert, sondern nur an den frei werdenden Slots.

Die Lufthansa werde sich einzelne Strecken, die sie noch nicht besetzt haben, herauspicken und den Rest der Strecken einstellen.

Bei dieser Planung würden die Mitarbeiter des insolventen Unternehmens keine große Rolle spielen, glaubt der ehemalige Rennfahrer. Sie werden nach der Übernahme einen neuen Vertrag unterschreiben müssen, der möglicherweise schlechtere Arbeitsbedingungen als der bisherige Vertrag bei Air Berlin beinhaltet.

► Hätte eine andere Fluggesellschaft Air Berlin gekauft, wäre womöglich ein stärkerer Wettbewerb in der Flugbranche entstanden. Die Flugtickets wären so eher billiger geworden.

Niki Lauda war an einem Kauf von Air Berlin interessiert

Niki Lauda gründete er nach seiner Formel-1-Karriere seine eigene Fluggesellschaft Niki Luftfahrt GmbH, die 2004 von Air Berlin übernommen wurde.

Im Sommer diesen Jahres hatte Lauda zusammen mit den Unternehmen Kondor und Thomas Cook selbst Interesse an einer Übernahme von Air Berlin angemeldet. Der Gläubigerausschuss ließ ihn jedoch nicht am Verfahren teilnehmen, wie der Deutschlandfunk berichtet.

Ayer, Trump recibió en la Casa Blanca al dueño Los Pingüinos de Pittsburgh, Ronald Burkle, por el triunfo del equipo en la Copa Stanley, la mayor competencia de la liga profesional de hockey sobre hielo de Estados Unidos y Canadá.

En su mensaje de bienvenida, Trump hizo una broma al copropietario del equipo de hockey. Le dijo que es un gran negociador y lo invitó a negociar el TLCAN, que calificó como uno de ""horribles"" acuerdos comerciales que tiene Estados Unidos.

Pero la broma no paró ahí. Trump también insinuó que el dueño del equipo de hockely podría estar ""del otro lado"" en la negociación del tratado en referencia a los cientos de empresarios que le pidieron al presidente estadounidense no salirse del acuerdo.

Ayer, empresarios de 310 cámaras de comercio, estatales y locales en Estados Unidos enviaron una carta al presidente estadounidense para decirle que el TLCAN debe actualizarse, pero también debe reconocerse que el acuerdo ha sido beneficioso para ese país.

Además, los firmantes le advirtieron a Trump que terminar con el acuerdo sería catastrófico, pues 14 millones de empleos en EU dependen del comercio con Canadá y México y más de 1 mil millones de dólares se comercian todos los días a través de sus fronteras (sur y norte), entre otras razones.

La broma de Trump puso muy incómodo al copropietario del equipo de hockey, quien sonreía ante las continuas provocaciones del presidente estadounidense.

Al final, el empresario Ronald Burkle decidió ceder a las preguntas de Trump. ""¿Tu no estás del otro lado del TLCAN, Ron, verdad?"", le dijo. ""No, no lo estoy"", contestó.

Como candidato y presidente, Donald Trump ha amenazado con terminar con el tratado, que ha calificado como ""el peor"" acuerdo comercial de la historia de Estados Unidos.

Christina Applegate

Als Kelly ""Dumpfbacke"" Bundy wurde sie mit der Erfolgssitcom ""Eine schrecklich nette Familie"" (1987-1997) bekannt. Alles andere als dumm war dagegen ihre Entscheidung für das Leben: 2008 ließ sich Christina Applegate nach einer Brustkrebs-Diagnose die Original-Brüste entfernen. Vor zwei Wochen wurden ihr auch Eierstöcke und Eileiter entfernt.

Angelina Jolie

Eine riesige Welle schlug auch das öffentliche Bekenntnis zur Brust-OP von Hollywood-Superstar und Sex-Symbol Angelina Jolie. Sie hatte sich 2013 die Brüste entfernen lassen, ein Jahr später folgten die Eierstöcke - ""Meine Kinder werden nicht sagen müssen: 'Meine Mutter ist an Eierstockkrebs gestorben'.""

Anastacia

Sängerin Anastacia (49) wählte ebenfalls die drastische Variante, nachdem sie seit der Diagnose 2003 jahrelang gegen den Brustkrebs angekämpft hatte. Als der Krebs 2013 wiederkam, unterzog sie sich einer beidseitigen Mastektomie.

Rita Wilson

Das Thema erneut auf den Tisch gebracht hat Filmemacherin Rita Wilson (60, ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding""). Wie sie 2015 bekanntgab, war bei ihr Brustkrebs diagnostiziert worden, woraufhin sie sich zur OP entschloss.

Olivia Newton-John

Bei dem britisch-australischen ""Grease""-Star Olivia Newton-John (69) wurde 1992 Brustkrebs diagnostiziert. Sie unterzog sich einer Mastektomie. 25 Jahre lang hörte man nichts mehr zum Thema. Tolle Aussichten eigentlich, doch leider gab die Künstlerin im Mai 2017 bekannt, erneut gegen die heimtückische Krankheit ankämpfen zu müssen.

Sharon Osbourne

Reality-Star und Schockrocker-Gattin Sharon Osbourne (65) erhoffte sich ebenfalls viel von der drastischen Operation. Die Angst vor einem möglichen Brustkrebs veranlasste auch sie dazu, sich beide Brüste abnehmen zu lassen, wie sie 2012 bekanntgab.

Kathy Bates

Auch Kathy Bates (69, ""Misery"") veröffentlichte 2012, dass sie sich wegen Brustkrebs ihre beiden Brüste abnehmen ließ. ""Nach langer Überlegung habe ich eine doppelte Mastektomie vornehmen lassen. Zum Glück muss ich mich keiner Strahlen- oder Chemotherapie unterziehen"", erklärte sie damals in einem Interview. Zuvor hatte sie bereits ihren Eierstockkrebs überstanden.

Patricia Kelly

Kurz vor ihrem 40. Geburtstag wurde bei Patricia Kelly (47) Brustkrebs diagnostiziert. Daraufhin ließ sie sich im Oktober 2010 das Gewebe in ihrer Brust herausoperieren. ""Es hat unmenschlich wehgetan. Man hatte das Gefühl, als wenn tausend Messer die Brust zerschneiden. Es brannte alles wie Feuer"", schilderte die Sängerin die Operation später im Interview mit ""Stern TV"". Seitdem trägt sie eine Prothese.

Wie genau die OP abläuft, erklärte der einstige Kelly-Family-Star im Interview auch: ""Der Innenbereich, also das Gewebe wurde entfernt, die Haut bleibt bestehen und die Prothese ersetzt das Gewebe."" Sie sei dankbar, dass sie sich trotz der Prothese weiblich fühlen könne und freut sich: ""Ich hätte vor der OP nie gedacht, dass es so schön ist.

BANASKANTHA -- Union Minister Uma Bharti on Thursday said Mahatama Gandhi's murder only benefitted Congress.

Bharti told media, ""Mahatma Gandhi's murder only benefitted Congress as he was about to disband Congress.""

She further said, the murder of Mahatma Gandhi needs reconsideration.

""Godsey may have killed Gandhi, but who instigated him?,"" questioned Bharti.

Mahatma Gandhi was murdered on January 30, 1948 in Delhi by Nathuram Vinayak Godse, who was a member of Hindu Mahasabha.

Bharti's comments come after the Supreme Court on October 6 appointed senior advocate and former additional solicitor general Amrender Sharan as amicus curiae on a plea seeking re-probe of Gandhi's murder.

The plea is filed by Mumbai-based Dr Pankaj Phadnis , a researcher and a trustee of Abhinav Bharat.

Bharti, who was here to participate in Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Gaurav Yatra, said that the people of Gujarat have given the BJP as well as the nation a sense of pride.

She claimed that the BJP will win 160-165 seats in the upcoming Gujarat Assembly elections.

The 14th legislative assembly election in Gujarat is to be held by the end of 2017 as the term of 13th assembly ends on January 22, 2018.

""BJP President Amit Shah has said about winning 150 seats, but I want to add that we (BJP will get 160-165 seats in Gujarat assembly elections,"" said Bharti.

When asked to comment on Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi's allegations against the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, she refused to comment by saying that ""for his own party, he must be a big leader but for me he is not so big that I comment anything on him.""

She said because of the Gujarat model, Modi became the Prime Minister of India and even Opposition accepted Gujarat Model that Prime Minister Modi developed while being Chief Minister of Gujarat.

HARCÈLEMENT SEXUEL - Chaque jour, la liste des victimes de Harvey Weinstein, empêtré dans un scandale de harcèlement sexuel et d'accusations de viol, ne cesse de s'allonger. Après les Françaises Emma de Caunes et Léa Seydoux, c'est au tour de la comédienne Florence Darel de témoigner dans une interview accordée au Parisien, ce jeudi 12 octobre.

Âgée de 49 ans, elle explique avoir subi les avances du producteur américain à 26 ans. Miramax, la société qu'il a co-fondée, avait à l'époque, en 1994, acheté ""Fausto"", le film dans lequel elle jouait. Pendant une avant-première à New York, la française raconte qu'Harvey Weinstein l'a appelée de nombreuses fois pour qu'ils se rejoignent après la fête.

""Comme je me doutais de ses intentions, j'ai prétexté que j'étais en couple avec l'acteur principal du film. Pour qu'il me lâche"", explique-t-elle.

Un an plus tard, en 1995, Harvey Weinstein est revenu à la charge. ""Il avait fait appeler chez mes parents pour signaler qu'il voulait me voir. Comme j'avais refusé, il était passé par mon agent qui m'avait dit: 'Tu ne peux pas faire l'économie d'y aller'"".

""Si tu veux continuer en Amérique, passe par moi""

L'actrice s'est donc rendue au rendez-vous, donné dans une suite du Ritz. ""Il gueulait parce qu'il n'y avait pas de jacuzzi dans la chambre. Sa femme était à côté."" Le producteur lui a ensuite parlé d'un projet de film sur la guerre 39-45. Jusqu'au dérapage: ""Il s'est mis à me dire qu'il me trouvait très attirante et qu'il voulait avoir des relations avec moi. Je lui ai dit que j'étais très amoureuse de mon compagnon"".

C'est à ce moment qu'Harvey Weinstein lui propose un marché. ""Il m'a répondu que ça ne le gênait pas du tout et m'a proposé d'être sa maîtresse quelques jours par an. Comme ça, on pourrait travailler ensemble. En gros, 'si tu veux continuer en Amérique, passe par moi'"", confie l'actrice dans l'interview.

Effrayée, Florence Darel raconte qu'elle s'est excusée et est partie de la chambre. Mais plus pessimiste, elle pense aujourd'hui que rien ne va changer, malgré l'ampleur du scandale. ""Tout le monde, ne serait-ce que les organisateurs de festivals, est aux premières loges pour savoir ce qui se passe dans les hôtels. Pourquoi est-ce que les agents envoient des actrices à des prédateurs? Pourquoi est-on censées aller rencontrer des producteurs dans des chambres d'hôtel? Il n'y a pas de garde-fous parce qu'il y a cette espèce de non-dit qui sous-entend: ""Si tu veux faire ce métier, tu dois coucher de temps en temps'"".

A Muslim teen has alleged that he was picked up by the police in Uttar Pradesh and charged with hacking, following a status update he posted on a recent court ruling on rivers Ganga and Yamuna. Speaking at a press conference organised by the Bhim Army in New Delhi, 18-year-old Zakir Ali Tyagi said that in April this year, police arrested him and then tortured him in their custody on the basis of various unfounded allegations.

Tyagi's status message had read: ""The Ganga has been declared a living entity; will criminal charges be initiated if someone drowns in it?"" Telegraph reports that Tyagi had meant it as a wisecrack on a High Court ruling on Ganga and Yamuna, asking the rivers to be treated as persons with rights.

However, he was charged under Section 66 of the Information Technology Act which could lead to a jail term of three years and deals with 'hacking'. The Telegraph quotes the FIR accusing Tyagi of posting 'galat tareeke ke (wrong type of) comments"" on Facebook.

The Telegraph spoke to Wasim Nadeeq Khan, who got Tyagi legal aid. He told them: ""The police had initially registered the FIR under Section 66A, which prescribes three years' jail for offensive posts, unaware that the Supreme Court had struck it down as unconstitutional in March 2015. When they realised the mistake, they merely dropped the letter 'A'.""

Tyagi was also booked under Section 420 of the IPC for having the picture of a police officer as his profile picture. The picture was of Akhtar Khan, a police officer killed on duty in Greater Noida, he had out the picture as a protest against his murder like people on Facebook tend to do.

Tyagi was let off almost after a month, following postponed bail hearings. In fact, once he was remanded in custody as the magistrate decided his was a 'serious' matter and he deserved to spend more time in jail.

Ο όμιλος China Evergrande του 59χρονου Σου έχει αξία 43 δισεκ. δολαρίων, αν και το συνολικό του χρέος ξεπερνά τα 100 δισεκ. δολάρια. Χάρη στην αύξηση της αξίας των ακινήτων, ο πλούτος του Σου αυξήθηκε κατά 30 δισεκ. δολάρια τον τελευταίο χρόνο και ο ίδιος βρέθηκε στην κορυφή της κατάταξης των πλουσίων που συντάσσει κάθε χρόνο η Hurun Report και που δόθηκε σήμερα στη δημοσιότητα. Η Evergrande, της οποίας οι μετοχές έχουν ενισχυθεί κατά 480% φέτος, τώρα κατατάσσεται ως η τρίτη μεγαλύτερη στη χώρα ανάπτυξης ακινήτων βάσει πωλήσεων.

Ο Σου έχει σημαίνοντα ρόλο και εντός του κυβερνώντος Κομμουνιστικού Κόμματος. Ο ίδιος είναι μέλος του Κινεζικού Λαϊκού Συμβουλευτικού Συνεδρίου, του ανώτατου συμβουλευτικού οργάνου. Και το Κρατικό Συμβούλιο, το υπουργικό συμβούλιο της χώρας, του απένειμε τον τίτλο «Εθνικό Πρότυπο Εργαζομένου» - μια από τις υψηλότερες τιμητικές διακρίσεις για τους πολίτες στην Κίνα.

Ο Σου αποφοίτησε από το Wuhan University of Science and Technology το 1982 και του απονεμήθηκε τιμητικός διδακτορικός τίτλος στο εμπόριο από το University of West Alabama το 2008.

Ίδρυσε την Evergrande το 1996, την οποία εισήγαγε στο χρηματιστήριο του Χονγκ Κονγκ το 2009 με την αρχική δημόσια προσφορά της να συγκεντρώνει περίπου 6 δισεκ. δολάρια Χονγκ Κονγκ (767 εκατ. δολάρια). Η εταιρία έχει χτίσει χιλιάδες σπίτια για τη μεσαία τάξη στην Κίνα ενώ το 2010 βρέθηκε στο επίκεντρο της δημοσιότητας όταν αγόρασε την ποδοσφαιρική ομάδα της Γκουανγκτζόου έναντι 100 εκατ. γιουάν (15 εκατ. δολαρίων). Το 2014, ο Σου πούλησε το ήμισυ του ποδοσφαιρικού συλλόγου στη μεγαλύτερη εταιρία ηλεκτρονικού εμπορίου της Κίνας, την Alibaba, για 192 εκατ. δολάρια. Ο ιδρυτής της Alibaba Τζακ Μα είχε δηλώσει τότε ότι ο ίδιος και ο Σου έκλεισαν τη συμφωνία κατά τη διάρκεια ενός δείπνου και ότι την ολοκλήρωσαν λίγες ημέρες αργότερα.

Στη δεύτερη θέση της κατάταξης της Hurun Report βρέθηκε ο Πόνυ Μα, γενικός διευθυντής του κολοσσού του διαδικτύου Tencent με περιουσία 37 δισεκ. δολαρίων, ενώ την τρίτη θέση στο βάθρο κατέλαβε ο Τζακ Μα με περιουσία 30 δισεκ. δολαρίων.

ÉTATS-UNIS - Alors que les témoignages contre Harvey Weinstein se multiplient, les ennuis judiciaires commencent. La police de New York a ouvert une enquête sur une agression sexuelle présumée remontant à 2004 dont est accusé le producteur américain, a indiqué jeudi 12 octobre un porte-parole.

Depuis la publication d'un article du New York Times le 5 octobre, les accusations de harcèlement, d'agressions sexuelles et de viols visant le magnat de Hollywood se multiplient, certaines remontant à plus de vingt ans. Il s'agit de la première enquête ouverte, après ces révélations.

Selon le quotidien new-yorkais Daily News, la justice chercherait à recueillir des éléments concernant des accusations de l'actrice Lucia Evans, publiée mardi par le magazine américain The New Yorker. Elle assure que Harvey Weinstein l'aurait forcée à lui faire une fellation en 2004, à New York. Dans le même article, deux autres femmes avaient rapporté avoir été violées par le producteur.

Selon le quotidien New York Post, le responsable de l'unité chargée des enquêtes liées aux crimes sexuels au sein de la police de New York aurait demandé à son équipe de se mettre en quête de tout élément concernant des cas éventuels de harcèlement ou d'agression sexuelle liés à Harvey Weinstein.

En 2015, la police de New York avait ouvert une enquête après un dépôt de plainte par une mannequin italienne, Ambra Battilana Gutierrez, affirmant que Harvey Weinstein l'avait agressée sexuellement dans une chambre d'hôtel. Les policiers avaient réalisé un enregistrement d'une conversation entre le géant d'Hollywood et la jeune femme, lors de laquelle il tentait de l'attirer de nouveau dans sa chambre avec insistance, ce qu'elle avait refusé.

“We are not in a good place to hash things out when we are angry and triggered and need time to process what’s happening.
It is up to you to determine what you need, and not your partner’s job to predict this after simply telling them you’re upset.

When you’ve lost sight of what you were even arguing about in the first place.","Conventional relationship wisdom says couples should settle their disagreements before bed and never go to sleep still mad at each other. And while this advice is well-intentioned, in some cases, it can actually worsen the problem at hand.

We asked relationship experts to tell us the types of arguments that call for hitting the hay and revisiting the discussion at a later time. Below, seven times to sleep on it, according to therapists and psychologists:

1. When you’re really tired.

“Lack of sleep can greatly exacerbate conflict. When couples are exhausted, they are more irritable and snippy. Going to bed mad can often mean that you wake up feeling okay, especially if the conflict was exacerbated or even entirely caused by two irritable, fatigued people sniping at one another.

Also, the idea that going to bed angry is ‘bad’ leads to many couples staying up later than they should, trying to resolve fights and often failing, as they get more and more entrenched in their positions. When you have a good night’s sleep, you can much more easily see your partner’s position and empathize, which means that making up is finally possible.” ― Samantha Rodman, psychologist and dating coach

2. When you’ve been drinking.

“The heated conversations of the overserved can travel to strange places, and the more drunk, the less constructive they tend to be. It might be best to call a time out, have a glass of water, and revisit the squabble in the morning, if you still remember it.” ― Ryan Howes, psychologist

3. When you’re really worked up.

“When in conflict, the body often goes into fight-or-flight mode. ‘Fight’ usually results in an elevated heart rate, an increase in stress hormones and an inability to think rationally. You cannot have a meaningful conversation, much less attempt problem solving, when your body is in this state. If you recognize it, you need to find a way to self-soothe. Some people go for a walk, some take a shower, some meditate and some sleep. If your anger has gotten the best of you, sleep may in fact be your best strategy for repair, especially if it’s late.” ― Zach Brittle, therapist and founder of the online couples therapy series forBetter

4. When you need more time to process your feelings.

“We are not in a good place to hash things out when we are angry and triggered and need time to process what’s happening. Anger provides useful information to us and is a signal that something needs to change. Specifically, you want to do this in a constructive way (journaling, reflecting, physical activity, sleep) and not destructively (lengthy discussions, yelling, violence). It is up to you to determine what you need, and not your partner’s job to predict this after simply telling them you’re upset. Sleep also provides a mental filing of things experienced or learned throughout the day, so it’s an even better time to allow for processing of these strong emotions.” ― Kari Carroll, couples therapist

5. When the conflict requires a mediator.

“Some conflicts are ongoing and require intervention, like therapy. Trying to resolve these in one evening just so you don’t go to sleep angry would be impossible, and would leave both partners feeling hopeless and like they must be doing something wrong if they can’t resolve things.” ― Samantha Rodman

6. When you have a big day the next day.

“You may have a bone to pick, but it’s 11 p.m. and your partner has a job interview first thing in the morning. Or a final exam. Or major surgery. If it’s possible to hold onto your moderate grudge until their major event has passed, that may be the most loving, considerate thing to do. But once their event is over, do talk about it, because buried resentments wreak havoc over time.” ― Ryan Howes

Deaths By Suicide May Be Falling, But We Must Realise That Every Single One Can Be Prevented It's wonderful news that suicide rates among adults have fallen in the UK and are at a six-year low.

We could get there a lot faster and be way more effective about reducing suicides if the government actually prioritised this.

Silence is complicity and all that. But the real reason we critically need men to add their voice to the debate is their very notable absence from it.

INTERNATIONAL - Les Etats-Unis ont annoncé ce jeudi 12 octobre qu'ils se retiraient de l'Unesco, accusant l'institution d'être ""anti-israélienne"".

Les Etats-Unis conserveront un statut d'observateur, a précisé le Département d'Etat, en lieu et place de leur représentation à l'agence onusienne basée à Paris.

Washington avait déjà quitté l'Unesco entre 1984 et 2003.

Le retrait annoncé ce jeudi ne sera effectif qu'à compter du 31 décembre 2018, conformément aux statuts de l'Unesco. ""Cette décision n'a pas été prise à la légère, et reflète les inquiétudes des Etats-Unis concernant l'accumulation des arriérés à l'Unesco, la nécessité d'une réforme en profondeur de l'organisation, et ses partis pris anti-israéliens persistants"".

Washington avait prévenu début juillet de son intention de réexaminer ses liens avec l'Unesco après sa décision de déclarer la vieille ville de Hébron, en Cisjordanie occupée, ""zone protégée"" du patrimoine mondial. Cette décision, qualifiée d'""affront à l'Histoire"", ""discrédite encore plus une agence onusienne déjà hautement discutable"", avait alors déclaré l'ambassadrice américaine à l'ONU, Nikki Haley.

L'inscription d'Hébron sur la liste du patrimoine mondial en danger et la caractérisation par l'Unesco d'Hébron comme ville islamique ont provoqué la fureur israélienne, les juifs revendiquant une présence de 4000 ans à Hébron.

Haut lieu de tensions, Hébron abrite une population de 200.000 Palestiniens et de quelque centaines de colons israéliens, qui sont retranchés dans une enclave protégée par des soldats près du lieu saint que les juifs désignent sous le nom de tombeau des Patriarches et les musulmans mosquée d'Ibrahim.

Le Premier ministre israélien Benjamin Netanyahu avait à l'époque qualifié de ""délirante"" la décision de l'Unesco.

Quelques mois plus tôt, l'Unesco avait identifié Israël comme une force d'occupation à Jérusalem.

Les Etats-Unis, grands alliés d'Israël, avaient déjà pris leurs distances avec l'Unesco. Ils avaient ainsi arrêté de participer à son financement en 2011 après que l'agence a admis les Palestiniens parmi ses Etats membres. Mais ils continuaient depuis à siéger au Conseil exécutif de l'Unesco, composé de 58 membres.

Selon le département d'Etat, un statut d'observateur permettrait de continuer d'apporter la ""vision"" et ""l'expertise"" américaines ""sur certains dossiers importants gérés par l'organisation"", notamment ""la protection du patrimoine mondial, la défense de la liberté de la presse"" et la promotion des sciences et de l'éducation.

Mesures contre l'anti-sémitisme

La directrice générale de l'Unesco Irina Bokova a immédiatement dit ""regretter profondément"" le retrait américain. ""L'universalité est essentielle à la mission de l'Unesco pour construire la paix et la sécurité internationales face à la haine et à la violence, par la défense des droits de l'Homme et de la dignité humaine"", a-t-elle estimé. ""C'est une perte pour la famille des Nations Unies. C'est une perte pour le multilatéralisme.""

Dans son communiqué, Bokova dresse un inventaire de mesures prises par l'Unesco en partenariat avec les Etats-Unis contre l'anti-sémitisme. ""Ensemble, nous avons travaillé avec le regretté Samuel Pisar, Ambassadeur honoraire et envoyé spécial pour l'enseignement de l'Holocauste, afin de partager l'histoire de l'Holocauste pour lutter contre l'antisémitisme et prévenir des génocides, avec la Chaire Unesco pour l'éducation au génocide au sein de l'Université de Californie du Sud et avec celle consacrée à l'alphabétisation au sein de l'Université de Pennsylvanie"".

Ou encore ""nous travaillons avec l'OSCE pour produire de nouveaux outils pour les éducateurs contre toutes les formes d'antisémitisme, comme nous l'avons fait pour combattre le racisme anti-musulman dans les écoles"".

En pleine élection

Cette semaine, le conseil exécutif des 58 pays membres doit désigner celui ou celle qui succédera à la Bulgare Irina Bokova, qui achève deux mandats marqués par des dissensions politiques et les difficultés financières de l'organisation. Il vote chaque jour depuis lundi, à l'issue de sa journée de travaux. Jusqu'à quatre tours de scrutin peuvent être organisés si aucun candidat n'atteint la majorité absolue. Si un cinquième vote devait être organisé, il porterait alors sur les deux arrivés en tête au 4e tour. Ce choix sera ensuite soumis à l'approbation de la conférence générale des 195 États membres le 10 novembre.

Les pays arabes ont aussi de leur côté revendiqué fermement la direction générale, pointant que leur groupe n'avait jamais occupé le poste. Néanmoins ils sont arrivés divisés sur la ligne de départ, avec initialement quatre candidatures.

Les candidats du Qatar et de la France sont arrivés en tête et à égalité mercredi à l'issue du troisième tour de scrutin pour l'élection. Alors que cinq candidats restent en lice, après le retrait mercredi du représentant du Vietnam, Hamad bin Abdoulaziz Al-Kawari, 69 ans, et Audrey Azoulay, 45 ans, ont chacun recueilli 18 des 58 voix du conseil exécutif de l'Unesco, selon les résultats officiels.

En filigrane de cette élection, figure donc la question israélo-palestinienne, avec des positions controversées de l'Unesco sur Jérusalem et Hébron, et l'adhésion en 2011 de la Palestine à l'organisation, qui a entraîné la suspension du financement des États-Unis. Or, ces derniers fournissaient près du quart du budget de l'agence, qui ""est fragile car elle n'a pas énormément de moyens financiers ni de moyens humains"", souligne-t-on de source diplomatique. L'Union européenne et ses États-membres en sont aujourd'hui le premier financeur (40% du budget).","Les Etats-Unis se retirent de l'UNESCO accusant l'institution d'être ""anti-israélienne""",http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2017/10/12/les-etats-unis-se-retirent-de-lunesco-accusant-linstitution-detre-anti-israelienne_a_23241145/?utm_hp_ref=fr-homepage

She told him repeatedly that she was uncomfortable and that she wanted to leave.

But she also said she was “sorry.”

This conversation between the two of them, captured during an FBI sting and published in Ronan Farrow’s New Yorker report on Tuesday, is a textbook example of psychological and emotional abuse, and shows that predatory behavior is truly insidious and rarely solely physical.

During the recorded conversation, Weinstein repeatedly tried to guilt Gutierrez into coming in to his hotel room for a drink while he took a shower, even though she voiced her discomfort. His tone was angry and desperate as he told her that she was embarrassing him, that she was making a scene in a hotel where he frequently stays.

His pained voice reassured her that he was not going to “do anything,” that he was sorry for groping her breast the day prior, that he was just “used to” being able to do that to women. He repeatedly issued unfinished threats, ominously trailing off after saying, “If you embarrass me in this hotel...”

This kind of rhetoric ― the kind that makes the victim look like they’re in the wrong when the opposite is actually true ― is common in abusive relationships, particularly in intimate partner relationships.

Domestic violence prevention and awareness resources show that emotional or psychological abuse can often predicate physical or sexual violence and therefore serve as a warning sign of what’s to come ― and though Weinstein and Gutierrez were not in a romantic relationship, the incident is still indicative of how control, manipulation and abuse can manifest.

Ruth Glenn, the executive director at the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, told HuffPost that the way Weinstein spoke to Gutierrez was “textbook” abuse.

“The cajoling and the shaming ... what he was conveying was, ‘I can destroy you and I have the power to do with you what I will.’”

Glenn also told HuffPost that emotional abuse is often the most difficult thing to recover from after an instance of violence.

“The first things that victims and survivors will say is the hardest thing to get over is the psychological and emotional abuse,” she said. “It is permanent. And it really reaches in to your psyche.”

Weinstein’s conversation with Gutierrez is also known as “gaslighting,” a term that’s picked up traction in recent years, especially in the wake of the 2016 election. Gaslighting is an abusive tactic in which the abuser makes their victim question their memory, perception, and overall sanity. HuffPost’s Melissa Jeltsen used the term last year to describe then-presidential candidate Donald Trump. “The GOP front-runner is gaslighting us — a technique that involves lying, then feigning outrage when caught,” she wrote.

Weinstein’s repeated pleading for Gutierrez not to “embarrass” him or “cause a scene” shows how gaslighting can make an abuse victim feel like they are the one that’s made a situation hostile rather than the actual abuser. It’s no surprise, then, that in their conversation, Gutierrez finds herself apologizing to the man making her feel unsafe.",The Harvey Weinstein Tape Is A Masterclass On Emotional Abuse,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-harvey-weinstein-tape-is-a-masterclass-on-emotional-abuse_us_59dce98ee4b0cee762dd50bd

It's what enables them move freely and detect any potential dangers that may lie ahead while walking down the street.

Enter smartphone users.

It's no surprise that Australians love their technology -- we even have more phones in this country than people -- but this love has become an unhealthy and dangerous obsession, particularly when those who insist on walking and texting bump into blind or visually impaired people.

Close to 60 percent of people who were bumped in to reported that it was caused by a fellow pedestrian engrossed in their mobile phone.

Close to 60 percent of people who were bumped into while using their white cane reported that the incidents were caused by fellow pedestrians who were too busy to take their eyes off their phone, according to a Guide Dogs Australia report.

What's even worse is that in the last two years almost half of all cane users had their canes broken by someone walking into them.

""Sometimes running into someone can just be a shock but other times it can be very harmful, upsetting and disorienting for the person with vision loss, particularly when it results in an injury or a broken cane,"" Karen Hayes, CEO of Guide Dogs Victoria, said.

""The most common cause for these situations, when it can be identified, is that the other person was on their mobile phone and not paying attention to where they were walking.

""We all have a role to play in helping to make sure people who with low vision or blindness can get around their communities safely and confidently, just like everyone else.""

One way to do this is to keep your phone in your pocket while moving about or if that's too difficult, ""using more caution by slowing your pace and looking up often"".

Tips for assisting people who are blind or have low vision It should go without saying but don't be a dickhead -- put the phone away while you're walking in public or regularly look up from it; Approach: if you suspect someone may need a hand, walk up, greet them and identify yourself; Ask: ""Would you like some help?"" The person will either accept your offer or tell you if they don't require assistance; Assist: Listen to the reply and assist as required. Not all people who are blind or vision impaired will want assistance -- don't be offended if your assistance is not required.

""Many of us have become accustomed to using our mobile devices constantly, but it's something we can easily be more mindful of to help ensure all Australians are able to feel safe and independent,"" Hayes said.

""Our instructors work with white cane users across Australia to teach them the skills they need to get around their communities safely and independently, but unfortunately there are certain environmental factors, like moving people, that they can't identify until it's too late.""",Smartphone Obsessed Aussies Are Knocking Over Blind People In The Streets,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/10/11/smartphone-obsessed-aussies-are-knocking-over-blind-people-in-the-streets_a_23240604/

PARIS, Oct 12 (Reuters) - The United States announced on Thursday it was withdrawing from UNESCO, the U.N.’s cultural and educational agency, complaining about how it is run and about what Washington described as bias against Israel.

“This decision was not taken lightly, and reflects U.S. concerns with mounting arrears at UNESCO, the need for fundamental reform in the organization, and continuing anti-Israel bias,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement.

The withdrawal of the United States, which provides a fifth of UNESCO’s funding, is a severe blow for the Paris-based organization which began work in 1946 and is known for designating World Heritage sites such as the ancient city of Palmyra in Syria and the Grand Canyon National Park.

Under UNESCO rules, the withdrawal will become effective as of the end of December 2018. Until that time, the United States, which provides around $80 million to UNESCO annually, will remain a full member.

The organization, which employs around 2,000 people worldwide, most of them based in Paris, has long been the object of criticism over its use of resources and resolutions that have been perceived by Israel and other countries as biased.

Director-General Irina Bokova expressed disappointment at the U.S. decision.

“At the time when conflicts continue to tear apart societies across the world, it is deeply regrettable for the United States to withdraw from the United Nations agency promoting education for peace and protecting culture under attack,” she said.

“This is a loss to the United Nations family. This is a loss for multilateralism.”

UNESCO is in the process of selecting a new chief, whose priority will be to revive its fortunes.

The U.S. move underscores the skepticism expressed by President Donald Trump about the need for the United States to remain engaged in multi-lateral bodies. The president has touted an “America First” policy, which puts U.S. economic and nationalist interests ahead of international commitments.

Since Trump took office, the United States has abandoned the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade talks, withdrawn from the Paris climate deal and opened up a renegotiation of a decades old trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, NAFTA. Trump has also called NATO obsolete, though he has since backtracked on that.

Diplomats expressed concern about the loss of U.S. engagement.

“The absence of the United States or any large country with a lot of power is a loss. It’s not just about money, it’s promoting ideals that are vital to countries like the United States, such as education and culture,” a UNESCO-based diplomat said.

For differing reasons, Britain, Japan and Brazil are among states that have yet to pay their dues for 2017.

After three days of secret balloting that could run until Friday, Qatar’s Hamad bin Abdulaziz al-Kawari and France’s Audrey Azoulay are tied to win the top post at the organization, with Egyptian hopeful Moushira Khattab in third. Two other candidates trail.

The horrifying allegations have kicked off discussions about the way industries like Hollywood enable abuse, and the shame attached to the big and small violations women deal with on a daily basis. But for some men, the takeaway from these allegations is that men should avoid meeting with women.

On Tuesday night, Seb Gorka, former Deputy Assistant to President Donald Trump, tweeted, “If Weinstein had obeyed @VP Pence’s rules for meeting with the opposite sex, none of those poor women would ever have been abused.” (Mike Pence has previously stated that he follows the “Billy Graham Rule,” and won’t eat a meal alone with a woman except for his wife or attend events where there is alcohol present without her.)

This morning, conservative radio host Erick Erickson wrote a piece asking everyone to “revisit Mike Pence’s rule about meeting with women alone” in light of the Weinstein allegations. “Mike Pence could never be accused of wanting to have sex with someone other than his wife in these sorts of situations because he avoids putting himself and the other person into these situations,” he wrote.

There are a few obvious problems with the suggestion that men must avoid being alone in a room (or at a restaurant table) with a woman in order to avoid committing sexual harassment ― or at least avoid charges of harassment.

First, it implies that men are unable to control their own behavior when in the presence of a woman, and that men have no way of gauging the difference between a professional relationship and a sexual or sexually violating one. (Men, you deserve better than that! I believe in your ability to interact with a woman and not harass or assault her!) It also implies that when women agree to a one-on-one professional meeting with a man, they are putting themselves in harm’s way ― just a hop, skip and a jump away from “asking for it.”

If you think being in the same room with a woman makes it hard to avoid raping or harassing her, perhaps you should stay home. Forever. pic.twitter.com/TN17d1asrN — Jessica Valenti (@JessicaValenti) October 11, 2017

Additionally, when men, who tend to still be the gatekeepers of any industry, decide that they must roll back spending time with their woman colleagues or employees, it can have real, lasting impact on those women’s careers.

A recent New York Times report looked at the ways powerful men across industries have begun scaling back their interactions with female colleagues because of a fear that they might end up facing harassment allegations.

“In Silicon Valley, some male investors have declined one-on-one meetings with women, or rescheduled them from restaurants to conference rooms,” reported Claire Cain Miller. “On Wall Street, certain senior men have tried to avoid closed-door meetings with junior women. And in TV news, some male executives have scrupulously minded their words in conversations with female talent.”

Professional intimacy and relationship-building are key to advancing in any industry. That’s how lower-level employees find mentors or sponsors, or find out about new professional challenges. People give opportunities and recognition to people they trust, and that trust is built through person-to-person interaction ― both at the office and outside of it.

When men decide to limit their interactions with women in order to “protect” women (and themselves), the only people who lose out are those women.","No, The Lesson Of Harvey Weinstein Isn't That Men Shouldn't Meet With Women",http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/no-the-lesson-of-harvey-weinstein-isnt-that-men-shouldnt-meet-with-women_us_59de3052e4b0b26332e8746d

""Gender equality is not only an issue for women and girls,"" explains Canadian Prime Minister @justinpjtrudeau in an exclusive essay for MarieClaire.com. ""Our sons have the power and the responsibility to change our culture of sexism."" Link in bio to read why #JustinTrudeau is raising his kids to be feminists.

""L'égalité de genre n'est pas seulement une question pour les femmes et les filles"", explique le premier ministre Canadien Justin Trudeau dans un essai exclusif pour MarieClaire.com. ""Nos fils ont le pouvoir et la responsabilité de changer notre culture sexiste.""

Justin Trudeau explique que s'il est fier du travail de son équipe pour faire du Canada un pays plus ouvert, plus inclusif, plus juste, et plus égal, son travail continue aussi à la maison.

""Chaque jour, j'ai l'opportunité incroyable -avec ma femme Sophie- d'encourager des valeurs d'empathie, de compassion, d'amour-propre et de justice chez nos trois enfants"" écrit-il.

Il continue en disant qu'il est particulièrement fier de sa fille Ella-Grace, qui est ""gentille, très intelligente, une débatteuse passionnée, ouverte au monde autour d'elle"".

Justin Trudeau continue en disant qu'il aime sa fille, mais qu'il s'inquiète des obstacles auxquels les femmes doivent faire face chaque jour. ""On est en 2017, mais au Canada et autour du monde, les filles et les femmes font toujours face à de la violence, de la discrimination, des stéréotypes qui les limitent, et des opportunités inégales qui les empêchent de réaliser leurs rêves"", écrit le premier ministre. Il poursuit en confiant qu'il trouve exaspérant que sa fille grandisse dans ce monde où: ""il y aura toujours des personnes qui ne la prendront pas au sérieux simplement parce que c'est une fille"".

""Quand nous sommes égaux, nous sommes plus libres""

Justin Trudeau explique qu'il travaille chaque jour pour tenter de changer ces inégalités, mais que le vrai changement viendra de sa fille elle-même, puisque lui et sa femme ne pourront pas être avec elle à chaque moment de sa vie.

""La meilleure chose que nous pouvons faire est d'aider. Elle va apprendre qu'elle a un immense pouvoir et une valeur intrinsèque, et que personne ne peut lui retirer ça. Qu'elle a une voix forte qu'elle peut utiliser. Ça veut dire l'élever en tant que féministe. Point final.""

Justin Trudeau vante les mérites de sa femme Sophie, ""une partenaire incroyable dans ce projet"".

""L'égalité entre les genres n'est pas seulement une problématique pour les femmes et les filles. Chacun de nous gagne lorsque les femmes et les filles ont les mêmes opportunités que les hommes et les garçons"", écrit-il. Il dit qu'il faut changer la culture du sexisme, et que c'est quelque chose qu'il apprend à ses fils.

""Le féminisme n'est pas seulement croire que les hommes et les femmes sont égaux. Quand nous sommes égaux, nous sommes plus libres"", note-t-il.

I'm Not Going To Let MS Stop Me From Exercising - It's What Keeps Me Fighting I spent a lot of time in the gym when I was teenager. Initially it was more of a social thing, but slowly exercise became a way of life for me. I imagined myself strong and healthy, and assumed I'd always be able to go for runs and lift heavy weights. What I never considered at 16 was that I'd soon be diagnosed with a condition that would force me to rethink exercise entirely. Mum to Dante and MS Society supporter

El club de escalada Climb'O clock, abierto recientemente en el centro de Rangún, capital económica birmana en plena mutación, le permite usar el muro de escalada para las clases, que comienzan siempre con un calentamiento colectivo en el suelo.

Entre siete y diez personas, en su mayoría mujeres, asisten a ellas. Como el muro se encuentra en la planta baja de un edificio, los transeúntes ven cómo las mujeres, con mallas de licra, suben equipadas con un arnés y con la ayuda de un empleado del club.

The prime minister is on a two-day trip to the U.S. capital, timed to overlap with the kickoff of the fourth round of NAFTA renegotiations.

Before the two leaders' meeting, the pair sat before a throng of reporters in the Oval Office, where Trudeau stressed the two countries' ""interwoven"" economies and cultures. He looked forward to being in the audience of the U.S. president again, he said.

Trump then commented on an NBC report, denying an allegation that he asked for a tenfold increase in nuclear weapons. After calling the U.S. broadcaster ""fake news,"" the president boasted about his country's stockpile of nuclear arms.

""Right now we have so many nuclear weapons. I want them in perfect condition, perfect shape. That's the only thing I've ever discussed,"" he said.

Trudeau withheld comment while the repartee between Trump and reporters shifted back to trade talks. Then the president acknowledged Trudeau's agenda.

""In all fairness, the prime minister wants to protect Canada and his people also. So we'll see what happens with NAFTA,"" Trump said.

The president then casually addressed the prime minister by his first name and hinted that if NAFTA renegotiations fail, a new trade deal could be in the works.

""And I mean, I think Justin understands this. If we can't make a deal, it'll be terminated and that'll be fine. They're gonna do well. We're gonna do well.

Pour cette étude, 400 femmes, toutes accouchant pour la première fois et en bonne santé, ont accepté de débuter le travail sous péridurale puis, désignées au hasard et sans le savoir, de continuer sous antidouleurs ou avec un placebo de solution saline.

Personne -futures mamans, chercheurs, sages-femmes ou obstétriciens- ne savait ce qui était diffusé par les cathéters, une méthode dite de ""double aveugle"" pour assurer la fiabilité et l'impartialité de l'étude.

La seconde partie de l'accouchement intervient quand le col de l'utérus est complètement dilaté et se termine quand le bébé vient au monde.

Plus le travail est long, plus les risques sont élevés, notamment pour la santé du bébé. Et pour éviter les complications, les obstétriciens décident souvent d'interrompre la péridurale.

Mais les résultats de l'étude indiquent que, péridurale ou pas, la durée de l'accouchementest à peu près la même: 52 minutes pour les femmes bénéficiant d'antidouleurs contre 51 pour celles ayant obtenu la solution saline, soit une différence de 3,3%.

Des études complémentaires restent nécessaires

La péridurale n'a pas non plus d'effet sur la santé des nouveaux-nés, le taux d'accouchement par voie naturelle, la position du bébé à la naissance et toute autre mesure du bien-être de l'enfant, selon l'étude.

L'essai a été stoppé pour 38 femmes -17 sous placebo, 21 sous péridurale- dont l'accouchement était compliqué. Comme attendu, les femmes n'étant plus sous péridurale ont connu une fin d'accouchement plus douloureux.

""Nous n'avons pas vu d'effet négatif mais l'analgésie péridurale lors de la seconde étape de l'accouchement reste sujet à controverse et mérite des études supplémentaires"", a commenté l'auteur principal de l'enquête, Philip Hess, directeur du service d'anesthésie obstétrique au Centre médical Beth Israel Deaconess à Boston, et professeurs-associé à l'École de médecine de Harvard.

Épisiotomie en baisse

Le taux d'épisiotomie continue à diminuer (de 27% à 20% des femmes entre 2010 et 2016), après les recommandations du CNGOF en 2005 de ne pas faire d'épisiotomie systématique, en raison de l'absence de bénéfice dans la prévention des lésions sévères du périnée.

De manière intéressante, la sensibilisation des professionnels à l'utilisation anormalement élevée de l'oxytocine (l'hormone qui déclenche l'accouchement) pendant le travail en France, et à ses risques pour la santé maternelle, a conduit à une baisse de son utilisation (de 57,6% à 44,3% chez les femmes en travail spontané), avant même les recommandations émises fin 2016 par le Collège national des sages-femmes et celui des gynécologues-obstétriciens.

Plus de grossesses à risque

Les femmes ne se ménagent pas. La consommation de tabac pendant la grossesse n'a pas baissé, et 17% des femmes ont fumé au moins une cigarette par jour au troisième trimestre de la grossesse. Par ailleurs, la fréquence de l'allaitement maternel exclusif durant le séjour à la maternité a diminué de manière importante entre 2010 et 2016, de 60% à 52%. De plus, l'allaitement maternel à la maternité, qu'il soit exclusif ou mixte, a légèrement diminué, de 68% en 2010 à 66% en 2016.

Le taux de prématurité et de petits poids à la naissance augmentent

D'autres éléments de l'étude Inserm ont été révélés, comme l'augmentation du taux de prématurité entre 1995 et 2016. Ce résultat pose question dans la mesure où d'autres pays réussissent à avoir des taux faibles et stables ou en baisse. Une augmentation de la fréquence des enfants de petit poids pour l'âge gestationnel est également observée entre 2010 et 2016.

A new study finds that people who lived close to trees or vegetation had an eight to 12 per cent reduced risk of dying compared to those that didn't.

FREDERICTON — A new study suggests having daily exposure to trees and other greenery can extend your life.

Dan Crouse of the University of New Brunswick, along with other researchers across Canada and the United States, studied 1.3 million Canadians in 30 cities over an 11-year period.

""We found that those who have more trees and vegetation around where they lived had an eight to 12 per cent reduced risk of dying compared to those who didn't,'' Crouse said Wednesday.

""... if you live in a greener area, compared to a less greener area, there's about a 10-per-cent reduced risk of dying."" Dan Crouse, study author

The study used data from the 2001 long-form census and compared it to Canadian mortality data base for the next 11 years.

Researchers took into account the amount of trees, plants, shrubs and other vegetation within 250 metres of an individual's home and created estimates of daily greenness exposure, he said.

They also used community data such as socioeconomic makeup and environmental characteristics like air pollution and population density.

The greenery effect was varied

""Holding all that constant, if you live in a greener area, compared to a less greener area, there's about a 10-per-cent reduced risk of dying,'' he said.

Crouse said he had heard anecdotal stories from people who said their stress level was reduced after spending time with nature, but he was surprised at the impact that green space can have.

Researchers found the protective effects of exposure to green space weren't the same for everyone, however.

Watch: other benefits to living near trees

""One thing that was kind of striking is that we found that those who were in the highest income bracket and those who had the highest levels of education were benefiting more from the exposure to greenness,'' he said.

""If you take two people and everything else is more or less the same ... their age, sex and city they live in and they both have the same amount of greenness around where they live, someone who is more affluent is getting a big boost to their risk of dying whereas people in the lowest income group were getting almost no benefit at all.''

Lower-income people don't get full effect

He said lower-income people may have less time to spend around their properties or live in an apartment without good views.

Having green space around your home has greater benefit than weekly trips to the park, he said, calling it an important message for city planners.

""Parks are important but I think this shows that it's just as important to have trees on medians and along streets and sidewalks where people are going to have contact on a regular basis,'' he said.

The study only measured rates of mortality and didn't estimate how much longer someone might live with regular exposure to green spaces.

Parks are important but ... it's just as important to have trees ... where people are going to have contact on a regular basis. Dan Crouse, study author

The full findings of the study are published in this month's issue of The Lancet Planetary Health.

Crouse said he'd like to do a similar study on the benefit of living close to oceans, rivers and lakes.

""Water is completely different from green space, but living on the water can be very relaxing and stress reducing,'' he said.

That's why we've asked some of Australia's top wellness experts who are getting together for the upcoming Fitness Show for small tweaks and easy tips you can incorporate to be in decent shape by the time the fat man comes.

Make a lunch swap

""Turn your favourite sandwich into a salad to help manage your carbohydrate load."" Lowe told HuffPost Australia.

""Love a turkey, avocado, cranberry and salad sandwich? Try making it into a salad version, using only fresh and unpacked ingredients.""

Lowe says excess carbohydrates in the form of sugar, white bread, pasta and rice and makes weight loss and fat burning virtually impossible.

""When you max out on white foods you stay hungry, courtesy of a blood sugar roller coaster, controlled by the hormone insulin. This causes cravings and it's easy to give in to overeating, especially at the back-end of your work day and the biscuit bin is calling.""

Not all salads are boring. Promise.

""By swapping a homemade salad for your usual white bread sandwich you will be minimising refined carbohydrates and you'll be on your way to eating an abundance of non-starchy vegetables, quality protein and good fats with each meal which will help you achieve a healthy body weight.""

Have 'clean' protein on every plate

""Swap the usual pasta or grains on your plate for a clean protein to take control of your cravings and the amount you eat,"" Lowe said.

""Protein is the satiety macronutrient that balances blood sugars and helps to control our blood sugar which dictates hunger, energy, mood and weight By choosing a variety of good-quality protein such as free range eggs, wild caught salmon, organic tofu or tempeh, grass-fed hormone-free beef, and organic, hormone-free chicken you will see a difference in not only the way you feel, but the way you look.""

Don't turn your back on good fats

Lowe says it's important to stop avoiding fat and increase your intake of food like avocado, salmon and almonds for essential omega 3s.

""Fat is essential for satiety, hormonal control and nutrient density but the right type of fat is extremely important. Always cook with saturated fat, such as coconut oil, butter and animal fat, as they are highly heat stable and maintain their structure under high temperatures. They are also a fantastic source of slow release energy and along with protein, contribute to satiety, blood sugar and insulin control,"" Lowe said.

""Avoid polyunsaturated seed oils, high doses of omega 6 and trans fats -- these are highly inflammatory and can lead to hormonal imbalances and chronic health conditions.""

Set performance-based goals

""I hear it all the time as a trainer. 'I want abs', 'What exercises will tone my thighs'. 'I'm trying to lose weight for summer'. The danger of these goals is letting a negative body image and self criticism fuel your workout regime,"" Poppett told HuffPost Australia.

Make your goals about getting fit and healthy, not about how your body looks.

""Exercise will improve your body confidence but don't let society's ideology of the perfect body be the driving force behind your workouts. I find the most successful goals that motivate clients to show up everyday and push their limits are those that focus on particular skill or facet of their fitness.""

Eat More Plants

Poppett is a big fan of adding more vegetables to your diet.

""The majority of Australians eat an excessive amount of meat and animal products, which believe it or not can have detrimental effects on not only your health but the health of the planet.""

""Most animal products are high in saturated fats which have been proven to contribute to preventable chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and obesity. Enjoying more plant based meals can also help reduce your carbon footprint and save precious resources like freshwater and fossil fuel.""

Poppett suggest swapping some animal sourced protein for a few of these nutrient rich plant-based alternatives:

Tempeh

Tofu

Black Beans

Lentils

Spirulina

Brown Rice or Pea Protein Powders

Hemp Seeds

Quinoa

Nutritional Yeast

Edamame Beans

Practice Mindful Eating

Poppett believes It's not just about what we eat, but how we eat.

""In our fast paced world full of distractions it can be seemingly easy to scoff an entire meal without taking the time to enjoy the flavours of the foods we are eating or even acknowledge the amount we are consuming.""

Mindful eating is the action of eating with your attention focused primarily on the food that is in front of you. Mindful eating is one of the biggest stepping stones we can take towards creating a healthy relationship with food,"" Poppett said.

Tips for mindful eating:

Eat slowly and remember to chew -- your digestive tract with thank you for this one.

Put your fork down between mouthfuls -- it is not a race to the finish line.

Be social -- take time to engage in conversation between mouthfuls whether it be with your family, friends, or work colleagues.

Turning off technology -- technology is one of our biggest distractions when it comes to eating mindfully. Turn the TV off, put away your smartphone, close the laptop screen and be at one with the meal that you are about to eat.

Wake up right

Mornings are an opportunity to start the day on the right foot.

""Breakfast is super important and if you start your day off in the best way possible you're more likely to continue on with those positive choices throughout your day,"" Bines told HuffPost Australia.

An omelette stuffed with spinach is a great way to start the day.

""Go for fresh fruits and yoghurts, smoothies, lean proteins and yummy vegetables in power packed omelets. Each morning, have a big glass of warm water with a squeeze of fresh lemon. Not only will this rehydrate your body but also kick start your digestive system and help get everything moving.""

Eat your greens to eat out without blowing out

It can be as simple as adding some fresh vegetables to every meal.

""It doesn't always work to restrict yourself, so why not look at ways to add things in. Treat dining out as a celebration but use ways to curb the food party. Order all your dressings or sauces on the side so you can you take control on how much you use.""

""Choose grilled, steamed or baked foods but pass on anything fried, smothered or encased. If there's a buffet, fill your plate with mostly fresh fruit and vegetables so there's less room for anything else,"" Bines said.

Press reset

""A break from routine can be just what you need to kick start your motivation,"" Bines said.

""Try to make the most of every day and do simple things like add in movement and healthy food wherever you can. It's not easy to find balance, but that just means you know what to work on tomorrow.""",Small Lifestyle Tweaks To Have You In Decent Shape By Christmas,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/10/11/small-lifestyle-tweaks-to-have-you-in-decent-shape-by-christmas_a_23239350/

It’s a concept people maybe come to from a religious frame of mind, but it isn’t medical,” Davis told HuffPost.
It doesn’t happen then.”It’s a concept people maybe come to from a religious frame of mind, but it isn’t medical.
TrueLife, LifeMatters and National Right to Life all post countless articles “confirming” that life begins at conception.
Including this language in the strategic plan, Davis said, “is setting the stage for turning things back, coming up with these justifications for refusing to cover” reproductive health care.","The Department of Health and Human Services released its strategic plan for 2018 to 2022 last month. As Jezebel reported Tuesday, the introduction now includes: “HHS accomplishes its mission through programs and initiatives that cover a wide spectrum of activities, serving and protecting Americans at every stage of life, beginning at conception.” The concept of “life at conception” is mentioned four more times in the 65-page report.

This idea has long been used by the anti-abortion community as justification for its protests, constant attempts to pass anti-abortion legislation (like the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which the House passed last week, that would ban abortions after 20 weeks) and remains a pillar of the religious far-right’s agenda.

But there is no medical determination that “life” starts at conception.

Dr. Anne Davis, consulting medical director at Physicians for Reproductive Health, told HuffPost on Wednesday that medical professionals purposefully don’t take a stance on the topic.

“There’s a reason that we don’t provide a definition of when life begins because there isn’t such a definition in medicine,” she said. “It’s not a medical concept.”

Davis elaborated that there is a huge misunderstanding of how “conception” (actually, fertilization) even works.

“The confusion here is that people think that the moment of fertilization is when pregnancy starts. They conflate those two things as one … which isn’t true,” she said. “Fertilizations occur many more times than pregnancies occur, because they often don’t wind up in pregnancies. Fertilization happens in the [fallopian] tube. Pregnancy happens in the uterus.”

Basically, the anti-abortion community stakes the entire basis of its belief system on medically unsound facts.

“It’s not a medical concept. It’s a concept people maybe come to from a religious frame of mind, but it isn’t medical,” Davis told HuffPost. “People think there is a magic moment when they have sex, that there’s ejaculation, fertilization and pregnancy happening in seconds. It doesn’t happen then.”

It’s a concept people maybe come to from a religious frame of mind, but it isn’t medical. Dr. Anne Davis, Physicians for Reproductive Health

In fact, it’s difficult to even research the topic because so many resources are in biased publications.

TrueLife, LifeMatters and National Right to Life all post countless articles “confirming” that life begins at conception.

One organization, the American College of Pediatricians, presents itself as a scientific resource claiming that life begins at conception, but it has actually been declared by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a hate group for its anti-LGBT agenda, among its other beliefs. In its mission statement, the organization says that it recognizes “the basic father-mother family unit, within the context of marriage, to be the optimal setting for childhood development.” Its director, Dr. Michelle Cretella, has appeared on Fox News to criticize “transgenderism.”

Such sources are unlikely to provide unbiased medical research.

But more neutral sources, like Davis and the medical community at large, are rightly not interested in arguing about the moment “life” starts. Davis told HuffPost that Americans, a majority of whom support the Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion, “are being hijacked by a tiny number of people,” such as Tom Price (who resigned as HHS secretary last month after criticism of his costly use of private planes for official business) and other HHS appointees, who wish to chip away at reproductive health care. Including this language in the strategic plan, Davis said, “is setting the stage for turning things back, coming up with these justifications for refusing to cover” reproductive health care.

VADNAGAR -- On his first visit to his birthplace since occupying the top post, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday held a roadshow and visited his school in Vadnagar and said the town had taught him to ""drink poison"".

At the B N High School where he studied, he smeared sand from the premises on his forehead.

Modi, who once sold tea at the Vadnagar railway station, recalled his journey to Delhi from Gujarat where he was the chief minister for 13 years from 2001.

He said he has managed to serve the nation with the blessings of Lord Shiva since 2001 despite some people ""spewing venom"" at him during these years.

He was apparently referring to the attacks on him during his tenure as Gujarat chief minister after the riots of 2002 in the state.

""Vadnagar has taught me to drink poison,"" he said, while noting that his birthplace is the land of Shiva, like Kashi (Varanasi), his Lok Sabha constituency.

Modi was addressing a public meeting after inaugurating a newly-built medical college and launching an immunisation programme.

""I started my journey from Vadnagar and now I have reached Kashi. Just like Vadnagar, Kashi is also the town of Bhole Baba. Bhole Baba's blessings gave me immense strength, and this strength is the biggest gift I have received from this land,"" he said.

""The blessings of Bhole Baba (Lord Shiva) gave me the strength to drink and digest poison. Due to this ability, I was able to counter all those who spewed venom against me since 2001. This ability gave me the strength to serve the motherland with dedication over these many years,"" he said.

The prime minister did his schooling in Vadnagar, an ancient town, which was once home to a Buddhist monastery and has a centuries-old Shiva temple.

On the second day of his visit to poll-bound Gujarat, Modi held a roadshow here. A large number of people lined the road to greet him. There were chants of ""Modi-Modi"" and flowers were showered on him along the route.

Before inaugurating a newly-built medical college in the town, he visited the Hatkeshwar Mahadev temple where he performed puja along with Chief Minister Vijay Rupani.

""I am touched by the immense love showered by the people of Vadnagar today. It gave me new energy to serve the nation with more zeal,"" Modi said, addressing a public gathering after the roadshow.

""I saw many faces among the people who came to greet me. Those faces brought back many memories of my childhood,"" he said.

In der Schule scheinen nachts unerklärliche Dinge zu geschehen

Was die Kamera aufgezeichnet hat, seht ihr oben im Video

Was eine Überwachungskamera nachts in einer Schule aufgenommen hat, erinnert auf den ersten Blick an einen Horrorfilm. Die Aufnahmen stammen aus der Deerpark Christian Brothers School im irischen Cork. In dem Überwachungsvideo ist zu sehen, wie eine Tür plötzlich zuknallt.

Dann fängt einer der Spinde an, sich zu bewegen und wackelt wild hin und her

Bei einem anderen Spind springt die Tür auf und Blätter fliegen heraus. Zuletzt fällt wie von Geisterhand noch ein Warnschild um. Der stellvertretende Schulleiter Aaron Wolfe sagte dem TV-Sender “Fox 13 News“, dass er nicht glaube, dass es in der Schule spuke. Er könne sich aber auch nicht erklären, wie die seltsamen Ereignisse von statten gehen konnten.

Der Vize-Direktor glaubt nicht, dass es in der Schule spukt

Seiner Meinung nach sei die Schule ein gruseliger Ort. Einige Schüler berichten, dass Gegenstände verschwinden würden und sie angeblich ab und zu komische Geräusche hören würden. Dass es in der Schule jedoch tatsächlich spukt, darf angezweifelt werden. Viel wahrscheinlicher ist, dass sich ein paar Schüler einige Scherze erlaubt haben.

Das gilt auch für das Überwachungsvideo. Entweder handelt es sich hier um einen gut inszenierten Scherz oder jemand, der sich gut mit Spezialeffekten auskennt, hat seiner Kreativität freien Lauf gelassen.

Diese tiefe Überzeugung ist der Grund für einen weltweiten und jahrzehntelangen Krieg gegen Drogen, der in vielen Ländern bis heute andauert.

Die wahre Ursache von Sucht ist jedoch nicht die Droge an sich - es ist vielmehr eine schmerzhafte Erfahrung, die ein Ungleichgewicht im Leben auslöst. Und diese schmerzhafte Erfahrung lässt sich zumeist auf Erlebnisse in der Kindheit zurückführen. Am häufigsten trifft das auf emotionalen und körperlichen Missbrauch zu, aber es gibt auch weniger offensichtliche Auslöser. (Mehr dazu oben im Video)

“Nicht alle Abhängigkeiten haben ihren Ursprung in Missbrauch oder Traumata, aber ich bin überzeugt, dass sie alle auf schmerzhafte Erfahrungen zurückgeführt werden können”, sagte Gabor Maté, ein kanadischer Arzt, der sich seit Jahrzehnten mit Sucht und der Bekämpfung von Abhängigkeiten beschäftigt.

Schmerz im Zentrum der Abhängigkeit

Maté glaubt, dass Schmerz im Zentrum jeder Abhängigkeit steht - egal, ob es Drogensucht, Internet-Abhängigkeit, Spielsucht, Kaufsucht, Magersucht oder Sucht nach Arbeit ist.

“Die Wunde mag nicht sehr tief erscheinen und der Schmerz nicht unerträglich - vielleicht ist die Verletzung sogar vollkommen verborgen - aber sie ist da”, sagte Maté.

Und wer Schmerz empfindet, der wird versuchen, diesem Schmerz zu entkommen.

Sucht ist die Krebserkrankung der Seele

“Wer seelisch belastet ist, sucht nach Entlastung und findet diese unter anderem in Alkohol, Drogen oder Medikamenten”, schreibt Psychotherapeut Ralf Schneider in “Die Suchtfiebel”.

Das bedeutet aber nicht, dass jeder, der eine schmerzhafte Erfahrung in der Kindheit gemacht hat, später auch eine Abhängigkeit entwickelt. Jeder Mensch geht mit Verletzungen ein wenig anders um.

Es gibt jedoch Erlebnisse in der Kindheit, die Schmerz verursachen und dadurch Abhängigkeiten begünstigen. Sie können frühzeitig von Eltern vermieden werden, indem sie sich bewusst machen, dass bestimmte Erziehungsmethoden Schaden verursachen.

6 Erlebnisse in der Kindheit, die Schmerz auslösen:



1. Die fehlende Befriedigung von Grundbedürfnissen

Geborgenheit, Schutz und Liebe sind ebenso wichtige Grundbedürfnisse von Babys und Kleinkindern wie Hunger und Durst. Werden sie nicht befriedigt, gerät das Kind in eine Notsituation: Es ist schließlich von den Eltern abhängig und es hat nur seine Stimme und möglicherweise noch keine Sprache, um sich mitzuteilen.

Wenn Eltern ihre Kinder zum Beispiel schreien lassen - etwa, weil sie glauben, dass Babys so lernen, allein einzuschlafen (was nicht der Fall ist - die Babys haben nicht aus der Erfahrung gelernt, sie haben schlichtweg aufgegeben), können sie damit unwissentlich erheblichen Schaden anrichten.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Das passiert mit Babys, die man schreien lässt

Das Schreienlassen hat keinerlei pädagogischen Wert

Babys und Kleinkinder sind geistig noch nicht weit genug entwickelt, um logische Schlussfolgerungen aus dem Verhalten ihrer Eltern zu ziehen. Sie weinen nicht, um ihre Eltern zu ärgern oder zu manipulieren, sondern weil sie irgendein Problem, irgendein Bedürfnis haben.

Viele Kinder fühlen sich nur in der Nähe ihrer Eltern sicher genug, um einschlafen zu können. Denn genau da, in der Nähe ihrer Eltern, sind Kinder nunmal am sichersten aufgehoben und aus Sicht der Evolution am besten geschützt.

Schreienlassen schädigt Körper und Seele

Wenn das Kind also weint, dann ruft es nach seinen Eltern. Reagieren die Eltern jedoch nicht darauf, entsteht Stress. Das Hormon Cortisol wird vermehrt ausgeschüttet. Dies kann Experten zufolge das zentrale Nervensystem sowie die Gehirnentwicklung beeinträchtigen. Und neben diesen körperlichen Auswirkungen bleiben natürlich auch die Seelischen nicht aus.

Wenn Kinder das Gefühl haben, so viel schreien zu können, wie sie wollen und doch nicht gehört zu werden, entstehen Schmerz und Unsicherheit, in besonders schlimmen Fällen sogar Traumata.

Bindungsprobleme, Schlafstörungen, Ängste und Depressionen können mögliche Folgen sein. Aber auch Abhängigkeiten und Süchte.

Schwere Versagungen in der Befriedigung von Grundbedürfnissen, die Dauerstress und Hilflosigkeit hervorbringen, können sich laut Schneider auf die Bereitschaft zum Drogenkonsum auswirken. In der “Suchtfiebel” schreibt er: “Offensichtlich erzeugt der frühe Stress eine Veränderung im Gehirn.”

2. Die Erfahrung, dass Liebe an Bedingungen geknüpft ist

Fast alle Eltern würden voller Überzeugung behaupten, dass sie ihr Kind bedingungslos lieben. Es sind jedoch vergleichsweise wenige, denen das wirklich und in letzter Konsequenz gelingt.

“Es gibt ganz wenige Kinder auf der Welt, die das Glück hatten, um ihrer Selbst willen geliebt zu werden”, sagte der bekannte deutsche Hirnforscher Gerald Hüther der Huffington Post.

Dabei ist genau das aus seiner Sicht die Grundvoraussetzung für eine glückliche Kindheit:

“Ein Kind muss spüren, dass es so wie es ist richtig ist. Dass es um seiner Selbst willen und bedingungslos geliebt wird. Das ist die wichtigste Erfahrung, die jedes Kind braucht”, sagte Hüther der HuffPost.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Ein Hirnforscher erklärt: Das ist das Geheimnis einer glücklichen Kindheit

Zuneigung im Tausch gegen Gehorsam

Kinder sind dann am glücklichsten, wenn sie nicht das Gefühl haben, sich anstrengen zu müssen, um von ihren Eltern geliebt zu werden.

Viele Kinder haben jedoch das Gefühl, dass ihre Eltern sie mehr lieben würden, wenn ihre Schulnoten besser wären. Oder wenn sie immer artig und hilfsbereit wären, nie widersprechen oder in Wut ausbrechen würden.

Es ist leider bis heute eine gängige Erziehungsmethode, Kinder mit Zuneigung zu belohnen, die sich so verhalten, wie ihre Eltern (oder auch Lehrer, Erzieher) das gerne hätten. Und die meisten Erwachsenen meinen das nicht einmal böse - ihnen ist schlichtweg nicht bewusst, dass dieses Verhalten extrem verletzend ist.

Ein Kind, das spürt, dass es nicht bedingungslos geliebt wird, hat ein sehr großes Problem. Denn Kinder sind von der Zuneigung ihrer Eltern abhängig - das hat die Natur so vorgesehen.

Das empfindliche Band der Liebe

Aus diesem Grund kommen sie bereits mit einem sicheren Band des Vertrauens und der Verbundenheit zu ihren Eltern zu Welt. Weil sie ihre Eltern lieben und sie brauchen, sind Kinder bereit, alles zu tun, um ebenfalls geliebt zu werden, damit sie sich weiterhin auf den Schutz und die Fürsorge der Eltern verlassen können.

Doch diese besondere Verbindung, dieses natürliche Band des Vertrauens zwischen Eltern und Kind, ist empfindlich.

“Wenn ein Kind zum Objekt elterlicher Erwartungen, Wünsche, Ziele, Vorstellungen oder Maßnahmen gemacht wird, dann zerreißt dieses Band zu den Eltern”, sagte Hüther. “Und das geht mit einem großen Schmerz einher.”

Der Schmerz des unvollkommenen Kindes

Dieser Schmerz ist sogar messbar. In wissenschaftlichen Versuchen konnte nachgewiesen werden, dass dies derselbe Schmerz ist, den der Körper auch bei physischem Schmerz signalisiert. Es werden dieselben Bereiche im Gehirn aktiviert, die auch betroffen sind, wenn wir körperliche Schmerzen erleben.

Diesen Schmerz, der entsteht, wenn wir als Kind das Gefühl haben, nicht vollkommen zu sein, verarbeitet jeder Menschen anders.

Manche Menschen werden ihr Leben lang versuchen sich anzustrengen, um geliebt und akzeptiert zu werden. Andere werden sich möglicherweise mit schmerzlindernden Substanzen behelfen.

3. Ein überfürsorgliches Verhalten der Eltern, das zu Verunsicherung führt

“Wenn man Suchtkranke rückblickend fragt, welche seelischen Ursachen ihr Substanzkonsum gehabt hat, erhält man unzählig viele plausible Antworten. Überrepräsentiert scheinen diejenigen zu sein, die sich nicht trauen, Risiken einzugehen, die sich ‘Mut antrinken’ oder ihre Hemmungen durch Drogenkonsum herabsetzen, die also Angst verringern”, schreibt Schneider in der “Suchtfiebel”.

Die Bereitschaft, Risiken einzugehen und furchtlos auf Herausforderungen zuzugehen, wird zu großen Teilen in der Kindheit geformt.

Kinder müssen hinfallen dürfen

Kinder müssen unbeaufsichtigt spielen, sie müssen sich sogar in gewissem Maße in Gefahr begeben, um zu erkennen, wo ihre eigenen Grenzen liegen.

“Es kann kein Kind lernen, wie man aufsteht, wenn es nie hinfällt. Es kann kein Kind laufen lernen, wenn ihm die Steine weggeräumt werden”, sagte Gerald Hüther der HuffPost.

So schwer es auch fällt - man tut einem Kind wirklich keinen Gefallen, wenn man es vor jeder Gefahr beschützt.

4. Der Mangel an freiem Spiel, der zu Fantasielosigkeit führt

Eine lebhafte Fantasie könnte ein sehr effektiver Schutz vor der Entwicklung von Suchtkrankheiten sein. Zu dieser Erkenntnis kommt Eckhard Schiffer, Autor der Bestsellers “Warum Huckleberry Finn nicht süchtig wurde”.

Bei seiner jahrelangen Arbeit mit Suchtkranken stellte Schiffer fest, dass Öde und Langeweile Vorboten späterer Abhängigkeiten sein können. Viele Patienten würden Suchtmittel benutzen, um einer inneren Leere zu entkommen.

Und diese Öde und Langeweile entsteht aus seiner Sicht durch einen Mangel an Fantasie, die wiederum auf einen Mangel des freien Spiels in der Kindheit zurückgeht - ein Problem, von dem heute immer mehr Kinder betroffen sind.

Der Angriff auf das freie Spiel

Das freie Spiel wird durch zwei entscheidende Entwicklungen beeinträchtigt: Zum einen bleibt Kindern immer weniger Zeit zum Spielen, weil viele Eltern wollen, dass ihre Kinder neben der Schule in Sport-, Musik- oder Sprachkursen weiter gefördert werden.

Zum anderen wird heute immer mehr in das kindliche Spiel eingegriffen, sodass es seine Spontanität und Regellosigkeit verliert; Es wird weniger um des Spielens Willen gespielt und mehr, um ein bestimmtes Ergebnis zu erzielen. Wir greifen viel zu häufig in das kindliche Spiel ein, indem wir organisieren, zeigen, “wie es besser geht”, erklären, dass Bäume grüne und nicht blaue Blätter haben.

Kreativität schützt den Geist

Kreativität und Fantasie entstehen jedoch genau da, wo das Kind frei sein darf. Wo alles erlaubt und alles möglich ist. Ein Kind, das ausreichend spielen darf, wird sich nicht langweilen. Es wird immer neue Möglichkeiten finden, sich zu beschäftigen und dafür braucht es nicht einmal Spielzeug.

Die so gewonnene Kreativität wird ihm ein Leben lang helfen, Lösungen für die komplexesten Probleme zu finden. Um die Ecke zu denken, sein Denken nicht durch andere einschränken zu lassen. Und sie wird es vor der Öde und Leere bewahren, die Abhängigkeit und Sucht - und sei es “nur” eine Konsumsucht, Kaufsucht oder Spielsucht - begünstigt.

5. Das Leistungsprinzip unserer Gesellschaft, dem Kinder unterworfen werden

Was Kinder heute leisten müssen, ist enorm. Schule um acht Uhr morgens, Konzentration und möglichst rege Beteiligung in allen Fächern, anschließend Hausaufgaben und außerschulische Aktivitäten - schon Kinder haben einen straffen Zeitplan, arbeiten also teilweise so viel wie Erwachsene.

Und das ist alles in Ordnung, sobald man nicht aus dem Raster fällt, hinter den Erwartungen zurückbleibt oder das schnelle Tempo einfach nicht mitgehen kann.

Schon im Kindergarten wird den Kleinsten beigebracht: Nur wer hart arbeitet, kann erfolgreich sein. Und nur wer erfolgreich ist, kann glücklich sein.

Kinder sollen funktionieren und Leistung erbringen

Wir bläuen unseren Kindern ein, dass sie gute Noten brauchen, um später mithalten zu können. Kommen sie mit einer Drei nach Hause, machen wir ihnen klar, dass sie doch auch eine Zwei haben könnten, wenn sie sich nur ein bisschen mehr anstrengten. Was viele Kinder aber hören, ist: Du würdest uns besser gefallen, wenn du bessere Noten hättest. Eine Fünf auf dem Zeugnis würde uns sehr enttäuschen.

“36 Prozent aller Eltern sind bereit, ihren zehnjährigen Kindern Arzneimittel zur Verbesserung der Konzentration zu geben”, schreibt Schneider in der “Suchtfiebel”. Dieses Leistungsstreben fordert jedoch seinen Preis: “Unter den guten Schülern ist der Anteil derjenigen, die regelmäßig Medikamente konsumieren, am höchsten.”

Über solche karriere- und kulturbeflissenen Familien schreibt Schiffer:

“Hier wird eine andauernde innere Friedlosigkeit erzeugt, denn die Leistung der eigenen Kinder steht im Vergleich zu der der jeweils anderen. Die Szene wird von Konkurrenz und Marktwert beherrscht. Was ist mein Marktwert? Wie steche ich meinen Konkurrenten aus?”

Das falsche Selbst vergiftet die Seele

So entstünde schließlich ein falsches Selbst. “Und das ist wegen der inneren Friedlosigkeit sucht- oder dopinggefährdet.”

Unsere Leistungsgesellschaft macht diejenigen zu Verlierern, die nicht mithalten können. Wer die Erwartungen nicht erfüllt, versucht häufig, sich zu verbiegen - jenes falsche Selbst zu erschaffen, um nicht ausgeschlossen zu werden.

Der daraus resultierende Stress, das andauernde Streben nach Erfolg und Glück, das doch scheinbar nie wirklich erreicht werden kann, ist Gift für die Seele. Für Kinderseelen noch viel mehr als für Erwachsene.

Das ständige Gefühl, nicht gut genug zu sein, löst einen Schmerz aus. Vielleicht einen, der zunächst unter der Oberfläche schlummert, wie Maté es ausdrückte, aber eben einen, der durchaus spürbar ist.

Es ist genau dieses Leistungsstreben, das zu den neuen Volkskrankheiten wie Depressionen und Burnout führt - und das ein Bedürfnis nach Ablenkung, Flucht und nach Betäubung auslösen kann.

6. Die Angst vor dem Versagen, die Eltern auf ihre Kinder übertragen

Es ist nicht leicht, heute ein Kind zu erziehen und viele Eltern fühlen sich stark unter Druck gesetzt. Hinzu kommt häufig die Angst, zu versagen. Was, wenn mein Kind in der Schule nicht gut genug ist? Was, wenn es in dieser globalisierten Leistungsgesellschaft nicht mithalten kann?

Viele Eltern wollen ihre Kinder beschützen und greifen deshalb sehr stark in ihr Leben ein. Sie planen ihre Freizeit, sie greifen in ihr Spiel ein, sie erwarten, dass ihr Kind ihre Erwartungen erfüllt. Sie glauben, dass sie es aus Liebe tun. In Wahrheit jedoch steckt Angst dahinter:

Elterliche Geborgenheit könne schnell in einen Würgegriff umschlagen, schreibt Schiffer, “wenn die Eltern aus eigener Not heraus nicht mehr die Bedürfnisse und Interessen ihres Kindes im Auge haben, sondern vorwiegend ihre eigene Angst in Schach halten"".

Leistung als magisches Mittel gegen die Angst

Das Heilmittel, das unsere Gesellschaft für diese Angst erfunden hat, heißt Leistung. Solange man nur hart genug arbeitet, wird man nicht untergehen.

“Leistung als magisches Mittel gegen Angst wird heute schon von Kindern eingefordert”, schreibt Schiffer. “Und ebendies bedeutet eine erhebliche Einschränkung der Autonomie und des eigenen Weges.”

Kinder, die nicht selbst bestimmen, nicht selbst ihre Umwelt entdecken und erleben, nicht ihren eigenen Interessen in ihrem eigenen Tempo folgen dürfen, verlieren ihren Eigensinn.

Dröhnungen gegen die Langeweile

Der Verlust des Eigensinns bleibt jedoch nicht ohne Folgen:

“Wenn Erwachsene die Fähigkeit, sich in tagträumerischer Weise von ihrer Umwelt ansprechen zu lassen und so stöbernd, stutzend, und staunend innerlich viel zu erleben, verloren bzw. nicht ausreichend erworben haben, dann verlieren sie einen Teil ihres Eigensinns.

The BBC station first broadcast Douglas Adams’ sci-fi comedy in 1978. A further four series followed between 1980 and 2005, as well as a hit TV version in 1981.

‘Hexagonal Phase’ has been adapted from Eoin Colfer’s spin-off novel ‘And Another Thing…’, which was commissioned to mark the 30th anniversary of the first novel.

Simon Jones will again play the quintessentially English Arthur Dent, who travels through space and time following the destruction of Earth.

Rex Martin Freeman starred in the 2005 big screen adaption of the classic cult sci-fi comedy.

Speaking about reprising his role, Simon Jones said: “It seems extraordinary that it’s been forty years since we recorded the first pilot episode for BBC Radio; how modest were our expectations then, and how amazing a worldwide phenomenon it became, and continues to be.

“I never expected to still be searching for a decent cup of tea and some kind of answer to Life, the Universe and Everything almost a lifetime later.

“Still, the dressing-gown and towel may be a little threadbare, like my hair, but my voice, much to my surprise, hasn’t changed a decibel, and despite years in America, I can still talk Arthur’s ‘indignant-posh’.”

Cuando tratas de determinar si una relación te conviene o no, en realidad ya conoces la respuesta. A veces solo necesitas plantearte la pregunta de otra manera para darte cuenta.

Cuando una relación no funciona, muchas personas reconocen que tuvieron una corazonada desde el primer momento de que la cosa iba a acabar mal. A veces, la esperanza y el cariño te ciegan, y la realidad, ya estuviera la relación destinada al fracaso o no, se convierte en un hecho aleccionador que hay que asumir.

Y mejor darse cuenta lo antes posible antes que perder el tiempo, ¿no?

1. ¿Discuten por tonterías o sobre si quieren seguir juntos?

2. ¿Piensan en cortar solo cuando se enojan o también cuando todo debería ir bien?

3. ¿Están más contentos cuando piensan el uno en el otro o cuando pasan tiempo juntos?

4. ¿Se encuentran completamente a gusto y enamorados? Ambas cosas son fundamentales si quieren que funcione a largo plazo. Deberían gustarse y seguir enamorados.

5. ¿Discuten porque les molesta no estar de acuerdo en un asunto importante y quieren estar en la misma onda, o directamente porque no se soportan y la burbuja les estalla en la cara una y otra vez?

6. ¿Aprenden del otro porque intentan cambiarse o porque les interesa y entusiasma saber cómo piensa y vive su pareja?

7. ¿Se desahogan con otras personas sobre los problemas de su relación o se desquitan entre ustedes sobre lo que sucede con otras personas?

8. ¿Pasan el tiempo pensando si de verdad deberían seguir juntos o simplemente recorren juntos los altibajos que tiene cualquier relación?

9. ¿Los inundan sentimientos inexplicables de ansiedad y dudas más que de felicidad, fortuna y pasión?

10. Si tuvieran que escoger entre casarse mañana o nunca, ¿qué harían?

11. Si supieran que la otra persona sería exactamente igual durante el resto de su vida juntos, ¿aún querrían estar juntos?

12. ¿Les suscita más dudas que orgullo presentarse a sus respectivas familias?

13. ¿Les interesa el sexo, pero tratan de evitar otros contactos íntimos como los besos o los abrazos?

14. ¿Es su pareja la primera persona a la que quieren llamar cuando les sucede algo importante?

15. ¿Se tratan como prioridad o como una mera opción?

16. ¿Son sinceros con sus amigos sobre cómo va la relación o sienten a veces que es mejor ocultar la verdad?

17. ¿A sus amigos les gusta estar con ustedes ahora que están juntos o parecen poco interesados en eso?

18. ¿Piensan que no están preparados en este momento para tener una relación o se sienten desconcertados por no querer entregarse completamente a alguien que, en otras circunstancias, parecería perfecto, de modo que hacen lo posible para que ese ""sea el momento""?

19. ¿Se dan cuenta del hecho de que nunca será el momento perfecto hasta que encuentren a la persona indicada y que, cuando llegue ese momento, no habrá nada que pueda interponerse entre dos personas que de verdad quieran estar juntas?

20. ¿Se aferran más al pasado de su relación que a lo que les depara el futuro juntos?

21. ¿Coinciden en los asuntos más innegociables? (Dónde quieren vivir, si quieren tener hijos, su grado de monogamia...).

22. ¿Pueden pasar largos periodos de tiempo juntos y felices sin necesitar un descanso el uno del otro?

23. Si fueran a pasar el resto de su vida en una isla desierta y solo pudieran llevar a una persona con la que pasar ese tiempo, ¿elegirían a su pareja?

24. ¿Les agobia la incertidumbre? ¿Están dispuestos a reconocer que no estar seguros de su futuro juntos es una forma de estar seguros de lo contrario y que tienen miedo de aceptarlo?

25. ¿Se empeñan en demostrar que no se necesitan? ¿Se dan cuenta de que la actitud de ""quiero estar solo"" es una forma de decir ""no eres la persona correcta aunque lo parezca""?

Viki Ferguson, 45, hopes her experience at the Royal Victoria Infirmary, in Newcastle, will serve as an example to other hospitals who may not currently provide such a high standard of care.

The mother chose to share her story during Baby Loss Awareness Week (9-15 October) after charities revealed current levels of care offered to women after baby loss are “worryingly inconsistent” across the UK.

The charities have called on the government to ensure all hospitals have accessible bereavement rooms and a member of staff to lead on bereavement care.

Ferguson believes these demands are achievable as she received a high standard of care after her stillbirth in 2013.

“I don’t know what more the staff could have done to help us through that time,” Ferguson told HuffPost UK. “Everything they did was for our benefit.”

VikiFerguson Viki Ferguson and her husband Colin.

In March 2013, Ferguson was 35 weeks pregnant with her first child when she went in for a routine scan.

She and her partner Colin knew their daughter had a heart condition, so she was having checkups on a more regular basis than most mothers-to-be.

At the appointment, she was told there was no heartbeat, her baby had died.

“The rest of that afternoon was a bit of a blur,” Ferguson explained. “But what I can remember is how supportive the staff were, they talked us through everything that was going to happen.”

Ferguson was told she had a choice of being induced or waiting for labour to start. She chose to be induced.

What surprised Ferguson when she went back to the hospital to give birth on 16 March 2013, was that she was given a private room away from other pregnant women.

“Within the maternity ward they have a bereavement suite,” she explained. “There are two rooms especially for anyone who will have a stillbirth. It is away from the noise, you can’t hear anyone else in labour or any crying babies.

“It was really well thought out and very self-contained. I had my own bathroom.”

Ferguson was assigned a specially trained bereavement midwife as soon as she arrived. The midwife stayed with her and, even when she finished her shift, a second bereavement midwife took over.

“If you want them there, they are there,” Ferguson explained. “If you wanted to be left alone, they left you alone.

“They looked after us so well, they made sure Colin was looked after as well, he was part of it - they brought another bed in the room so he could stay with me overnight.

“Things like that really made a difference to me.”

“The care was exemplary. I don’t know how it would have felt not to have that. If they want a model to work on, that was it."" Viki Ferguson

When Ferguson gave birth, she was surprised how comforted she felt by the midwife and staff in the room with her.

“They bathed my daughter, they put her in a babygro and treated her if she was still alive,” the mum explained.

“They were talking to her and made it the nicest experience it could’ve been. It wasn’t like it was all over as soon as she was born. How they treated her meant so much to us.”

Ferguson gave birth at 8.20pm and she and her husband had a couple of hours with their baby that night. The midwife stayed with them until after midnight, speaking to them and checking they were okay.

“I really couldn’t have faulted the care,” she said.

“The next day we had another couple of hours with our daughter and then we had staff coming in to talk us through everything that happens with funerals, who would be in touch with us, and the counselling that was available. It was all the information we needed.”

Ferguson said she didn’t feel rushed to leave the bereavement suite - she was told she could stay as long as she wanted, but she decided to get discharged the next day.

On leaving the suite, she was given a memory envelope with photos, hair, footprints and handprints taken from her daughter, and knitted teddy bear twins - one that stayed with her daughter and one that stayed with the couple.

In the weeks following, Ferguson had a visit from a chaplain to talk through the funeral, two visits from the health visitor, a counselling session, and her GP ensured she didn’t go back to work until she was up to it.

“The care was exemplary,” she added. “I don’t know how it would have felt not to have that. If they want a model to work on, that was it.

“The staff were completely lead by us, I didn’t feel like we were forced into anything. Everything was for our benefit.”

Ferguson believes good care does “not require a complete overhaul of the NHS”.

She said small gestures such as the memory box and the empathy shown by the midwives made her experience as good as it could have been.

“Every hospital should have a midwife or midwives trained in bereavement,” she said. ”Just to have someone to know how to deal with death and what to expect - simple things like that made such a difference.

“It’s shocking that there is a postcode lottery of care.

“It helps so much to have support at a time like that. If there is a consistent level of care, it helps you through the grieving process.”",Mum's Account Of Care After Baby Loss 'Should Serve As An Example To Other NHS Hospitals',http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2017/10/10/bereaved-parents-care-stillbirth_n_18246000.html?utm_hp_ref=uk

MUMBAI -- Fostering monetary conditions conducive to economic growth were a constant consideration for Indian policymakers, but would not take priority over achieving the central bank's inflation target, Governor Urjit Patel told a newspaper on Monday.

Patel told the Mint newspaper that the economy was recovering after growth slowed to a three-year low of 5.7% in the April-June quarter.

The slowdown had sparked some calls for lower interest rates, but with inflation rising the RBI left rates unchanged at a review by the monetary policy committee (MPC) last week.

""Growth is always there in the MPC's scheme of things; we don't lose sight of that, but not at the cost of inflation,"" Patel was quoted as saying in the interview.

""However, we have to be careful — we should aim at achieving the inflation target without losing sight of supporting economic growth.""

Consumer inflation accelerated to 3.36 percent in August. India's central bank has a medium-term target for annual inflation of 4 percent with the flexbility of plus/minus 2 percent on either side to make room for food price volatility.

The (MPC) will strive to achieve its 4 percent inflation target on a ""durable basis"", Patel said.

Last week, the RBI kept its repo rate unchanged at 6.00 percent as expected last week, and raised inflation projections, cooling hopes for future rate cuts.

However, Patel said growth was already starting to recover. The RBI last week cut its projection for gross value added - an indicator of growth it prefers to 6.7 percent from 7.3 percent for the year ending in March - higher than some analyst forecasts.

""Our projections based on high frequency real economy indicators suggest that growth will pick up in the third and fourth quarters (of the current fiscal year) to above 7 percent,"" he told Mint.

""We have started seeing the upturn.""

Patel has given only a handful of interviews since taking over as RBI Governor late last year.

HuffPost-Autor Sebastian Christ schreibt, warum er Air Berlin vermissen wird

Liebe Air Berlin!

Meine Facebook-Timeline ist voll mit Abschiedspostings. Es ist die Zeit der letzten Air-Berlin-Flüge. Ich finde es rührend, was da zu lesen ist: Viele meiner Freunde sprechen dem Personal ein letztes Mal Mut zu und wünschen ihnen alles Gute für den Weg in eine ungewisse Zukunft.

Jetzt, da eine Ära vorbei geht, scheint das geschäftige Treiben an den Flughäfen dieser Republik, zwischen Rollkoffern und Businessanzügen, plötzlich menschliche Züge zu bekommen. Das ist ein gutes Zeichen.

Andere schreiben wehmütig über den Geschmack der Schokoherzchen, die es früher beim Aussteigen gab. Zugegeben, ich fand die Teile auch lecker. Aber sie sind so ziemlich das Unwichtigste, was ich an Air Berlin vermissen werde.

Früher war Fliegen noch außergewöhnlich

Seit Donnerstag ist klar, dass Air Berlin größtenteils von der Lufthansa übernommen wird. Damit dürfte sich der Flugverkehr, so wie wir ihn kennen, radikal ändern. Jeder, der das Fliegen noch in den 1990er-Jahren erlebt hat, dürfte da eine Vorahnung haben.

Ich habe meinen ersten Flug in einem Linienjet erst mit 22 Jahren machen können. Dabei hatte ich weder Flugangst noch war ich jemand, der keine Lust aufs Reisen hatte. Ich konnte mir es schlicht und einfach nicht leisten, für mittlere Strecken ein Flugticket zu erwerben.

Bis vor etwa 20 Jahren war Fliegen etwas Besonderes, wenn es um innerdeutsche Strecken ging. Preise von 600 oder 800 Mark für ein Flugticket von Hamburg nach München waren damals nichts Außergewöhnliches, sondern eher etwas ganz Normales.

Das war etwas für Geschäftsreisende, deren Firmen bereit waren, teures Geld dafür zu bezahlen, um fähige Fachkräfte von A nach B zu transportieren. Aber kein echtes Konkurrenzangebot für die Bahn, die damals noch staatlich-gemächlich durch Deutschland zockelte.

Das Aufkommen preisgünstiger Flugangebote hat vieles verändert: bisweilen sogar die Infrastruktur unserer Städte. Vor allem aber die Art und Weise, wie wir reisen.

Du warst bei allem der Dreh- und Angelpunkt

Es ist heute kein Problem mehr, morgens in Stuttgart und nachmittags in Hamburg zu sein. Es gibt heute sogar Studenten, die Fernbeziehungen per Flugzeug führen – weil man es sich leisten kann, am Freitagmorgen von Berlin nach Köln zu fliegen, und am Sonntagnachmittag wieder zurück. Vorausgesetzt, man bucht rechtzeitig.

Und Du, Air Berlin, warst bei allem der Dreh- und Angelpunkt. Wahrscheinlich beschäftigt Dein Niedergang auch deswegen so viele Menschen: Wenn die Lufthansa für die Fernreisenden ein Stück Alltagskultur geworden war, warst Du es für die Kurz- und Mittelstrecken.

Und wenn wir schon über die Lufthansa sprechen: Genau da fängt das Problem an. Außer Germanwings und Eurowings gibt es sonst auf dem deutschen Markt keine größeren Billigfluganbieter mehr. Beide Gesellschaften gehören zu Lufthansa. Und die schluckt jetzt eben auch noch Air Berlin.

Um das ganze mal mit Fakten zu illustrieren: Im Juni 2017 belegten die nunmehr vier Fluglinien der Lufthansa die Plätze eins bis vier nach Abflugzahlen in Deutschland. Gut 46.200 Flüge gehen auf das Konto des Lufthansa-Imperiums. Auf Platz fünf folgt dann Ryanair mit 4.600 Abflügen.

Man muss kein Wirtschaftswissenschaftler sein, um an dieser Stelle eine Gefahr für den Wettbewerb zu sehen.

Uns droht eine Saure-Gurken-Zeit

Billigflüge könnten künftig wieder zu etwas werden, was in der Nische stattfindet. Zumindest hätte die Lufthansa die nötige Marktmacht, um das durchzusetzen.

Das hätte nicht nur Folgen für den Flugverkehr.

Denn auch die Bahn hat sich unter dem zunehmenden Druck von Seiten des Flugverkehrs in den vergangenen 20 Jahren zusehends modernisiert. In einigen Wochen zum Beispiel wird die Strecke von Berlin nach München für den Personenverkehr freigegeben: Dann wird man in vier Stunden von der Hauptstadt nach Süddeutschland fahren können.

Solche Trassen werden nicht gebaut, um den Bussen Konkurrenz machen zu können. Sondern, weil die Bahn gegen den Flugverkehr ankommen will. Vier Stunden – das ist durchaus eine wettbewerbsfähige Fahrtzeit. Leider bietet die Bahn viel zu wenige dieser Verbindungen an.

Im Gegensatz zu Frankreich übrigens. Dort war es offensichtlich möglich, ein Hochgeschwindigkeitsnetz für die Schiene aufzubauen. In Deutschland droht uns nach dem Wegfall der Konkurrenz aus der Luft eine neue Saure-Gurken-Zeit.

Auch deswegen werde ich Dich vermissen, Air Berlin. Es geht nicht um die Schokoherzen – sondern darum, einem bisweilen recht schwerfälligen Land den Mut zur Veränderung schmackhaft zu machen. Doch leider könnten wir uns bald schon wieder in Reisewelten befinden, die ein wenig streng nach den 90er-Jahren müffeln.

Propulsée sur le devant de la scène médiatique après avoir accepté un poste de chroniqueuse sur C8, la chaîne du milliardaire Vincent Bolloré, l'avocate et oratrice nationale de la France insoumise Raquel Garrido détonne de plus en plus au sein d'un mouvement qui se revendique comme l'antithèse des pratiques qui lui sont reprochées. Devenue, parfois contre son gré, une actrice du monde des polémiques spectacles, l'avocate et ses incartades ont installé un malaise certain au sein de la France insoumise.

Pour l'heure, la direction du mouvement antilibéral fait toujours bloc derrière la porte-parole. ""Raquel Garrido concentre leur haine de caste"", l'a notamment défendue Jean-Luc Mélenchon en décrivant une femme ""de talent"", ""cultivée"" et qui ""parle quatre langues, ce qui lui permet de boire d'autres potages informatifs que la seule soupe nationale"". A travers elle, ""il y a une volonté très claire de déstabiliser la France insoumise"", assure le député Bastien Lachaud pour qui ""les informations du Canard enchaîné ne sont pas les bonnes"".

Des arguments qui ne suffisent plus à apaiser l'inquiétude de certains militants, tiraillés entre la défense d'une camarade et le respect de l'intégrité doctrinale du mouvement.

""Garrido est un boulet pour nous, elle nous décrédibilise""

""J'arrête pas de dire aux gens autour de moi que tous les politiques ne sont pas des pourris en prenant pour exemple ceux de la France Insoumise. Mais là, avec Garrido, ça devient dur de nous défendre"", s'émouvait ce mercredi un cybermilitant sur le Discord insoumis. ""Désolé de le dire mais actuellement, Garrido est un boulet pour nous, elle nous décrédibilise complètement autant sur le fond que sur la forme"", regrette un autre.

Plus qu'un problème d'image, le ""cas Garrido"" pose une question de cohérence programmatique. Le programme L'Avenir en commun porté par Jean-Luc Mélenchon pendant la présidentielle insiste sur la nécessité de ""balayer l'oligarchie"" et ""d'abolir les privilèges de la caste"". Autant dire que les révélations du Canard enchaîné sur le non-paiement de ses cotisations sociales, puis de Buzzfeed qui a dévoilé que le couple que forme Raquel Garrido avec le député Alexis Corbière n'avait pas quitté son HLM parisien, ont semé le trouble.

Jusqu'à s'inviter dans les contributions internes des adhérents de la France insoumise. Dans la réflexion lancée par le mouvement sur son site Internet, (""quelles modalités d'actions pour la France insoumise?""), un adhérent met les pieds dans le plat: ""Si Raquel Garrido est coupable, alors il faut condamner et exclure ces personnes, car je peux vous dire qu'autour de moi, cette histoire commence déjà à flinguer la belle réputation qu'avait de l'élection la France insoumise (sic)"". ""Rester totalement irréprochable"", estime-t-il, est la ""condition ultime"" pour ""continuer à informer et dénoncer les injustices, les abus, commenter les scandales commis par les politiques"".

Le malaise Bolloré

A travers Raquel Garrido, c'est aussi la stratégie médiatique de la France insoumise, théorisée notamment par Jean-Luc Mélenchon, qui est interrogée. ""Faire masse"" en ne dédaignant aucune invitation dans un média très grand public a toujours été revendiqué par le mouvement. L'arrivée sur C8 de Raquel Garrido s'inscrivait dans cette logique. Mais en acceptant d'être salariée par le milliardaire controversé Vincent Bolloré, l'avocate a visiblement franchi une ligne jaune.

Le 31 août, un référent de la France insoumise estimait que le nouveau job de l'oratrice posait ""une ambiguïté qu'il faut résoudre"", dans la mesure où elle ""est considérée comme porte-parole du mouvement"". Début octobre, alors que l'intéressée commence à afficher plusieurs polémiques à son compteur, un autre adhérent propose qu'elle ""verse ses émoluments de Canal+"" au mouvement pour l'achat de matériel. ""D'ailleurs, ce serait bien que l'on sache combien elle gagne"", ajoute-t-il suspicieux.

Un malaise qui se ressent aussi sur la plateforme Discord. ""Je ne suis pas bourgeois, et je ne parle pas de pureté d'un média. Mais Garrido sur C8, je trouve qu'il y a une association qui ne passe pas"", s'interrogeait le 9 octobre un membre du réseau. ""Si il y a bien une chose qui était une belle connerie de la part de Raquel Garrido, c'est d'avoir accepté ce poste de chroniqueuse chez Bolloré. Ça, effectivement, c'est une connerie, et qu'elle ne pourra réparer qu'en se faisant virer avec pertes et fracas de l'émission"", analyse un autre.

La théorie du complot médiatique

Face à ces interrogations, d'autres militants continuent toutefois de lui accorder le bénéfice du doute, voire de rejeter en bloc les accusations. L'argument massue, conforme à celui des cadres du parti: le complot médiatique dont ferait l'objet la France insoumise. Une théorie que l'on retrouve sur les réseaux sociaux, où plusieurs soutiens de Jean-Luc Mélenchon crient à la ""fake news"".

For in this moment, these two competing ideas of post-Brexit Britain, the lion and the servant cannot sustain the standoff.

HuffPost-Autor Sebastian Christ schreibt, warum er Air Berlin vermissen wird

Liebe Air Berlin!

Meine Facebook-Timeline ist voll mit Abschiedspostings. Es ist die Zeit der letzten Air-Berlin-Flüge. Ich finde es rührend, was da zu lesen ist: Viele meiner Freunde sprechen dem Personal ein letztes Mal Mut zu und wünschen ihnen alles Gute für den Weg in eine ungewisse Zukunft.

Jetzt, da eine Ära vorbei geht, scheint das geschäftige Treiben an den Flughäfen dieser Republik, zwischen Rollkoffern und Businessanzügen, plötzlich menschliche Züge zu bekommen. Das ist ein gutes Zeichen.

Andere schreiben wehmütig über den Geschmack der Schokoherzchen, die es früher beim Aussteigen gab. Zugegeben, ich fand die Teile auch lecker. Aber sie sind so ziemlich das Unwichtigste, was ich an Air Berlin vermissen werde.

Früher war Fliegen noch außergewöhnlich

Seit Donnerstag ist klar, dass Air Berlin größtenteils von der Lufthansa übernommen wird. Damit dürfte sich der Flugverkehr, so wie wir ihn kennen, radikal ändern. Jeder, der das Fliegen noch in den 1990er-Jahren erlebt hat, dürfte da eine Vorahnung haben.

Ich habe meinen ersten Flug in einem Linienjet erst mit 22 Jahren machen können. Dabei hatte ich weder Flugangst noch war ich jemand, der keine Lust aufs Reisen hatte. Ich konnte mir es schlicht und einfach nicht leisten, für mittlere Strecken ein Flugticket zu erwerben.

Bis vor etwa 20 Jahren war Fliegen etwas Besonderes, wenn es um innerdeutsche Strecken ging. Preise von 600 oder 800 Mark für ein Flugticket von Hamburg nach München waren damals nichts Außergewöhnliches, sondern eher etwas ganz Normales.

Das war etwas für Geschäftsreisende, deren Firmen bereit waren, teures Geld dafür zu bezahlen, um fähige Fachkräfte von A nach B zu transportieren. Aber kein echtes Konkurrenzangebot für die Bahn, die damals noch staatlich-gemächlich durch Deutschland zockelte.

Das Aufkommen preisgünstiger Flugangebote hat vieles verändert: bisweilen sogar die Infrastruktur unserer Städte. Vor allem aber die Art und Weise, wie wir reisen.

Du warst bei allem der Dreh- und Angelpunkt

Es ist heute kein Problem mehr, morgens in Stuttgart und nachmittags in Hamburg zu sein. Es gibt heute sogar Studenten, die Fernbeziehungen per Flugzeug führen – weil man es sich leisten kann, am Freitagmorgen von Berlin nach Köln zu fliegen, und am Sonntagnachmittag wieder zurück. Vorausgesetzt, man bucht rechtzeitig.

Und Du, Air Berlin, warst bei allem der Dreh- und Angelpunkt. Wahrscheinlich beschäftigt Dein Niedergang auch deswegen so viele Menschen: Wenn die Lufthansa für die Fernreisenden ein Stück Alltagskultur geworden war, warst Du es für die Kurz- und Mittelstrecken.

Und wenn wir schon über die Lufthansa sprechen: Genau da fängt das Problem an. Außer Germanwings und Eurowings gibt es sonst auf dem deutschen Markt keine größeren Billigfluganbieter mehr. Beide Gesellschaften gehören zu Lufthansa. Und die schluckt jetzt eben auch noch Air Berlin.

Um das ganze mal mit Fakten zu illustrieren: Im Juni 2017 belegten die nunmehr vier Fluglinien der Lufthansa die Plätze eins bis vier nach Abflugzahlen in Deutschland. Gut 46.200 Flüge gehen auf das Konto des Lufthansa-Imperiums. Auf Platz fünf folgt dann Ryanair mit 4.600 Abflügen.

Man muss kein Wirtschaftswissenschaftler sein, um an dieser Stelle eine Gefahr für den Wettbewerb zu sehen.

Uns droht eine Saure-Gurken-Zeit

Billigflüge könnten künftig wieder zu etwas werden, was in der Nische stattfindet. Zumindest hätte die Lufthansa die nötige Marktmacht, um das durchzusetzen.

Das hätte nicht nur Folgen für den Flugverkehr.

Denn auch die Bahn hat sich unter dem zunehmenden Druck von Seiten des Flugverkehrs in den vergangenen 20 Jahren zusehends modernisiert. In einigen Wochen zum Beispiel wird die Strecke von Berlin nach München für den Personenverkehr freigegeben: Dann wird man in vier Stunden von der Hauptstadt nach Süddeutschland fahren können.

Solche Trassen werden nicht gebaut, um den Bussen Konkurrenz machen zu können. Sondern, weil die Bahn gegen den Flugverkehr ankommen will. Vier Stunden – das ist durchaus eine wettbewerbsfähige Fahrtzeit. Leider bietet die Bahn viel zu wenige dieser Verbindungen an.

Im Gegensatz zu Frankreich übrigens. Dort war es offensichtlich möglich, ein Hochgeschwindigkeitsnetz für die Schiene aufzubauen. In Deutschland droht uns nach dem Wegfall der Konkurrenz aus der Luft eine neue Saure-Gurken-Zeit.

Auch deswegen werde ich Dich vermissen, Air Berlin. Es geht nicht um die Schokoherzen – sondern darum, einem bisweilen recht schwerfälligen Land den Mut zur Veränderung schmackhaft zu machen. Doch leider könnten wir uns bald schon wieder in Reisewelten befinden, die ein wenig streng nach den 90er-Jahren müffeln.

Laxmi Narayan Chaudhary, a cabinet minister in Uttar Pradesh, has said that the Taj Mahal was ""rightly kept out"" of the tourism booklet recently released the Yogi Adityanath government, and the 17th century monument ""should instead be replaced with the Guru Gorakhnath peeth.""

Speaking on the controversial omission, Chaudhary said that the Bharatiya Janata Party government in Uttar Pradesh was ""rashtravadi (nationalist)"" and runs on ""dharm niti (religious policy).""

The Times of India reported today that Chaudhary, who is in charge of culture, religious affairs and minority welfare, shared his views on the Taj Mahal at an event organized by the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) in Hathras.

""Taj Mahal is not the symbol of any religion and (it is) nobody's. It does not represent any religion,"" he said. ""On the other hand, Gorakhnath peeth represents people's faith.""

TOI further reported that when it was pointed out that the Taj Mahal was a UNESCO heritage site, Chaudhary said, ""Those who included the monument in that list must have been of a similar taste (mizaz) as those who built it.""

In September, the UP government released a booklet entitled ""Uttar Pradesh Tourism: Its High Potential,"" which did not mention the world famous monument.

In the face of intense criticism, the UP government said that the booklet was not brochure of all the tourist attractions in UP, but a compilation of the UP government's ongoing and future projects in the tourism sector.

""The government, with the help of the World Bank has proposed projects worth Rs 370 crore, of which projects worth Rs 156 crore are meant for development of the Taj Mahal and Taj Mahal region,"" the UP Information Department said in a press release.

Tourism Minister Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a former Congress Party leader who joined the BJP ahead of the Assembly election, said, ""How can anyone in the tourism sector ignore the Taj Mahal, one of the big tourist attractions in the country?""

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, however, is not a fan of the 17th century marble mausoleum made by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife, Mumtaz Mahal, known the world over as the ""monument of love.""

In June, Adityanath said that the Taj Mahal did not reflect Indian culture. ""Foreign dignitaries visiting the country used to be gifted replicas of the Taj Mahal and other minarets which did not reflect Indian culture,"" he said.

In August, the Modi government at the Centre approved the Adityanath government's proposal to rename the Mughalsarai railway station in Uttar Pradesh after the Bharatiya Jana Sangh leader Pandit Deendayal Upadhayay, who also served the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideological parent of the BJP.

Diversity Progress In Fashion Is A Step Forward But There's No Time To Be Complacent While there's nothing wrong with being naturally slim and tall, it's not representative of what our society looks like, leading to greater anxiety and fear among people of not being able to live up to what's considered beautiful.

La zénitude, sérénitude : 24h sur 24, 7 jours sur 7, beau temps mauvais temps...

La vie va si vite. Mais pas moi. Du moins, plus maintenant, selon les réactions de mon corps et de ma tête. Par contre, mon coeur et mon âme semblent d'avis contraires; ils vagabondent sans cesse dans tout mon être, à la recherche d'une issue, mais il n'y en a pas!

À l'intérieur de moi, ça rugit comme un lion prêt à attaquer sa proie et ça gronde comme le tonnerre qui se déchaîne et dont nous ne pouvons ignorer la prestance.

À l'intérieur de moi, ça rugit comme un lion prêt à attaquer sa proie et ça gronde comme le tonnerre qui se déchaîne et dont nous ne pouvons ignorer la prestance. Ça tremble aussi, comme un tremblement de terre de faible intensité, avec de petites fluctuations de temps à autre, et ce depuis très longtemps. En fait, du plus loin que je me souvienne pour être bien franche!

Tout mon être semble confus, peut-être même en désaccord sur la tangente à prendre afin que mon corps, ma tête, mon coeur et mon esprit soient en parfaite harmonie, en équilibre, en homéostasie.

J'ai besoin de bouger, de laisser courir mon lion dans la savane; de permettre à mon énergie de se libérer, mais mes muscles sont comme les chaînes d'un pont-levis lorsque le gardien aperçoit l'ennemi, elles se rétractent et l'envahisseur frappe un mur.

J'ai besoin de me détendre, de prendre de grandes bouffées d'air frais... Le tonnerre qui m'habite préfère de loin la musique rythmée, expressive et explosive que le chant des baleines du sud de la Californie. Alors, après quelques minutes à me faire à croire que dans une autre vie je devais probablement être une moniale bouddhiste, ne parvenant plus à me retenir davantage, je laisse échapper un soupir qui en dit long sur mon niveau d'impatience. Puis, je me relève en maudissant mon être d'être aussi immature en entretenant une vieille querelle dont j'ai l'impression qu'aucune des parties en cause ne se souvient du quoi, où, quand, comment et surtout, POURQUOI ils en sont arrivés là...

Il y a de fortes chances que vous aussi vous ayez oublié quelque chose... Mais de quels «partis en cause» parle-t-elle ? Je parle de mon corps, ma tête, mon coeur et mon âme!

Au fond de moi, je sais que c'est à moi que revient le mandat d'agir à titre de médiatrice entre ces divers partis; de les écouter, de leur faire des propositions, de leur apprendre à faire des compromis, sans maugréer... Difficile à faire et vachement épuisant par moment, surtout quand chacun dit ce qu'il pense en faisant fi des conventions usuelles de politesse.

Bref, dans ce tumulte intérieur, je me demande sincèrement comment devenir une personne sereine, zen et inébranlable devant l'adversité.

Peut-être aussi que cette façon de vivre (sérénitude / zénitude) au jour le jour n'est tout simplement pas faite pour moi... En fait, j'en suis certaine, car ça ne respecte pas le besoin de certaines parties de mon être...

Et si je faisais fausse route en ce qui concerne ma vision de ce que c'est «être zen»?

Après tout, mon image d'un Yogi vêtu de blanc et s'enfilant une ligne de rayon de soleil chaque matin, lors de son levé, buvant que de l'eau pure de l'Himalaya, mangeant que luzerne et tofu, et s'adonnant à une séance de yoga matin, midi et soir me semble quelque peu exagéré...

Bon, je sais bien que ce que j'ai écrit n'était que pure fiction, mais c'était ma façon de représenter l'intensité poussée à l'extrême que certaines personnes en déroute peuvent choisir comme mode de vie survie. Et moi, je ne veux pas «survivre» à ma vie, je veux la VIVRE!

Pour moi, zen, c'est être bien, être serein. J'ai regardé la définition de sérénité, sur Larousse.fr:

« État de calme, de tranquillité, de confiance sur le plan moral.»

Peut-on réellement être, en permanence, dans cet état ?

Moi personnellement, je n'y crois pas.

Ce qui capte mon attention dans la définition, c'est « confiance sur le plan moral », donc avoir confiance en soi, en ses capacités... Si on réussit à avoir une véritable confiance sur le plan moral, nous devrions, selon ma logique du moins, nous sentir en sécurité, donc de ne pas être en mode « survie », alors d'être en mesure de prendre le temps de chercher diverses suggestions et solutions qui sont à notre portée.

À partir de là, pour une vie saine et adaptée à nous, à nos besoins, on peut piger, tel un menu à la carte, une idée, un concept qui nous interpelle, ici et là, un peu partout, sans se restreindre à une seule proposition. Notre vie ressemblera peut-être à un repas gastronomique cinq services, ou encore, à un véritable buffet!

En y réfléchissant bien, la sérénité (ou la zénitude) c'est quand on se sent profondément bien, paisible, en paix avec soi-même et j'oserai même dire léger. Puis, ce qui nous procure cet état de bien-être est propre à chacun de nous. Chacun à sa propre recette: ingrédients spécifiques, quantités uniques. Les grands chefs disent, il me semble en tout cas, que c'est important de connaître ses bases en cuisine, mais qu'il faut aussi user d'intuition, de créativité et d'audace pour inventer un plat aux saveurs incroyables. Cela s'applique aussi à la vie...

Et la mienne, je la veux colorée et rafraichissante, avec des pauses « thé vert, livres ouverts et contemplation de l'univers »!

La polarización de las conversaciones no ha ayudado más a que dividir a la sociedad, o quizás la sociedad dividida solo ha ayudado a polarizar las conversaciones. Pero a la polarización no contribuye uno, sino varios factores. El tono en el discurso de los políticos sin duda, la desigualdad y la impunidad seguramente en muchos casos, tanto como la debilidad de las instituciones de garantizar los derechos de los ciudadanos. Pero algo que particularmente para el caso de Enfoque Noticias resulta importante es la polarización de las audiencias de los medios de comunicación o de los propios medios, y también en las conversaciones de redes sociales. Es el linchamiento probablemente equívoco desde la reacción sesgada.

Y aquí el asunto es que un linchamiento equívoco no tendrá peor consecuencia que en el propio detrimento de la sociedad que lo ejerce.

Hay que recordar que los medios no solo están integrados por periodistas (buenos y malos, como profesionales en todos lados) sino que son estas fuerzas movidas también por ciertos principios o visiones, por razones empresariales y, particularmente en México, por ser clientes del gobierno o no. Y así lo ha recordado el propio Leonardo Curzio en su columna de ayer en El Universal, ""...hay un ecosistema que inhibe el desarrollo autónomo de los medios y es la dependencia (producto de la gestión no profesionalizada) de la publicidad gubernamental"". Esta una realidad que debe solucionarse con urgencia. Sin embargo, el mismo Curzio agregó que no puede asegurar que hubo presión gubernamental para su salida de Enfoque Noticias.

""El presidente Peña planteó en uno de sus primeros manifiestos que debía transparentarse el manejo de publicidad oficial a través de un órgano técnico y ciudadano"", escribió el periodista para luego decir que no puede coincidir más con él. La cosa es que no ha sucedido.

Hay que recordar que el mundo digital abrió la puerta por completo a los bots y las noticias falsas. Hay que recordar que la mayor parte de los usuarios de redes sociales se comporta muchas veces desde su lado más animal.

No me cesaron, me voy por mi propia voluntad. En efecto, me pidieron la cabeza de dos colaboradores. — Leonardo Curzio (@LeonardoCurzio) October 4, 2017

La historia que cuenta Curzio es que se le pidió eliminar ""La Tertulia"", una mesa de análisis que realizaba junto con María Amparo Casar y Ricardo Raphael. Él se negó y prefirió renunciar. Por su parte, el dueño de Radio Mil, Edilberto Huesca, argumentó que esa sección de 40 minutos ya no era rentable, y negó que se tratara de otras circunstancias.

En tiempos en que el gobierno federal y el mismo PRI tienen poco margen para salir airosos de severas y fundamentadas críticas, ¿qué ganarían con este numerito? Es decir, Curzio, Raphael y Casar no son los únicos ni más férreos críticos del gobierno. Se dijo que la petición a Curzio sucedió después de que en la mesa de debate se criticó el asunto de la propuesta del PRI para eliminar el financiamiento público a los partidos políticos, y reducir los senadores y diputados plurinominales. Sin embargo, en los días pasados mucha gente, periodistas en distintos medios, analistas y redes sociales han mostrado su desacuerdo con esta iniciativa.

Se puede pensar también que el gobierno trae algo en contra de María Amparo Casar, impulsora de Mexicanos contra la corrupción. Esto por aquella nota en la que The New York Timescuenta que EPN le habría dicho a Claudio X. González Laporte (padre de Claudio X. González Guajardo, presidente de dicha organización, MCCI) que la sociedad civil no debería pasar tanto tiempo hablando de corrupción. Misma nota en la que el diario estadounidense resalta que González Guajardo ha sido objeto de espionaje por parte del gobierno mexicano, así como de diversas auditorías fiscales para una posible revocación del estado de las ONG's en las que él está involucrado.

Sin embargo, María Amparo Casar, insisto, tiene otros espacios en distintos medios.

Y en tiempos en que 8 de cada diez mexicanos desconfían de la radio, la televisión y los periódicos, ¿qué ganaría Radio Mil sumándose una interpretación de este tipo al pedir la cabeza de dos analistas que además cuentan con otros espacios para expresarse?

Entonces vayamos pensando dos veces todo. La radiodifusora tiene el derecho de quitar a los colaboradores que no le funcionen. Aunque también hay que resaltar que son una concesiones gubernamentales, son un negocio. No digo que por esto no la hubo —censura o autocensura— sino que invito a la reflexión. Y que lo más importante de todo esto es no dejarnos llevar por el impulso y la reacción, y entender que lo que deberíamos hacer es presionar para que el gobierno deje el manejo del presupuesto de publicidad a una entidad autónoma. Y que no sea utilizado a su gusto y negociación con los dueños de los medios dependiendo de sus contenidos.

Es sin duda lamentable que desaparezcan espacios de debate como éste, sin embargo no es el único y en la medida en que las audiencias los consumamos, en esa medida existirán más. Y precisamente los espacios de debate ayudan a entender el otro lado de la moneda y alivianar la polarización.

Hoy en día también es mucho más difícil para el gobierno ejercer censura. Están las redes sociales y la libertad del uso de ellas. EPN ha sido el primer presidente ""víctima"" de ellas, pero no será el último.

Tras un evento como el de Enfoque Noticias, la reacción social —y porque el gato no era arisco— es pensar en censura. Pero justo una de las desventajas de la era digital es una respuesta inmediata sin razonamiento, es el exceso, es la exageración, es la inmediatez, es la conversación aplastante de twitter, es la próxima coyuntura que se presenta y que nos obliga a subirnos a ella y olvidarnos de la anterior aunque fuera más importante; es el meme, es el tren del mame que se lleva muchas cosas entre sus patas, pero más que nada se puede llevar la oportunidad de conocer la verdad a partir de haberse creado una ""verdad"" digital politizada o masificada.",Para ti que piensas que es censura,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.mx/laura-raquel-manzo/tu-tambien-piensas-que-es-censura_a_23238883/

Που θα δείξουν ότι διαθέτουν τις κατάλληλες ικανότητες, την εμπειρία και τη γνώση που απαιτεί το έργο που έχουν επιλέξει και ο συγκεκριμένος ρόλος που θα αναλάβουν» σημειώνει η κυρία Ρούλη Χριστοπούλου, Υπεύθυνη Τμήματος Βιώσιμης Ανάπτυξης και Κοινωνικής Συνεισφοράς της Vodafone. Προκειμένου να συμμετάσχουν στο πρόγραμμα, οι ενδιαφερόμενοι θα πρέπει πρώτα να έχουν έρθει σε επαφή με τον οργανισμό στον οποίο θέλουν να εργαστούν και να συμφωνήσουν σε ένα συγκεκριμένο έργο για την περίοδο απασχόλησής τους. Στη συνέχεια θα πρέπει να υποβάλουν την αίτησή τους ηλεκτρονικά στην ιστοσελίδα της Vodafone στο www.vodafone.gr/worldofdifference μέχρι και τις 15 Οκτωβρίου.

Όλες οι αιτήσεις που λαμβάνει το Ίδρυμα Vodafone περνούν από μία συγκεκριμένη διαδικασία αξιολόγησης που περιλαμβάνει διάφορα στάδια, όπως τηλεφωνικές συνεντεύξεις με τους οργανισμούς, προσωπικές συνεντεύξεις με τους υποψηφίους κ.λπ.

Το Ίδρυμα Vodafone αρωγός στους νέους και στην κοινωνία

«Ως Ίδρυμα Vodafone, θέλουμε να επενδύουμε με ένταση στους νέους ανθρώπους και να δημιουργούμε ευκαιρίες για την απόκτηση εργασιακής εμπειρίας, καθώς αναγνωρίζουμε τον μοναδικό ρόλο που μπορούν να διαδραματίσουν οι γνώσεις, οι ιδέες και το όραμα των νέων ανθρώπων στην ελληνική πραγματικότητα» επισημαίνει η κ. Χριστοπούλου, αναφέροντας πως το “World of Difference” έχει διττό στόχο: δημιουργεί θέσεις απασχόλησης, ενώ ταυτόχρονα ενισχύει το έργο Μη Κερδοσκοπικών Οργανισμών, συμβάλλοντας στην ανακούφιση ευαίσθητων κοινωνικών ομάδων.

Έτσι, όσοι συμμετάσχουν στο πρόγραμμα, θα έχουν την ευκαιρία να ενισχύσουν έμπρακτα το έργο κοινωφελών οργανισμών, θα αμείβονται για τις υπηρεσίες που θα παρέχουν και θα έχουν τη δυνατότητα να αναπτύξουν τις δεξιότητές τους και να αποκτήσουν εργασιακή εμπειρία, εφόδια πολύτιμα για τη μελλοντική σταδιοδρομία τους. Παράλληλα, μέσα από το πρόγραμμα, οι οργανισμοί ωφελούνται από τις ικανότητες και την εμπειρία εκείνων των νέων που θέλουν να κάνουν τη διαφορά.

Μια εμπειρία ζωής

«Ένας διαγωνισμός που σου δίνει την ευκαιρία να δουλέψεις έμμισθα για 6 μήνες σε έναν οργανισμό που σ’ ενδιαφέρει, καλύπτοντας μια θέση που μπορείς να σχεδιάσεις εσύ, είναι εξ ορισμού κάτι πάρα πολύ ελκυστικό. Αποκτάς εργασιακή εμπειρία, καλλιεργείς δεξιότητες και αναβαθμίζεις το βιογραφικό σου» εξηγεί η κ. Χριστοπούλου και συνεχίζει: «Το γεγονός, δε, ότι ταυτόχρονα ο οργανισμός αυτός έχει κοινωφελή χαρακτήρα και σου δίνει τη δυνατότητα να υποστηρίξεις αληθινές ανάγκες της κοινωνίας ή ευάλωτες κοινωνικές ομάδες και ν’ αφήσεις το δικό σου αποτύπωμα, νομίζω θα μ’ έκανε να δηλώσω συμμετοχή χωρίς δεύτερη σκέψη και να βάλω τα δυνατά μου να πείσω τους ανθρώπους που θα με αξιολογούσαν ότι είμαι ικανή να κάνω τη διαφορά. Έχοντας έρθει πολύ κοντά αυτά τα χρόνια με ανθρώπους που εργάζονται σε ΜΚΟ, έχω διακρίνει σ’ αυτούς μοναδικές δεξιότητες και ταλέντα, τα οποία σε κάποιο άλλο περιβάλλον μπορεί να μην είχαν καλλιεργήσει. Το να προσπαθείς, συχνά με ελάχιστούς πόρους, να κάνεις το καλύτερο δυνατό, σε κάνει δημιουργικό, εφευρετικό, τολμηρό και αποτελεσματικό. Σε κάνει να σκέφτεσαι χωρίς περιορισμούς και να βρίσκεις λύσεις. Κι αν συνυπολογίσει κανείς την προσωπική ικανοποίηση που παίρνεις υποστηρίζοντας δύσκολες καταστάσεις, βοηθώντας ευάλωτους συνανθρώπους μας ή βρίσκοντας λύση σε κοινωνικά ή περιβαλλοντικά προβλήματα, η συμμετοχή σ ένα τέτοιο πρόγραμμα γίνεται όχι απλά επαγγελματική εμπειρία, αλλά εμπειρία ζωής».

Η ιστορία του προγράμματος “World of Difference”

Το “World of Difference” του Ιδρύματος Vodafone ξεκίνησε στην Ελλάδα τον Σεπτέμβριο του 2010 και μέχρι σήμερα έχει αναδείξει 54 άτομα τα οποία εργάστηκαν σε 49 Μη Κερδοσκοπικούς Οργανισμούς της επιλογής τους. Οι νέοι που συμμετείχαν στο πρόγραμμα εργάστηκαν σε διάφορες πόλεις και περιοχές της χώρας, συγκεκριμένα, σε 11 διαφορετικές περιοχές της Ελλάδας (Αθήνα, Θεσσαλονίκη, Δράμα, Καστοριά, Κέρκυρα, Κοζάνη, Κομοτηνή, Κρήτη, Μυτιλήνη, Πάτρα, Πάρος, Πρέσπες), προσφέροντας σημαντικό έργο στην τοπική κοινωνία. Τα άτομα που έχουν επιλεγεί ως νικητές έχουν προσφέρει έργο -μεταξύ άλλων- σε οργανισμούς όπως η Κιβωτός του Κόσμου, ο Σύλλογος Συνδρόμου Down Ελλάδος, το Δίκτυο για τα Δικαιώματα του Παιδιού, η ΕΛΕΠΑΠ, το Ινστιτούτο Οδικής Ασφάλειας «Πάνος Μυλωνάς», η Εταιρεία Προστασίας Πρεσπών, το Σώμα Ελλήνων Προσκόπων, η Equal Society, το Make a Wish Ελλάδας και σε άλλους φορείς.

Η κ. Χριστοπούλου περιγράφει, καθώς θυμάται την επιτυχία του περσινού προγράμματος: «Είναι υπέροχο να βλέπεις τόσους νέους ανθρώπους να παθιάζονται με κάτι που αφορά τον συνάνθρωπό τους, την κοινωνία, τη βιώσιμη ανάπτυξη, το περιβάλλον, και οργανισμούς που αφοσιώνονται στους σκοπούς και στις αξίες τους με πείσμα και σοβαρότητα. Επειδή τελικά τα κοινωνικά προγράμματα αξιολογούνται με τον αντίκτυπό τους, αυτό που δεν θα ξεχάσω ποτέ από το “World of Difference” του 2017 είναι τα 118 άτομα με κινητική αναπηρία και τους 542 φροντιστές που εκπαίδευσε ο Φάνης για τη βελτίωση της ποιότητας ζωής και την εργασιακή τους επανένταξη, τους 4.000 μαθητές δημοτικού που η Ειρήνη εκπαίδευσε και ευαισθητοποίησε για το θέμα της σπατάλης του φαγητού, τους 370 ελέγχους μνήμης που η Μικαέλα πραγματοποίησε σε συνανθρώπους μας τρίτης ηλικίας για τη διάγνωση και αντιμετώπισης της άνοιας, τους 8 σπουδαστές με νοητική αναπηρία που η Ρόζμαρι εκπαίδευσε με σκοπό την κοινωνική και επαγγελματική τους ενσωμάτωση και αυτονομία, τα 1.354 κουτιά φαρμάκων που ο Ηλίας εξοικονόμησε για μηνιαία φαρμακευτική περίθαλψη σε 450 άτομα, τους 3000 μαθητές και τους 500 εκπαιδευτικούς που συμμετείχαν στο εκπαιδευτικό πρόγραμμα της Ειρήνης για τις προσφυγικές ροές και τα ανθρώπινα δικαιώματα, τα 330 παιδιά και ενήλικες που επωφελήθηκαν από το Mobile School σε περιοχές της Δράμας που υλοποίησε η Ελένη, τους 2.100 πρόσφυγες που ενημέρωσε ο Παύλος για θέματα ασφάλειας και ατομικής υγιεινής, τα 12.000 άτομα που επωφελήθηκαν από τα παιχνίδια για τυφλούς και δράσεις που σχεδίασε και υλοποίησε η Αντιγόνη, τις δράσεις που συντόνισε ο Κώστας για τη βελτίωση της ζωής χιλιάδων οροθετικών ατόμων».","15 Μη Κερδοσκοπικοί Οργανισμοί, 6 μήνες απασχόλησης, ένας κοινός στόχος για 15 νέους: Να κάνουν τη διαφορά",http://www.huffingtonpost.gr/2017/10/12/life-world-of-difference-vodafone_n_18170072.html#comments

Another expert in the recently released TrueChild report says, ""Older women have power in areas where men do not.
We must not ignore deeply ingrained patriarchal structures that allowed practices like chaupadi to exist in the first place.","A young Nepali girl hugs her knees to her chest to keep warm. She has nestled herself into the hay as far away from the steaming pile of dung as she can. There, in the small cow shed, this 13-year-old has been banished for the entire length of her period. Only after her monthly bleeding stops will she be considered clean enough to rejoin her family. It begins to rain, and the drops crash on the corrugated metal roof. Inside, it sounds like an approaching army. Yet, outside, there is no one at all.

As it is believed that menstruating girls bring bad luck to the household, roughly 75 per cent of women and girls in one Nepali region are banished to cow sheds during their periods. Known as chaupadi, this practice received international attention last year after two girls died during their isolation.

Chaupadi provides a backdrop for three tough truths that I'd like to share on the Day of the Girl. Only when we begin to understand the following can we make headway in ending the practices and beliefs that hold girls back for generations.

1. Skirting around complexity won't serve women's movements

Important new research, released today by TrueChild, highlights a disturbing reality — one that is rarely discussed. Practices like chaupadi are often perpetuated by women themselves.

As one expert quoted in TrueChild's report notes,

""Girls are disciplined by older women to be submissive, obedient, not ask questions, talk back, raise their eyes, or make decisions. Girls are watched, monitored, and corrected every moment. This is imposed mainly by women who enforce these traditional female norms. We have a Hindi saying that literally translates to: 'Women are the biggest enemy of women.'""

As funders and as donors, this reality makes us uncomfortable. It's not that we aren't familiar with this idea in other contexts. For example, in a Western context, research shows that women in the C suite sometimes stand in the way of other women who aspire to rise up the ranks.

Yet, as women's rights advocates, we often shy away from the deeply complex and uncomfortable reality that women play a role in harming other women. Bringing these conversations to the surface is important if we are to unpack the many ways in which a patriarchal system affects us.

Indeed, when we widen the lens on my earlier story to see the 13-year-old girl being banished to the shed by her young mother, the complexity is almost mind-numbing. This young mother experienced the shed as an adolescent and now she enforces the same practice on her own daughter. This mother is playing by the rulebook of her society, trying to fit in, trying to live up to the expectations placed on her. But the rules weren't made by her, and she has little power to change them. Her participation in perpetuating harmful traditions is, in fact, deep-rooted patriarchy in its ugliest form.

2. Our narratives are short sighted

We have said for years that the women's movement needs new narratives. Yet adding complexity flies in the face of everything we have been taught. Consider this:

While chaupadi has been illegal for more than 10 years, the laws were rarely enforced. Case in point: local organizations indicate that there were fewer than 20 reported cases in 2015-2016. Then, in August, Nepal finally criminalized chaupadi, making the practice punishable by a fine and/or time in jail.



Funders such as The MATCH Fund rejoiced. Rarely can we point to such a concrete happy ending.

[The mother's] participation in perpetuating harmful traditions is, in fact, deep-rooted patriarchy in its ugliest form.



But grassroots women's groups in Nepal are not celebrating just yet. As one of The MATCH Fund's Nepali partners has pointed out, truly enforcing these laws would require women and girls to report their own family members — often their mothers, aunties, or grandmothers — to the police. This begs the question: are girls really safer when their mothers are incarcerated? Is it really justice to lock up a woman for doing what, her whole life, she has been told is best for her family?



Certainly I want laws to protect and enforce the status of women and girls. But, just like in the example above, widening the lens on the story shows us a girl whose mother is the head of her household. (Her father has been away for months looking for work in the Saudi oil fields.) An even more nuanced story also shows us that Nepal's population of female inmates is growing by an alarming five per cent each year. And then there's this: Nepal prisons are so overcrowded that inmates are sometimes forced to live ... in sheds.

As funders, we must override our desire for a happy-ending story and widen the lens. When we do, we will also widen our understanding of the many issues at play, opening our work to stronger collaborations at the intersections of sectors and movements.

3. The patriarchy is alive and well

Naming and exposing the complexities in our storytelling is important. But, perhaps most important, is acknowledging the force that underpins it all: the patriarchy and long-held patriarchal structures.

Another expert in the recently released TrueChild report says, ""Older women have power in areas where men do not. People tell us that men need to change — but in these areas, it's the women who need to change."" We must not ignore deeply ingrained patriarchal structures that allowed practices like chaupadi to exist in the first place.

Truly brave philanthropy explores constructs of power and, in its storytelling, asks the hard questions: who really holds the power in a community, for how long, over whom, and why? Why, over time, have women been taught to fear their own bodies? When women do not follow practices that have been mandated for generations, how much power do they actually have to live safe and valued lives within their communities?

I'm sure that today, the Day of the Girl, you'll hear lots of stories about girls — girls who triumph despite incredible odds and girls who are the heroes you either wish you had or wish you were. Among these narratives, I am grateful for brave documents like TrueChild's that highlight the complexity of attacking gender norms head on, surfacing the dark and difficult manifestations of long-held patriarchal traditions, including naming our role as women in keeping these traditions alive.

I would add only a call to action for those of us who fund, either institutionally or individually, women's and girls' rights. Let us not shy away from the whole story.

In den Wahlprogrammen der möglichen Jamaika-Koalitionäre zeigen sich tiefe Gräben

Aber sie sind nicht unüberwindbar

Es ist ein Bündnis, das viele Hoffnungen weckt - und nach dem schlechten Abschneiden der Union und SPD bei der Bundestagswahl nun realistischer ist als je zuvor: Eine sogenannte Jamaika-Koalition aus Union, FDP und Grünen.

Sie gilt unter ihren Befürwortern als progressiver als die Große Koalition und bürgerlicher als Rot-Rot-Grün. Unter ihr könnten drängende Zukunftsthemen angegangen werden.

Die FDP treibt die Digitalisierung und den Wettbewerb mit weniger Staat voran, die Grünen den Klimaschutz und Europa. Und die Union steht für innere und äußere Sicherheit.

Allen Parteien zeigen sich gesprächsbereit - ihnen ist aber auch klar: Jamaika ist kein Selbstläufer.

Mehr oder weniger rote Linien haben alle potenziellen Partner gezogen - in der Klima- und Sozialpolitik, vor allem aber in der Flüchtlings- und Einwanderungspolitik.

Grüne und FDP haben Zehn-Punkte-Kataloge vorgelegt. Zoff aber dürfte es vor allem mit der CSU geben, Störfeuer aus München sind zu erwarten.

Es schwirrt deswegen noch ein anderes Wort durch Berlin. Es heißt Neuwahlen. Die sind natürlich hochhypothetisch, aber ein Schreckgespenst - weil sie eine Staatskrise auslösen, die AfD stärken und die Volksparteien weiter schwächen könnten.

Wie realistisch ist also Jamaika? Hier sind 5 Konflikte, an denen das Bündnis scheitern könnte - und warum sie wahrscheinlich gelöst werden.

1. Klimaschutz: Rote Linie für die Grünen

Es ist das wichtigste Thema für die Grünen, sagte Parteichef Cem Özdemir am Montag in der Bundespressekonferenz. Hier wird sich die Partei also wenig reinreden lassen.

Im einen entscheidenen Streitthema hat sich Özdemir allerdings bereits kompromissbereit gezeigt.

Die Grünen treten in ihrem Wahlprogramm dafür ein, ab dem Jahr 2030 keine Autos mit Verbrennungsmotor mehr neu zuzulassen. Die CSU wiederum will keinen Koalitionsvertrag unterschreiben, in dem ein Enddatum für den Verbrennungsmotor festgehalten ist.

Die Liberalen halten nichts von einem Verbot von Verbrennungsmotoren. CDU-Chefin und Kanzlerin Angela Merkel sieht den Verbrennungsmotor allenfalls als eine Brückentechnologie an.

Grünen-Chef Özdemir ließ also erkennen, dass 2030 als Enddatum für Benziner und Diesel nicht durchsetzbar sein könnte, da man ja nicht allein regiere.

2. Energiepolitik: Kompromisse von allen Parteien nötig

Hier müssen alle Koalitionspartner Kompromisse eingehen.

► Die Grünen wollen die 20 schmutzigsten Kohlekraftwerke sofort dicht machen und bis 2030 ganz aus der Kohle aussteigen.

► Die Union ist für einen Ausstieg zumindest aus der Braunkohle, ohne sich aber auf ein Datum festzulegen.

► Die FDP versteht sich als Partei des Wettbewerbs, des schlanken Staates und des freien Unternehmertums.

Auch sie steht zu den Klimazielen von Paris und der EU, will aber Korrekturen und weniger Vorgaben. Beim Ausbau von Ökostrom dürfte es etliche Reibereien geben.

3. Flüchtlingspolitik: Was wird aus der Obergrenze?

Ein entscheidendes Thema wird die Obergrenze sein, das Steckenpferd der CSU.

""Wir werden darauf bestehen. Ich hab das jeden Tag dem Wähler versprochen"", sagte Seehofer in einer Pressekonferenz am Montag. Zu einer Bedingung hat er es bislang allerdings nicht gemacht.

Gegen die Obergrenze sind CDU, Grüne und auch die FDP. Letztere ist nicht bereit, das Grundgesetz dafür zu ändern. Auch der Familiennachzug könnte unter den Jamaika-Parteien für Diskussion sorgen - die Grünen wollen ihn erleichtern.

FDP und Grüne sind zudem für ein Einwanderungsgesetz und ein Punktesystem zur Steuerung der Zuwanderung. Auch hier müssen sie sich zunächst vor allem mit der Union auf einen gemeinsamen Nenner verständigen.

4. Steuerpolitik: Wenig Verhandlungsmasse

Hier profitieren die Parteien davon, dass sie im Wahlkampf wenig bis gar keine konkreten Versprechen gemacht haben.

Alle Parteien wollen den Soli abschaffen und untere und mittlere Einkommen entlasten.

Kritisch wird es bei Einkommens-, Erbschafts- und Vermögenssteuer. Die Grünen etwa sind für eine Vermögenssteuer, die mit der FDP nicht zu machen ist.

5. Europapolitik: Hardliner FDP

Auf diesem Gebiet sorgt vor allem die FDP im Ausland für Unruhe. Die Liberalen könnten in einer neuen Regierung darauf dringen, bei den Euro-Regeln kompromissloser aufzutreten.

Die Liberalen lehnen einen gemeinsamen Haushalt für die Euro-Zone ab und wollen die EU-Verträge so ändern, dass der Austritt eines Landes aus der Euro-Zone nicht auch den Austritt aus der EU nach sich zieht.

Darauf angesprochen, gab sich die Kanzlerin heute in ihrer Pressekonferenz vorsichtig - und sagte, dass sie sich erst mit der FDP abstimmen müsse.

Die CDU ist in Europa-Fragen eher auf Linie der Grünen. Einen Reformerfolg in Frankreich wünschen sich alle Beteiligten.

Ein Schwarm von 30.000 Bienen hatte sich dort eingenistet

Wie ein Imker die Bienen entfernt, seht ihr im Video oben

Ein Mann aus Hillside in New Jersey fragte sich, was sich hinter seiner Wohnzimmerwand verbirgt. Immer wieder hörte er lautes Summen. Er vermutete einen Insektenschwarm hinter dem Gemäuer.

Und damit sollte er Recht behalten. Denn es war ein Schwarm aus 30.000 Bienen, wie unter anderem das Wissenschaftsportal “Science Alert” berichtet.

“Das ist verrückt! Sowas habe ich noch nie gesehen.”

Auch der Imker Mickey Hedegus, der den Schwarm beseitigen sollte, war beeindruckt. “Das ist verrückt! Sowas habe ich noch nie gesehen”, sagte er der ”Washington Post”.

Der Bienenzüchter bohrte zunächst ein kleines Loch in die Wand, um mithilfe einer Kamera die Größe des Schwarmes einzuschätzen.

Beim Öffnen der Wand stieß der Imker dann nach und nach auf immer mehr Bienen und Waben. “Das sind mindestens 30.0000 und über 40 Pfund Honig”, sagte Hedegus.

Der Imker wird mehr als 30 mal gestochen

Er nutzte einen Vakuumsauger und konnte 95 Prozent der Bienen aus der Wand in Boxen sammeln. Auch die Waben entfernte er aus der Wand und nahm sie mit, um die Bienen zu retten und nicht töten zu müssen.

Offenbar handelte es sich um eine sehr aggressive Art. “Ich wurde trotz meines Schutzanzugs mindestens 30 Mal gestochen. Das sind afrikanisierte Honigbienen. Diese Art baut besonders viel Waben und Honig an, sie sind aber auch äußerst aggressiv”, sagte er.

From girls, for girls: 11 #powerful quotes that will give you hope for the future!
""Gender stereotypes are really, really harmful both for boys and for girls, "" Legena said.","Plan International Deputy CEO Susanne Legena: ""We have got a lot of work to do if we want to create a much more equal society for boys and for girls.""

CANBERRA -- The words are clear and come from a 10 year old Australian girl demanding gender equality. A strong voice tells the nation, ""I want girls to basically stop being treated as walking Barbie dolls"".

Another young women states, ""I want to change the way girls are treated"". She added, ""I want girls to be treated the way boys are treated"".

And then something more basic, ""I want girls to know they are good enough"".

A new national online survey of 1,745 girls aged 10 to 17, conducted by Essential Research and released on Wednesday by girls' rights agency Plan International Australia to mark International Day of the Girl, has found an uninspiring, even damning situation: virtually all the girls who responded (98 percent) believe they are being treated adversely compared to boys.

This belief floods all areas of girls' lives: home, school, in popular culture and particularly in sport and the media.

When asked how to fix this, half of girls aged 10 to 14 replied with the suggestion: gender equality, including equal pay. What did they want? time and time again, ""To be taken more seriously"", ""To be treated equally"", ""Wish we didn't get judged by what we look like or what we're wearing!"" and ""To not listen to hate"".

It comes on the day girls and young women turn the tables on positions of power, by conducting 600 takeovers of positions of presidents, prime ministers, CEOs and parliamentarians in 60 countries, although 18 offices in Australia's federal parliament will have a delayed #GirlsTakeover on Wednesday, October the 18th, including that of Education Minister Simon Birmingham and Greens leader Richard Di Natale.

The young women will shadow the politicians throughout the day and are expected to press the MPs and Senators on improving the currently poor participation of young women in politics.

But today, on International Day of the Girl, the take over is elsewhere, including the Canadian PM Justin Trudeau, the ACT Legislative Assembly and the position of CEO at Plan International.

The newly released Plan International report called ""Dream Gap"" - the gap between what girls hope for in early in life and what they later believe is realistic for them - has found 40 percent of the responding girls think gender is the single biggest barrier to leadership, while almost all (93 percent) of girls aged 15-17 said it would be easier to get ahead in life if they were not judged on their appearance.

""Girls are internalising and recognising it is not the same if you are a boy or a girl, even in 2017,"" Plan International Deputy CEO Susanne Legena told HuffPost Australia. ""We have got a lot of work to do if we want to create a much more equal society for boys and girls.""

The report notes plummeting confidence as girls become teens. Fifty-six percent of girls view themselves as confident at 10, which drops to 44 per cent by the time they reach 17, to just 27 per cent when they reach adulthood (18-25).

""It is not an accident that the loss of confidence is happening at the same as you are entering puberty and your body is starting to change,"" Legena said.

""You start to feel like maybe your primary asset is really on your appearance and on your body.

""And you are probably taught that you need to keep that safe and if you don't, it is your fault. So it is not surprising to me that maybe girls would likely withdraw from the community and the outside world to protect themselves given that is what is happening.""

On Wednesday, a gender revolution is coming. Girls, boys, women, men must join the fight for equality #GirlsTakeover https://t.co/d977u2PSdb — AB Albrectsen (@ABAlbrectsen) October 9, 2017

The girls surveyed and Plan International want a ban on sexist advertising including industry regulations to ban photoshopped images of women, the streamlining of non-gendered school uniforms and gender pay audits for corporations.

""Gender stereotypes are really, really harmful both for boys and for girls, "" Legena said.

""If you grow up thinking that men and women have certain set roles and that men have freedom and women are constrained by their bodies or by their opportunity, it is not really a surprise to me that in the political world or the corporate world or other places, ambitious women are viewed negatively and instead of being embraced or rewarded and that girls are looking at that and not putting themselves out there for that.""

There's a concerted push to change advertising rules. France has just passed a law making it illegal to photoshop commercial images without disclosure and a fortnight ago, one of the world's most influential photo agencies, Getty, banned doctored stock images.

""The girls talk a lot in the report about this emphasis on bodies and on image over their abilities and their character,"" Legena explains. ""So there is this kind of push to say, 'Why are we tolerating sexist advertising or excessive photoshopping of girls?' So they are growing up with really unhealthy stereotypes, stereotypes which are reinforcing a negative view of what boys and girls can be and who they are.""

Empresarios le piden a Trump permanecer en el TLCAN

La Cámara de Comercio estadounidense acusó el martes al Gobierno en Washington de intentar sabotear las discusiones con ""propuestas venenosas"".

Las conversaciones sobre el TLCAN podrían estancarse por las agresivas demandas de Estados Unidos de elevar abruptamente los requerimientos de origen local para componentes de autos y autopartes, según expertos comerciales.

Por su parte, el secretario de Comercio de Estados Unidos, Wilbur Ross, uno de los máximos asesores de Trump, desestimó que el final del TLCAN sea necesario. ""No esperamos que pase, no deseamos que pase, no creemos que pase, pero es al menos un posibilidad conceptual mientras avanzamos"", destacó.

Fuentes informadas sobre las propuestas de Estados Unidos dijeron que éstas apuntan a elevar el límite para el contenido de origen norteamericano a 85%, desde el actual 62.5 %, con un requerimiento específico de fabricación estadounidense de 50%.

Don't cry for Messi, Argentina. Cry instead for every other football player in the world who is not Lionel Messi, nor will ever be fit to tie the laces on his football boots.

Argentina just beat Ecuador 3-1 in a FIFA World Cup qualifier which they simply had to win. Lose, and they would have finished sixth on the table. This would have been a disaster for the two-time World Cup winners, as only the top four South American nations qualify, while the fifth faces a play-off.

But Argentina got there, and Messi was most of the reason why.

Things started awfully for the Argentines in the Ecuadorian capital Quito. They were behind a goal after just one minute. But Messi, who has been named world's best player a record five times, showed why.

This was just a gorgeous move. The set-up, the pass, the finish. No booming strike required. Just sheer artistry with the ball.

The second showed a different side of the maestro. Here he displayed the positioning and finishing of a striker. Boom! 2-0.

The third? OH, GET OUT OF HERE. He did a bit of both of the above, didn't he. Brilliant lead-up work, brilliant finish, and all of it thanks to one man. Himself.

So this is how things finished in South America after the last round of matches, which were all played concurrently.

Chile slumped from third to sixth after losing 3-0 in their final match to Brazil. This is quite the shock, as they won the last two Copa Americas.

Meanwhile Colombia qualified after drawing 1-1 with Peru. Peru's late strike after being 1-0 down not only relegated Chile to sixth, but means they will play New Zealand in a playoff series for a spot at the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia.

Meanwhile in an absolute sensation, the U.S.A. has missed out on qualifying for Russia due to an almost unimaginably unlikely series of circumstances.

Below is the table BEFORE Wednesday's games.

To miss World Cup qualification, the U.S.A. had to lose to the bottom-of-the-table Trinidad and Tobago. Meanwhile Honduras had to upset ladder-leaders Mexico and Panama had to beat second-placed Costa Rica.

In other words, each of the bottom three teams had to win their respective matches against the top three. This all happened. No one can quite believe it, but it did. Here's the UPDATED table.

By finishing fourth, Honduras earn the right to play Australia's Socceroos in a two leg elimination series.","World's Best Player Lionel Messi Shows Exactly Why, And Oh Wow",http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/10/10/worlds-best-player-lionel-messi-shows-exactly-why-and-oh-wow_a_23239364/

According to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, 11 people died in just one of the fires, making it the sixth deadliest fire in state history.

In Sonoma County, 560 people were still unaccounted for as of Wednesday morning, though that eye-popping figure is likely in part a result of difficulty communicating in the fire-scarred area.

Nearby Mendocino County has also been hit particularly hard, with entire ranches burned to the ground.

“I feel so bad. I want to be donating and not donated to. I feel like I’m stealing, you know?” one woman in Mendocino County told The Mercury News. “If we get to go back to our home, we are going to set up a tent city in the yard because a lot of people will have no place to go back to.”

“Redwood Valley is just gone,” she added.

Some 50,000 people have evacuated so far, and that number could very well rise. Officials fear strong winds Wednesday night and Thursday morning, paired with low humidity, could spread the fires even farther.

In light of the ongoing disaster, here’s how you can help.

If you live in or near the affected region:

California Airbnb hosts can sign up here to offer free housing to evacuees and relief workers.

If you live in or near Sonoma and are willing to volunteer, you can register to do so at the Sonoma Community Center, which is open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.

Those in or near Napa willing to volunteer are being asked to sign up and create a profile with the Center for Volunteer and Nonprofit Leadership.

You could also foster an animal. Hundreds of pets have been evacuated from animal shelters in the affected region, leading to crowded facilities in the safe areas they’ve been evacuated to. Check with your local animal rescue facility ― NBC Bay Area has a great list here ― to see how you can help.

If you’re in the region of the Tubbs Fire (including Lake, Sonoma and Mendocino counties), join the Tubbs Fire Facebook Group, where people are coordinating requests and offers for help.

If you live farther away, or would prefer to donate money:

Donate to the Sonoma County Resilience Fund. The fund is overseen by the Community Foundation of Sonoma County and pledges to “focus on the mid- to long-term tasks of recovery and rebuilding, which will include basic needs as well as longer term economic, health and social supports.”

Donations can also be made to the Napa Valley Community Disaster Relief Fund.

From April 1, 2019 the plans will see private health insurance companies able to offer people between the ages of 18 and 29 access to reduced private hospital cover as well as premium discounts of up to two percent for each year a person is aged under 30 -- up to a maximum of 10 percent for 18-25-year-olds.

#BREAKING Young Australians to be targeted in the biggest overhaul of private health insurance in decades #auspolhttps://t.co/mY6H0cSqNA — Jane Norman (@janeenorman) October 12, 2017

Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said in a statement on Thursday that the reforms will make private health insurance ""simpler and more affordable"" for Australians and encouraged young people to consider looking into private cover.

""We know that every dollar matters to Australian families and these reforms will get better value for families and make policies easier to understand,"" he said.

""We are encouraging younger Australians to take up private health insurance by allowing insurers to discount hospital insurance premiums for 18- to 29-year-olds by up to 10 per cent.

""People with hospital insurance that does not offer full cover for mental health treatment will be able to upgrade their cover and access mental health services without a waiting period on a once-off basis.""

I know the gov thinks the 10% private health insurance discount for young people is great but basic cover is still approx $800p/a — queen ruthless (@makomoris) October 12, 2017

When it comes to mental health, the changes will also see the removal of ""Benefit Limitation Periods"", which currently see Australians only entitled to restricted benefits for a particular condition or treatment for a set period of time.

Additionally, the shake-up will prevent insurance companies applying limits for patients on the number of mental health treatments that they can access.

Plan seems to be 'how can we sucker young people who don't need private health insurance into buying private health insurance'. https://t.co/zYJe4xQHTz — Andrew Sykes (@Interlime) October 12, 2017

The major reforms come as part of a package of 14 measures all designed at enhancing Australia's private health insurance standards, which also includes the categorisation of different cover types, increases to maximum excess levels and the removal of natural therapy coverage.

""The Turnbull Government is committed to private health insurance and we're committed to supporting the 13 million Australians that have taken out cover,"" Hunt said in the statement.

""We know that many people would like to be able to select a higher excess in exchange for lower premiums. That's why we will increase the maximum excess consumers can choose under their health insurance policies for the first time since 2001.

""And we know that many people find private health insurance confusing. We will act to simplify private health insurance by requiring insurers to categorise products as gold/silver/bronze/basic, and use standardised definitions for treatments to make it clear what is and isn't covered in their policies.""

The changes also follow the sixteenth annual private health insurance price hike that came in April this year, which had young people all around the country reconsidering taking up cover at all.In that increase, private health insurance went up by an average of 4.84 per cent with many Australians' individual policies rising by as much as 10 or even 12 per cent.

At the time, one in five 18 to 24-year-olds considered giving up their private health insurance, while a quarter of 25 to 34 and a third of 35-44 year-olds said that if their premiums reached an average of $3,000 a year they'd walk.",Young People Will Pay Less In Major Private Health Insurance Shake-Up,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/10/12/young-people-will-pay-less-in-major-private-health-insurance-shake-up_a_23240805/

""I said Dane has big shoes to fill, they're not actually big shoes, they're metaphorically big shoes.","OTTAWA — The federal Conservative candidate vying for Rona Ambrose's former seat once tried to recruit enough members to incorporate a Canadian chapter of the National Rifle Association.

Dane Lloyd, who is a 26-year-old candidate running in the Sturgeon River-Parkland byelection, started a Libertarianism-inspired Facebook group in 2009 with the intention to turn it into a ""big movement.""

""Libertarianism and the right to bear arms are synonymous since the freedoms of Libertarianism are guaranteed by a well armed citizenry,"" the then-18-year-old wrote.

Screengrab of a post from 2009.

In a statement to HuffPost Canada on Wednesday, Lloyd commented on the post and said his stance on firearms has since changed:

That statement does not reflect my current view and policy on firearm ownership in Canada. My policy on firearms is a commitment to cost-effective gun control programs designed to keep guns out of the hands of criminals while respecting the rights of law-abiding Canadians to own and use firearms responsibly, and includes measures like safe storage provisions, firearms safety training, and mandatory minimums for criminal use of firearms.

Lloyd, who self-describes his political views as ""very Conservative,"" beat out former party leadership contender Rick Peterson, local party organizer Jamie Mozeson, and ex-political staffer Luke Inberg for the Tory nomination.

Ambrose, the party's former interim leader, had endorsed Mozeson.

Past support for memorializing Confederate figure

In 2015, two years after Lloyd graduated from Trinity Western University, he shared his thoughts on a Russia Today story suggesting that he no qualms about memorializing the legacy of the U.S. Confederacy, as old social media posts suggest.

The story reported on Baltimore officials mulling a plan to remove Confederate general Robert E. Lee's name from a city park.

""This would be a real shame to see go through,"" the post on an account associated with Lloyd's name reads. He said the former Confederate general's ""actions at the end of the war did much to heal and unite a deeply divided nation.""

Baltimore eventually introduced legislation to rename the city park to Lake Roland.

The timing of the post preceded renewed public pressure to rename monuments linked to U.S. Confederate figures after a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va. this summer.

In another post, this time from 2014, Lloyd shared a link to a fundraising campaign by The Rebel to fight ""anti-Christian bigots on Nanaimo city council.""

""It just goes to show that when people actually stand up to intolerant anti-Christian rhetoric, common sense and justice will prevail,"" reads the post.

The Vancouver Island municipality stirred some controversy at the time for pulling a permit for the Leadership telecast, a so-called Christian conference, days before the event. One city councillor had an issue with the event sponsor's link to anti-gay views and ""support of the traditional family.""

Reaction to the event's cancellation was mixed: former NDP MP Jean Crowder and the Vancouver Island Rainbow Association praised council's decision, while right-wing pundit Ezra Levant blasted it, and one letter to the editor called it ""over-the-top panic.""

Lloyd did not respond to a request for comment for the views he expressed in these two posts.

Use of ' Feminazi' raises eyebrows

The Conservative candidate made headlines recently for another Facebook comment he made in 2009 in response to the University of Guelph's decision to shutter its women studies program.

""I'll probably get assassinated by the Feminazi's for saying that cutting this program is a good thing, saves a lot of wasted money on a useless program,"" he wrote. ""Way to go Guelph way to be politically incorrect.""

Sturgeon River-Parkland Conservative candidate stands next to a campaign sign.

Lloyd explained himself to CTV News last week, saying: ""Sometimes you get in to emotionally charged debates and you say things that you regret and I would say that would not be a term I would use today.""

He told the broadcaster he didn't think an old social media post would affect his campaign.

Despite Lloyd being a new public figure, he has earned some political experience working under former cabinet ministers Ed Fast and Jason Kenney.

He is also a Canadian Armed Forces reservist and most recently worked as a political staffer for St. Albert—Edmonton MP Michael Cooper.

Scheer jokes about metaphorical shoes

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer joined Lloyd at an event in Stony Plain, Alta. on Tuesday to kick off his campaign.

Lloyd addressed a crowd of supporters by drawing parallels between himself and the Tory leader, noting how both men are ""strong Conservatives."" ​​​​​

""He's got big shoes to fill coming in after Rona Ambrose, she was a great member of Parliament,"" Scheer said.

After the crowd applauded his tribute to his predecessor, Scheer joked with supporters. ""I said Dane has big shoes to fill, they're not actually big shoes, they're metaphorically big shoes. I think he probably wears a few sizes bigger than Rona did.""

Sturgeon River-Parkland voters will head to the polls on Oct. 23.

Österreich klagt vor dem EuGH gegen die deutsche Pkw-Maut

Die Ungleich-Behandlung von Ausländern sei nicht mit EU-Recht vereinbar

Im Streit um die deutsche Pkw-Maut wird Österreich eine Klage vor dem Europäischen Gerichtshof (EuGH) einbringen. Die geplante Einführung der Maut sei diskriminierend, begründete Verkehrsminister Jörg Leichtfried (SPÖ) am Donnerstag in Wien den Schritt. ""Das ist eine reine Ausländer-Maut"", sagte der Minister.

Die EU-Kommission habe sich davor gedrückt, Deutschland die Stirn zu bieten. Österreich gehe nun voran, sagte Leichtfried. Ein von der Regierung in Auftrag gegebenes Rechtsgutachten bescheinigt gute Aussichten auf einen Erfolg vor Gericht.

Die Klage hat keine aufschiebende Wirkung für die für 2019 geplante Einführung der Maut. Dies müsste eigens beantragt und vor Gericht bewilligt werden.

Österreich ist einer der schärfsten Kritiker der deutschen Maut. Aus Sicht der Regierung in Wien spricht nichts grundsätzlich gegen die Einführung eines Maut-Systems - auch Österreich selbst verfahre so.

Dass am Ende nur Ausländer zahlten, sei aber nicht mit den Grundwerten der EU vereinbar, hatte Leichtfried in der Vergangenheit mehrfach betont. ""Ich kämpfe auch für eine Europäische Union, die eine Solidargemeinschaft ist"", so Leichtfried.

Dobrindt mntzt über ""Ösi-Maut-Maulerei""

Die Ankündigung der Klage fällt in Österreich in das Wahlkampffinale. Die Alpenrepublik wählt am Sonntag ein neues Parlament.

Ende März hatte der Bundesrat in Berlin trotz erheblicher Kritik den Weg für die Einführung einer Pkw-Maut auf deutschen Autobahnen und Bundesstraßen freigemacht und ein dafür vom Bundestag beschlossenes Gesetzespaket passieren lassen.

Eigentlich war die Maut schon 2015 beschlossen worden. Da Brüssel kurz darauf ein Verfahren wegen der Verletzung von EU-Recht gegen Deutschland eröffnete, wurden die Gesetze aber bisher nicht umgesetzt.

Die EU ließ ihre Einwände fallen, nachdem Bundesverkehrsminister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) das Modell an einigen Stellen geändert hatte. So werden mehr Kurzzeit-Tarife für Fahrer aus dem Ausland angeboten.

Die Maut gilt als Prestigeprojekt der CSU. Dobrindt, der laut Leichtfried im Vorfeld über die Klage aus Wien informiert wurde, wies Vorwürfe Österreichs mehrfach als ""Ösi-Maut-Maulerei"" zurück.

Das Thema Maut könnte aber auch innerhalb Deutschlands noch zu einem Streitpunkt bei Koalitionsverhandlungen werden. Die Grünen und die FDP sind dagegen, die Linken und die AfD ebenso.

Die SPD will die Lkw-Maut nicht auf Fahrzeuge unter 7,5 Tonnen ausdehnen, da dies vor allem Handwerksbetriebe belasten würde.

I kept in regular contact with my parents who would give me updates on his health.
Having to receive verbal abuse and witness explosive episodes caused by a member of my own family because of mental ill health has been one of the most soul destroying and heart breaking things I've ever experienced.
Thanks to some wonderful support from the charity Mind, my brother is living mostly independently and is striving every day for good mental health.
But it fills my heart with so much hope when I see the huge difference in people's attitudes towards mental health over the last nine years and I'm confident that talking and learning will continue to help break the stigma and support all those affected by mental health (which I hope you've realised by reading to the end of this post, is everyone).","A lot of people, who know me well, will know that I have a terrible memory. I forget why I came upstairs; I forget what I was supposed to buy in the supermarket; I write shopping lists so I don't forget the things I was supposed to buy in the supermarket, and then I forget the list.

Some things, though, I will never forget: My first Oasis gig; Seeing the Sydney Opera House in real life; The time I received a phone call from my dad to tell me ""Your brother's not well. He's had a breakdown"".

That phone call was almost nine years ago.

Out of respect for my brother's privacy, I will not go into the details of what the catalyst was for his rapid slide into mental ill health, but just like I'm sure is the case with many others, our family did not see this coming - it was like a baseball bat had swung around and hit us right in the stomach.

""He's been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder"", was the next big update from my parents. It was the first time a label had been attached to my brother that was something different to the descriptions of him I had grown used to hearing throughout our childhood: ""Life of the party"", ""such a lovely boy"", ""always smiling"". Just like the phone call to break the news - this one is also etched into my memory. Not knowing what 'Bipolar' meant, I concentrated on the 'Disorder' part and said it in my head over and over again, trying not to be scared of the realisation that in having a disorder, someone must therefore be 'disordered'.

I will hold my hands up and confess that prior to my brother becoming unwell, my knowledge of mental ill health was largely based on films and the gossip pages of trashy magazines; i.e. not real life.

As soon as my brother had a diagnosis, I rushed to the library and started reading. I struggled to know how to offer help, so I settled for the next best thing - understanding. I wanted to learn about his condition. I wanted to know everything. This person had grown up with me, and I had looked up to him as a perfect model of everything I wanted to be ever since I can remember. I wanted back the brother I knew. In a matter of weeks he had turned into a stranger, a shell of the person I knew so well. Someone I used to spend hours talking to non-stop and now I couldn't even think of two words to say to him.

Looking back, I realise that I must've been in a state of shock for a long time. To this day, I am ashamed and angry with myself for how I dealt with the news. Not knowing what to do, I backed away entirely, for fear of saying the wrong thing or making matters worse, but days of non-communication turned into weeks, and weeks turned into months. I kept in regular contact with my parents who would give me updates on his health. Every day was a guessing game as to how he would feel and what he might be capable of doing: some days progress would mean getting dressed. Other days he would be able to go out and see friends. The phrase, 'taking each day as it comes' had taken on a whole new meaning.

Over these last nine years, my brother's illness has been like a mental health rollercoaster - except there are no comedy photos to take home on a key ring, just emotional scars carried by him, and everyone surrounding him; bitter memories of painful episodes: verbal abuse, bouts of mania, paranoia, anxiety and depression.

Having to receive verbal abuse and witness explosive episodes caused by a member of my own family because of mental ill health has been one of the most soul destroying and heart breaking things I've ever experienced. There's been times when I've been prepared to cut out my own brother because of his condition, but my understanding of it has helped me to realise that running away from someone you love who needs help can never be a positive move, no matter how hard that road is - you have to travel it together. I will carry my brother on my back forever, if that's what he needs.

Thanks to some wonderful support from the charity Mind, my brother is living mostly independently and is striving every day for good mental health. A more recent diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder sparked more trips to the library for me, but the more I read, the more I realise the accuracy of his diagnosis and have been working hard to support him in every way I can. With ageing parents and a daughter of my own to care for, I know that the road ahead will continue to be hard, as he will gradually move from being my parents' responsibility to being mine. But it fills my heart with so much hope when I see the huge difference in people's attitudes towards mental health over the last nine years and I'm confident that talking and learning will continue to help break the stigma and support all those affected by mental health (which I hope you've realised by reading to the end of this post, is everyone).

I'm really writing this so that I can share my story and open up the comments to people who may have previously been too afraid to say ""I've been there too"" ""I'm there now"" or, simply in the hope that people click the 'share' button to spread the awareness, and help erase the stigma.",Loving Someone With Mental Ill Health,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/jo-caley/he-aint-heavy-hes-my-brot_1_b_18231032.html?utm_hp_ref=uk

Da Ratten nur wenige hundert Gramm wiegen, explodieren die Minen nicht und können von Experten entschärft werden

Wie die Ratten trainiert werden und wie sie die Minen aufspüren, seht ihr oben im Video

Ratten stehen für Dreck und lösen bei den meisten Menschen Ekel aus. Diese Ratten dürften jedoch das Image ihrer Artgenossen deutlich aufwerten. Denn sie retten tausenden Menschen das Leben - indem sie Landminen in Afrika und Asien entschärfen.

Trainiert für die Minensuche werden die Tiere in Tansania von der Non-Profit Organisation “APOPO“. Die Tiere werden auch “Hero Rats“ genannt. Mithilfe ihres außerordentlich guten Geruchsinns können die Ratten Landminen aufspüren.

Die Ratten retten das Leben von Tausenden

Das tun sie in Mosambik Angola, Kambodscha und bald auch in Zimbabwe. Dort werden jedes Jahr tausende Menschen von Landminen getötet oder schwer verletzt.

Viele Dörfer können das umliegende Land nicht für die Landwirtschaft nutzen, weil es vermint ist. Durch die Verminung von Straßen sind viele Menschen außerdem von Wasserquellen abgeschnitten. Die Ratten werden darauf trainiert, den Sprengstoff in den Minen aufzuspüren. Die Minen können dann entschärft werden.

Die Ratten sind zu leicht, um eine Explosion auszulösen

Eine Ratte benötigt eine halbe Stunde, um ein Feld in der Größe eines Tennisplatzes auf Minen abzusuchen. Mit einem Metalldetektor würde man für die gleiche Fläche vier Tage brauchen, um den Bereich auf Minen abzusuchen. Da die Ratten so leicht sind, explodieren die Minen nicht, wenn sie die Tiere entdecken.

Bis heute hat die Organisation in sechs Ländern über 21 Millionen Quadratmeter Land von Minen befreit und für sicher erklärt.

Dabei konnten die Mitarbeiter 100.000 Landminen zerstören und so 900.000 Menschen helfen, ihr Land wieder produktiv zu nutzen. Übrigens können die Tiere auch am Geruch feststellen, ob ein Mensch an Tuberkolose erkrankt ist.

En cette Journée des Filles, on ne peut les oublier ; on ne peut les abandonner à leur sort.","Depuis 2012, par décret de l'ONU, le 11 octobre de chaque année célèbre la Journée des Filles. Cette journée est consacrée à la prise de conscience que dans le monde, les filles devraient avoir les mêmes droits que les garçons tant au niveau de l'accès de l'éducation qu'au niveau du travail; les filles sont aussi davantage exposées aux violences de tout ordre que les garçons.

En outre, dans leur innocence de fillettes, elles font face, souvent sans comprendre, aux traditions familiales qui les privent de leur droit à être protégées en tant qu'enfants.

Les fillettes sont de réelles ""monnaies d'échange""

Monnaies d'échange pour échapper à une pauvreté insupportable avec des traditions qui autorisent, voire qui favorisent les mariages forcés, les filles doivent accepter un mari souvent bien plus âgé qu'elles. Pas encore sorties de l'enfance, elles doivent obéir à leurs parents et sont donc mariées de force sans souvent comprendre ce qui leur arrive. Elles quittent un environnement familier pour affronter, seules, désarmées, les impératifs d'un mariage qui leur détruisent le corps et l'esprit. On ne tient évidemment pas compte de leur souffrance, des séquelles qu'engendrent ces mariages. Si rien n'est mis en place, elles risquent également de reproduire le même schéma auprès de leurs propres filles des années plus tard.

On se doute bien que le mariage ne protège même pas les filles, les femmes: elles doivent souvent affronter non seulement une vie d'humiliations, de privations, mais aussi de périls quotidiens. Leur vie est en danger de diverses manières. En effet, il existe encore des hommes qui tuent leur femme par cupidité. Le décès de leur épouse leur permet en effet de pouvoir se remarier et donc, d'obtenir une nouvelle dot. En Inde, par exemple, en 2013, une femme par heure est assassinée ou brûlée vive par leur mari ou leur belle-famille. (""En Inde, une femme meurt toutes les heures à cause de la dot"",www.lemonde.fr, 2013/09/03.) Pourtant, interdite par la loi, la dot continue à tuer des filles, des femmes. Selon le Bureau national des crimes (National Crime Register Bureau), l'année 2014 a vu à elle seule 8455 décès liés à la dot, soit 30 femmes qui meurent tous les jours... (Nayagam, C.: ""La dot, le côté 'sombre' du mariage indien"", ACTU INDE (Actualité et informations sur l'Inde et l'Asie du Sud) dans INDES Magazine, novembre-décembre 2015 – DOSSIER ""Mariage indien"".)

Crimes d'honneur ou crimes d'horreur?

Ainsi, de par le monde, des femmes sont châtiées parce qu'elles ont refusé d'obéir à leur famille qui leur impose un époux dont elles ne veulent pas, parce qu'elles veulent divorcer, parce qu'elles ont agi de manière inadéquate (sortir seule de la maison, parler à quelqu'un, regarder trop longtemps à la fenêtre, préparer un repas qui ne convient pas, etc.), parce qu'elles ont été violées, parce qu'un membre de la famille a accompli un acte qui a déplu... Ces meurtres sont qualifiés de crimes d'honneur. En effet, les familles, les hommes invoquent leur honneur pour perpétrer l'indicible. Aucun sentiment de culpabilité pour accomplir leurs horribles méfaits: mutilations, immolations par le feu, jets d'acide, lacérations, amputations, lapidations... En d'autres termes, ces femmes sont condamnées à mourir dans d'atroces souffrances. (Gold, A. : La réussite au féminin, Editions Vitamines, Bruxelles, p.187.)

Les crimes d'honneur s'exportent. Avec les mouvements migratoires, en Europe, les faits qui ressemblent étrangement aux pratiques évoquées ci-dessus se multiplient. Des pères, des mères, des frères tuent leur parente parce qu'elle refuse un mariage forcé. Des jeunes filles scolarisées dans les pays de l'Union européenne sont parfois kidnappées et emmenées de force à l'étranger pour être unies à l'homme choisi par la famille. On s'arrange alors pour qu'elles n'aient aucun moyen de revenir. En 2001, dans son film ""Chaos"", la cinéaste Coline Serreau abordait déjà le problème en démontrant l'indifférence de notre société face à la souffrance des filles issues de l'immigration qui tentent d'échapper à l'autorité familiale.

Pour accéder à la liberté que leur offrent les démocraties dans lesquelles elles vivent, ces femmes doivent parfois briser définitivement les chaînes qui les relient à leur famille. S'éloigner à jamais de ses racines est une décision déchirante. Pourtant, certaines de ces femmes réussissent à faire comprendre à leur entourage ce qu'elles attendent de l'existence et font des carrières professionnelles et/ou fondent une famille sans respecter nécessairement les traditions inculquées pendant l'enfance. (Gold, A. : La réussite au féminin, Editions Vitamines, Bruxelles, p.189.)

Se révolter en sari rose

Partout dans le monde, des révoltes de femmes, même discrètes, grondent.

Sampat Pal, mariée de force à douze ans dans un village en Inde, a créé en 2006 dans l'Etat d'Uttar Pradesh, au nord-est du pays, un groupe de femmes vêtues de saris roses, le Gulabi Gang, qui proteste quand une fillette ou une femme est mariée de force ou quand une femme subit des violences. Dans Moi, Sampat Pal, chef de gang en sari rose (Oh ! Editions, Paris, 2008, p.107), elle écrit : ""Ces dernières années, le gouvernement nous a bombardées de slogans réaffirmant le droit des femmes à l'éducation, aux choix professionnels, au divorce. Mais les lois qui sont censées les protéger sont inapplicables. Dans les faits, dès qu'une femme essaie de sortir du carcan qu'on lui a imposé, dès qu'elle tente de franchir des barrières, on remet en cause sa personnalité, on s'attaque à sa réputation, on la catalogue comme fille perdue. A la campagne, si une femme décide de ne plus se couvrir la tête avec son sari, si elle adresse la parole à des hommes autres que son mari, elle est taxée d'indécence. Si une femme tombe amoureuse, c'est de sa faute. Si elle décide de vivre avec le partenaire qu'elle a choisi, on dit qu'elle s'est enfuie de chez elle. Si sa famille la retrouve, elle se fait tuer. [...] Si une femme décide de revenir chez elle, ses parents la jetteront dehors.""

Sampat Pal explique donc qu'en toutes circonstances, l'homme n'est jamais ""puni"": l'unique coupable est la fille qui risque la mort ou d'être chassée sans aucune ressource, ce qui revient souvent à la même chose.

Protéger les filles: notre devoir, notre force d'aimer

Dans ce contexte, on ne répétera jamais assez l'importance de l'éducation dans ces pays où on empêche les filles de s'instruire. Car les filles ont droit à l'école, à l'université.

Si changer les mentalités est un processus qui prend du temps, si les vieilles traditions ""ont la dent dure"", on ne peut pas abandonner. Et sans cesse, dans le monde – et chez nous aussi –, la vigilance doit toujours rester de mise pour éviter les dérives.

Accueillons donc ces femmes qui viennent dans notre Europe et qui portent en elles des souffrances « invisibles ». Protégeons leur pudeur car elles ont fréquemment connu, avec le mariage, un « viol institutionnalisé » dans leur village, dans le pays d'où elles viennent. Elles ont souvent dû abandonner leurs enfants. Rejetées par leur famille, par leur village, par les rumeurs du passé qui les poursuivront à jamais, elles ne doivent leur salut qu'à notre compréhension et notre humanité.

En cette Journée des Filles, on ne peut les oublier ; on ne peut les abandonner à leur sort. Cette responsabilité s'apparente aussi à notre force d'aimer.

Dieser berühmte Satz von Franz Josef Strauß klang am Sonntag, den 24. September um 18.01 Uhr vielen in der Union in den Ohren. Die Union sollte das zweitschlechteste Ergebnis aller Zeiten erhalten, während sich die AfD als drittstärkste Kraft im Bundestag zum eigentlichen Wahlsieger erklärte.

Wenige hätten damit gerechnet, dass dem ""Schlafwahlkampf"" ein derart böses Erwachen folgen würde: keine eindeutige Koalitionsmehrheit, historischer Absturz der Volksparteien, die populistischen Neurechten als drittstärkste Kraft.

Klar ist: Nach dieser Wahl ist nichts wie zuvor. Das gilt trotz des vierten Wahlsieges in Folge (!) insbesondere für die Union: nach einem Verlust von über acht Prozentpunkten ist ""business as usual"" keine Option. Umso lauter werden die Rufe nach Veränderung.

Das ""Ob"" ist also nicht die Frage - entscheidend bleibt das ""Wie"": schon jetzt mehren sich die Stimmen, die die Geißel der Union in der AfD, als Ergebnis einer ""misslungenen"" Flüchtlingspolitik und dem Liberalismus der Bundeskanzlerin, sehen. Nur ein konservativer Rechtsruck könne die Union wieder in höhere Gefilde und die AfD ins politische Nirvana befördern.

Verführerisch, wie diese Auffassung angesichts des Wahlergebnisses scheint, sollte man in der Debatte jedoch all die Emotionen und voreiligen Gedankenspiele beiseitelassen. Denn nüchtern betrachtet wirkt diese Schlussfolgerung nicht nur falsch, sondern tatsächlich brandgefährlich - sie riskiert langfristig genau das Gegenteil von dem zu erreichen, was sie sich erhofft.

Irrglaube 1: Merkel hat das sicherheitspolitische Profil der Union zunichtegemacht

Widmen wir uns zunächst dem populärsten in konservativen Unionskreisen: Die Bundeskanzlerin ist für die Verluste ihrer Partei verantwortlich.

Leider übersehen die Merkel-Kritiker dabei, dass die Bundeskanzlerin einen erheblichen Anteil daran hatte, dass sich die Union den Wahlsieg sicherte: der ""Merkelfaktor"" lag hinter der Wahlentscheidung von sage und schreibe 38% der Unionswähler - bei keiner anderen Partei spielte der Spitzenkandidat eine so entscheidende Rolle.

Ebenso wird der Union - mehr als jeder anderen Partei - die größte Kompetenz dabei zugestanden, die Migrationskrise zu managen: der Vorsprung auf die zweitplatzierte SPD ist dabei nahezu doppelt so groß.

Auch in der Terrorismus- und Kriminalitätsbekämpfung liegt die Union in den Augen der Wähler sehr weit vorne. Dass Merkels Flüchtlingspolitik das sicherheitspolitische Profil der CDU schlagartig zunichtegemacht hat, ist ergo schlicht falsch.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Die AfD bekommt in den nächsten Jahren 400 Millionen Euro vom Staat

Irrglaube 2: Die Flüchtlingspolitik der Kanzlerin ist schuld am Aufstieg der AfD



Zwar lässt es sich kaum leugnen, dass die Flüchtlingskrise einen erheblichen Anteil am Wandel der Parteienlandschaft hatte. Trotzdem es ist ein fataler Irrglaube, hierin den einzigen Faktor hinter dem Aufstieg der AfD zu vermuten - denn wer die Flüchtlingspolitik zu bemängeln hatte, hatte eine echte Alternative: die FDP.

Das Wahlergebnis deutet darauf hin, dass viele enttäuschte Unionswähler diese Initiative ergriffen. Es darf nicht vergessen werden, dass die Union mehr Stimmen an die Liberalen, als die AfD verloren hat. Das ist nicht Makulatur.

In der Wahl zwischen Liberalen und Nationalisten lag ein gewichtiger Unterschied, den die Union beim Umgang mit der AfD beachten muss: denn während die FDP unter Lindner die Flüchtlingspolitik stets mit Blick auf die Wiederherstellung von Recht und Kontrolle, ergo Sicherheit, argumentierte, ging die AfD mit ihren Thesen zur drohenden ""Überfremdung"" und ""islamischen Invasion"" weiter.

Und hierfür wurde sie von vielen gewählt: ganze 95% der AfD-Wähler fürchten einen Verlust der deutschen Kultur, 92% geht der Einfluss des Islams zu weit. Derlei Sorgen über Kriminalität, Terrorismus und Überfremdung suggerieren, dass die fundamentale Unzufriedenheit der AfD-Wähler der Flüchtlingskrise vorausging - sie hat sie lediglich verschärft.

Irrglaube 3: Die AfD ist ein Sammelbecken enttäuschter Unionswähler

""Die AfD gewinnt, was die CDU verloren hat."" Diese Schlussfolgerung könnte die These stützen, dass es sich bei den AfD-Wählern mehrheitlich um einen konservativen Kern handle, den die Union unter Merkel aufgegeben habe - nicht zuletzt angesichts der 60%, die ""Enttäuschung"" als Grund für ihr Kreuz hinter der AfD angaben.

Tatsächlich ergibt eine nähere Betrachtung jedoch ein entschieden anderes Bild: selbst wenn man 2013 miteinrechnet, hat die Union im Laufe dieses Jahrzehnts nicht mehr als 2% an die AfD verloren.

Auch eine schleichende Abwanderung konservativer Wähler, die CDU und CSU schon vor Jahren den Rücken kehrten und nun aus dem Nichtwählermilieu zur AfD stoßen, wird wohl nur marginal ausgefallen und durch das Hinzustoßen neuer Wählergruppen kompensiert sein.

Das bedeutet jedoch im Umkehrschluss, dass gut 9-10% der AfD-Wähler keine abtrünnigen Christdemokraten oder Christsozialen sind, die mittels einer Rückkehr zu angestammten bürgerlichen Werten wieder in den Schoß der Union zurückkehren würden.

Wie fehlgeleitet die Wahrnehmung der AfD als konservativem Zufluchtsort ist, wird deutlich, wenn man die Wählerschaft der Nationalisten unter die Lupe nimmt: denn tatsächlich hat die AfD diesen September im selben Maße dem linken Lager - SPD, Linke und Grüne - Stimmen abgejagt wie der Union: knapp eine Million. Hinzu kommen satte 1,47 Millionen Stimmen aus dem Nichtwählermilieu.

Wie erklärt sich diese breite Unterstützerbasis? In Anbetracht besagter 60% ist die Sachlage eindeutig: die AfD hat eine Koalition der Unzufriedenen zusammengerauft, bei denen die ""konservative Wertopposition"" nur einen vergleichsweise geringen Teil darstellt.

Die Enttäuschung der AfD-Wähler richtet sich nicht gegen eine ""sozialdemokratisierte Union"", sondern die gesamte politische Führungsriege der Bundesrepublik. Mit anderen Worten: It's The System Not The Flüchtlinge, Stupid!

Der Erfolg der AfD liegt nicht einfach in ihrer Opposition zur Flüchtlingsaufnahme, sondern ihrer Ablehnung des ""Systems"" - und für viele galt die Flüchtlingskrise als Symbol für ein im Kern dysfunktionales System. Hinzu kommt eine starke Prise nationalistische Überfremdungsangst, die jedoch nicht gleichbedeutend ist mit bürgerlichem Konservatismus.

Wenngleich nicht alle diese Wähler für die Union unerreichbar sind, gehören sie nicht zu ihrer Stammklientel und werden mit einer Rückkehr zu ""konservativen Werten"" wohl nicht bezirzt.

Irrglaube 4: Alles neu macht der Rechtsruck

Nicht wenige vertreten die Ansicht, die ""rechte Flanke"" zu schließen, sei der Schlüssel zum Erfolg für die Union und zur Entzauberung der AfD. Und genau in dieser Schlussfolgerung liegt die Krux. Was die AfD ihren Wählern bietet, sind nicht schlüssige Konzepte, sondern eine Möglichkeit, Unmut über eine Politikerklasse zu äußern, die sie als korrupt und selbstsüchtig betrachten.

Dieses Misstrauen ist so tief verankert, dass es sehr unwahrscheinlich ist, dass ein Großteil der AfD-Wähler den Weg zu den demokratischen Parteien zurückfindet, nur weil diese Sprache und Maßnahmenkatalog der Nationalisten zu imitieren suchen.

Sie werden es den Politikern schlicht nicht abnehmen - und sich eher in ihrer Entscheidung für die AfD bestärkt fühlen. Im Gegenzug könnte sich die Mitte, welche der Union die letzten Wahlsiege gesichert hat, von dieser abwenden.

Nicht zuletzt daher wird der Versuch, die AfD rhetorisch zu übertrumpfen, mit nahezu hundertprozentiger Wahrscheinlichkeit nach hinten losgehen. Denn Fakt ist, dass die Union kein Monopol mehr auf die Themen hat, die den Erfolg von Gauland, Höcke und Konsorten untermauernt - und letztere haben einen entscheidenden Vorteil gegenüber der Union: sie sind nicht durch unausgesprochene Gesetze der Mäßigung und Verantwortung gebunden.

Jede Offerte der Union nach rechts kann sie daher doppelt und dreifach überbieten. Auf diese Weise kann die AfD die Union mittelfristig vor sich hertreiben, ohne an Zustimmung zu verlieren. Wer sich länger mit der Neurechten auseinandergesetzt hat, wird dieses Schema kennen: Der Trick der Populisten ist es, den politischen Gegner dazu zu bringen, rote Linien zu überschreiten.

In einem offenen Schlagabtausch mit der AfD um die rechte ""Pole-Position"" kann die Union nur verlieren. Denn für die AfD gibt es einfach keine roten Linien. Wer die Sprache und Agenda der Populisten übernimmt, stärkt diese nur - oder wird selbst zum Populisten.

Noch immer Zweifel?

Dann genügt nur der Blick nach Großbritannien oder in die USA. Die Länder liefern ein Paradebeispiel für diese Dynamik: dass Großbritannien momentan im Brexitchaos versinkt, beruht darauf, dass sich die Konservativen unter David Cameron auf einen Spießrutenlauf mit Nigel Farages UKIP einließen.

Über mehrere Monate hinweg diktierte die Sorge vor einer Massenabwanderung der Wähler gen UKIP den Kurs der Tories, die immer weiter nach rechts rückten. Dieses Katz-und-Maus-Spiel mündete im berüchtigten, wenig durchdachten EUReferendum, von dem sich Cameron die Besänftigung seiner Parteirechten und der UKIP-Wählerschaft erhoffte.

Stattdessen zerrüttete es den politischen Konsens im Land und hinterließ die populistische Flanke der Konservativen, die mittlerweile unverhohlen UKIP-Parolen propagiert, stärker denn je. In den Vereinigten Staaten rief das permanente Hofieren der Tea Party-Bewegung und der ultrarechten Presse um Fox News durch die Republikaner die Geister, die zum Wahlsieg Donald Trumps führten.

Vielleicht braucht man jedoch auch nicht so weit ins Ausland zu blicken, wenn die CSU schon am eigenen Leib erfahren durfte, wie wenig es hilft, sich Populisten anzubiedern.

Und was heißt das jetzt im Klartext? Vor allem eines: die Union hat durch eine Schließung ihrer ""rechten Flanke"" nur wenig zu gewinnen, wenn sie verlorenen Boden bei der AfD gutmachen will.

Im Gegenteil, sie hat wohl tatsächlich viel mehr zu verlieren, sollte sie sich vom Erfolg der AfD verleiten lassen, eine ""konservative Kehrwende"" einzulegen.

Daraus könnte man nun schließen, dass die Union der ""rechten Mitte"" entsagen sollte. Dass sie AfD-Protestwähler ihrem Schicksal überlassen muss. Das wäre allerdings ebenfalls ein fataler

Trugschluss.

Das Hauptaugenmerk muss darauf liegen, Vertrauen in die Institutionen der Bundesrepublik wiederherzustellen

Einige Abwanderer lassen sich durchaus durch eine inhaltliche Erneuerung zurückgewinnen, indem die CDU ihr marktwirtschaftliches und ordnungspolitisches Profil schärft. Wer jedoch die Protestwähler der AfD wieder in den politischen Mainstream einbinden will, der braucht einen deutlich längeren Atem.

Denn das Hauptaugenmerk muss darauf liegen, Vertrauen in die Institutionen der Bundesrepublik und ihrer Repräsentanten wiederherzustellen. Dies gelingt nicht durch Aktionismus, brachiale ""Obergrenzen""-Rhetorik ohne schlüssige Konzepte, von der Realität abgekoppelte Phantomdebatten über ""verbotenes Schweinefleisch"" und Maßnahmen, die der Lebenswirklichkeit in Deutschland nicht gerecht werden.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: So erklärt der Chefredakteur der ""Leipziger Volkszeitung"" den Wahlerfolg der AfD in Sachsen

Dass die AfD mit ihrem ethnonationalistischen, antipluralistischen Gedankengut und autoritären Gehabe kein Modell für eine reformierte Union darstellen kann, weiß man nach diesem Wahlkampf zur Genüge. Vielmehr geht es doch im Kern darum, die Union zukunftsfähig, volksnah und schlagkräftig zu machen.

Das geht nur mit einer umfassenden strukturellen Reform - und ja, auch einer personellen Erneuerung. Der Kampf um die Wählerstimmen darf jedenfalls nie mit der Aushöhlung oder gar Aufgabe der freiheitsliebenden Prinzipien der Christdemokratie einhergehen. Das sollte auch nach dieser Wahl feststehen.

Speaking on Radio 4′s Today programme, Marcus Dolman said failure to negotiate a trade agreement with the EU would be “worst-case [scenario] all round”.

Since the triggering of Article 50 in March, exporters have benefitted from the drop in the value of the pound which has meant they can sell products outside the UK for less making them more competitive.

But stalled Brexit negotiations and the singling out of the UK on Tuesday by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as the only major economy not to see its growth forecast upgraded, has led to what Chancellor Philip Hammond has called a “cloud of uncertainty” hanging over the country.

Adding to the murky outlook, a damning report by leading investment bank, Rabobank, has warned a hard Conservative plans for a hard Brexit would plunge the UK into immediate recession, cost the economy £400 billion and wipe 18% off GDP growth by 2030.

Research by Rabobank also shows that any form of Brexit – hard, soft or through a new free trade agreement (FTA) – would be detrimental to the economy and British workers.

Under a “no deal” scenario, British workers would be left £11,500 poorer, while an FTA or soft Brexit would see working Britons stomach a £9,500 or £7,500 blow respectively, reports the Press Association.

Hugo Erken, senior economist at Rabobank, said: “There has been extensive economic research into the immediate effects of Brexit, but they have largely focused on trade and investment, whereas implications of the different factors that affect productivity is only marginally or partially addressed.

“By looking at dynamics such as innovation, competition, knowledge and human capital, how they will change and what effects this will have on the structural make-up of the UK and European economy, our research shows that the long-lasting impact of Brexit is likely to be more severe than initially anticipated.”

Rabobank said that even if the UK negotiated a new free trade agreement, like Switzerland’s, it would cost Britain 12.5% of GDP growth by 2030.

A soft Brexit, where the UK remains part of the European internal market but exits the customs union, would result in a 10% hit.

According to the research, a hard Brexit implemented in 2019 without a transition period would result in the UK economy “immediately falling into a two-year recession period”.

Hard Brexit would cause a jump in unemployment from 4.6% in 2018 to 6.2% in 2020, but this would only be temporary and quickly return to “long-term structural unemployment levels”.

For the FTA and the soft Brexit scenario there would also be a recession, Rabobank said, but “milder and much more short-lived”.

If negotiations in Brussels result in a hard Brexit, UK GDP is expected to decline by 2.4% following its departure in 2019.

However, if the UK and EU were to agree on a free trade agreement, GDP would still fall but only by 1.1%, and by just 0.3% in a soft Brexit scenario.

For countries in the euro area, any form of Brexit would see a 2% hit to EU GDP by 2024, the study said, with the Netherlands bearing the brunt because of its closer trade relationship with the UK, accruing losses of around 25 billion euros to 35 billion euros.

Rabobank’s study used macro-econometric modelling to assess the effects of the UK leaving the European Union and all three scenarios were benchmarked against a situation where the UK would continue to be a member.

It's no secret that the president is not a fan of NAFTA, but Wednesday's remarks suggested he's open to the possibility of a bilateral trade deal with Canada.","WASHINGTON — For the first time, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is acknowledging that the North American Free Trade Agreement could be in trouble.

Trudeau wrapped up his visit to Washington on Wednesday by saying that he continues to believe that renegotiating and renewing NAFTA is the best option for all three countries. However, he suggested — repeatedly — that the federal Liberal government is bracing for the worst.

""It is very important and very possible to get a win-win-win ... out of these negotiations,"" Trudeau told a news conference on the roof of the Canadian Embassy.

""So saying, I think it's been clear that circumstances are often challenging, and we have to be ready for anything — and we are.'

""We're taking this very seriously and we're taking the importance of standing up for Canadian jobs and Canadian economic growth very seriously, and that goes (for) every economic engagement we have with the Americans.""

During his earlier visit to the White House, Trudeau listened intently as U.S. President Donald Trump hinted at the possibility of a free trade deal directly with Canada, should the ongoing talks collapse.

But the U.S. president also said it's too early to give up on the negotiations, which resumed Wednesday in Alexandria, Va., with negotiators from Canada, the U.S. and Mexico.

U.S. President Donald Trump welcomes Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to the White House on Oct. 11, 2017.

""It's possible we won't be able to reach a deal with one or the other,"" Trump said, a poker-faced Trudeau seated at his side. ""In the meantime, we'll make a deal with one, but I think we have a chance to do something very creative that's good for Canada, Mexico and the United States.""

It's no secret that the president is not a fan of NAFTA, but Wednesday's remarks suggested he's open to the possibility of a bilateral trade deal with Canada. ""We'll see what happens, we have a tough negotiation.""

It wasn't clear whether the change in the prime minister's NAFTA message was a direct result of his meeting with the U.S. president, someone he acknowledged ""makes decisions that surprise people sometimes."" But repeating the ""ready for anything"" sentiment multiple times suggests a conscious decision to acknowledge that the outcome of the talks may not go Canada's way.

""I continue to believe in NAFTA; I continue to believe that as a continent working together in complementary ways is better for our citizens and better for economic growth, and allows us to compete on a stronger footing with the global economy,"" Trudeau said.

I think it's been clear that circumstances are often challenging, and we have to be ready for anything — and we are. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau

""So saying, we are ready for anything and we will continue to work diligently to protect Canadian interests, to stand up for jobs, and look for opportunities for Canadian business and citizens of all of our friends and neighbour countries to do well.""

Indeed, there have been early but unmistakable signs of trouble in the talks, with big business groups expressing fear the quarter-century-old deal could disappear.

Earlier Wednesday, Trudeau held discussions with the House of Representatives' influential Ways and Means committee, one of two bodies of U.S. lawmakers that are helping negotiators put forward the U.S. positions on trade.

He joined the committee to warm applause and expressions of optimism about the deal from both the committee's Republican chair and the ranking Democrat member.

'Model for future trade deals'



The committee is dedicated to making sure the negotiations are successful, said Rep. Kevin Brady, the committee chair, who asked for Trudeau's help in keeping an open mind.

""We all want this agreement to be a model for future trade deals,"" Brady said.

The latest round of NAFTA talks kicked off with a discussion of government procurement, already a thorny subject — U.S. negotiators suggested during the last round in Ottawa that they want to limit Canadian and Mexican access to U.S. projects.

Having to receive verbal abuse and witness explosive episodes caused by a member of my own family because of mental ill health has been one of the most soul destroying and heart breaking things I've ever experienced.

But it fills my heart with so much hope when I see the huge difference in people's attitudes towards mental health over the last nine years and I'm confident that talking and learning will continue to help break the stigma and support all those affected by mental health (which I hope you've realised by reading to the end of this post, is everyone).","A lot of people, who know me well, will know that I have a terrible memory. I forget why I came upstairs; I forget what I was supposed to buy in the supermarket; I write shopping lists so I don't forget the things I was supposed to buy in the supermarket, and then I forget the list.

Some things, though, I will never forget: My first Oasis gig; Seeing the Sydney Opera House in real life; The time I received a phone call from my dad to tell me ""Your brother's not well. He's had a breakdown"".

That phone call was almost nine years ago.

Out of respect for my brother's privacy, I will not go into the details of what the catalyst was for his rapid slide into mental ill health, but just like I'm sure is the case with many others, our family did not see this coming - it was like a baseball bat had swung around and hit us right in the stomach.

""He's been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder"", was the next big update from my parents. It was the first time a label had been attached to my brother that was something different to the descriptions of him I had grown used to hearing throughout our childhood: ""Life of the party"", ""such a lovely boy"", ""always smiling"". Just like the phone call to break the news - this one is also etched into my memory. Not knowing what 'Bipolar' meant, I concentrated on the 'Disorder' part and said it in my head over and over again, trying not to be scared of the realisation that in having a disorder, someone must therefore be 'disordered'.

I will hold my hands up and confess that prior to my brother becoming unwell, my knowledge of mental ill health was largely based on films and the gossip pages of trashy magazines; i.e. not real life.

As soon as my brother had a diagnosis, I rushed to the library and started reading. I struggled to know how to offer help, so I settled for the next best thing - understanding. I wanted to learn about his condition. I wanted to know everything. This person had grown up with me, and I had looked up to him as a perfect model of everything I wanted to be ever since I can remember. I wanted back the brother I knew. In a matter of weeks he had turned into a stranger, a shell of the person I knew so well. Someone I used to spend hours talking to non-stop and now I couldn't even think of two words to say to him.

Looking back, I realise that I must've been in a state of shock for a long time. To this day, I am ashamed and angry with myself for how I dealt with the news. Not knowing what to do, I backed away entirely, for fear of saying the wrong thing or making matters worse, but days of non-communication turned into weeks, and weeks turned into months. I kept in regular contact with my parents who would give me updates on his health. Every day was a guessing game as to how he would feel and what he might be capable of doing: some days progress would mean getting dressed. Other days he would be able to go out and see friends. The phrase, 'taking each day as it comes' had taken on a whole new meaning.

Over these last nine years, my brother's illness has been like a mental health rollercoaster - except there are no comedy photos to take home on a key ring, just emotional scars carried by him, and everyone surrounding him; bitter memories of painful episodes: verbal abuse, bouts of mania, paranoia, anxiety and depression.

Having to receive verbal abuse and witness explosive episodes caused by a member of my own family because of mental ill health has been one of the most soul destroying and heart breaking things I've ever experienced. There's been times when I've been prepared to cut out my own brother because of his condition, but my understanding of it has helped me to realise that running away from someone you love who needs help can never be a positive move, no matter how hard that road is - you have to travel it together. I will carry my brother on my back forever, if that's what he needs.

Thanks to some wonderful support from the charity Mind, my brother is living mostly independently and is striving every day for good mental health. A more recent diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder sparked more trips to the library for me, but the more I read, the more I realise the accuracy of his diagnosis and have been working hard to support him in every way I can. With ageing parents and a daughter of my own to care for, I know that the road ahead will continue to be hard, as he will gradually move from being my parents' responsibility to being mine. But it fills my heart with so much hope when I see the huge difference in people's attitudes towards mental health over the last nine years and I'm confident that talking and learning will continue to help break the stigma and support all those affected by mental health (which I hope you've realised by reading to the end of this post, is everyone).

Ce dernier accuse l'élu des Hauts-de-Seine d'avoir porté atteinte à sa vie privée, en décrivant notamment ses conditions de détention dans le Le Journal du dimanche.

Le suspect-clé des attentats qui ont fait 130 morts à Paris et Saint-Denis n'a officiellement plus d'avocat depuis que Maîtres Frank Berton et Sven Mary ont renoncé à le défendre il y a un an. La forme que prendra cette audience devant les juges civils demeure dès lors incertaine, selon une source proche du dossier.

Salah Abdeslam ne sera pas extrait de sa cellule pour une audience civile, a précisé cette source. Et si rien n'indique qu'un avocat viendra plaider pour lui, des conclusions devraient a minima être déposées pour achever la procédure qu'il a engagée.

""Il était en survêtement et T-shirt sombre""

En exerçant son droit de parlementaire de visiter les prisons, Thierry Solère s'était rendu le 29 juin 2016 à la maison d'arrêt de Fleury-Mérogis, au sud de Paris, où Salah Abdeslam, détenu à l'isolement, est placé sous surveillance 24 heures sur 24.

Les deux journalistes du JDD qui accompagnaient le député n'avaient pas pu le suivre jusqu'à la salle de vidéosurveillance du détenu le plus surveillé de France. Mais il avait décrit dans le journal ce qu'il avait vu, du brossage de dents à la prière.

""Il était en survêtement et T-shirt sombre, cela fait une semaine qu'il ne porte plus la djellaba, et il a noué autour de sa taille une veste, avant de se mettre à genou, tourné vers l'Est... Une longue prière"", relatait ainsi le parlementaire.

La salle de sport particulière

Thierry Solère avait également interpellé le garde des Sceaux, à l'époque Jean-Jacques Urvoas, affirmant que Salah Abdeslam bénéficiait d'une ""salle de sport"" exclusive, en fait une cellule avec rameur.

De son côté, le conseil de ce dernier, Me Frank Berton, avait dénoncé dans une lettre au ministre le comportement du député, ""comme s'il s'était promené au zoo de Vincennes"". Me Berton avait demandé à la justice administrative de suspendre en urgence la vidéosurveillance de son client au nom de sa ""vie privée"", requête refusée en juillet par le tribunal administratif puis le Conseil d'État.

Ses conditions de détention ont en revanche été assouplies, comme l'a confirmé la ministre de la Justice en septembre. ""Il reste à l'isolement, rien n'a changé sur ce point"", a-t-elle affirmé. Elle a en revanche admis qu'il avait désormais ""accès à certaines possibilités pour parler plus facilement à son avocat"", évoquant des ""craintes sur sa santé"".

Un euro de dommages et intérêts

Salah Abdeslam avait assigné Thierry Solère au civil. Il demande un euro de dommages et intérêts pour atteinte au droit au respect de sa vie privée.

A 100-metre statue of Ram, worshipped as a god by many Hindus, might be installed on the banks of River Sarayu in Ayodhya, the 'birthplace' of the mythical king, by the government of Uttar Pradesh, as part of its proposal to give the city an image makeover.

Located in another part of the state, the Taj Mahal, Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan's tribute to his deceased wife Mumtaz Mahal, considered as one of the seven wonders of the world, has disappeared from the new brochures issued by the tourism department.

Luckily UP is prosperous enough that its ministers can keep dumping all over the state's biggest tourist draw https://t.co/bggkk90C0R — michael safi (@safimichael) October 10, 2017

The contrast between these two statements highlights the priorities of the ruling dispensation in the state. Of course, CM Adityanath, who, until recently, was the leader of a religious mutt in Gorakhpur, before his elevation to the seat of political power, is an unapologetic firebrand Hindutva leader. Shortly after he was appointed to office, a section of the media went on a spree to report examples of his religious generosity.

Adityanath, we were told, is exemplary for being an equal-opportunity employer, having given jobs to Muslims and lower-caste Hindus in a range of roles at his organisation, from being the handler of finances to the caretaker of the cows. His frugal lifestyle and faith in the best of Bharatiya sanskar exonerated his previous track record of being a rabble-rouser, who preyed on dividing communities along religious lines.

Sample some of his statements: ""If one Hindu girl is converted, we will convert 100 Muslim girls""; ""Mother Teresa was a part of a conspiracy to evangelise India""; or ""there is no difference in the language between Shah Rukh Khan and Hafiz Saeed"". This is the man who fought election after election, won several of them, and had his party give him the top job in the state one day.

So it seems like a corollary that the government under Adityanath's watch is planning to put up a massive statue of Ram in a historically communalised part of the state, while wiping out the existence of the most glorious example of Mughal architecture in India from a tourist pamphlet. Initially, facing intense criticism, officials said the booklet was not a brochure for all the tourist attractions in Uttar Pradesh — only a list of the government's ongoing and future projects in the tourism sector. Soon after, the officials dropped every pretence.

Laxmi Narayan Chaudhary, a cabinet minister in Uttar Pradesh, said the Taj Mahal was ""rightly kept out"" of the tourism booklet because the Guru Gorakhnath peeth, presided over by Adityanath, was more deserving of being showcased as a religious symbol. His views were echoed in June this year by Adityanath. ""Foreign dignitaries visiting the country used to be gifted replicas of the Taj Mahal and other minarets which did not reflect Indian culture,"" he said.

The Taj Mahal, as Shoaib Daniyal recently wrote in Scroll.in, is so immensely valued the world over that it is one of the 115 images included in the Voyager spacecraft, launched into space in 1977. ""In case the ship was discovered by intelligent extraterrestrial life,"" he wrote, ""the scientists who launched Voyager wanted them to know that earthlings had built the Taj Mahal."" The fact of having a magnificent structure such as it in his state should inspire pride in Adityanath, not a crass competition exacerbated by a lingering sense of insecurity.

For it is insecurity that has pushed the Hindutva brigade into adopting risibly sinister strategies such as the whitewashing of the Taj Mahal and, in more extreme cases, the rewriting of history to assign the imagined victories on rulers of their choice. From Akbar losing the battle of Haldighati to the portrayal of Aurangzeb as a mindless tyrant, these revisions are meant to put the pride back in parochialism as well as establish a reign of untruths.

The nefarious agenda now extends to installing a statue of Lord Ram at a place which saw one of the worst communal riots in modern India, changing the political course of the country since then. The demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992 — a section of the Hindus believe it was built by Muslim invaders over the original birthplace of Ram — and the resultant loss of life and damage to democracy should be warning enough for the state government to avoid any innovation that might destabilise harmony in the city of Ayodhya.

The only silver lining is that the Taj Mahal enjoys a pre-eminent place in the history of art and architecture across the world — and will continue to do so without a doubt

What's worse, for the integrated development of Ayodhya, the state government sent a detailed project report of ₹195.89 crore to the tourism ministry at the Centre, which has sanctioned ₹133.70 crore so far. Imagine the funds being diverted into improving the healthcare in the state instead, which was recently noted by global media for staggering number of deaths of children due to encephalitis — crossing 400 in one month alone.

The only silver lining is that the Taj Mahal enjoys a pre-eminent place in the history of art and architecture across the world — and will continue to do so without a doubt. A gigantic statue on the bank of a river may draw the attention of the public, but it's never going to obscure the appeal of one of the greatest creations of humanity for generations to come.

Wie bitte? Genau solche absurden Behauptungen hat eine britische Abgeordnete am Montag geäußert. Was dahintersteckt und wie sie sich jetzt verteidigt, erfahrt ihr hier.

Hochrangige Mitglieder des britischen Königshauses mussten diese Woche ungeheuerliche Vorwürfe über sich ergehen lassen. So soll Prinz Philip (96) seiner Ehefrau, Queen Elizabeth II. (91), schon seit Jahren untreu sein! Das behauptete jedenfalls vergangenen Montag (25. September) ein Mitglied des britischen Parlaments, Emma Dent Coad, Abgeordnete der Labour Partei, am Rande eines Kongresses ihrer Partei. Um genau zu sein, lauteten ihre Worte „mirror.co.uk“ zufolge: „Es könnte schon sein, dass die Queen zurücktreten möchte, wenn ihr (hust, hust) Seelenverwandter stirbt.“ Und fügte hinzu: „Er ist ihr schon seit einigen Jahren untreu.“

Sie lässt kein gutes Haar an den britischen Royals

Doch damit noch längst nicht genug, denn Dent Coad äußerte auch harsche Kritik Prinz Harry (33) gegenüber, wie die Online-Ausgabe weiter berichtet: „Eigentlich kann Harry gar keinen Helikopter fliegen … Er versuchte viermal, durch die Helikopter-Prüfung zu kommen, schaffte es aber überhaupt nicht, deshalb ist er immer nur der Co-Pilot. Deshalb sitzt er immer nur daneben und sagt ‚Vroom Vroom‘.“ Auch an Prinz William (35) lässt sie kein gutes Haar: Er und sein Bruder seien „nicht sehr helle“. Und um das Fass noch voll zu machen, kritisierte sie Herzogin Kate (35) dafür, sich Pullover für 150 britische Pfund (umgerechnet 171 Euro) gekauft zu haben: „Das gibt eine vierköpfige Familie für Essen aus.“ Das sei „widerlich“.

Hintergrund Herzogin Kate Skandal um William! Was hat er da nur angestellt? Bringt Prinz William jetzt ausgerechnet seine Leidenschaft in Bedrängnis? Sein Name taucht überraschenderweise im großen FIFA-Report auf, der Korruption aufdecken könnte.

„Ich finde, ich sollte etwas sagen dürfen“

Der Zorn der Öffentlichkeit ließ bei solch infamen Vorwürfen nicht lange auf sich warten. Gegenüber „standard.co.uk“ rechtfertigte sich die Abgeordnete für ihre Worte: „Wenn wir keine Debatte führen können, leben wir dann in einer Demokratie? Ich lebe in einer Demokratie und finde, ich sollte etwas sagen dürfen. Es handelt sich um eine Diskussion, nicht um eine Revolution. Ich möchte darüber sprechen dürfen, dass die Steuerzahler die royale Familie finanzieren.“

Eine Entschuldigung? Weit gefehlt!

Es ist fraglich, inwiefern ihre aus der Luft gegriffenen Behauptungen solch eine „Debatte“ anstoßen. Allein die Vorwürfe Prinz Harry gegenüber halten keiner Prüfung stand. Er war zweimal in Afghanistan im Einsatz, diente seinem Land ein Jahrzehnt lang und erlangte in dieser Zeit den Rang eines Captains. Von Unfähigkeit, einen Helikopter zu fliegen, keine Spur. Mit ihren Worten konfrontiert, entgegnete sie „standard.co.uk“ nur: „Ich habe auch gesagt, dass mir das über Prinz Harry erzählt wurde, doch wenn ich einen Fehler gemacht habe, gebe ich es zu.“ Eine Art von Entschuldigung bringt sie aber bezüglich Prinz Philips vermeintlicher Untreue nicht über die Lippen: „Oh nein, was für ein Albtraum. Ich werde darauf nicht antworten, jeder weiß, was vor sich geht … Ich möchte nicht weiter ins Detail gehen, weil die Sache aus dem Ruder läuft.“

Sie hätte mit ihren Aussagen nur Spaß gemacht, wollte aber zum Nachdenken darüber anregen, warum die Steuerzahler die Königsfamilie finanzieren. „Warum darf ich nicht anderer Meinung sein? Es scheint, als dürften wir keine Meinung dazu haben.“

Die Labour Partei lenkt ein

Dent Coads Parteikollege John Woodcock fand in diesem Zusammenhang angemessenere Worte. Der Kommentar über Prinz Harrys militärischen Dienst sei „höchst unangebracht“ gewesen und entspräche „in keinster Weise der Ansicht meiner Partei.“ Außerdem fügte er hinzu: „Wie jeder, der sich in Gefahr bringt, um unsere Sicherheit zu garantieren, verdient Seine Königliche Hoheit nur Lob und Respekt für seinen Dienst.“ Woodcock sei zutiefst beschämt über das, was diese Woche passiert ist.

State capture is a huge embarrassment to South Africa, ANC treasurer-general Zweli Mkhize said on Wednesday.

""This issue of state capture is something that is a huge embarrassment...we take it as a form of corruption. This is something that we have not experienced before,"" he said.

Mkhize was speaking at The Joburg Indaba which focuses on the mining industry. After his speech, he was grilled about issues of state capture.

Mkhize says the delay in the establishment of a judicial commission of inquiry into state capture was due to issues surrounding its terms of reference.

""From the National Executive Committee, we expected it (inquiry) would have taken place much quicker,"" he said.

""The commission must be able to question everyone who is involved...legislation needs to be put in place. When the findings are released, we will be able to act on those involved. Those emails have come with a lot of revelations.""

Mkhize, a presidential frontrunner, said he believes there were issues between lawyers as to how they could define the terms of reference for the inquiry.

In his speech, Mkhize said the ANC has had ""a number of engagements"" with the Chamber of Mines to facilitate a resolution of issues, especially around the amended Mining Charter.

""Our focus to the Chamber of Mines has been that we need to find a way to rebuild this industry...to make sure that this industry grows,"" he said.

Mkhize outlined three issues currently facing the mining industry:

- How to achieve growth;

- How to create jobs;

- How to deal with transformation in the industry.

""What we are looking at is how do we increase the ownership and the participation of black industrialists who have over the years been left out. In the process, therefore, we have found that the mining chamber indicated the tension that exists between the chamber and the ministry,"" Mkhize said.

""One of the issues raised internally was the issue of the instability within the labour movement...a bit of progress has been made on that side. For the past three or so years we have not seen as much of protracted work stoppages and violence.""

He said there needs to be more engagement between government and the private sector.

""There is a huge concern about the stability within the ANC...we want to make sure we bring a lot more unity,"" he said.",Zweli Mkhize: State Capture Is An 'Embarrassment',http://www.huffingtonpost.co.za/2017/10/04/zweli-mkhize-state-capture-is-an-embarrassment_a_23232088/?utm_hp_ref=za-homepage

Emsflorenz. Der kleine Aufkleber am Bahnhof von Papenburg sagt viel aus. Denn es ist die Ems mit ihren Kanälen, die das Leben in der beschaulichen Stadt bestimmt. Hübsch ist es hier, die Grenze zu Holland ist nur ein paar Kilometer entfernt und die bekannte Meyer Werft baut ganz in der Nähe die berühmtesten Kreuzfahrtschiffe der Welt. Klar, der Name des Schiffsbauers ist vielen bekannt, nicht aber die Stadt selbst. Denn sie gehört eben nicht in die Größenordnung von Touristenmagneten wie Hamburg, Düsseldorf oder Münster. Papenburg ist die versteckte Schönheit unter den Reisezielen. Umso mehr lohnt es sich, das „Venedig des Nordens"" zu entdecken.



""Den ersten sien Dod, den Twedden sien Not, den Dridden sien Brot!"" Ludger Stukenbrock mit einem Stück Torf.

Ludger Stukenbrock ist geborener Papenburger. Durch und durch. Meist trifft man ihn in der Von-Velen-Anlage. Hier taucht er ein in die Vergangenheit und nimmt die Gäste mit. Er erzählt von den ersten Siedlern und auch von der einen oder anderen Moorleiche. Denn hier gibt es noch die Untiefen, das Moor, das einst erschlossen wurde, um auf den abgetorften Flächen Landwirtschaft zu betreiben.

Ab Mitte des 17. Jahrhunderts gruben die Bewohner ausgehend vom Fluss Kanäle von insgesamt 43 Kilometern Länge. Neben der Entwässerung des Moores dienten diese gleichzeitig als Wasserstraßen. Mit einfachen Plattbodenschiffen transportierte die frühere Bevölkerung den abgebauten Torf zu den ostfriesischen Ziegeleien und später nach Emden, Bremen und Hamburg. Auch der Weg zur Nordsee wurde dadurch frei.

Papenburg - das ehemalige Armenhaus

Die ersten Siedler lebten in erbärmlichen auf dem Hochmoor erbauten fensterlosen Hütten aus Birkenstämmen, Reisig und Heideplaggen. In der Mitte dieser Katen befanden sich die Kochstellen. Mensch und Vieh teilten sich den kargen Wohnraum. Erst viel später gab es einen bescheidenen Wohlstand, der zweifellos den ersten Siedlern zu verdanken ist. Gegen Ende des 18. Jahrhunderts fanden viele Papenburger Arbeit im Schiffbau. Zur Blütezeit des Werftwesens gab es 23 Werftanlagen. Auf einer längs des Kanals errichteten Helling wurde das Schiff auf Kiel gelegt und konnte dadurch ins Wasser gleiten.

Abgebaute Torf-Briketts.

Stukenbrock deutet auf einen Sumpf, der abgetrennt und gesichert ist. ""Wer hier reinfällt, kommt nicht mehr raus"", betont er. Und dann erzählt er von dem Jungen, der 1939 im Moor gefunden wurde. Sein Skelett wies eine Hüftdeformation auf. Nachforschungen ergaben, dass das Kind im 11. Jahrhundert lebte und stark gehbehindert war. ""Man hat den Jungen wohl umgebracht und im Moor verschwinden lassen"", mutmaßt Stukenbrock. ""Damals, zu Zeiten großer Not, konnte er nicht zum Überleben der Familie beitragen und man entledigte sich ihm."" Es gibt einige Menschen, die im Moor einfach verschwanden und nie wieder aufgetaucht sind.

Das Geschäft mit der Frische.

Landwirtschaft und Gartenbau stehen in der norddeutschen Stadt heute mit an vorderster Stelle. Die Gartenbauzentrale Papenburg steht für das Geschäft mit der Frische. Anfang der 1970er Jahre begann sie mit dem Anbau von Topfblumen, später, zu Beginn der 1980er Jahre mit Topfkräutern. Salbei, Rosmarin, Bleifuß, Minze und viele mehr. Allein 80 Millionen Topfkräuter werden von hier aus jährlich auf den Markt gebracht. Die Genossenschaft arbeitet mit selbständigen Gärtnern zusammen und fördert somit den Wohlstand der Region.



Papenburg - ein charmantes Städtchen.

Auf der Meyer Werft werden regelmäßig Führungen veranstaltet. Und die Gäste können den späteren Luxus erahnen, der die halbfertigen Ozeanriesen schon beim Bau umgibt. Hier sieht man ihre Gerippe und beobachtet Hunderte von Arbeitern, die einer neuen AIDA Form geben oder dem Disney-Kreuzfahrtschiff den letzten Anstrich verpassen. Es ist eine Welt der Superlative. Es lohnt sich, sie zu entdecken. Dabei zu sein, hautnah. Sich eine Reise über die Ozeane unserer Welt vorstellen. Einfach so. Träume werden hier wahr, nicht nur für die leidenschaftlichen Kreuzfahrt-Fans.



Die Holländer Astrid van der Wel und Kees van Veen mit ihren Hunden Trüffel und Hazel kommen gerne zum Einkaufen nach Papenburg.

""Boßeln"" - Was ist denn das?

Am frühen Abend trifft man sich zum Boßeln. Nur Insider wissen, um was es da genau geht. „Ran an die Kugel und den Kopf einziehen!"", lautet das Motto. Und nach der Ausübung des hiesigen Volkssports geht es zum Grünkohlessen. Das muss sein. Denn Papenburg ist diesbezüglich nicht nur eigenwillig sondern auch lukullisch ein Genuss.

Das charmante Städtchen an der Ems hat viel zu bieten, nicht nur für Insider. Auch im Nachbarland weiß man Papenburg als Einkaufsziel zu schätzen. Wie das holländische Paar Astrid van der Wel und Kees van Veen, die Latte Macchiato und Kuchen in einem Café am Kanal genießen. ""Gutes deutsches Mühlenbrot kaufen und leckere Tortenstücke essen"", lacht die 61-Jährige. Kees van Veen, ein ehemaliger Koch, schätzt die Auswahl an Küchenutensilien in dem nahen Laden. ""Hier werde ich oft fündig"", sagt der 68-Jährige. Neben Torten, Kochlöffel, eine große Werft und Millionen an Kräutertöpfen hat Emsflorenz noch viel mehr zu bieten. Einen kurzen oder langen Abstecher ist das Städtchen allemal wert.

Meteorologe Kachelmann forderte die Politiker zum Handeln auf

Die panischen Prognosen einiger Experten wollte er jedoch nicht teilen

Mehrere Tage lang hatte die Obergrenze die Republik als Geisel genommen.

Fast konnte man den Eindruck gewinnen, die Diskussion um das Maximal-Kontingent zur Einreise von Flüchtlingen, auf das die Union sich am Sonntagabend geeinigt hatte, sei derzeit das einzig wichtige Politikum.

Dabei geht es auch bei den Jamaika-Sondierungen um zahlreiche andere Themen. Nicht zuletzt der Klimaschutz könnte zu einem wichtigen Streitpunkt zwischen Union, Grünen und Liberalen werden.

Auch deshalb ging es im ARD-Talk von Sandra Maischberger am Mittwoch um den Klimawandel. ""Xavier und die Wetterextreme: Kippt unser Klima?"", fragte Maischberger die Gäste.

Neben Dorothee Bär von der CSU und Ex-Umweltministerin Bärbel Höhn von den Grünen waren das Klimawandel-Skeptiker Alex Reichmuth, Klimaforscher Hans Joachim Schellnhuber und Meteorologe Jörg Kachelmann.

Die Diskussionslinien waren von Anfang an klar gezogen. Forscher Schellnhuber warnte vehement vor den Folgen der Erderwärmung (""in den nächsten Jahrzehnten dringt die Sahara nach Europa vor"") – Skeptiker Reichmuth tat den menschlichen Einfluss auf den Klimawandel als ideologische Spinnerei ab.

CSU gegen Grüne beim Kohle-Ausstieg

Bär und Höhn lieferten sich vor allem beim Thema Kohle-Ausstieg spannende Wortgefechte. ""Selbst ich als Grüne sage ja nicht: Morgen alle Kohlekraftwerke abschalten"", gab sich Höhn anfangs kompromissbereit. Als Deadline müsse man aber das Jahr 2030 für alte Kohlekraftwerke setzen. Irgendwann müsse man komplett auf Kohle verzichten, vertrat Höhn die Grünen-Linie.

CSU-Politikerin Bär war das immer noch zu forsch. ""Klimaschutz darf keine Arbeitsplätze gefährden"", erklärte sie.

► Zum Hintergrund: In Deutschland arbeiten derzeit nur noch etwa 20.000 Menschen (0,07 Prozent aller Beschäftigten) in der Braunkohlewirtschaft. Zum Vergleich: Im Ökostrom-Sektor arbeiten laut dem Bundesverband Erneuerbare Energien etwa 330.000 Menschen.

Trotzdem erklärte Bär, bei den Sondierungsgesprächen müsse man sehen, ""was an realistischen Forderungen auf den Tisch kommt"". Durch die Blume heißt das wohl: Große Sprünge im Kampf gegen den Klimawandel, wie sie die Grünen planen, wird es mit der CSU nicht geben.

Höhn habe ja auch als NRW-Ministerin nicht alle Kohlekraftwerke abgeschafft, warf sie ihrer Kontrahentin vor. Die ging kurz auf 180: ""Hallo?"" Sie hätte mit ihrer Partei einen ""massiven Kampf gegen die Braunkohle"" geführt.

Kachelmann erklärt, was die Debatte so schwer macht

Fast dankbar konnte der Zuschauer sein, dass die ARD mit Meteorologe Jörg Kachelmann jemanden eingeladen hatte, dem es vor allem um Besonnenheit ging.

Als Klimawissenschaftler Schellnhuber eine Überflutung der Kontinente im Jahr ""3000, oder wie auch immer"" prophezeite, brachte Kachelmann das Gespräch wieder ins Hier und Jetzt.

Der ehemalige ARD-Wettermann machte damit gleichzeitig auf ein großes Problem der Klimapolitik aufmerksam: Menschen könnten nur schwer so weit in die Zukunft blicken. Kein Bürger würde daher sagen: ""Heute fahre ich nicht nach Schweinfurt ins Kino, weil möglicherweise bin ich schuld, wenn der Meeresspiegel in tausend Jahren 70 Meter höher ist.“

Kachelmann: ""Schmeißen Sie gefälligst den Laden!""

Auch deshalb gibt es für die meisten Parteien wohl attraktivere Themen als klimapolitische Langzeitkonzepte. Wichtig wären sie allemal. ""Ich erwarte von Ihnen auf dem Politiksofa, dass sie gefälligst den Laden schmeißen"", wandte sich der Schweizer an Bär und Höhn.

Ohnehin lieferte der Meteorologe viele kluge Einwände. Für Panik sei es zu früh, machte er schon zu Anfang der Sendung deutlich. Man sehe etwa statistisch gar keine Häufung von schweren Unwettern.

""Die Unwetter kommen nicht mit einem Zettelchen daher.""

Sind die derzeitigen Wetterextreme Indizien für den #Klimawandel, Herr @Kachelmann? pic.twitter.com/z7rHsW9xRS — Maischberger (@maischberger) 11. Oktober 2017

Ohnehin müsse es in der Diskussion um den Klimawandel stärker um etwas anderes gehen, als um die Frage, was der Mensch zu den derzeitigen Auffälligkeiten beigetragen habe. ""Falls es so ist, wie beschrieben: Was tun wir dagegen, damit es nicht so kommt?""

Es sei ""wie wenn so ein Meteorit auf die Erde zukommt, wir diskutieren aber nicht, wie wir das verhindern, dass wir alle sterben, sondern streiten uns übereinander.""

Ein Satz, den Höhn und Bär mit in die Koalitionsgespräche nehmen sollten.

Jedes Kind braucht die Chance auf Bildung Egal wo auf der Welt: Ohne Bildung haben Kinder aus armen Familien in der Regel keine Chance.

Όπως αναφέρεται σε δημοσίευμα του LiveScience, η επιγραφή, μήκους 29 μέτρων, περιγράφει την άνοδο ενός ισχυρού βασιλείου, ονόματι Μίρα, το οποίο πραγματοποίησε μια στρατιωτική εκστρατεία με επικεφαλής έναν πρίγκιπα από την Τροία, ονόματι Μούξους.

Η επιγραφή είναι γραμμένη στη Λουβική γλώσσα- τη γλώσσα του λαού των Λουβίων, για τους οποίους τα ερωτηματικά εξακολουθούν να είναι πολλά: Ενδεικτικά, μόλις γύρω στους 20 μελετητές ανά τον κόσμο είναι σε θέση να τη διαβάσουν σήμερα, Μεταξύ αυτών η Φρεντ Γουντχούιζεν, ανεξάρτητος ερευνητής, ο οποίος κατάφερε να αποκρυπτογραφήσει ένα αντίγραφο της επιγραφής.

Ο Γουντχούιζεν και ο Έμπερχαρντ Ζάνγκερ, γεωαρχαιολόγος και πρόεδρος του Ιδρύματος Λουβικών Μελετών, θα προβούν σε αναλυτικές δημοσιεύσεις τον Δεκέμβριο, στο Proceedings of the Dutch Archaeological and Historical Society. Όπως αναφέρει το LiveScience, αν η επιγραφή είναι αυθεντική παρέχει μια πολύτιμη ματιά σε μια περίοδο κατά την οποία οι, αποκαλούμενοι σήμερα «Λαοί της Θάλασσας»- θεωρείται πως επρόκειτο για μια χαλαρή συμμαχία φύλων/ λαών- προκάλεσαν την κατάρρευση πόλεων και πολιτισμών στη Μέση Ανατολή. Το βασίλειο της Μίρα, το οποίο πραγματοποίησε την προαναφερθείσα εκστρατεία, εκτιμάται πως ανήκε σε αυτή τη συμμαχία.

Ένας «Τρωικός πόλεμος»;

Η επιγραφή μιλά για το πώς ο βασιλιάς Κουπαντακουρούντας κυβερνούσε ένα βασίλειο ονόματι Μίρα, στη σημερινή δυτική Τουρκία. Η Μίρα είχε υπό τον έλεγχό της την Τροία, σύμφωνα με την επιγραφή- στην οποία αναφέρεται ότι ο Τρώας πρίγκιπας Μούξους ηγήθηκε μιας ναυτικής εκστρατείας που είχε ως αποτέλεσμα την κατάκτηση της Ασκελόν στο σημερινό Ισραήλ και την ανέγερση ενός φρουρίου εκεί.

Ειδικότερα, όπως αναφέρεται σε σχετικό δημοσίευμα του PhysOrg, όταν ο Κουπαντακουρούντας θεώρησε πως το βασίλειό του ήταν αρκετά ισχυρό, γύρω στο 1190 πΧ, έστειλε τις στρατιές του προς την ανατολή, εναντίον των βασιλείων που ήταν υποτελή στους Χετταίους. Μετά από μια σειρά επιτυχών εκστρατειών στην ξηρά, δημιουργήθηκε ένας στόλος από τις ενωμένες δυνάμεις της δυτικής Μικράς Ασίας, ο οποίος επιτέθηκε εναντίον πολλών πόλεων στις ακτές της νότιας και της νοτιοανατολικής Μικράς Ασίας, της Συρίας και της Παλαιστίνης. Του στόλου αυτού ηγήθηκαν τέσσερις πρίγκιπες, μεταξύ αυτών και ο Μούξους της Τροίας. Οι εκστρατείες αυτές είχαν ως αποτέλεσμα οι Λούβιοι να φτάσουν μέχρι τα σύνορα της Αιγύπτου. Γενικότερα, εκτιμάται πως η δραστηριότητα των Λουβίων αποτέλεσε σημαντικό κομμάτι των εισβολών/ επιδρομών των Λαών της Θάλασσας- μια θεωρία η οποία δείχνει να αποκτά δυναμική τα τελευταία χρόνια.

Επίσης, στην επιγραφή περιγράφεται η πορεία του Κουπαντακουρούντας μέχρι την κατάκτηση του θρόνου της Μίρα. Ο πατέρας του, βασιλιάς Μασουΐτας, πήρε τον έλεγχο της Τροίας μετά την εκθρόνιση ενός Τρώα βασιλιά ονόματι Βάλμους. Λίγο μετά, ο Μασουΐτας επανέφερε τον Βάλμους στον θρόνο της Τροίας, με αντάλλαγμα την πίστη και υπακοή του στη Μίρα.

Ο Κουπαντακουρούντας έγινε βασιλιάς μετά τον θάνατο του πατέρα του και εδραίωσε τον έλεγχό του στην Τροία, αν και δεν έγινε βασιλιάς της: Στην επιγραφή χαρακτηρίζεται «προστάτης» της Τροίας (η οποία αποκαλείται Βιλούσα, ένα αρχαίο όνομα για την πόλη).

Η ίδια η επιγραφή δεν υπάρχει πλέον, καθώς καταστράφηκε τον 19ο αιώνα, αλλά υπάρχουν αρχεία για αυτήν, περιλαμβανομένου ενός αντιγράφου, που κατείχε ο Τζέιμς Μέλααρτ, ένας διάσημος αρχαιολόγος που πέθανε το 2012. Ο Μέλααρτ ανακάλυψε πολλούς αρχαιολογικούς χώρους στη ζωή του, ο πιο γνωστός εκ των οποίων ήταν η Τσατάλ Χουγιούκ: Μια μεγάλη πόλη 9.500 ετών στην Τουρκία, για την οποία κάποιοι πιστεύουν πως είναι η παλαιότερη του κόσμου.

Ο Μέλααρτ άφησε πίσω του σημειώσεις και οδηγίες, όπου επισήμαινε ότι η επιγραφή δεν ήταν δυνατόν να αποκρυπτογραφηθεί πλήρως και να δημοσιοποιηθεί- και ότι άλλοι μελετητές θα έπρεπε να ασχοληθούν μαζί της. Ωστόσο, κάποιοι επιστήμονες έχουν εκφράσει προβληματισμούς για το ενδεχόμενο η επιγραφή να είναι πλαστή- ένα κατασκεύασμα του ίδιου του Μελάαρτ ή κάποιου άλλου.

Ο Μέλααρτ είχε αναφερθεί στην ύπαρξη της επιγραφής σε τουλάχιστον μία δημοσίευσή του, το 1992, στο journal της Anglo-Israel Archaeological Society, ωστόσο ποτέ δεν την περιέγραψε πλήρως σε επιστημονική δημοσίευση. Σύμφωνα με τις σημειώσεις του, η επιγραφή αντιγράφηκε το 1878 από έναν αρχαιολόγο ονόματι Zωρζ Περό, κοντά σε ένα χωριό με το όνομα Μπεικόι στη σημερινή Τουρκία. Λίγο μετά την καταγραφή της επιγραφής, οι ντόπιοι χρησιμοποίησαν την πλάκα ως υλικό για την κατασκευή ενός τζαμιού. Λίγο μετά οι αρχές έκαναν έρευνες στο χωριό και βρήκαν τρεις χάλκινες πλάκες με επιγραφές, η τύχη των οποίων σήμερα αγνοείται- είναι παντελώς άγνωστο τι μπορεί να έγραφαν.

Ένας μελετητής ονόματι Μπαχαντίρ Αλκίμ (πέθανε το 1981) ανακάλυψε την καταγραφή του Περό και έκανε αντίγραφο, το οποίο ο Μελάαρτ με τη σειρά του αντέγραψε και πρόσφατα αποκρυπτογράφησε ελβετο-ολλανδική ομάδα επιστημόνων.

Σημειώνεται επίσης πως ο Μελάαρτ ήταν μέλος ομάδας ερευνητών που, ξεκινώντας από το 1956, προσπαθούσε να αποκρυπτογραφήσει και δημοσιοποιήσει το αντίγραφο της επιγραφής που είχε κάνει ο Περό, μαζί με τις χαμένες χάλκινες πλάκες και άλλες λουβικές επιγραφές. Στις σημειώσεις του Μελάαρτ αναφέρεται πως η ομάδα δεν τα κατάφερε να ολοκληρώσει το έργο της πριν τα περισσότερα από τα μέλη της πεθάνουν. Ο Μελάαρτ ήταν ο τελευταίος που έμεινε, και πέθανε σε ηλικία 86 ετών. Οι ερευνητές της ελβετο-ολλανδικής ομάδας ανακάλυψαν πως είχε καταβάλει πολυετείς προσπάθειες να αποκωδικοποιήσει τα αντίγραφα των διαφορετικών λουβικών επιγραφών που είχε στην κατοχή του, ωστόσο δεν μπορούσε να διαβάσει λουβικά: Είχε μπει στην ομάδα λόγω των γνώσεών του πάνω στο αρχαιολογικό «ανάγλυφο» της δυτικής Τουρκίας. Άλλα μέλη της ομάδας ωστόσο, μπορούσαν να το κάνουν.

Αμφιβολίες

Μιλώντας στο LiveScience, επιστήμονες που δεν συμμετείχαν στην έρευνα εξέφρασαν προβληματισμούς για το ενδεχόμενο να πρόκειται για πλαστή επιγραφή, υποστηρίζοντας πως μέχρι να βρεθούν αρχεία για αυτήν που να μην προέρχονται από τον Μέλααρτ δεν μπορεί να είναι σίγουρο πως η επιγραφή υπήρξε στα αλήθεια. Οι Ζάνγκερ και Γουντχούιζεν εκτιμούν ωστόσο πως θα ήταν δύσκολο, αν όχι αδύνατο, να κάνει μια τέτοια πλαστογραφία ο Μέλααρτ ή κάποιος άλλος. Η επιγραφή είναι πολύ μεγάλη, και ο Μέλααρτ δεν μπορούσε να διαβάσει, πόσο μάλλον να διαβάσει λουβικά, όπως τονίζουν στο paper τους. Επίσης, σημειώνουν πως κανείς δεν είχε καταφέρει να αποκρυπτογραφήσει τα λουβικά μέχρι τη δεκαετία του 1950, κάτι που σημαίνει πως ούτε ο Περό θα ήταν σε θέση να την πλαστογραφήσει. Οι Ζάνγκερ και Γουντχούιζεν υπογραμμίζουν πως σήμερα ελάχιστοι είναι σε θέση να διαβάσουν λουβικά, πόσο μάλλον να γράψουν μια μακροσκελή επιγραφή. Επίσης, προσθέτουν πως δεν είναι σε θέση να σκεφτούν έναν λόγο ο Μέλααρτ να μπει στη διαδικασία να προβεί σε μια τόσο μακρά και πολύπλοκη πλαστογραφία, αλλά να την αφήσει αδημοσίευτη. Σημειώνεται πως ο Μέλααρτ είχε κατηγορηθεί κατά καιρούς για συνεργασίες με λαθρεμπόρους και υπερβολές όσον αφορά σε στοιχεία που στήριζαν τις αρχαιολογικές του απόψεις, ωστόσο ποτέ δεν κατηγορήθηκε για πλαστογραφίες.

Παρόλα αυτά, ο Ζάνγκερ είπε στο LiveScience πως, μέχρι να βρεθούν αρχεία σχετικά με την επιγραφή τα οποία δεν προέρχονται από τον Μέλααρτ, δεν μπορεί να επιβεβαιωθεί πέρα από κάθε αμφιβολία πως είναι αυθεντική και όχι πλαστή.

Ο Ζάνγκερ δημοσιεύει λεπτομέρειες σχετικά με την, πλέον αποκωδικοποιημένη, επιγραφή, σε ένα βιβλίο στα γερμανικά με τίτλο «Die Luwier und der Trojanische Krieg – Eine Forschungsgeschichte» (Orell Füssli, 2017) (Οι Λούβιοι και ο Τρωικός Πόλεμος- Η ιστορία μιας έρευνας).",Αποκρυπτογράφηση επιγραφής 3.200 ετών: Μιλά για τους μυστηριώδεις Λαούς της Θάλασσας και έναν πρίγκιπα της Τροίας,http://www.huffingtonpost.gr/2017/10/11/eidhseis-culture-apokryptografhsh-epigrafhs-3200-etwn-laoi-ths-8alassas_n_18233448.html?utm_hp_ref=greece#comments

The ‘Gone Girl’ star issued a statement on Facebook, saying he was “saddened and angry that a man who I worked with used his position of power to intimidate, sexually harass and manipulate many women over decades.”

However, the actress was left unimpressed, issuing an angry response, alleging that she told Ben personally about Harvey’s past misconduct.

Addressing him on her Twitter page, she wrote: “@benaffleck ‘GODDAMNIT! I TOLD HIM TO STOP DOING THAT’ you said that to my face. The press conf I was made to go to after assault.

Colin Bateman, who has seen the cover of his darkly comic 1995 book Divorcing Jack apparently doctored by Jones and used repeatedly by the press, said the picture has become the “ultimate stock image.”

“Nobody ever asks why on earth a Syrian terrorist would be holding a Jack Russell,” he told HuffPost UK.

Sally Jones, who was also known as the White Widow, died earlier this year in a US drone strike in Syria, according to multiple reports, including one in The Sun, which printed the oft-used picture of her on its front page.

Jones used her Twitter to recruit women and provided practical advice on how to join Isis in Syria.

She is believed to have been behind dozens of terror plots and was the leader of the secret Anwar al-Awlaki battalion’s female wing.

Reacting to news of Jones’ death on Facebook, Bateman said “she just hijacked the image, which was then itself hijacked by the world’s media”.

The nun image, one of only a handful of Jones, is often used by the media without any context, implying it is real.

Bateman, a Northern Irish screenwriter and ex-journalist, told HuffPost he was dismayed how often the media would use the picture with no context or explanation of its origin.

Sally Jones The 'nun with a gun' image of Sally Jones is actually a crude photoshop of the Divorcing Jack cover

“Nobody delves any deeper. Obviously there’s very little information about her so they grasp at what they’ve got. Nobody ever goes deep on it and asks why it’s being used or where it’s from or where it originated.

“It’s become the ultimate stock image.”

In 2014, the Daily Express ran the image under the caption: “Sally Jones in her nun and gun outfit”.

In January 2015, The Times called it an “Isis recruitment poster”.

In September 2014, The Evening Standard ran it, calling it “bizarre”.

When asked if he wanted the media to stop using it, Bateman said: “I was a journalist for 20 years. I know how it works... Sometimes it’s the easiest thing you grab [to use as a picture].

“But I just think a little bit of context is useful to have.”

HuffPost understands it was taken from one of Jones’ social media accounts when it was first reported that she had travelled with her husband Junaid Hussain to Syria to join Isis in 2013.

Twitter 'White Widow' Sally Jones has reportedly been killed in a US drone strike

He was killed by a US drone in 2015, and had reportedly been planning “barbaric attacks against the West” including terror plots targeting high profile public commemorations this summer.

Bateman believes Jones herself may have created the image. She played in an all-female punk group in the 1990s and Bateman said this coincided roughly with the time of the book’s success.

“The book was quite punky and had a lot of punk references. I presume she picked it up around then, because the image hasn’t been on the book for quite a few years, so it’s not something she’s picked up recently,” he said.

Bateman remembers first seeing the photoshopped image when he opened a newspaper and saw it on page three.

“It was just a shock,” he said. “You read into it and you realise how surreal and bizarre it is that this has come back to haunt you.”

Since then, Bateman has had no one had ever approached him over the connection between his book and the picture.

He said when he first saw it on The Daily Mail, he posted a comment pointing out the connection but had no response.

“I know it’s been used for terrible things. If in some way I’m connected to even one person being recruited to go out there. I really hate that fact,” he said.

“It’s just a bizarre connection to have. I’m just sorry if any people have suffered because of it.”

He added: “It corrupts my happy memories of the book in a way but also I’m quite proud of the image and the book, the fact that people are still talking about it 22 years after it was published.”

Bateman, who has written 33 novels and six screenplays - including the film adaptation of Divorcing Jack - said the episode may inspire him to write a novel.",Sally Jones' Reported Death Prompts 'Divorcing Jack' Author To Lament How Media Use Photoshopped Nun Image,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2017/10/12/white-widow-sally-jones-divorcing-jack_n_18246548.html?utm_hp_ref=uk

Un enjeu personnel et artistique devenu un métier pour l'artiste qui voit en ces lieux et leurs murs les vestiges du temps et les témoins de vie qui passent. Aux abords du canal de l'Ourcq, un des temples du graff, LES AMBITIEUSES est partie à sa rencontre pour comprendre comment elle a réfléchi et construit sa liberté sur les murs. Un témoignage qui s'inscrit dans une volonté de proposer un autre visage à la ville et sa société. D'en réécrire l'histoire et pourquoi pas demain!

J'ai fait la connaissance de Jessy alias Doudou Style à travers ses peintures, ses graffs qu'elle essaime et propose sur les murs. Ces fétiches pandas tout d'abord. Puis ces femmes, jeunes et moins jeunes, qu'elle peint dans des postures lascives ou combatives, des courbes chaleureuses voire énigmatiques. En m'y arrêtant, pour m'en imprégner, j'ai voulu savoir qui se cachait derrière cette intention et sa signature. J'ai voulu prendre connaissance de son parcours. Savoir ce qui avait amené l'artiste et la femme à investir les murs plutôt que des toiles. J'ai voulu découvrir un milieu et son environnement. Appréhender la ville à travers un prisme, celui de l'artiste graffeuse qui conquiert délibérément l'espace public aux yeux de tous. Pour tous.

J'ai donc fini par rencontrer Jessy à la sortie du RER, Gare du Nord. Ce même RER qui l'amenait, dix ans plus tôt, sur la voie du graffiti et ses murs.

J'ai voulu savoir ce qui avait amené l'artiste et la femme à investir les murs plutôt que les toiles.

Le regard franc et souriant, la parole sincère, Jessy me déroule sa vie au fil de ses graffs et de ses aventures pour y accéder. Comme si peindre lui avait permis d'en exorciser certaines. Comme si peindre lui avait permis d'y (re)trouver son identité. De l'affirmer. De revendiquer sa place dans la société entre ses origines martiniquaises, sa naissance à Paris, son enfance à la campagne et la vie qui va. Un parcours non sans difficultés et sacrifice personnel. Un destin urbain au féminin.

Un outil d'expression voire de revendication

Si le graffiti porte encore en lui les stigmates d'un mode d'expression jugé parfois illégal et misogyne, c'est grâce aux hommes que Jessy en est là aujourd'hui. Attirée par ces espaces d'expression grandeur nature et visibles aux yeux de tous, c'est son petit ami de l'époque qui lui permet d'intégrer un crew d'artistes graffeurs. Bien loin de la peinture sur vêtement qui marque ses débuts ou son école d'art, Jessy y fait ses premiers pas. Sur un petit coin de mur, elle s'essaie. Elle apprend la technique comme les codes spécifiques du milieu. Un milieu ancré dans une contre-culture où faire un pas de côté comme renoncer -juste un instant- peut s'avérer fatidique pour une femme. Mais la personnalité de Jessy est à la mesure de son sourire: conquérante. Elle se tient à une discipline de fer. Elle observe, à l'affût du moindre conseil pour s'améliorer et proposer un travail de qualité à ses comparses comme à la société. Elle sait qu'elle est jugée.

Et générateur de lien social

Car malgré l'accueil des débuts, Jessy n'a pas peur de le dire, il faut s'y prendre avec courage, modestie, recul et réflexion pour se faire une place. Pour se faire un nom en tant que femme et artiste dans les crews et squats qu'elle intègre au fur et à mesure de son parcours, comme dans la rue. Car voir une femme investir un mur, bombe à la main, reste encore peu ordinaire aux yeux d'une société. Mais pour Jessy, le graff est tout autre. Universel. Et parce que ce sont les actes qui font foi et l'intention qu'on y donne, elle persiste en visant l'excellence pour que son art passe bien au-delà du genre, d'une place qu'on voudrait bien lui donner.

C'est comme si peindre lui avait permis de (re)trouver son identité.

A travailler et instaurer le dialogue face à des stéréotypes de la rue et de la société, comme avec les membres de son crew, son art a fini par payer et devenir créateur de lien social.

Aujourd'hui, sa légitimité et liberté en tant que graffeuse, Jessy les doit à sa témérité comme à celle de ses prédécesseuses. Une philosophie qu'elle essaye de transmettre, à travers les murs, aux femmes mais aussi à la société en général. Un message pour tout à chacun qui oseraient s'arrêter sur une des ses œuvres.

Jessy allait faire partie de l'aventure des Ambitieuses et me donner rendez-vous rue de l'Ourcq, où elle allait faire don à la société d'une nouvelle oeuvre. Un graff qui allait devenir bien plus que des formes et couleurs associées. Il serait la marque sincère d'un message, d'une volonté de ne pas flancher devant le moindre obstacle. Le reflet de son histoire. D'un regard. D'une philosophie de vi(ll)e!

An effective affordable housing strategy.","Doing something about improving housing affordability, particularly for people on low and moderate incomes, is difficult for Australian politicians. The core of the problem is simple: until those trying to buy a home outnumber those who own one, governments will not adopt policies to bring down house prices. As John Howard once observed, no one came up to him complaining their house price had increased.

Given the public anxiety about the issue, particularly among young people, governments are showing renewed interests in doing something about housing affordability. So what sort of government interventions are effective?

A new report from the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute (AHURI), released today, explores these issues state by state. And some are clearly doing better than others.

What have governments been doing?

In the past six months governments at all levels have released housing affordability plans. The Victorian government released a broad proposal with interventions across the housing continuum (see figure 1).

The state with the largest housing affordability problem, New South Wales, released a package of measures in June this year. The cornerstone of the plan is a reduction in stamp duty charges for first home buyers and increasing availability of some grants for the same group.

Most economists agree that these measures are likely to put upward pressure on prices as first home buyers compete in the property market with more dollars. However, politicians seem to like these sort of measures because they are popular with voters.

The NSW plan also focused on increasing housing supply through changes to the planning system and accelerated provision of infrastructure. The headline goal used to measure the results of the package is an increase in the number of dwelling completions to 61,000 per year.

What's unusual about this target is that there is no indication of the intended price levels of completed dwellings. Left to the market, the supply will not reach those most in need.

A recent AHURI study found focusing only on supply as a strategy to reduce housing prices was a blunt instrument. The study reported:

Most of the growth in housing supply has been taking place in mid-to-high price segments, rather than low price segments. There seems to be structural impediments to the trickle-down of new housing supply.

The same study concluded:

Targeted government intervention might be needed in order to ensure an adequate supply of affordable housing.

How do the states compare?

Drawing on the new research, Table 1 compares established state and territory schemes designed to deliver affordable housing.

It's clear some states and territories, by adopting a multi-pronged approach, have been more active and innovative than others.

The research focused on a review of state-level affordable housing delivery. To identify what sort of conditions maximised the chances of success, this included an evaluation of two effective strategies -- one in the Australian Capital Territory and the other in Western Australia.

Both strategies delivered thousands of dwellings for households in need of affordable housing across the continuum. Both have clear targets.

What are the secrets of success?

Strong and sustained leadership is critical to both the implementation and ongoing delivery of an affordable housing strategy. Leadership is required both within the organisation responsible for the strategy, ideally a single entity, but also at a political level, ensuring a whole-of-government approach.

Both the ACT and WA strategies had the support of the treasurer during development. This ensured implementation was not hamstrung by a lack of resources.

A strategy needs to be resilient; it should not be easy to roll back following a change of government. It also needs to be developed in close consultation with the private sector and relevant areas of government to ensure all stakeholders are on board.

The organisation implementing the strategy needs to be flexible and innovative. This includes taking advantage of poor housing market conditions to develop joint ventures with the private sector.

When unexpected funding sources arise, state government needs to take advantage by using funding to leverage additional outcomes.

These established strategies offer several lessons for a state government seeking to implement an affordable housing strategy.

Land release is a key factor.

Governments have focused on a broad goal of increasing supply as an affordable housing solution, (such as the NSW strategy).

In most cases this is a blunt tool because the government cannot directly influence the amount of land or housing stock made available (which are private sector decisions) or the price at which it is released onto the market.

States with an effective government land agency have an advantage. Land release then becomes an important part of an affordable housing strategy.

The ACT has been able to increase land supply and also to target the supply at a particular price point. WA has used its land effectively within private sector joint ventures to secure affordable housing.

Being able to guarantee increased land supply (and not just planning approvals for land development) as well as the price points of that land is a very powerful tool for a government trying to deliver affordable housing.

An effective affordable housing strategy.

An effective affordable housing strategy is essential to deliver a range of supply options. At present, blockages along the housing continuum prevent households exiting social housing, which would free up supply for households in greater need.

WA in particular has demonstrated a successful strategy. Having reached its target of 20,000 dwellings five years early, the government committed to a further 10,000 homes by 2020.

Other states in the early stages of strategy implementation could learn much from the multi-pronged approach in the West.

Jahrhunderts avancierte. Denn er schrieb unter anderem die Songs für die vierköpfige Gruppe. Nach letzterem Lied wurde sogar ein Musical und der Film ""Mamma Mia!"" mit Pierce Brosnan (64) und Meryl Streep (68) benannt. Und wäre Madonnas Song ""Hung Up"" so erfolgreich geworden, hätte sie nicht Auszüge aus ABBAs Hit ""Gimme Gimme Gimme"" dafür hergenommen? Die Nachrichtenagentur spot on news hat mit Benny Andersson gesprochen und dabei verriet er, warum seine Enkelkinder das Wichtigste für ihn sind und dass er es bereut, Klavierstücke nicht direkt vom Notenblatt spielen zu können.

Herr Andersson, Sie waren Mitglied einer der erfolgreichsten Formationen des 20. Jahrhunderts. Für was sind Sie noch besonders dankbar?

Hier können Sie Benny Anderssons neues Album ""Piano"" bestellen

Benny Andersson: Ich bin für vieles dankbar. Am wichtigsten ist natürlich, dass ich gesund bin und sechs Enkelkinder habe. Aber auch, dass ich in meiner Arbeit erfolgreich und von Glück begünstigt bin, überhaupt so lange im Musik-Business arbeiten zu können.

Sie waren Hauptsongwriter für ABBA. Was ist Ihr Lieblingslied?

Andersson: Diese Frage bekomme ich oft gestellt und immer antworte ich wieder: Ich weiß es nicht, denn wenn, dann habe ich mehrere. ""Knowing Me, Knowing You"", ""Dancing Queen"" oder ""The Winner Takes It All"" sind wahrscheinlich meine drei Lieblingshits.

Ihr neues Album ""Piano"" kam kürzlich in die Läden. Spielen Sie auch privat viel Klavier oder tun Sie das mehr im Tonstudio?

Andersson: Ich spiele jeden Tag Klavier - oft von 10 bis 16 Uhr und das seit vielen Jahren. Wenn ich es satt habe meine eigene Musik zu spielen oder neue zu schreiben - dann spiele ich auch gerne Stücke von anderen Künstlern auf dem Klavier.

Was war Ihre größte Inspiration für Ihr neues Album?

Benny Andersson: Ehrlich gesagt dachte ich nur: Inzwischen habe ich so viele selbstgeschriebene Songs, dass ich davon doch einfach ein paar hernehmen könnte und diese auf dem Klavier spiele. Kein Orchester, keine Lyrics - nur ich und das Klavier - sonst nichts. Ich fing mit ein paar Songs an und irgendwann hatte ich so viele zusammen, dass sie für ein Album reichten. Ich will kein Klavierspieler sein, ich will einfach nur Musik machen.

Bereuen Sie etwas in Ihrem Leben oder Ihrer Karriere nicht getan zu haben?

Andersson: Manchmal finde ich es schade, dass ich Musik nicht professionell lesen oder schreiben kann. Ich habe mich inzwischen aber damit abgefunden, denn es funktioniert auch so - ohne diese Fähigkeit. Wenn ich zum Beispiel Stücke für große Orchester schreibe, dann helfen mir Freunde dabei, meine Arbeit für das Orchester verständlich zu machen. Ich bereue nicht, dass ich keine akademische Ausbildung habe. Manchmal vermisse ich einfach, dass ich nicht direkt vom Notenblatt Klavierstücke spielen kann. Stattdessen höre ich aber auf bestimmte Records und spiele die vom Gehör her nach.

Ist das nicht ein viel größeres Talent, Musik einfach vom Gehör nachspielen zu können?

Andersson: Vielleicht - ich lese die Musik nicht, ich habe sie einfach im Kopf. Alles was ich höre und was mir gefällt, bleibt in meinem Kopf. Ich spiele immerhin schon seit sechzig Jahren Klavier, also seit ich zehn Jahre alt bin. Also das was in meinem Kopf ist, ist gleichzeitig auch in meinen Händen. Wenn ich einen Song im Kopf habe, kann ich ihn auf dem Klavier spielen - selbst, wenn ich ihn noch nie zuvor gespielt habe.

Wenn Sie sich in einer Zeitschrift oder im Spiegel sehen - was denken Sie?

Andersson: Ich habe gelernt, mit mir und meinem Aussehen zu leben, sagen wir es so. (lacht)

Könnten Sie sich vorstellen, selbst in einem Musical wie ""Mamma Mia!"" aufzutreten?

Andersson: Ich würde nie in einer Serie oder einem Musical mitspielen. Nur über meine Leiche - ich bin kein Schauspieler.

Was war Ihre beste Erfahrung auf der Bühne?

Andersson: Meine Band ""Benny Anderssons Orkester"" und ich, wir spielen alles von schwedischer Folkmusik bis hin zu Dance-Music der 40er und 50er Jahre und auch einige ABBA-Cover. Jedes zweite Jahr spielen wir auf einem Event, zu dem 5.000-7.000 Leute kommen. Die Leute tanzen oder sitzen einfach nur auf der Wiese und hören zu - das liebe ich sehr. Es geht mir nicht um das Performen, sondern um das Musizieren an sich.

Was würden Sie Ihrem früheren Ich raten, wenn Sie die Möglichkeit dazu hätten?

How Do We Build Our Teenage Girls' Self-Esteem? Beauty and appearance are thorny issues when raising girls. Our girls are vulnerable. All it takes is one throw away comment at the wrong time and their sense of self-worth can become quickly wrapped up in this body image nightmare, which even if they don't come to it until later, is still an issue to be confronted, not trivialised or ignored.

It Takes A Special Kind Of Selflessness To Support Your Child In Their Sport The class was something my parents had signed me up for - as well as the typical football and tennis classes.

Foster Care Cuts Across Race And Religion When Child Protection Is The Highest Priority What business does a white family have caring for black children, or a Muslim family caring for a white girl? And maybe you are right. There are many families out there who are better suited than us. Yet when the call came, on a bleak November evening, we were the ones who opened our door to three children who were tired, cold and frightened. We provided warm baths and towels, hot chocolate and cookies, a bedtime story, a warm bed. We dried tears, and held little hands until sleep finally came. And we set three extra places for breakfast, in silence as we tried to understand the scale of the challenge we had just accepted. Media adviser, writer and foster carer

Why Women Should Be At The Forefront Of Preventing Radicalisation And Extremism Parity between the sexes remains one of the most vital challenges of our society and one which has the power to resolve so many inequalities and social harms.

I forget why I came upstairs; I forget what I was supposed to buy in the supermarket; I write shopping lists so I don't forget the things I was supposed to buy in the supermarket, and then I forget the list.

Some things, though, I will never forget: My first Oasis gig; Seeing the Sydney Opera House in real life; The time I received a phone call from my dad to tell me ""Your brother's not well. He's had a breakdown"".

That phone call was almost nine years ago.

Out of respect for my brother's privacy, I will not go into the details of what the catalyst was for his rapid slide into mental ill health, but just like I'm sure is the case with many others, our family did not see this coming - it was like a baseball bat had swung around and hit us right in the stomach.

""He's been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder"", was the next big update from my parents. It was the first time a label had been attached to my brother that was something different to the descriptions of him I had grown used to hearing throughout our childhood: ""Life of the party"", ""such a lovely boy"", ""always smiling"". Just like the phone call to break the news - this one is also etched into my memory. Not knowing what 'Bipolar' meant, I concentrated on the 'Disorder' part and said it in my head over and over again, trying not to be scared of the realisation that in having a disorder, someone must therefore be 'disordered'.

I will hold my hands up and confess that prior to my brother becoming unwell, my knowledge of mental ill health was largely based on films and the gossip pages of trashy magazines; i.e. not real life.

As soon as my brother had a diagnosis, I rushed to the library and started reading. I struggled to know how to offer help, so I settled for the next best thing - understanding. I wanted to learn about his condition. I wanted to know everything. This person had grown up with me, and I had looked up to him as a perfect model of everything I wanted to be ever since I can remember. I wanted back the brother I knew. In a matter of weeks he had turned into a stranger, a shell of the person I knew so well. Someone I used to spend hours talking to non-stop and now I couldn't even think of two words to say to him.

Looking back, I realise that I must've been in a state of shock for a long time. To this day, I am ashamed and angry with myself for how I dealt with the news. Not knowing what to do, I backed away entirely, for fear of saying the wrong thing or making matters worse, but days of non-communication turned into weeks, and weeks turned into months. I kept in regular contact with my parents who would give me updates on his health. Every day was a guessing game as to how he would feel and what he might be capable of doing: some days progress would mean getting dressed. Other days he would be able to go out and see friends. The phrase, 'taking each day as it comes' had taken on a whole new meaning.

Over these last nine years, my brother's illness has been like a mental health rollercoaster - except there are no comedy photos to take home on a key ring, just emotional scars carried by him, and everyone surrounding him; bitter memories of painful episodes: verbal abuse, bouts of mania, paranoia, anxiety and depression.

Having to receive verbal abuse and witness explosive episodes caused by a member of my own family because of mental ill health has been one of the most soul destroying and heart breaking things I've ever experienced. There's been times when I've been prepared to cut out my own brother because of his condition, but my understanding of it has helped me to realise that running away from someone you love who needs help can never be a positive move, no matter how hard that road is - you have to travel it together. I will carry my brother on my back forever, if that's what he needs.

Thanks to some wonderful support from the charity Mind, my brother is living mostly independently and is striving every day for good mental health. A more recent diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder sparked more trips to the library for me, but the more I read, the more I realise the accuracy of his diagnosis and have been working hard to support him in every way I can. With ageing parents and a daughter of my own to care for, I know that the road ahead will continue to be hard, as he will gradually move from being my parents' responsibility to being mine. But it fills my heart with so much hope when I see the huge difference in people's attitudes towards mental health over the last nine years and I'm confident that talking and learning will continue to help break the stigma and support all those affected by mental health (which I hope you've realised by reading to the end of this post, is everyone).

I'm really writing this so that I can share my story and open up the comments to people who may have previously been too afraid to say ""I've been there too"" ""I'm there now"" or, simply in the hope that people click the 'share' button to spread the awareness, and help erase the stigma.",Loving Someone With Mental Ill Health,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/jo-caley/he-aint-heavy-hes-my-brot_1_b_18231032.html

The Challenges Faced By A Prison Psychiatrist Severely psychiatrically unwell prisoners are people who, very likely, have been failed by services over and over again. They are very likely to have had horrific experiences (abuse seems to come as standard for the women, and even the men that I have assessed in prison). Sure, some of them have made poor choices and may have wronged others, and that can't be ignored. Nevertheless, for those who are too unwell to look out for themselves, we, as an apparently mature, developed society should step in and shoulder some of the responsibilities.

What Now For Ukip? Now searching for their fifth leader in a year, Ukip find themselves in a precarious position. An inability to present themselves as a credible ""protector"" of Brexit will only see them lose further relevance, resulting in a party that won 12.6% of the vote in 2015 becoming all but wiped out by the time of the next general election.

Anupam Kher's newest appointment has led to an outpouring of praise from most quarters, except for the one that should matter to him the most – the students of Pune's Film and Television Institute of India.

The cheerleaders are helmed by his wife Kirron Kher, fellow actor and currently member of Parliament for the Lok Sabha from Chandigarh for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at the Centre.

Congratulations my dear @AnupamPkher for becoming FTII Chairman ! Know you will do a great job ! October 11, 2017

A chorus of approval followed, typically summarised by this piece, hailing the elevation of the actor as a step in the right direction. Few would disagree with the fact that Kher has a much more illustrious career than his predecessor Gajendra Chauhan.

A member of the BJP, Chauhan was appointed to the role in 2014, a decision that was widely criticised as a politically partisan move to 'saffronise' the campus. Apart from objecting to Chauhan's ideological leanings, FTII students and alumni pointed out his singularly unimpressive output as an actor.

Compared to towering film personalities like Gulzar, Shyam Benegal and Adoor Gopalakrishnan, who were allegedly in the running for the job, Chauhan seemed like a shockingly ill-judged choice, raising suspicions of nepotism driven by a political agenda.

In Kher's case, at least his acting record is indisputably solid: over 500 films, in several languages, both in industries in India and beyond, scores of stage appearances, and an active engagement with cinema. But, as any sensible employer should know, a shining CV doesn't necessarily make for an ideal candidate.

That statement is especially true in the case of those pursuing creative professions like acting or teaching, which involve an emotional investment quite unlike the impersonal chore of, say, a book-keeper's, and the interplay of one's personal politics and belief systems in the professional sphere.

Kher's public image over the last two years, gleaned from his social media activities, smacks of a stridently pro-BJP agenda.

In 2015, when a group of writers, film personalities and artists decided to return awards conferred on them by the government to protest against the rise of intolerance in India, Kher's response was tellingly abrasive.

Some more usual suspects who never wanted @narendramodi to become PM in d first place have joined the #AwardWapsi gang. Jai Ho.:) — Anupam Kher (@AnupamPkher) October 28, 2015

Instead of engaging with the substance of the gesture by the leading lights of India's intelligentsia, Kher decided to attack them for their criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, under whose watch, as chief minister, Gujarat saw one of the worst communal riots in modern India in 2002.

What's worse, instead of choosing the path of civilised debate and dissent, Kher decided to lump them into a conglomerate — the ""#AwardWapsi gang"" — trivialising their stance and its import. It's not that the matter ended with a sly tweet and an emoticon — Kher actually took to the streets to emphasise his disdain for the lot.

But this was only the beginning.

In February 2016, with student leaders Kanhaiya Kumar and Umar Khalid of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), taking the nation to storm with their anti-establishment politics, Kher let loose another malignant remark on Twitter, comparing the young men to cockroaches and vermin that need purging from people's home. He urged for a nationwide ""pest control"" programme, piling vile allegory upon allegory.

घरों में पेस्ट कंट्रोल होता है तो कॉक्रोच, कीड़े मकोड़े इत्यादि बाहर निकलते है। घर साफ़ होता है।वैसे ही आजकल देश का पेस्ट कंट्रोल चल रहा है। — Anupam Kher (@AnupamPkher) February 20, 2016

Days later, he tweeted photographs from the JNU campus, where he addressed the students and ""purified"" it of anti-national slogans chanted earlier by crying ""Bharat Mata ki Jai"".

While love for one's country is a perfectly reasonable feeling to cherish in oneself, it is unfair to impose it as the only acceptable standard of patriotism on others. Given his fractious association with students and institutes of learning, Kher should tread with care as he takes over the running of FTII.

Kher has repeatedly baulked at the slightest hint of the criticism of the ruling government and its policies. Be it to support PM Modi's decision to demonetise high-value currencies last November, which was greeted by widespread public panic, or to abuse 20-year-old pacifist Gurmehar Kaur, he has left no stone unturned to make his allegiances known.

But aside from his right-leaning politics, there is a much bigger concern with Kher's appointment, which his troopers seemed to have conveniently overlooked. He is the founder of a private acting school in Mumbai, which presents a conflict of interest for his new role at FTII — as though being married to a politician, who is a member of the ruling government, and being appointed to run a government-backed institution wasn't problematic enough already.

Kher isn't bothered much. As he told The Quint, ""I am not worried about any clash of interest. I prioritise my various commitments in a very systematic way."" Be that as it may, the students of FTII aren't making matters easy for him.

Within 24 hours of Kher's appointment, they have written an open letter to him, outlining the glitches in the system they are plagued with. From short-term courses running for commercial gains to irregularities over the hiring of staff to the allocation of funds for purchase of equipment to the change in the syllabus, the problems are manifold and require urgent attention.

Hopefully, the new chairman, currently busy pinning tweets of gratitude and basking in the cacophony of applause around him, will pay heed to their demands before long.

“After that, indications are that by that point it will then have weakened and be no longer a hurricane or tropical storm, it will be extratropical.

“But then it will continue its way towards the British Isles, probably reaching us very early next week.”

Burkhill said cold sea temperatures mean Ophelia will not be strong enough to be categorised as a hurricane when it hits Britain.

But he added: “It’s definitely something that we are keeping an eye on, for the possibility of some disruptive weather early next week.”

The unsettled weather looks likely to continue into Tuesday due to a separate band of low pressure, and will remain changeable throughout the rest of the week.

India is one of the few countries worldwide where child marriage continues to be widely accepted--legally and socially. Despite reports suggesting that child marriage is on the decline in the country since 2001, the latest Census report on the decadal headcount in 2011 reveals that child marriage is rampant, with almost one in every three married women being below 18 years. What is worse, a whopping 78.5 lakh girls (2.3% of all women or girls who were ever married or were married in 2011) were married before they were 10 years old. Even the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) 4 data shows that 26.8% of women are married before the age of 18 years.

The high prevalence of child marriage in the first place speaks volumes of the times we live in. Even after 70 years of Independence, this discriminatory social practice remains widespread in many parts of the country and does not seem to be going away anytime soon because for the simple fact that it is a socially accepted custom in the first place.

Child marriage affects both boys and girls, however, in most cases it is the girls who are vulnerable. Child brides have a diminished chance of completing their education and are at a higher risk of being physically and sexually abused, contracting HIV and other diseases, and dying while pregnant or giving birth. Child marriage among girls perpetuates unequal community and family decision-making power, gender gaps in educational achievement and economic independence, and poor reproductive and sexual health. As per the NFHS 4, the percentage of women aged 15-19 years who were already mothers or pregnant is 6.3%.

Despite all the efforts to curb the practice, in some states, the prevalence of child marriage exceeds 60%.... thanks to a poor conviction rate and loopholes...

The Government of India has enacted the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 to prevent child marriages, as opposed to only restraining them. States/Union Territories from time to time also regularly pursue the effective implementation of the Act. Despite all the efforts to curb the practice, in some states, the prevalence of child marriage exceeds 60% with the practice being more prevalent in rural areas as compared to urban areas—thanks to a poor conviction rate and loopholes within the law and system. As per the National Crime Records Bureau data, a total number of 280, 293 and 326 cases were registered under the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act 2006 in the year 2014, 2015 and 2016 respectively.

The reasons for child marriage are complex as it is a 'mindset' problem where girls are considered a burden and her sexuality a concern. Social customs, tradition, illiteracy, poverty, low status of women in society, lack of awareness about consequences of child marriage are the other reasons that encourage the practice. In Rajasthan, for example, child marriages are a part of the fabric of society and widely accepted. In other parts of the country like Bihar and Jharkhand, child marriage is practised due to poverty and economic reasons. Recent reports of child brides being sold to rich Sheikhs from the Middle East countries have sent shock waves across the country.

To prevent child marriage in the first place, strict measures must be taken by the government on an urgent basis. At the policy front, we need to promote girls' access to quality secondary education by providing easier and safer access to quality secondary schools. We must develop stronger coordination among stakeholders such as government bodies, law enforcement officials, civil society organisations, and community leaders to create a social force that can change the norms around child marriage. We need to strengthen law enforcement as it is critical to identify and prosecute parties involved in child marriage so that the law becomes a deterrent. Lastly, and most importantly, introduce economic empowerment initiatives that empower girls and women, specifically in locations where there's a high prevalence of child marriage and marginalised communities. Addressing poverty, one of the key precipitating causes of child marriage has the potential to reduce the practice drastically.

However, not all the issues involved in child marriage can be tackled by legislative interventions alone. The role of community assumes importance as well. For example, at the local level, Community Based Organisations or non-profit groups can develop systems for regular engagement with parents of high-risk families. These can include: home visits, promote livelihood programmes, vocational and skills-based training to help delay the marriage of girls and implement community education programs that emphasise the need to respect the decisions of girls to remain unmarried if they wish. NGOs also need to ensure that overall focus on the issue is not lost and child marriage prevention is kept among the primary objectives as opposed to a secondary or tertiary objective subsumed under other social initiatives.

These programmes and policies, if implemented in an effective and timely manner, will go a long way in delaying the marriage of girls and achieving the larger goal of reducing the prevalence of child marriage. For India's child marriage epidemic to be cured, we need to creatively solve the problem, as merely enforcing laws may not be the answer.

Difficile de croire qu'internet n'a que 25 ans et l'omniprésent smartphone, dix à peine. La technologie progresse si vite que le simple fait de se tenir au courant des dernières innovations est un travail de tous les instants. Voici quelques hypothèses sur ce que pourraient devenir cinq objets technologiques du quotidien.

Le téléphone

Eu égard au bouleversement qu'il a provoqué dans notre vie de tous les jours, on a du mal à se dire que le smartphone ne nous accompagne que depuis dix ans. Mais comment va-t-il évoluer?

De l'avis général, l'appareil photo va occuper une place prépondérante et utiliser l'imagerie 3D pour développer de nouvelles fonctions telles que la reconnaissance faciale (ce que fait déjà le nouvel iPhone) et la réalité augmentée (RA) qui, à l'aide de données numériques, remanie le monde physique quand on le regarde par le biais d'un écran.

Supposons que vous ayez envie d'acheter un canapé et que vous souhaitiez voir ce qu'il donne dans votre salon: regardez simplement l'endroit de la pièce où il sera placé avec votre téléphone et vous le verrez s'y matérialiser.

Bien sûr, il sera nécessaire d'adapter la longévité des batteries au bon fonctionnement des applications récentes et plus puissantes en lien avec la RA.

L'indispensable chargement sans fil sera assuré par ce que l'on appelle la ""charge par induction"": en tirant simplement l'énergie des ports de charge environnants, notre téléphone ne sera plus jamais à plat. Avec la RA, le téléphone lui-même finira peut-être par disparaître au profit de la technologie portable que représenteront nos écouteurs, nos lunettes, voire nos lentilles de contact. Enfin une vision à la Terminator!

La voiture

L'ère de la voiture électrique (VE) a déjà commencé et d'ici une génération, ce type de véhicule deviendra la norme.

Au-delà des VE, la prochaine étape majeure sera celle des voitures sans chauffeur, dont l'arrivée prochaine ne fait aucun doute pour ceux qui travaillent dans le secteur, même si la technologie nécessite encore quelques ajustements. Notre façon d'utiliser les voitures s'en trouvera profondément modifiée.

On aura toujours la possibilité de conduire, mais l'habitacle des voitures ressemblera à un salon, un bureau, ou même une discothèque mobile...

Les vitres et le pare-brise de la voiture constitueront un support sur lequel projeter un film, une chaîne de télé ou le bureau de notre ordinateur, voire afficher des informations sur les monuments environnants grâce à la RA.

Les voitures sans chauffeur ouvrent également la possibilité d'un réseau routier entièrement synchronisé sur lequel les véhicules seront continuellement suivis par satellite et automatiquement envoyés sur un itinéraire bis par un algorithme chargé d'éviter la formation de bouchons.

On pourrait aussi avoir des voitures qui génèrent de l'énergie en roulant sur des routes réactives à l'énergie cinétique. Des cristaux piézoélectriques intégrés dans le sol, les trottoirs ou même les chaussures produisent déjà de petites quantités d'électricité quand on les presse. À plus grande échelle et placés sous des autoroutes très fréquentées, ils généreraient une part de l'électricité nécessaire au déplacement des voitures.

L'ordinateur

L'ordinateur connaît une perte de popularité ces dernières années, notamment du fait des téléphones et des tablettes, qui empiètent sur son territoire. La définition de ce qu'est un ordinateur pourrait donc encore évoluer.

Il deviendra sans aucun doute encore plus léger et plus souple que les mastodontes actuels. Peut-être même se résumera-t-il à une clé d'accès à la totalité de notre bureau, que l'on pourra brancher sur n'importe quel terminal.

Il est en tout cas certain que les innovations techniques actuelles seront présentes d'une façon ou d'une autre, qu'il s'agisse de la reconnaissance vocale ou visuelle, de la réalité augmentée ou même des dernières avancées en matière d'intelligence artificielle (IA), avec un ordinateur qui parle et fait des propositions selon notre activité ou notre humeur.

La vitesse de traitement et la mémoire restent ses principaux avantages, et elles vont continuer à croître de façon exponentielle jusqu'à l'avènement, nous assurent certains scientifiques, d'ordinateurs ""quantiques"".

""Ces technologies viendront à bout d'un problème en quelques millisecondes, là où il faudrait des années au plus rapide des ordinateurs standards"", déclare ainsi Winfried Hensinger, de l'université du Sussex.

Une autre évolution, tout droit sortie du domaine de la science-fiction, rendrait l'ordinateur personnel vraiment très personnel, en le branchant directement sur notre cerveau.

""Cela nous permettrait d'intégrer la nanoélectronique 3D dans nos circuits neuronaux"", indique Charles M. Lieber, professeur de chimie à l'université de Harvard. L'ordinateur et l'homme pourraient donc fusionner pour former un cyborg. Espérons que le simple fait de se réinitialiser suffira à résoudre ses problèmes personnels.

Internet

S'il nous paraît aujourd'hui normal d'avoir internet, sa présence dans nos vies ne fait que débuter. Pensez par exemple aux endroits où il faut se battre pour obtenir un signal Wifi: à l'avenir, le degré de couverture et de connectivité permettra un accès constant et fluide.

Qui plus est, la Toile sera présente dans toutes sortes d'objets domestiques, grâce à l'Internet des objets (IdO). Les réfrigérateurs commanderont à manger, notre réveil dira à la machine à café quand préparer notre cappuccino matinal, et le lave-linge triera automatiquement les vêtements tout en choisissant le meilleur moment pour lancer la machine (quand l'électricité est la moins chère).

Internet constituera le ciment de la ville intelligente, en permettant par exemple le transfert d'énergie entre les transports en commun et les immeubles selon leur usage, ou en faisant circuler les camions de pompiers et les ambulances (sans chauffeur) sur des voies fluides à travers des agglomérations encombrées.

L'inconvénient? Les questions relatives à la vie privée seront encore plus pressantes quand nos activités et nos habitudes seront suivies 24 h/24.

La télé

Ah, notre bonne vieille télé. Dans le monde ubérisé et high-tech d'aujourd'hui, elle ferait presque figure de relique surannée. Mais, bien que l'on passe désormais une grande partie de notre temps les yeux rivés sur un écran qui tient dans la paume de notre main, la plupart d'entre nous aiment encore regarder des films sur un écran suffisamment grand pour s'immerger dans l'action.

Il existe déjà des télés ultraplates, comme le modèle OLED TV Wallpaper de LG, dont certaines sont si légères qu'elles peuvent être fixées au mur par des aimants.

Dans le futur, les télés pliables que l'on peut enrouler, un peu comme un poster, puis dérouler une fois arrivés à destination s'imposeront.

Il est aussi probable qu'allumer la télé consistera plutôt à afficher une image sur un support quelconque, la télé du futur étant remplacée par un mini-projecteur, permettant peut-être un affichage 3D sans lunettes.

Electrify the World est une initiative de Nissan. Pionnier des véhicules 100% électriques, Nissan estime qu'il est nécessaire d'agir dès à présent afin d'assurer l'avenir des générations futures.

Ein ziemlicher Klotz, groß, schwer und wuchtig. Zumindest bei uns hat sich BMW mit dem Fünfer GT nicht viele Freunde gemacht. Deutlich besser sah es allerdings im Rest der Welt aus, vor allem im Reich der Mitte. Die Chinesen liebten den ""dicken Bayern"" wegen seines präsenten Auftritts und den großzügigen Platzverhältnissen. Der Nachfolger, ab November im Handel, könnte sich auch bei uns in die Herzen fahren. Schlank und elegant, flacher, länger und leichter. Als hätte er eine erfolgreiche Diät mit anschließendem Fitness-Training hinter sich. Da macht es von der Marketing-Seite her nur Sinn, auch gleich den Namen zu ändern: Sechser Gran Turismo. Das klingt nach gediegenem Langstreckenkomfort und stilvollem Reisen. Aber Halt! Gibt es nicht schon ein Sechser Gran Coupé? Stimmt, ist aber anders positioniert. Zudem wird es nur noch kurze Zeit gebaut und dann durch die neue Achter-Baureihe ersetzt.

Ein Kofferraum wie ein Kleiderschrank

Der Sechser Gran Turismo basiert auf der gleichen Architektur wie Fünfer und Siebener. Vom Flaggschiff erhielt er den langen Radstand von 3,07 Metern. Entsprechend fürstlich sind die Platzverhältnisse im Fond. Business-Class. Damit dürften sogar chinesische Direktoren und Minister zufrieden sein. Doch damit nicht genug. Der Kofferraum fasst üppige 610 Liter, ein Plus von 110 Litern. Gut einen Meter breite Gegenstände können bequem hineingeschoben werden. Keine Ladekante stört, alles ist eben wie der Esszimmertisch zu Hause. Neu ist die Fernentriegelung der Sitzlehnen vom Kofferraum aus. Fallen sie nach vorne, wächst die Ladekapazität auf gigantische 1.800 Liter. Das schaffen manche Kombis in dieser Klasse nicht, inklusive des hauseigenen Bruders Fünfer Touring. Wer also vom Design her Kombis nicht zu seinen Favoriten zählt, ist mit dem Sechser Gran Turismo bestens bedient. Etwas Gewöhnung verlangt lediglich die Handhabung mit der Gepäckabdeckung. Normalerweise hakt man einfach das Rollo aus. BMW wählte jedoch erstmals zwei Hartschalen, hat für diese aber unter dem Ladeboden ein spezielles Fach vorgesehen, in das die beiden Teile exakt eingesteckt werden können.

Der 6er kann selbstständig überholen und parken

Hinter dem Lenkrad heißt es sofort: Willkommen zu Hause. Das bekannte BMW-Cockpit glänzt durch gute Übersicht, leichte Bedienung und exzellente Verarbeitung. Premium-Segment eben. Für das auch entsprechende Preise aufgerufen werden. Beim Sechser Gran Turismo beginnt der Spaß bei 62.300 Euro (630i). Dafür gibt es wohlgemerkt ""nur"" einen Vierzylinder mit zwei Liter Hubraum. Leistung: 258 PS. Souveräner und geschmeidiger geht da natürlich der Sechszylinder-Reihenmotor (3,0 Liter Hubraum) im 640i zu Werke (68.100 Euro). Klangbild, Elastizität und Leistungsentfaltung machen das 340-PS-Aggregat zur ersten Wahl für dieses Auto. Es sei denn, man steht auf Diesel und dessen extrem bulliges Drehmoment. Schon der 630d schickt maximal 620 Newtonmeter in die Achtgang-Automatik, setzt selbst kleine Gaspedalbewegungen unmittelbar in Vortrieb um. Ende des Jahres will BMW noch den 640d nachreichen, mit gleichem Hubraum, aber gut 20 Prozent mehr Leistung sowie zehn Prozent mehr Drehmoment.

Was Fahrkomfort, Agilität und Handling angehen, muss eigentlich kein Wort mehr verloren werden. Der Sechser Gran Turismo grenzt hier an Perfektion. Die Hinterachse hat serienmäßig Luftfederung. Gegen Aufpreis gibt es eine komplette Luftkissenbettung, dazu Aktivlenkung und Wankstabilisierung. Und natürlich hält die Preisliste ein ganzes Bündel an Assistenzsystemen parat. Zu den jüngsten Errungenschaften zählen der Staupilot, dessen Zeitraum für die automatische Wiederanfahrt auf 30 Sekunden verlängert wurde, das selbstständige Überholen auf der Autobahn, das ferngesteuerte Parken per Display Schlüssel und die Gefahrenwarnung durch Vernetzung mit anderen BMW-Fahrzeugen.

Ohnehin spielt BMW beim Thema Konnektivität in der Champion-League. Wie beim Fünfer und Siebener wird auch der Sechser Gran Turismo zum rollenden Mobilitätsassistenten. Das Auto zeigt einem in Echtzeit Staus und freie Parkplätze an. Die Routenplanung zu Hause am PC lässt sich direkt ins Cockpit übertragen. Der Fahrer erhält sogar automatisch Nachricht, früher zu starten, weil sich zwischenzeitlich die Verkehrssituation geändert hat. Und Geschäftspartner oder die Ehefrau können von unterwegs per SMS benachrichtigt werden, falls es später werden sollte als vereinbart. Wirklich aufmerksam, diese neuen Assistenten.
