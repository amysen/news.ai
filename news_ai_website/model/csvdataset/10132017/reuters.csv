Coordinated Rohingya insurgent attacks on 30 security posts on Aug. 25 sparked a ferocious military response in the Muslim-majority northern part of Rakhine state that the United Nations has said was ethnic cleansing.

A committee led by military Lieutenant-General Aye Win has begun an investigation into the behavior of military personnel, the office of the commander in chief said on Friday, insisting the operation was justified under Buddhist-majority Myanmar’s constitution.

According to a statement posted on Senior General Min Aung Hlaing’s Facebook page, the panel will ask, “Did they follow the military code of conduct? Did they exactly follow the command during the operation? After that (the committee) will release full information.”

Myanmar is refusing entry to a U.N. panel that was tasked with investigating allegations of abuses after a smaller military counteroffensive launched in October 2016.

But domestic investigations - including a previous internal military probe - have largely dismissed refugees’ claims of abuses committed during security forces’ so-called “clearance operations”.

Thousands of refugees have continued to arrived cross the Naf river separating Myanmar’s Rakhine state and Bangladesh in recent days, even though Myanmar insists military operations ceased on Sept. 5.

Aid agencies now estimate that 536,000 people have now arrived in Cox’s Bazar district, straining scarce resources of aid groups and local communities.

About 200,000 Rohingya were already in Bangladesh after fleeing persecution in Myanmar, where they have long been denied citizenship and faced restrictions on their movements and access to basic services.

In comments to Japan’s ambassador carried in state media on Friday, Min Aung Hlaing denied ethnic cleansing was taking place on the grounds that photos showed Muslims “departing calmly rather than fleeing in terror”.","Myanmar army opens probe amid reports of killings, abuse of Rohingya Muslims",https://www.reuters.com/article/myanmar-rohingya/myanmar-army-opens-probe-amid-reports-of-killings-abuse-of-rohingya-muslims-idINKBN1CI1KV

SMBC Nikko Securities said in a note to clients that investors in Kobe Steel face a prolonged period of uncertainty.","TOKYO (Reuters) - The cheating crisis engulfing Kobe Steel Ltd (5406.T) just got bigger.

Chief Executive Hiroya Kawasaki on Friday revealed that about 500 companies had received its falsely certified products, more than double its earlier count, confirming widespread wrongdoing at the steelmaker that has sent a chill along global supply chains.

The scale of the misconduct at Japan’s third-largest steelmaker pummeled its shares as investors, worried about the financial impact and legal fallout, wiped about $1.8 billion off its market value this week.

As the company revealed tampering of more products, the crisis has rippled through supply chains across the world in a body blow to Japan’s reputation as a high-quality manufacturing destination.

A contrite Kawasaki told a briefing the firm plans to pay customers’ costs for any affected products.

“There has been no specific requests, but we are prepared to shoulder such costs after consultations,” he said, adding the products with tampered documentation account for about 4 percent of the sales in the affected businesses.

Yoshihiko Katsukawa, a managing executive officer, told reporters that 500 companies were now known to be affected by the tampering.

Kobe Steel initially said 200 firms were affected when it admitted at the weekend it had falsified data about the quality of aluminum and copper products used in cars, aircraft, space rockets and defense equipment.

Asked if he plans to step down, Kawasaki said: “My biggest task right now is to help our customers make safety checks and to craft prevention measures.”

PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES

Boeing Co (BA.N), has some of the falsely certified products, a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters, while stressing that the world’s biggest maker of passenger jets does not consider the issue a safety problem.

More than 30 non-Japanese customers had been affected by the firm’s data fabrication, the Nikkei newspaper reported on Friday.

A Kobe Steel spokesman said the companies received its products but would not confirm they had any of the falsely certified components.

Nuclear power plant parts are the latest to join the list of affected equipment as Fukushima nuclear operator Tokyo Electric Power (9501.T) (Tepco) said on Friday it had taken delivery of pipes from Kobe Steel that were not checked properly.

The pipes were delivered to its Fukushima Daini station, located near the destroyed Fukushima Daiichi plant, but have not been used, Tepco said, adding it was checking all its facilities.

Faulty parts have also been found in Japan’s famous bullet trains that run at speeds as high as around 300 kilometers (180 miles) per hour and a space rocket that was launched in Japan earlier this week. One bullet train operator has already said it will seek compensation from Kobe Steel.

The government has ordered Kobe Steel to address safety concerns within about two weeks and report on how the misconduct occurred in a month.

CREDIBILITY ‘ZERO’

No safety issues have yet been identified in the unfolding imbroglio.

Kobe Steel shares fell nearly 9 percent on Friday and have fallen more than 40 percent since the scandal broke.

The steelmaker faces a range of legal risks, including compensation sought by clients or their customers, penalties for violating unfair competition laws for false representation, shareholder lawsuits for the fall in the company’s stock price and class lawsuits from overseas customers seeking punitive damages, a lawyer, specializing in corporate laws and risk management, said.

“It is hard to predict the extent of legal costs,” said Motokazu Endo, a lawyer at Tokyo Kasumigaseki law office.

“We cannot rule out the possibility that this will shake Kobe Steel to its foundation.”

The company has forecast a profit for the year through March 2018 after two successive annual losses.

Kobe Steel was founded in 1905 and has been a pillar of Japan’s manufacturing sector. Such are its establishment bona fides that Shinzo Abe, the prime minister and scion of a political dynasty, worked at the company decades ago, before entering politics.

But those credentials have been shattered, a point amplified by CEO Kawasaki who earlier said the credibility of the firm “has plunged to zero.”

Kobe Steel said it was examining possible data falsification going back 10 years - a familiar echo of a string of other cheating scandals involving Japan inc.

The corrosive business practices have raised broader questions over corporate governance in Japan, and cast doubt on the integrity of a manufacturing industry once the envy of the world.

Previous cases in Japan involving falsified data included Nissan Motor (7201.T), Mitsubishi Motors (7211.T) and Takata Corp., which filed for bankruptcy this year over faulty airbags that were blamed for 17 deaths and scores of injuries.

In 2015, it was revealed that Toyo Tire & Rubber (5105.T) fabricated data to secure government approval for materials to absorb shocks from earthquakes. Conglomerate Toshiba Corp (6502.T) is still battling the fallout of a scandal over reporting inflated profits.

SMBC Nikko Securities said in a note to clients that investors in Kobe Steel face a prolonged period of uncertainty.

“It will likely continue to be extremely difficult to make judgments on creditworthiness and investment until the safety of the products and the extent of damages are clarified.”","As crisis at Kobe Steel deepens, CEO says cheating engulfs 500 firms",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kobe-steel-scandal/kobe-steels-cheating-engulfs-more-divisions-shares-resume-slide-idUSKBN1CI097

TORONTO (Reuters) - Hackers continue to target the SWIFT bank messaging system, though security controls instituted after last year’s $81 million heist at Bangladesh’s central bank have helped thwart many of those attempts, a senior SWIFT official told Reuters.

“Attempts continue,” said Stephen Gilderdale, head of SWIFT’s Customer Security Programme, in a phone interview. “That is what we expected. We didn’t expect the adversaries to suddenly disappear.”

The disclosure underscores that banks remain at risk of cyber attacks targeting computers used to access SWIFT almost two years after the February 2016 theft from a Bangladesh Bank account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

Gilderdale declined to say how many hacks had been attempted this year, what percentage were successful, how much money had been stolen or whether they were growing or slowing down.

On Monday, two people were arrested in Sri Lanka for suspected money laundering from a Taiwanese bank whose computer system was hacked to enable illicit transactions abroad. Police acted after the state-owned Bank of Ceylon reported a suspicious transfer.

SWIFT, a Belgium-based co-operative owned by its user banks, has declined comment on the case, saying it does not discuss individual entities.

Gilderdale said that some security measures instituted in the wake of the Bangladesh Bank heist had thwarted attempts.

As an example, he said that SWIFT had stopped some heists thanks to an update to its software that automatically sends alerts when hackers tamper with data on bank computers used to access the messaging network.

SWIFT shares technical information about cyber attacks and other details on how hackers target banks on a private portal open to its members.

Gilderdale was speaking ahead of the organization’s annual Sibos global user conference, which starts on Monday in Toronto.

At the conference, SWIFT will release details of a plan to start offering security data in “machine digestible” formats that banks can use to automate efforts to discover and remediate cyber attacks, he said.

SWIFT will also unveil plans to start sharing that data with outside security vendors so they can incorporate the information into their products, he said.",SWIFT says hackers still targeting bank messaging system,https://www.reuters.com/article/cyber-heist/swift-says-hackers-still-targeting-bank-messaging-system-idINKBN1CI1ED

Some 5,800 migrants had arrived at the center since fighting broke out last month in the coastal city of Sabratha, previously a launch pad for crossings to Italy. About 2,000 people have already been sent on from Gharyan to other centers in the capital, Tripoli.

“The situation is very tragic...disastrous. There’s a lack of support,” said Abdulhameed Muftah, who runs Al-Hamra dentition center in Gharyan, about 80 km (50 miles) south of Tripoli.

The clashes in Sabratha resulted in the withdrawal of an armed group that said it had begun blocking migrant departures from Sabratha, under intense pressure from Italy. Sabratha was previously the foremost smuggling hub for migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean.

U.N. agencies have been struggling to provide support for thousands of mainly sub-Saharan African migrants stranded after the fighting.

Many have been taken to centers such as the one in Gharyan, which are nominally controlled by the U.N.-backed government but notorious for widespread abuse and poor conditions. Humanitarian workers have limited access.

Muftah said there were many children and some pregnant women in the center, several of whom had given birth since arriving.

“We appeal to all international organizations and the Libyan state to consider the humanitarian condition of these migrants,” he said.

“I call on the government to establish alternatives to detention in Libya, to halt the practice of arbitrary detention, and to ensure accountability for the abuses perpetrated against migrants in detention centers,” he said in a statement on Thursday.

Bruno Mars led with eight nominations, including Artist of the Year, the top accolade of the night. He will face hip hop stars Drake and Kendrick Lamar, British singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran and electro-pop DJ duo The Chainsmokers - each of whom landed five nominations - for the coveted award.

The women of pop music failed to land nominations in categories such as Artist of the Year, Video of the Year and Tour of the Year.

Pop star Halsey, one of the few female artists to land nominations for her collaboration with The Chainsmokers on the hit song “Closer,” tweeted on Thursday that she was “really disappointed” at the male-dominated nominees list.

“so many incredible female artists have released this year. hoping the coming award shows give them the credit that is due to them,” she said.

Halsey landed two nominations, in the favorite pop/rock song and collaboration of the year categories for “Closer,” but did not land any solo nominations despite having had a chart-topping album earlier this year.

Notable omissions include Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus, Lorde, Demi Lovato, Lana Del Rey and Kesha, all of whom released new songs and albums this year, as well as Taylor Swift, who released a high-concept video in August for her single “Look What You Made Me Do.”

The AMA nominees are selected through measurements on fan interactions across Billboard Magazine and Billboard.com, which include figures from music sales, touring, streaming and radio airplay and social activity from Sept. 9, 2016 to Sept. 14, 2017, organizers said.

The failure by Prime Minister Theresa May to win a parliamentary majority in last week's election has pushed the world's fifth largest economy toward a level of political uncertainty not seen since the 1970s.

May called the election to secure a mandate for her vision of a “hard Brexit” -- driving down migration by taking Britain out of the single market and the customs union.

Instead, she got a hung parliament in which no single party has a majority. Business leaders demanded a re-think.

“The UK has had a reputation, earned over the generations, for stability and predictability in its government,” a senior executive at a multi-national company listed on the London FTSE 100 told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

“That reputation in 12 months has been destroyed, truly destroyed. First by Brexit and now through this election.”

A survey by the Institute of Directors (IoD) found only 20 percent of its nearly 700 members were now optimistic about the British economy over the next 12 months, compared with 57 percent who were quite or very pessimistic.

The IoD survey, taken after the election, found a negative swing of 34 points in confidence in the economy from its previous survey in May.

“It is hard to overstate what a dramatic impact the current political uncertainty is having on business leaders, and the consequences could – if not addressed immediately – be disastrous for the UK economy,” said Stephen Martin, director general of the IoD.

The collapse in confidence, which follows a short-term drop after last year’s Brexit vote, coincides with a slowdown in the wider economy that has taken hold since the start of this year, as rising inflation pushes up the price of goods.

Figures from credit card firm Visa showed British consumers turned more cautious even before the shock election result, with households cutting their spending for the first time in nearly four years last month.

The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) warned there was now a risk businesses would cut back on investment which has largely held up since last year’s Brexit vote.

And the trade group that represents manufacturers, the EEF, said its members were having to navigate the most uncertain political territory in Britain for decades.

Both groups called on the government to rethink its approach to Brexit, saying the country needed tariff-free access to the single market and a steady flow of migrant workers.

Some executives hoped the political paralysis would lead to a ‘softer Brexit’, with access to markets prioritized over a clamp down on immigration.

“Here we are again: another bolt from the blue, a political earthquake that we didn’t think used to happen in the UK,” CBI Director General Carolyn Fairbairn said at a conference hosted by the Resolution Foundation.

“But I do think there are opportunities in this, and it is an opportunity to refocus back on the economy to talk about jobs, growth, future prosperity.”

Having slid to its lowest for nearly two months against the dollar on Friday, the pound fell broadly again on Monday.

LEFT IN LIMBO

Business executives warned the political uncertainty could be felt across a wave of sectors.

Leaders of the drugs industry warned of the hazards of government limbo at a critical time for the highly regulated sector as companies seek clarity on the rules that will govern their business after Brexit.

Andy Bruce, the CEO of Lookers (LOOK.L), one of Britain’s biggest car dealerships, said the lack of a clear result meant the highly successful industry had now entered “uncharted waters” in terms of how many new cars it could sell.

And Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP (WPP.L), the world’s largest advertising agency, told Reuters he feared increased economic uncertainty, which meant “weak investment and postponement of decision making.”

“Now it seems that we could have no deal because of the short time fuse and lack of decisive government decision making, or a soft Brexit, the latter with more movement and membership of the single market,” he said.

Bankers, at the heart of London’s huge financial center, cautioned of the impact on takeover activity.

“So long as uncertainty is there I don’t see that as particularly positive for M&A in the short term,” Karen Cook, chairman of investment banking at Goldman Sachs said at the Reuters Global M&A summit.

Gareth Vale, marketing director at recruitment group Manpower, said its clients were very apprehensive, and had not yet fully grasped the impact that Brexit would have.

“I think the uncertainty around Brexit, and more recently the general election, has created a sense of almost inertia, which has prevented them from considering some of the bigger seismic shifts that are on the horizon.”",Business confidence plummets as political crisis grips Britain,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-economy/business-confidence-plummets-as-political-crisis-grips-britain-idUSKBN1931P9

(Reuters) - Firefighters face another round of dry, windy conditions on Friday as they battle wildfires that have killed at least 31 people in Northern California and left hundreds missing in the heart of wine country.

The most lethal wildfire event in California’s history has killed people while they sleep in their beds and prompted authorities to evacuate thousands of residents, warning anyone deciding to wait it out: “You are on your own.”

The toll from the more than 20 fires raging across eight counties could climb, with more than 400 people in Sonoma County alone still listed as missing.

Winds of up to 60 mph (100 kph) and humidity of just 10 percent will create “critical fire weather conditions” and “contribute to extreme fire behavior” on Friday afternoon and into Saturday, the National Weather Service said.

A force of 8,000 firefighters is working to reinforce and extend buffer lines across the region where the flames have scorched more than 190,000 acres (77,000 hectares), an area nearly the size of New York City.

With 3,500 homes and businesses incinerated, the so-called North Bay fires have reduced whole neighborhoods in the city of Santa Rosa to smoldering ruins dotted with charred trees and burned-out cars.

The cause of the disaster is under investigation, but officials said power lines toppled by gale-force winds on Sunday night may have sparked it.

The Napa Valley town of Calistoga faces one of the biggest threats and its 5,000-plus residents were ordered from their homes as winds picked up and fire crept closer.

Calistoga Mayor Chris Canning said anyone refusing to heed the mandatory evacuation would be left to fend for themselves if fire approached, warning on Thursday: “You are on your own.”

Sonoma County accounted for 17 of the North Bay fatalities, all from the Tubbs fire, which now ranks as California’s deadliest single wildfire since 2003.

Some people killed were asleep when flames engulfed their homes, fire officials said. Others had only minutes to escape as winds fanned fast-moving blazes.

Mark Ghilarducci, state director of emergency services, said the loss of cell towers likely contributed to difficulties in warning residents.

As many as 900 missing-person reports have been filed in Sonoma County and 437 have since turned up safe. It remains unclear how many of the 463 still unaccounted for are fire victims rather than evacuees who failed to alert authorities, Ghilarducci said.

The fires struck the heart of the world-renowned wine-producing region, wreaking havoc on its tourist industry and damaging or destroying at least 13 Napa Valley wineries.

California’s newly legalized marijuana industry also was hit hard, with at least 20 pot farms in Sonoma, Mendocino and Napa counties ravaged, said Hezekiah Allen, executive director of the California Growers Association.",California wildfires kill at least 31 as wind continues to fan flames,https://in.reuters.com/article/california-fire/death-toll-rises-to-31-in-california-wildfires-hundreds-missing-idINKBN1CH2B8

In August, fires raging in a remote region of British Columbia choked Vancouver and Seattle with smoke. That month, more than a million acres in Montana burned, forcing schoolchildren to stay inside. In September, terrifying images circulated of fires smoldering in the background of everyday scenes like an airport tarmac in Burbank, California and a golf course in Oregon.

The toll of these fires is the product of bad land use, especially over-development at the perimeter of forests, and subsequent fire suppression efforts that protect those developments at the expense of a vital natural cycle. If U.S. and Canadian authorities don’t adopt the right policies, wildfires will only become more deadly.

Seyed Hossein Mousavian: What Trump needs to know about Iran

Following a wet and snowy winter in the West, many hoped this year would see minimal wildfires. But a hot, dry summer that set heat records even in normally-chilly San Francisco destroyed that optimism. This year is no fluke: large wildfires have become more common and damaging in recent years. In 2015, Washington State saw its worst wildfire season on record, including the largest fire in state history. In 2013, a rapidly escalating wildfire in Arizona killed 19 members of an elite firefighting squad. Climate scientists predict that global warming will make wildfires worse as less mountain snowpack and hotter, drier summers conspire to create more conflagrations.

The issue is most acute in the western areas of North America because the region’s rapidly growing population, proliferation of rural vacation homes, and suburban sprawl means more and more people are building too close to forests. From 1960 to the early 2000s, the U.S. population living in what’s known as the “wildland-urban interface,” the locations where homes and businesses butt up against a fire-prone natural environment – think of a subdivision in an Arizona canyon or a cluster of mountain cabins in Colorado surrounded by thick forest – has ballooned by 720 percent, from 25 to 140 million people. According to the U.S. Forest Service, 60 percent of new home construction since 1990 is located in this dangerous zone. As Montana Public Radio, reporting on the wildfire season, described it, “There’s an unquenchable demand for home construction in and near wildfire-prone areas.”

While heavily-forested landscapes are precisely the draw for constructing a cute cabin in the woods or relocating to a small town in the shadow of a tree-lined ridge, they are also increasingly dangerous places for people to live and towns to grow. When human lives and property are under threat, state and local jurisdictions have an obligation to respond. That costs a lot of money – this year has already proven to be the most expensive wildfire season in Montana since 1999, adjusted for inflation – and risks the lives of courageous firefighters.

Just like the need for stricter land-use regulations in the wake of coastal flooding from this season’s devastating hurricanes, it’s time for state and local governments to stop allowing people to live cheek-by-jowl with wildfire-prone vegetation and hold accountable those who take the risk. After all, when local firefighting budgets are exhausted, as they quickly are in heavy fire seasons, the U.S. Forest Service picks up the slack at a cost to all taxpayers. Even worse, voters in some areas with a history of past fires have rejected special assessments to pay for the extra fire prevention and response measures that their lifestyle requires, forcing the cost onto their neighbors who don’t live in fire zones.

Currently, just two states – California and Oregon – have mandatory mitigation measures that require structures in fire-prone zones to be built with fire-resistant materials and homeowners to clear vegetation a certain radius away from the building to prevent fire from engulfing a structure.

Stricter rules are a good first step, but the bigger problem is the people who are living near wildlands in the first place. National Geographic reports that the number of housing units within half a mile of a national forest grew from 484,000 in 1940 to 1.8 million in 2000.

Wildfires serve an important role in ecosystems, clearing underbrush and debris and allowing healthy trees to flourish. When more people live in or near forests, firefighters are ordered to suppress blazes near those houses, disrupting the natural wildfire cycle and making future fires even worse by building up the store of dry vegetation.

Low-density, sprawling development is the chief culprit. Outward expansion happened around every major U.S. city, but the consequences are the most severe in the fire-prone western United States. Many of the major cities with the lowest population densities, such as San Diego, Salt Lake City and Phoenix, are found in the West. Even supposedly eco-friendly West Coast burgs like Portland and Seattle are more spread out than East Coast cities such as Boston or Philadelphia. “In the last half century, about one-fifth of the American people have moved into flame zones, insufficiently aware of the perils awaiting them and inadvertently testing the limits of nature’s tolerance,” writes former National Park Service director Roger Kennedy in “Wildfire and Americans: How to Save Lives, Property, and Your Tax Dollars.”

The West’s historical draw may be as an escape valve from crowded eastern cities, but it’s time to retire that outdated narrative. Westerners who aren’t working the land need to live in dense housing in or near cities, not on big lots out at the edge of a wild forest. There are risks even if that forested hillside is close to the central city – like the Oakland hills, where California’s deadliest fire raged in 1991. Perversely, homeowners there used insurance payouts to build even bigger houses in the hills, though thankfully insurance companies are finally wising up and even refusing to re-insure in fire-prone areas.

The forest should be for visiting and maybe staying overnight in a tent, not for living in permanently. When the smoke from British Columbia made life unbearable in my Seattle apartment over the summer, I retreated to the cleaner air of Olympic National Park. The beautiful temperate rainforest would be a heavenly place for a cabin if I could afford one, but the responsible course of action is to follow the old hiker’s maxim: take only pictures, leave only footprints.",Commentary: There’s a way to reduce the wildfire toll.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenyan police shot dead two people and wounded a third when a crowd tried to storm a police station during an opposition protest against a looming presidential vote re-run, a senior official said.

Around 20 youths attempted to take over the station during an otherwise peaceful rally in the town of Bondo in the southwest county of Siaya, forcing officers to open fire, County Commissioner Josephine Onunga said by phone.

Police also used teargas to break up small demonstrations in Kenya’s three main cities - Kisumu, the capital and the port of Mombasa - defying a government ban on rallies in city centers.

Kenya’s supreme court nullified the presidential election in August, citing procedural irregularities and voiding the victory of President Uhuru Kenyatta, opening the way to a repeat vote on Oct. 26.

But opposition leader Raila Odinga has refused to take part, saying the re-run should not happen until wide-ranging reforms were brought in to prevent a repeated failure.

Related Coverage Kenya police shoot dead 2 protesters amid opposition demonstrations

The election board has said the polls will go ahead anyway, pitting Kenyatta against six other candidates, none of whom polled more than 1 percent in the August election.

Odinga told Reuters that he might consider returning to the Supreme Court for clarification on whether the Oct. 26 poll was legal.

PROVOCATIONS

“As far as we are concerned, that (original Supreme court) ruling is still valid,” Odinga said during a visit to London.

“What we are demanding is that the electoral commission should respect the Supreme Court and carry out elections in accordance with the ruling.”

He supported protesters’ right to demonstrate, he said, but he has so far stopped short of calling people onto the streets himself.

Martin Kimani, the Director of the National Counter Terrorism Centre, said the opposition was trying to manufacture a crisis.

“A lot of those provocations or demonstrations taking place is an attempt to create the appearance of a crisis,” he said. “There is a clear process on how to hold an assembly – it is about maintaining law and order.”

In Nairobi, opposition legislators were repeatedly teargassed as they tried to drive into the city center.

“We are asking Uhuru’s government to ... let us protest in peace and truth and we are saying we want change and we do not want Uhuru and his people,” said protester Mellen Kirumbo.

In Kisumu, a stronghold of Odinga support, protesters reacted angrily when police turned water cannon on them to prevent them from entering the city center.

“Our demonstrations have a (valid) basis and are peaceful,” said Odinga supporter Hezron Tirus Aloyo. “We condemn the directive ... on the limitation of our rights to demonstrate.”",Kenya police shoot dead two during opposition protest: commissioner,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-kenya-election/kenya-police-shoot-dead-two-during-opposition-protest-commissioner-idUKKBN1CI102?il=0

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Amazon Studios chief Roy Price was put on an immediate leave of absence Thursday, the company said, following allegations that he harassed a producer and ignored an actress’s claim of a sexual assault by producer Harvey Weinstein.

The Hollywood Reporter on Thursday reported an allegation by Isa Hackett, a producer on one of Amazon.com Inc’s shows, that Price had lewdly propositioned her in 2015.

Amazon said in a statement: ”Roy Price is on leave of absence effective immediately. We are reviewing our options for the projects we have with The Weinstein Co.”

Hackett did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reuters could not independently confirm the allegation. Price could not immediately be reached independently by Reuters and he declined to comment to the Hollywood Reporter.

Price’s removal creates uncertainty about the studio’s direction when Amazon is investing more on video content than ever before - some $4.5 billion this year.

The studio’s Chief Operating Officer Albert Cheng will step in as the interim chief, Amazon said.

Hackett is the daughter of famed science fiction author Philip K. Dick, whose book “The Man in the High Castle” served as the basis for Amazon’s eponymous show.

Also on Thursday, actress Rose McGowan said on Twitter that she had told Price that she had been assaulted by Weinstein, who was forced out of his company this week following reports in the New Yorker and the New York Times that he had harassed and assaulted numerous women over the years. In tweets directed at Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, she criticized the company for doing business with the Weinstein Co.

A spokeswoman for Harvey Weinstein said: “Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein.”

Price has been integral to Amazon’s movie business, helping steer it through an attempt to crowd-source television scripts and garnering Hollywood awards for shows such as “Transparent.”

Amazon hopes original movies and TV shows will draw new people to join its streaming and shopping club Prime, and in turn buy more goods from the online retailer.

(Reuters) - Washington has dramatically increased tensions in talks to renew the North American Free Trade Agreement by proposing that the lifespan of any new deal be limited to five years, people familiar with the negotiations said on Thursday.

The proposal for a so-called sunset clause - just one of a series of U.S. initiatives that are opposed by NAFTA partners Canada and Mexico - only served to increase uncertainty about the future of the deal.

Two sources with direct knowledge of the talks described the atmosphere as “horrible” and highly charged.

The U.S. side proposed the sunset clause late on Wednesday during the fourth of seven scheduled rounds to update the rules governing one of the world’s biggest trade blocs, said two officials, who asked not to be identified because the talks are confidential.

The Trump administration says the clause, causing NAFTA to expire every five years unless all three countries agree it should continue, is to ensure the pact stays up to date.

But Mexico and Canada insist there is no point updating the pact with such a threat hanging over it, arguing the clause would stunt investment by sowing too much uncertainty about the future of the agreement.

“It’s a source of total uncertainty,” said one of the NAFTA government officials.

Speaking in Mexico City, Finance Minister Jose Antonio Meade said the government was working on plans to alter tariffs and identify substitute markets in case the NAFTA talks failed.

His remarks and the tension around NAFTA helped push the peso down 1 percent against the U.S. dollar to a five-month low.

U.S. President Donald Trump says NAFTA, originally signed in 1994, has been a disaster for the United States and has frequently threatened to scrap it unless major changes are made.

Business and farm groups say abandoning the 23-year-old pact would wreak economic havoc, disrupting cross-border manufacturing supply chains and slapping high tariffs on agricultural products. Trade between the United States, Canada and Mexico has quadrupled under NAFTA, now topping $1.2 trillion a year.

In addition to the sunset clause, the United States wants to boost how much North American content autos must contain to qualify for tax-free status and eliminate a dispute settlement mechanisms that Canada insists must stay.

Some trade observers said it is difficult to see how negotiators could reach an agreement given U.S. demands that many see as non-starters.

The head of Unifor, Canada’s largest private sector labor union, said it was clear the United States did not want a deal.

“NAFTA is not going anywhere. This thing is going into the toilet,” Jerry Dias told reporters on Thursday.

Despite clear signs of impatience from Canada in particular, U.S. negotiators have yet to submit their proposal on rules of origin for the auto sector. That looked unlikely to come before Friday, another official familiar with the talks said.

Trump on Wednesday repeated his warnings that he might terminate the pact and said he was open to doing a bilateral deal with either Canada or Mexico.

He was speaking alongside Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who later said Canada was “braced” for Trump’s unpredictability.

Negotiators were also set to cover the difficult issue of government procurement on Thursday.

Canada and Mexico want their companies to be able to bid on more U.S. federal and state government contracts, but this is at odds with Trump’s “Buy American” agenda. U.S. negotiators have countered with a proposal that would effectively grant the other countries less access, people familiar with the talks say.

On automotive rules of origin, NAFTA negotiators face tough new U.S. demands to increase regional vehicle content to 85 percent from 62.5 percent, with 50 percent required from the United States, according to people briefed on the plan.

The rules of origin demands are among several conditions that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has labeled “poison pill proposals” that threaten to torpedo the talks.",U.S. hikes tensions in NAFTA talks with call for 'sunset clause',https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1CH2EO-OCATP

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks advanced for a fourth straight day on Friday on expectations of broad-based global growth, while the dollar was on course for its worst week in five as investors awaited U.S. inflation data.

MSCI’s world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up 0.1 percent after hitting record highs on Thursday.

Earlier in Asia, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan hit a 10-year high.

European shares rose to their highest level in nearly four months, helped by some well-received earnings updates. The pan-European STOXX600 rose 0.3 percent and was set for its fifth straight week of gains as were world stocks.

Germany’s DAX index was up 0.1 percent, just below an all-time high hit in the previous session, while Britain’s FTSE eased back 0.1 percent after a record close on Thursday.

Wall Street futures indicated a positive open for the S&P 500 index.

“We’re seeing positive economic news even in the midst of so called geopolitical risk, I think investors are generally more optimistic right now,” said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA, referring to strong corporate earnings.

“Earnings in the second quarter were very positive, and looking beyond the impact of hurricanes, it seems like there’s improved fundamentals in the U.S. and Europe.”

Emerging market stocks were buoyant too as another 0.2 percent rise set their latest 6-year peak.

In currencies, the dollar stayed on the defensive after minutes from the last U.S. Federal Reserve meeting showed policymakers remained divided on U.S. inflation prospects.

The index which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies was flat ahead of consumer price inflation data, due at 1230 GMT.

“Abating political risks in the U.S. and growing Fed rate hike bets have pushed the dollar higher in recent weeks,” Credit Agricole strategists said in a note.

“With a December rate hike almost fully priced in by now, however, investors are starting to focus on the Fed’s still cautious forward guidance and hence the limited scope for a further increase of the dollar’s rate advantage.”

NEW FED CHIEF

On top of the near-term inflation readings, investors are looking at whom U.S. President Donald Trump will nominate as successor to Fed Chair Janet Yellen, whose term expires next February.

White House Chief of Staff John Kelly said on Thursday that Trump was “some time away” from making a decision, while another official said Trump had met with Stanford University economist John Taylor -- of economics text book Taylor-rule fame -- to discuss the job.

Meanwhile, the euro was flat but still set for its biggest weekly rise in a month. [FRX/]

European Central Bank policymakers broadly agreed to extend asset purchases at a lower volume at their October policy meeting with views converging on a nine-month extension, sources at the central bank told Reuters.

Britain’s pound rose to a 10-day high, boosted by a report in Germany’s Handelsblatt newspaper that the European Union could offer Britain a two-year transitional Brexit deal. [GBP/]

The most eye-catching move, however, was from digital currency Bitcoin as it soared by as much as 7.4 percent after Thursday’s 13 percent gain, to hit a record high of $5,846. It is up more than 450 percent this year.

The chief financial officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co said the firm was open-minded about the future potential use of digital currencies, appearing to dial back comments last month from his boss, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, who said bitcoin was a “fraud”.

Among commodities, copper prices held firm after hitting a one-month high on Thursday as optimism over the demand outlook from major consumer China fuelled buying.

London copper futures were at $6,898.50 a tonne, up 0.2 percent on the day.

Oil prices also climbed after data showed both U.S. crude production and inventories had declined. Crude was set for its sixth weekly rise in the last seven weeks. U.S. crude jumped 2 percent to $51.59 a barrel. Brent crude rose 2.2 percent to $57.50 a barrel.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is likely to take a major step against the international nuclear deal with Iran on Friday, laying out a more aggressive approach to Iranian activities in the Middle East that risks upsetting U.S. relations with European allies.

“It is time for the entire world to join us in demanding that Iran’s government end its pursuit of death and destruction,” Trump said in a White House statement that flagged key elements of the strategy.

He is to present his plan in a 12:45 p.m. EDT (1645 GMT)speech at the White House, the product of weeks of internal discussions between him and his national security team.

U.S. officials said Trump was expected to announce that he will not certify the 2015 nuclear accord between Iran and six world powers, one he has called the “worst deal ever” as it was not, in his view, in the U.S. national interest.

Trump found himself under immense pressure as he considered de-certifying the deal, a move that would ignore warnings from inside and outside his administration that to do so would risk undermining U.S. credibility abroad.

He had formally reaffirmed it twice before but aides said he was reluctant to do so a third time.

De-certification would not pull the United States out of the deal but would give the Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions on Tehran that were suspended under the pact, negotiated during the administration of President Barack Obama.

Michael McCaul, chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Homeland Security Committee, told Reuters he thinks Trump “is likely to not completely pull out of the deal, but decertify compliance.”

If Washington quits the deal, that will be the end of it and global chaos could ensue, Iran’s influential parliament speaker, Ali Larijani, was quoted by the Russian news agency TASS as saying during a visit to St Petersburg on Friday.

“FOOTPRINTS ON THE GROUND”

U.N. nuclear inspectors say Iran is in compliance with the accord, which limited the scope of Iran’s nuclear program to help ensure it could not be put to developing bombs in exchange for a lifting of international sanctions on Tehran.

Trump says Tehran is in violation of the spirit of the agreement and has done nothing to rein in its ballistic missile program or its financial and military support for the Lebanese Shi‘ite movement Hezbollah and other militant groups.

White House Chief of Staff John Kelly said on Thursday the U.S. approach toward Iran is to work with allies in the Middle East to contain Tehran’s activities.

“We have footprints on the ground, naval and Air Force is there to just demonstrate our resolve, our friendship, and try to deter anything that any country out there may do,” Kelly told reporters.

European allies warn of a split with the United States over the nuclear agreement, in part because they are benefiting economically from a relaxation of sanctions.

A variety of European allies, including the leaders of Britain and France, have personally appealed to Trump to re-certify the nuclear accord for the sake of allied unity.

Germany’s government pledged on Friday to work for continued unity if Trump de-certified the deal as Berlin remain convinced the agreement was an important tool to prevent Iran developing nuclear weapons.

Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel underlined German views in a telephone call with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson late on Thursday, his spokeswoman Maria Adebahr told reporters.

Gabriel said on Thursday U.S. behavior was driving a wedge between Europe and its close ally United States and bringing Europeans closer to Russia and China. “It’s imperative that Europe sticks together on this issue,” said Gabriel.

Russian President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said on Friday that if the United States ditched the nuclear pact, “this will damage the atmosphere of predictability, security, stability and non-proliferation in the entire world”.

U.S. MOVE AGAINST REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS

McCaul said he expected Trump also to announce some kind of action against the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IGRC), the country’s most powerful security entity. Trump is under a legal mandate to impose U.S. economic sanctions on the Revolutionary Guards as a whole by Oct. 31 or waive them.

U.S. sanctions could seriously hurt the IRGC as it controls large swaths of Iran’s economy. The Guards’ foreign paramilitary and espionage wing, the Quds Force, is under U.S. sanctions, as is the Quds Force commander, other officials and associated individuals and entities.

The deputy Quds commander, Brigadier-General Esmail Ghaani, was quoted by Iran’ Tasnim news agency on Friday as saying Trump’s threats would “damage” the United States.

“We are not a war-mongering country. But any military action against Iran will be regretted...We have buried many...like Trump and know how to fight against America,” Ghaani said.

“EMBARRASSMENT”

The 2015 nuclear agreement, signed by the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China, the European Union and Iran, has been denounced by Trump as “an embarrassment”.

European officials have categorically ruled out renegotiating the deal but have said they share Trump’s concerns about Iran’s destabilizing influence in the Middle East.

China has said it hopes the agreement will stay intact.

Israel, Iran’s arch-adversary in the Middle East, welcomed Trump’s anticipated announcement on Friday but voiced doubt that the tougher tack by Washington could turn around the Islamic Republic.

The International Atomic Energy Agency concluded that Iran secretly researched a nuclear warhead until 2009, which Tehran denies. Iran has always insisted its uranium enrichment activity is for civilian energy purposes, not for atomic bombs.

The threat of new U.S. action has prompted a public display of unity from rival factions among Iran’s rulers.

Daisy Bautista inseriu uma meia no buraco do braço da irmã, e o homem que a ajudava apertou um cinto ao redor da ferida. Esta improvisação pode ter salvado a vida de Paola, evitando a perda de sangue que é a principal causa de mortes por ferimento.

Paola, uma californiana fã de música country, é uma das muitas vítimas de um ataque a tiros em Las Vegas que foram beneficiadas pelo uso de uma técnica de salvamento de vidas polêmica e de vários séculos de existência que está sendo retomada, o torniquete.

Embora exista desde a Idade Média, o torniquete ganhou má fama nas últimas décadas por causa dos temores de que aumente o risco de amputações. Agora essa percepção deu lugar a um novo consenso médico, segundo o qual é melhor salvar uma vida do que um membro do corpo, e a indícios colhidos recentemente nos campos de batalha mostrando que atualmente o risco de amputação é bastante baixo.

A nova visão ganhou aceitação mais ampla no meio médico depois do massacre de 2012 na escola de ensino fundamental Sandy Hook, no Estado norte-americano de Connecticut. Seguindo uma diretiva do então presidente norte-americano Barack Obama para encontrar maneiras de aumentar a sobrevivência em ataques do tipo, um grupo de médicos publicou o “Consenso Hartford”, um compêndio de práticas e diretrizes ideais com destaque para um pedido de reabilitação do torniquete.

Desde então, mais de 200 mil policiais de grandes cidades dos Estados Unidos foram treinados para usar a técnica de salvamento de vidas de baixo custo. O Conselho de Segurança Nacional, juntamente com grupos de assistência emergencial e de ferimentos, lançou a campanha “Estanque o sangramento” para divulgar o treinamento entre civis. Shopping centers e aeroportos começaram a instalar conjuntos de controle de sangramento, incluindo torniquetes, em paredes perto de desfibriladores de emergência.

“Queremos transformá-lo no próximo RCP (ressuscitação cardiopulmonar)”, disse Ian Weston, paramédico e diretor-executivo da American Trauma Society.

A má reputação do torniquete tem alguma base em fatos, já que, quando um membro fica muito tempo sem fluxo de sangue e a função não pode ser restaurada, a amputação pode ser necessária -- mas hoje em dia a maioria das vítimas de ferimentos recebe ajuda antes de o torniquete se tornar um perigo.","Rejeitados por décadas, torniquetes ajudaram a salvar vidas após massacre em Las Vegas",https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idBRKBN1CI1OD-OBRWD

Puigdemont made a symbolic declaration of independence on Tuesday night, only to suspend it seconds later and call for negotiations with Madrid.

Spain’s Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has given him until Monday to clarify his position - and then until Thursday to change his mind if he insists on a split - threatening to suspend Catalonia’s autonomy if he chooses independence.

But far-left Catalan political group CUP called on Puigdemont to make an unequivocal declaration of independence in defiance of the deadlines.

“If (the central Madrid government) wants to continue to threaten and gag us, they should do it to the Republic that has already been claimed,” the party said.

The CUP only holds 10 seats in the 135-seat Catalan parliament. But Puigdemont’s minority government relies on its support to push through legislation and cannot win a majority vote in the regional parliament without its backing.

The wealthy region’s intention to break away after a referendum has plunged Spain into its worst political crisis since an attempted military coup in 1981 and could hurt economic growth targets for next year, the deputy prime minister said.

ECONOMIC RISK

“If there were no quick solution to this issue we should be forced to lower expectations of economic growth for the year 2018,” Soraya Sainz de Santamaria said on Friday.

Sources close to the Catalan government said Puigdemont and his team were working on an answer to Rajoy though they declined to say what line he would take.

The CUP statement echoes the position expressed late on Thursday by influential pro-independence civic group Asamblea Nacional Catalana which said: “Given the negative position of Spain toward dialogue, we ask the regional parliament to raise the suspension (on the declaration of independence).”

But the leader of Puigdemont’s party, Artur Mas, who served as the region’s president until 2016 and is still believed to influence key decisions, said on Friday declaring independence was not the only way forward.

“If a state proclaims itself independent and cannot act as such, it’s an independence that is merely aesthetic,” he told Catalan television TV3.

“The external factor must be taken into account in the decisions that will be made from now on,” he said.

The European Union, the United States and most other world powers have made it clear they wanted Catalonia to remain within Spain.

“If we allow Catalonia - and it is none of our business - to separate, others will do the same. I do not want that,” Jean Claude Juncker said in a speech at Luxembourg University.","Allies press Catalan leader to declare full independence, ignore Madrid deadlines",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-politics-catalonia/allies-press-catalan-leader-to-declare-full-independence-ignore-madrid-deadlines-idUSKBN1CI19X?il=0

Under his watch, Trump parted ways with chief strategist Steve Bannon and other top officials, while new restrictions were set to streamline meetings and material for the president.

But reports of both Kelly’s and the president’s frustrations have persisted, sparking continued speculation of pending shakeups.

Trump has confided to friends that he has felt constrained by some of Kelly’s moves to limit access to him and some administration officials have privately chafed at the restrictions as well, sources familiar with the internal dynamics of the White House have said.

Disarray within the executive branch has concerned officials outside the administration. Republican Senator Bob Corker has said Kelly is one of three officials including Secretary of Defense James Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson as “those people that help separate our country from chaos.”

He later told the New York Times that Trump risked setting the nation “on the path to World War Three.”

Critics of the president say his frequent use of Twitter has contributed to a sense of chaos.

But the retired Marine made clear that he did not see his job as the arbiter of Trump’s tweets, pushing back at criticism that his penchant for order and organization had not extended to control over the president’s favorite mode of social media communication.

“I was not brought to this job to control anything but the flow of information to our president so that he can make the best decisions,” Kelly told reporters.

“I was not sent in to or brought in to control him and you should not measure my effectiveness as a chief of staff by what you think I should be doing,” he said.","White House chief of staff not quitting, says job is not to control Trump",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-kelly/white-house-chief-of-staff-not-quitting-says-job-is-not-to-control-trump-idUSKBN1CH2P6

OTTAWA (Reuters) - The number of job vacancies in Canada rose in the second quarter compared to the year before, with more openings seen broadly across regions and sectors, data from Statistics Canada showed on Thursday.

There were 460,000 jobs open in the second quarter, up 17.2 percent from the second quarter of last year. The job vacancy rate, which measures the share of unfilled jobs out of those available, rose to 2.9 percent from 2.5 percent.

A higher job vacancy rate often points to economic growth. Canada has seen robust job gains over the past year amid a strong economy that has prompted the Bank of Canada to raise interest rates twice in 2017 so far.

Job vacancies in the second quarter rose in nearly all the provinces, led by Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia, which have seen strong economic growth.

The number of job openings also rose in Alberta, which is recovering from the collapse in oil prices. The mining, quarrying and oil and gas sector saw some of the biggest increases in job vacancies, which is consistent with recent employment gains in the sector, the statistics agency said.

The Trump administration on Friday disclosed the date of the subsidies cutoff after announcing late on Thursday the most dramatic action the president has taken to undercut Democratic former President Barack Obama’s signature 2010 healthcare law.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the administration will not make the next payment to insurers scheduled for next Wednesday. The payments cost $7 billion this year and were estimated to be $10 billion in 2018, according to congressional analysts.

Trump has made the payments, guaranteed to insurers under Obamacare to help lower out-of-pocket medical expenses for low-income consumers, each month since taking office in January. But he has repeatedly threatened to cut them off and disparaged them as a “bailout” for insurance companies.

The move drew swift condemnation from congressional Democrats, who accused Trump of sabotaging the law, and threats from Democratic state attorneys general in New York and California to take legal action.

Trump, a Republican who promise as a candidate last year to dismantle the law formally called the Affordable Care Act, urged opponents to reach out to him to make a deal.

“The Democrats ObamaCare is imploding. Massive subsidy payments to their pet insurance companies has stopped. Dems should call me to fix!” Trump said in a post on Twitter early on Friday, calling the law “a broken mess.”

Shares of hospitals and health insurers fell in premarket trading on Friday after Trump’s decision. Shares of Anthem Inc, Molina Healthcare Inc, Cigna Corp and Centene Corp, which are all offering plans on Obamacare markets for 2018, were all lower.

Trump has been frustrated by the failure of his fellow Republicans who control Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare despite seven years of promises to get rid of the law that has brought health insurance to 20 million people.

His decision is likely to please those in his hard-line conservative political base who detest the Affordable Care Act, which many Republicans have attacked as an unneeded government intrusion in Americans’ healthcare.

In a nod to that same constituency, the president signed an executive order on Thursday intended to make it easier for Americans to buy bare-bones health insurance plans exempt from Obamacare requirements.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi derided the subsidies cut-off in a joint statement, saying Trump would single-handedly push Americans’ healthcare premiums higher.

‘SPITEFUL ACT’

“It is a spiteful act of vast, pointless sabotage leveled at working families and the middle class in every corner of America,” they said. “Make no mistake about it, Trump will try to blame the Affordable Care Act, but this will fall on his back and he will pay the price for it.”

Insurers and proponents of Obamacare have implored Trump for months to commit to making the payments. Several insurers have cited uncertainty over the payments when hiking premiums for 2018 or exiting insurance markets altogether.

About 10 million people are enrolled in the plans via the law’s marketplace. Many of them receive subsidies, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.

The White House said late on Thursday that it could not lawfully pay the subsidies anymore. A White House statement said that based on guidance from the Justice Department, “the Department of Health and Human Services has concluded that there is no appropriation for cost-sharing reduction payments to insurance companies under Obamacare.”

“In light of this analysis, the Government cannot lawfully make the cost-sharing reduction payments,” it said.

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said he was prepared to lead other attorneys general in a lawsuit.

The payments were the subject of a lawsuit brought by House Republicans against the Obama administration that alleged they were unlawful because they needed to be appropriated by Congress. A judge ruled in favor of the Republicans, and the Obama administration appealed the ruling.

The Trump administration took over the lawsuit and had delayed deciding whether to continue the Obama administration’s appeal or terminate the subsidies, but in April Trump began threatening to stop the payments.

That case became more complicated in August when a U.S. appeals court allowed 16 Democratic state attorneys general to defend the payments and have a say in the legal fight.

In a court filing released on Friday, Sessions argued that while the law provided funds for tax credits it did allow cost-sharing payments for insurers. It was in that court filing that he announced next week’s cutoff date.

Meanwhile, the political turbulence has affected insurers’ decisions. Anthem, one of the largest remaining Obamacare insurers, in August scaled back its offerings in Nevada and Georgia and blamed the moves in part on uncertainty over the payments.

Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina earlier this year raised premiums by more than 20 percent, but said it would have raised premiums by only about 9 percent if Trump agreed to fund the payments.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that cutting off the payments would cause premiums to rise 20 percent in 2018, and that 5 percent of Americans would live in areas that do not have an insurer in the individual market in 2018.

Trump has taken other steps to undermine Obamacare. Last week, his administration allowed businesses and non-profit organizations to seek religious and moral exemptions from Obamacare’s mandate that employers provide coverage for women’s birth control.

The administration also slashed the Obamacare advertising and outreach budget and halved the open enrollment period.","Trump scraps key Obamacare subsidies, urges Democrats to fix 'broken mess'",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-healthcare/trump-scraps-key-obamacare-subsidies-urges-democrats-to-fix-broken-mess-idUSKBN1CI0E4?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices recorded their biggest increase in eight months in September as gasoline prices soared in the wake of hurricane-related production disruptions at oil refineries in the Gulf Coast area, but underlying inflation remained muted.

The mixed report from the Labor Department on Friday comes as Federal Reserve officials have been engaged in a vigorous debate on the inflation path and suggests a December interest rate increase is not a done deal.

As a result, the dollar fell against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S Treasuries rose. U.S. stock index futures rose. Policymakers could, however, find solace from another report indicating that the economy was swiftly recovering from the damage inflicted by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, with a strong rebound in retail sales last month.

“The firmness in retail sales should override the enduring mystery of low inflation to spur a December Fed rate hike,” said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.

The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index increased 0.5 percent last month after advancing 0.4 percent in August. September’s rise was the biggest since January and pushed up the year-on-year gain in the CPI to 2.2 percent from 1.9 percent in August. The increase in the CPI was broadly in line with economists’ expectations.

Gasoline prices surged 13.1 percent last month, accounting for 75 percent of the rise in the CPI. The increase in gasoline prices was the largest since June 2009 and followed a 6.3 percent advance in August.

The Labor Department said Harvey was reported to have impacted refinery capacity in the Gulf Coast and was likely a factor in last month’s increase in gasoline prices.

Outside gasoline, price pressures were benign. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, consumer prices gained 0.1 percent in September as the increase in rental accommodation slowed and the cost of new motor vehicles and medical care declined.

The so-called core CPI rose 0.2 percent in August. In the 12 months through September, the core CPI increased 1.7 percent. The year-on-year core CPI has now increased by the same margin for five consecutive months.

INTENSE INFLATION DEBATE

The Fed tracks the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy. The core PCE has consistently undershot the U.S. central bank’s 2 percent target for more than five years. Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said that temporary factors such as one-off price cuts by wireless telephone companies are holding back inflation.

Minutes of the Fed’s Sept. 19-20 meeting published on Wednesday showed ”many participants expressed concern that

the low inflation readings this year might reflect not only transitory factors, but also the influence of developments that could prove more persistent.”

Last month, food prices rose 0.1 percent after a similar gain in August. Owners’ equivalent rent of primary residence rose 0.2 percent after advancing 0.3 percent in August. Prices for new motor vehicles fell 0.4 percent as manufacturers resort to deep discounting to eliminate an inventory overhang.

There were also decreases in the cost of medical care, apparel, and household furnishings. But the cost of mobile phone services rose 0.4 percent after 14 straight months of declines.

In a separate report on Friday, the Commerce Department said retail sales jumped 1.6 percent in September likely as reconstruction and clean-up efforts in areas devastated by Harvey and Irma boosted demand for building materials and motor vehicles.

Retail sales were also buoyed by a surge in receipts at service stations, which reflected higher gasoline prices. Last month’s increase in retail sales was the largest since March 2015

Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales increased 0.4 percent last month after being unchanged in August. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product.

The rebound in core retail sales suggests the drag on the economy from the hurricanes will probably be modest. Economists estimate the storms could subtract at least six-tenths of a percentage point from third-quarter GDP growth.

The economy grew at a 3.1 percent annualized rate in the April-June period.","Gasoline buoys U.S. consumer prices, underlying inflation tame",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-inflation/gasoline-buoys-u-s-consumer-prices-underlying-inflation-tame-idUSKBN1CI1NZ?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

O Brasil tem observado nos últimos anos um crescimento no número de startups de tecnologia, mas embora o segmento apresente mais força para avançar que anos anteriores, os obstáculos para investidores e empreendedores seguem consideráveis, segundo empresários do setor.

A evolução do mercado é impulsionada pelo desenvolvimento de tecnologias como a computação em nuvem, que barateou custos e ampliou a capacidade de processamento e armazenamento de dados dessas empresas. O mercado nacional também se beneficiou do aumento global de investimentos em tecnologia provenientes de investidores de risco após a crise financeira de 2008.

”A partir da crise de 2008, tivemos uma expansão dos investimentos no setor de tecnologia em geral. (...) Aqui no Brasil a gente sente isso pelo crescimento expressivo no número de aceleradoras, fundos de investimentos e valores investidos”, disse Jorge Vargas Neto, presidente-executivo da fintech Biva.

Segundo dados da Associação Brasileira de Startups (ABStartups), que representa as companhias do setor, em 2012, a entidade reunia 2.519 startups de todo o país. Em 2016, esse número saltou para 4.273 empresas.

Só no Estado de São Paulo, a agência de fomento de investimentos em pequenas e médias empresas, a Desenvolve SP, que investe em fundos de participação desde 2011, registra aportes de 262,9 milhões de reais em 42 empresas de tecnologia, por meio de cinco fundos geridos em parceria com outras instituições.

“Esses fundos veem uma janela de oportunidade num mercado consumidor muito grande, com um talento ainda inexplorado”, disse Eduardo Lins Henrique, cofundador e vice-presidente sênior de desenvolvimento de negócios da Movile, empresa criadora do serviço de entrega de comida iFood e que atua no segmento de startups há cerca de 20 anos.

A retomada da economia prevista para 2018 pode trazer perspectivas melhores para o setor, tanto pelo esperado aumento no poder aquisitivo dos consumidores brasileiros, quanto por fatores macroeconômicos que incluem a inflação controlada e juros em baixa.

“O investidor brasileiro está acostumado a instrumentos de renda fixa. Com um cenário de retração da Selic, esses investidores vão buscar alternativas mais rentáveis, então ganha força o mercado de capitais”, disse Vargas Neto.

Mas o país ainda precisa trabalhar para que o segmento se desenvolva mais, como ocorre em outros países.

“O mercado de startups do Brasil é infinitamente mais maduro e promissor do que era quando a gente começou (nos anos 1990). Nós temos muito mais investidores olhando para o mercado, fundos nacionais e internacionais investindo, temos muito mais anjos custeando e fazendo investimentos, temos mais histórias de sucesso, mais incubadoras. É suficiente? Não”, disse Eduardo, da Movile.

Para os empresários, é fundamental fomentar a mentalidade empreendedora no país, seja por meio do ensino em faculdades, ou do exemplo de casos de sucesso. A falta de exemplos nacionais de startups com alta valorização de mercado, os chamados “unicórnios”, também é considerado um fator que desestimula empreendedores e investidores em empresas de tecnologia do país.

“É bem importante a gente ter um caso de unicórnio com retorno sobre o investimento para validar essa tese de que vale a pena investir em startups no Brasil”, disse Vargas Neto, da Biva.

IMPOSTOS E CRIATIVIDADE

Um dos problemas que desestimulam diretamente o investimento em empresas de tecnologia do país é a carga tributária, que cresceu neste ano depois que a Receita Federal editou medida para cobrar de investidores-anjo 15 a 22,5 por cento de imposto sobre o rendimento gerado por recursos aportados em startups.

“O governo precisa entender melhor isso (startups). Quando eu vi que o governo aumentou impostos para investidores-anjo eu falei ‘meu Deus do céu’. O governo precisa atrair e não espantar esse tipo de gente. O nosso país precisa ter mais credibilidade como um todo”, disse o cofundador da Movile.

“A parte de impostos é uma completa loucura. O sistema tributário é extremamente complicado e a carga tributária é insana. A burocracia de trazer e tirar dinheiro (do país) é super complicada”, acrescentou.

Para sobreviver a esse ambiente hostil à inovação, algumas startups aprenderam a se adaptar às dificuldades do mercado nacional e encontraram no exterior canal para seu crescimento.

A Magnamed, startup criada em 2005, desenvolveu o ventilador hospitalar portátil Oxymag, que pode ser usado em bebês, crianças ou adultos e viu na exportação saída para a demora de dois anos para receber a aprovação regulatória para seu produto no Brasil.

“A gente nasceu exportando o produto. Só depois, em meados de 2011, a gente conseguiu o registro do produto na Anvisa (Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária)”, disse um dos sócios fundadores da Magnamed, Wataru Ueda.

A partir disso, a companhia passou a considerar o tempo para a aprovação regulatória, normalmente mais longo na área de saúde, como parte do processo de desenvolvimento de seus produtos. “A gente já está acostumado e isso faz parte do nosso cronograma de desenvolvimento de produtos. Já não enxergamos mais como um entrave”, disse Ueda.

Segundo ele, a Magnamed aproveitou o fôlego obtido com cerca de 20 milhões de reais em financiamentos levantados nos últimos anos junto a diversas fontes - desde instituições voltadas à pesquisa, como Fapesp e CNPq, até fundos de capital de risco, como Criatec, apoiado por BNDES; e Vox Capital. Atualmente, a empresa exporta para mais de 50 países e deve gerar lucro pela primeira vez ano que vem.","Ecossistema para startups se fortalece no Brasil, mas obstáculos permanecem",https://www.reuters.com/article/internetNews/idBRKBN1CI1NL-OBRIN

Although versions of this legislation had been introduced in prior years, the bill did not go anywhere while President Barack Obama stood ready to veto it. But now that President Donald Trump, whose actions have demonstrated hostility to civil rights, occupies the White House, the proposal presents a real risk of passage. If Republicans in Congress do eviscerate the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), it will be the culmination of their recent abandonment of the bipartisan consensus in favor of inclusion and equality for disabled persons.

Although the partisan divide in Washington has often seemed unbridgeable, disability rights long united lawmakers. Republican President George H.W. Bush referred to the ADA, which he signed in 1990, as one of his “proudest achievements.” The law guaranteed that people with disabilities would have access to, and be free from discrimination by, employers, businesses, and government agencies. In 2008, after a series of court decisions that gave a narrow reading to the ADA, a Democratic Congress passed amendments to the ADA reasserting the statute’s broad coverage - and President George W. Bush signed it.

The Trump administration is hacking away at disability rights online and in the workplace, while Trump and congressional Republicans work to gut funding for programs people with disabilities rely on such as Medicaid. The partial ADA-repeal bill is only the most overt assault on disability rights - the culmination of a shift that began when, in December 2012, 38 Republican senators denied the two-thirds vote needed for ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which was modeled on the ADA and ardently supported by disabled GOP luminaries such as former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole. But while that action was merely symbolic red meat for their base – conservatives worried it would inhibit homeschooling and infringe U.S. sovereignty - this new proposal could cause tangible and long-lasting harm.

The current bill, misleadingly titled the “ADA Education and Reform Act of 2017,” would render largely unenforceable key ADA requirements that businesses be accessible to disabled consumers – requirements that they provide ramps instead of stairs where possible, that doorways be wide enough for wheelchairs and so forth.

For wheelchair users, a single step – or a door that is a bit too narrow – can be the barrier that prevents them from patronizing a store. A few inches can make the difference between being full participants in civic and economic life and being dependent on others and shut off from the community.

Businesses have had 27 years to learn about and conform to the ADA’s requirements. But too many still fail to comply with the law, because enforcement relies principally on suits by disabled individuals. Wheelchair users, blind persons, and other people with disabilities encounter inaccessible businesses on a daily basis. According to 2016 Department of Labor statistics, only 31.2 percent of working-age Americans with disabilities had jobs, compared to 76.4 percent of working-age nondisabled Americans. The failure of employers, including stores and restaurants, to provide required accommodations is one of the key reasons for this persistent gap. Surveys show inaccessibility also causes people with disabilities to eat out less often.

The ADA does not give a disabled customer the right to receive damages for a denial of service, just an injunction that requires the owner to remove the barrier. This limitation already creates an incentive for inaccessible businesses to wait until they are sued before complying. Under the bill that recently passed the judiciary committee, the incentive to wait and see will be even greater. The proposal would prevent a disabled person from suing a business that violates the ADA as long as the business makes “substantial progress in removing the barrier,” within six months of being notified. A business might be able to avoid ever complying with the ADA or facing a lawsuit. It’s a system designed to allow businesses to delay until the victim runs out of energy or money to keep pursuing them.

Sponsors of the “ADA Education and Reform Act,” such as Texas Republican Ted Poe, say that the bill is necessary to stop unscrupulous lawyers from bringing frivolous or abusive ADA cases against small businesses. But state bars, and individual judges, already have ample authority to sanction attorneys who engage in such unprofessional conduct. And the ADA itself protects the interests of business owners by providing that an existing facility need not remove accessibility barriers unless doing so is easy to accomplish without significant expense.

Rather than protecting legitimate business interests, the bill pending in Congress would give a reprieve to enterprises that have had 27 years to comply with the law but have not yet done so. That is a betrayal of the basic promise of the ADA – that people with disabilities would be treated as equal citizens, with full access to America’s civic and economic life.

It is just the latest Republican betrayal of the historic bipartisan support for disability rights. In the Trump administration, attacks on disability rights have accelerated. Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ Justice Department has already reversed course in a key lawsuit, prosecuted by the Obama administration, involving the rights of disabled workers to retain their jobs. The White House has also signaled a halt to the Obama-era efforts to adopt regulations ensuring that the Internet is accessible to blind people and others with disabilities.

Perhaps the biggest threat to disability rights isn’t even in the realm of civil rights law, but healthcare: the GOP’s endless efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and cut funding for Medicaid. If they succeed Republicans would remove benefits that allow people with disabilities to access health insurance and home health services. Instead of staying in their communities and possibly working, many would be institutionalized. Trump has also proposed in his budget to cut drastically into Social Security Disability Insurance, the only source of income for millions of Americans unable to work.

Bale sustained the injury towards the end Real’s 3-1 win at Borussia Dortmund on Sept. 26 in which he had played a starring role to answer many of his critics in the Spanish media.

It was the eighth time he had damaged his left calf muscle since joining Real from Tottenham Hotspur in 2013 and his 10th calf problem since he moved to Spain.

Real originally said Bale’s fitness problems in Dortmund were related to cramp and allowed him to go on international duty with Wales.

Scans, however, soon revealed he had injured his calf and forced him out of Wales’s World Cup qualifiers against Georgia and Ireland.

Real later released a medical report stating Bale had a swollen calf but had not torn the muscle.

It did not give an estimated date for his return, and Zidane was unable to clarify the situation.

“I can’t say when he’ll be back, but he’s better, I can’t say if he’ll return in a week or 10 days, we’ll have to see,” Zidane told a news conference on Friday ahead of Real’s visit to Getafe in La Liga.

“He’s getting better every day. He had two problems, one in Dortmund when he only seemed a bit worn out, and then he had a different problem with his calf. Now we have to take it easy with him and be patient.”

Bale is ruled out of Saturday’s short trip to Getafe and unlikely to feature against former side Tottenham Hotspur in the Champions League on Tuesday, while he is also a doubt for the return game against Mauricio Pochettino’s side on Nov. 1.

Real are fifth in the Liga standings, seven points behind leaders Barcelona.

Bale, 28, has missed a third of Real’s games since he joined the club in a then world record move for 100 million euros ($118 million).

He had to watch most of last season’s Liga and Champions League winning double campaign from the sidelines due to a long lay off with an ankle injury and subsequent calf problems and later said he regretted rushing back too early after surgery on his ankle.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Nigeria and South Africa are expected to lift sub-Saharan regional growth next year, a Reuters poll showed, once their central banks cut rates to boost Africa’s largest - but sickly - economies.

The two economies contribute more than half of sub-Saharan Africa’s gross domestic product and the poll taken in the past three days showed Nigeria’s economy, Africa’s biggest, will grow 2.4 percent in 2018, up from 0.8 percent this year. It has been in recession since late 2015.

South Africa, the continent’s most industrialized economy, is expected to grow 1.2 percent in 2018 compared to 0.7 percent this year.

Economists suggested both countries will probably wait until January or March to cut interest rates by 25 basis points to 6.50 percent in South Africa and by the same margin to 13.75 percent in Nigeria.

“South Africa and Nigeria are the region’s largest two economies and, at present, the largest drawback on the SSA growth performance,” said Christie Viljoen, economist at KPMG.

Viljoen added improved growth in these two economies would help sub-Saharan Africa accelerate next year.

Africa’s two biggest economies emerged from recession in the second quarter but strong growth won’t return until business confidence is restored.

Nigeria has suffered from dollar shortages and falling commodity prices that have affected the continent’s major crude exporters, while South Africa has been dogged by political uncertainty.

Thea Fourie, senior economist at IHS Markit said the synchronized developed market recovery is also expected to support sub-Saharan Africa’s growth rate into next year.

Still, the World Bank on Wednesday said the economy of sub-Saharan Africa is seen growing more slowly this year than previously forecast, largely due to weak investment and productivity.

Fourie added growth is unlikely to reach levels witnessed during the commodity price super cycle, a period in the early 2000‘s.

She listed stronger foreign direct investment, higher government revenues and more inclusive growth as needed to place the region on a stronger path moving forward.

The survey also suggested Ethiopia and Ghana would lead growth in the region, with Ghana growing 6.6 percent next year from 6.3 percent this year, way better than the continent’s biggest economies.

Ethiopia’s economy is one of the fastest growing in Africa, with the IMF expecting a growth rate of 9 percent for the 2016/17 fiscal year.

The IMF’s earlier outlook for the sub-Sahara region suggests 2017 growth of 2.6 percent - around a full percentage below that for the world as a whole and less than half the 1999-2008 average of 5.6 percent.

Africa’s major central banks are in an easing cycle to stimulate economies. Ghana is likely to cut the most with rates, currently at 21 percent, seen ending next year at 17 percent.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of U.S. hospital companies and health insurers fell on Friday after President Donald Trump decided to cut off Obamacare subsidies to health insurance companies for low-income patients in a move that sparked threats of legal action and concern about chaos in insurance markets.

The White House said late Thursday it could no longer lawfully pay the “cost-sharing reduction” subsidies, which were guaranteed to insurers under former President Barack Obama’s 2010 Affordable Care Act to help lower out-of-pocket medical expenses for low-income consumers.

Trump, like most of his fellow Republicans a strong critic of Obamacare, has made the payments each month since taking office in January, even as he attacked them as a “bailout” for insurance companies.

Still, the actual impact of the cuts on U.S. insurers could be muted. They had already factored in the possibility that the Trump administration would stop making the payments when setting next year’s rates for Obamacare plans in many states, said Jeff Jonas, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds who focuses on healthcare. Hospital companies could be hit harder.

“We already were expecting (Obamacare) enrollment to be way down last year and therefore, see slightly fewer admissions and more charity care and bad debt. This just reinforces that,” Jonas said.

Shares of hospital operators Tenet Healthcare (THC.N), Community Health Systems (CYH.N) and HCA Healthcare (HCA.N) were down 7.6 percent, 6 percent and 3.3 percent, respectively, in before-the-bell trading on Friday.

Shares of insurer Centene Corp (CNC.N) fell 7.3 percent and Molina Healthcare’s stock (MOH.N) dropped 2.3 percent.

Every Republican in Congress opposed the international accord reached under Democratic former President Barack Obama two years ago. Joined by several Democrats, they nearly passed legislation to kill the deal in which Iran agreed to curb its disputed nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief.

However, with the agreement in place and strongly supported by co-signers Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China, many Republicans who still abhor the pact nevertheless do not want to blow it up for fear that doing so would erode U.S. credibility. They want to find other ways to clamp down on Tehran.

Meeting with officials from the Trump and Obama administrations, European diplomats and among themselves, they have been preparing strategies to save it, including pushing for tougher inspections, changing the law requiring Trump to certify Tehran’s compliance and setting new sanctions over Iran’s non-nuclear activities.

“As flawed as the deal is, I believe we must enforce the hell out of it,” Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said on Wednesday.

On Friday, Trump is expected to unveil a broad strategy for Iran, including announcing that he will decertify the agreement ahead of an Oct. 15 deadline, although he could always change his mind.

If the Republican president goes ahead, that would open a 60-day window in which Congress could reimpose sanctions, a step toward an unraveling of the deal.

PRESSURE ON REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS

However, Trump is not expected to call on lawmakers to revive those sanctions. If he stops short of recommending that, it gives Republicans room to stand pat for now.

On Wednesday, H.R. McMaster, Trump’s national security adviser, discussed Iran with the Republican chairmen of House of Representatives national security committees. On Thursday, intelligence officials scheduled a classified briefing for members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, a key player in the Iran debate, has suggested changing the Iran Review Act he co-authored to eliminate the requirement that Trump recertify Iran’s compliance with the deal every 90 days, several congressional sources said.

Trump, who pledged during his campaign to rip up the Iran deal, has recertified it twice since taking office in January and hates having to do so.

A Twitter feud that erupted this week between Trump and Corker could complicate the efforts by the influential Republican to broker a deal that would likely require both Democratic and Republican support.

“Congress and the administration need to be on the same page, and a major breakdown in the working relationship between one of the very few key Republicans on the Hill who works with Democrats and the president on Iran policy bodes very poorly,” said Elizabeth Rosenberg, a former Treasury Department official now at the Center for a New American Security.

To win over some conservative Republicans and Iran hawks, Corker and other leaders are considering proposing sanctions on Iran’s non-nuclear activities and broader inspections, particularly of Iranian military facilities.

On Thursday, the House Foreign Affairs Committee approved sanctions targeting Iran’s ballistic missiles development. It could come up for a vote in the full House well before the end of the 60 days Congress has to react to Trump’s announcement.",Iran deal's foes in U.S. Congress may be its unlikely saviors,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-congress/iran-deals-foes-in-u-s-congress-may-be-its-unlikely-saviors-idUSKBN1CH2K2

One week after suffering a staggering collision with Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico is in the throes of an agonizing humanitarian disaster.

The storm left at least 16 dead and the entire island without power; most people won’t get their lights back on anytime soon. The cascading effects have been devastating. More than half of residents remain without drinking water. Hospitals cannot function. Supermarket shelves are empty and few gas stations are open. Communication networks are crippled, and first responders are struggling to make contact with residents in remote or heavily affected areas. Credit cards are useless, and ATMs are out of service.

We know how to do better and we can do better. Nobody should die because the power went out.

We need a dedicated national effort to fortify our electrical grids so that they can get back online much more quickly after inevitable, and increasingly severe, extreme weather events. Natural disasters happen, but often the catastrophes that follow are man-made. And when it comes to the electricity system—the lynchpin upon which so much of our society relies—widespread, long-lasting power outages can quickly devolve into nightmares all their own. Just a few weeks ago, 11 senior citizens died in Florida following prolonged heat exposure due to power outages in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma. Similar catastrophes were suffered in the wakes of many other earlier storms, including Hurricanes Sandy and Katrina.

The centralized electricity grid is widely vulnerable to threats, both natural and manmade. Flooding can submerge and damage equipment, as it did throughout the Northeast during Sandy; heavy winds can rip down trees and power lines, as was seen throughout Florida from Irma; and extreme heat and forest fires can wreak havoc on transmission lines. Climate change stands to escalate these threats, by contributing to higher seas, more intense storms, worsening wildfires and extended heat waves.

That’s why the focus must be on electricity grid resilience. It’s impractical and impossible to stop all outages from occurring. But it is possible to design the system such that when the power does inevitably fail, fewer people are affected from the outset and power is restored more quickly for the rest.

In Florida, policymakers directed the state’s utilities to “storm harden” their systems following the devastating 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons. One decade and several billion ratepayer dollars later, Irma gave people a chance to see their increased utility bills at work.

The result: an astounding 6.7 million customers—or nearly two out of every three in the state—were plunged into darkness. Surely evidence of a failed approach, right?

Not quite. When it comes to the cascading failures arising from widespread outages, length of the blackout is a key factor in the severity of the impact. Even though all those Floridians lost power after, the utilities were able to get over one million back online overnight, and millions more restored within a few days with help from crews from across America.

In Florida, that pivot toward improving recovery times has meant, for one, simple upgrades, like replacing thousands of wooden utility poles with concrete that can better withstand hurricane-force winds. In the aftermath of Irma, even though crashing trees and flying debris ripped down power lines, restoration times were vastly improved by a reduced need to replace fallen poles.

Other initiatives can be more technologically complex. For example, by installing sensors and grid automation throughout the system, utilities can pinpoint when and where an outage has occurred, and re-route systems to reduce the number of people without power. Similarly, flood monitoring equipment can alert a utility when critical infrastructure is at risk of inundation, allowing the equipment to be pre-emptively turned off to improve post-storm repair times.

Tackling a problem this big, however, is impossible for each utility to do alone. Complicating the push for a more resilient electricity system is the fact that proposed interventions can be expensive, and investment dollars are limited. Additionally, the federal government has offered insufficient assistance, leaving states, cities and territories to largely fend for themselves, even though investing in a more resilient system now can reduce the costs of future relief and recovery efforts.

Utilities’ limited funds mean there are trade-offs, so opportunities must be carefully weighed against one another. But the costs of prolonged outages are far-reaching and challenging to quantify, and resiliency metrics are hard to define and even harder to compare. Efforts must also align with other priorities, especially as the power sector undergoes an unparalleled transition to clean and distributed renewable resources.

The fact also remains that some services are far too critical—drinking water, first responders, communications—and some populations, such as the elderly, disabled, or low-income, to tolerate even a day without power. For these people and services, a resilient grid is not enough.

Diesel generators, which have long-served a backup role when disasters hit, are expensive, heavily polluting, and prone to failure due to infrequent use. And as the long and frustrating lines following recent storms have made clear, maintaining steady access to fuel in the aftermath of a severe storm can be challenging, if not impossible. Microgrids powered by solar and storage, on the other hand, are more reliable during times of crisis, better for health and the environment, and increasingly affordable. This is thanks to lower costs of solar and storage technologies, as well as the fact that these systems can provide onsite power, generating benefits all year, not just during extreme weather events.

So what does this mean for Puerto Rico? Reports suggest parts of the island could remain without power for months, potentially impacting millions of people. This is unacceptable.

Now, as a country, we must pool together resources for a swift response to curtail the devastating crisis at hand. But we must also ensure that as the decimated power grid is pieced back together, this catastrophe—and the far too many that preceded it—were not suffered in vain. The electricity system must be rebuilt for a climate-resilient, clean-energy supporting future, not as a replica of its brittle and underinvested past.",Commentary: How we could have prevented some of Puerto Rico’s misery,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mcnamara-electricity-commentary/commentary-how-we-could-have-prevented-some-of-puerto-ricos-misery-idUSKCN1C42ER

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Amazon Studios chief Roy Price was put on an immediate leave of absence Thursday, the company said, following allegations that he harassed a producer and ignored an actress’s claim of a sexual assault by producer Harvey Weinstein.

The Hollywood Reporter on Thursday reported an allegation by Isa Hackett, a producer on one of Amazon.com Inc’s shows, that Price had lewdly propositioned her in 2015.

Amazon said in a statement: ”Roy Price is on leave of absence effective immediately. We are reviewing our options for the projects we have with The Weinstein Co.”

Hackett did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reuters could not independently confirm the allegation. Price could not immediately be reached independently by Reuters and he declined to comment to the Hollywood Reporter.

Price’s removal creates uncertainty about the studio’s direction when Amazon is investing more on video content than ever before - some $4.5 billion this year.

The studio’s Chief Operating Officer Albert Cheng will step in as the interim chief, Amazon said.

Hackett is the daughter of famed science fiction author Philip K. Dick, whose book “The Man in the High Castle” served as the basis for Amazon’s eponymous show.

Also on Thursday, actress Rose McGowan said on Twitter that she had told Price that she had been assaulted by Weinstein, who was forced out of his company this week following reports in the New Yorker and the New York Times that he had harassed and assaulted numerous women over the years. In tweets directed at Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, she criticized the company for doing business with the Weinstein Co.

A spokeswoman for Harvey Weinstein said: “Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein.”

Price has been integral to Amazon’s movie business, helping steer it through an attempt to crowd-source television scripts and garnering Hollywood awards for shows such as “Transparent.”

Amazon hopes original movies and TV shows will draw new people to join its streaming and shopping club Prime, and in turn buy more goods from the online retailer.

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co on Wednesday warned leaders of Canada’s Unifor labor union that it will start to wind down production of its popular Chevrolet Equinox sport utility vehicle at an Ontario factory unless workers there call off a month-long strike.

The strike has been fueled by union opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement.

Unifor leader Jerry Dias told Reuters on Wednesday that GM officials said they would ramp up production of the vehicle at two plants in Mexico that build the Equinox and a similar model, the GMC Terrain if the walkout is not called off.

“GM just told us today that they are going to ramp up production in Mexico,” Unifor President Jerry Dias said by phone from Washington. “They have declared war on Canada.”

GM has plants in the United States that are under-utilized, but retooling them to build the Equinox would be expensive.

GM plans to study how quickly key suppliers to the Ontario Equinox plant could move their operations to accommodate a shift in the vehicle’s production, a person familiar with the discussions said on Wednesday.

GM’s decision to build the Equinox and Terrain in Mexico is a major issue in the contract dispute between the automaker and the Canadian union.

Dias said he would not call off the strike.

“This is the big issue,” Dias said of the strike. “Once we solve this, everything else will fall into place.”

About 2,500 workers at a factory in Ingersoll, Ontario, walked off the job on Sept. 18 after GM rejected Unifor’s call for the automaker to designate the factory, known as CAMI, as the lead production site for the Equinox in North America. The automaker invested $800 million to retool the plant for the new model.

The union also objected to GM’s decision to lay off 600 CAMI workers as it phased out production of the last-generation GMC Terrain SUV, and launched production of new generation Terrain models along with the Equinox in Mexico.

The CAMI plant was projected to build about 210,000 vehicles in 2018, while two plants in Mexico together were projected to build about 150,000 vehicles next year, according to AutoForecast Solutions, a forecasting firm.

Unifor’s Dias has blamed NAFTA for the job losses, complicating Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s effort to promote the benefits of open trade in response to U.S. President Donald Trump’s criticism of the deal.

U.S., Canadian and Mexican negotiators began another round of talks this week to modernize the agreement.

The Equinox was the second best-selling model in the United States Chevrolet lineup in September, and GM had just 41 days worth of the vehicle in stock at the end of last month, according to Automotive News.

The Trump administration on Friday disclosed the date of the subsidies cutoff after announcing late on Thursday the most dramatic action the president has taken to undercut Democratic former President Barack Obama’s signature 2010 healthcare law.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the administration will not make the next payment to insurers scheduled for next Wednesday. The payments cost $7 billion this year and were estimated to be $10 billion in 2018, according to congressional analysts.

Trump has made the payments, guaranteed to insurers under Obamacare to help lower out-of-pocket medical expenses for low-income consumers, each month since taking office in January. But he has repeatedly threatened to cut them off and disparaged them as a “bailout” for insurance companies.

The move drew swift condemnation from congressional Democrats, who accused Trump of sabotaging the law, and threats from Democratic state attorneys general in New York and California to take legal action.

Trump, a Republican who promise as a candidate last year to dismantle the law formally called the Affordable Care Act, urged opponents to reach out to him to make a deal.

“The Democrats ObamaCare is imploding. Massive subsidy payments to their pet insurance companies has stopped. Dems should call me to fix!” Trump said in a post on Twitter early on Friday, calling the law “a broken mess.”

Shares of hospitals and health insurers fell in premarket trading on Friday after Trump’s decision. Shares of Anthem Inc, Molina Healthcare Inc, Cigna Corp and Centene Corp, which are all offering plans on Obamacare markets for 2018, were all lower.

Trump has been frustrated by the failure of his fellow Republicans who control Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare despite seven years of promises to get rid of the law that has brought health insurance to 20 million people.

His decision is likely to please those in his hard-line conservative political base who detest the Affordable Care Act, which many Republicans have attacked as an unneeded government intrusion in Americans’ healthcare.

In a nod to that same constituency, the president signed an executive order on Thursday intended to make it easier for Americans to buy bare-bones health insurance plans exempt from Obamacare requirements.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi derided the subsidies cut-off in a joint statement, saying Trump would single-handedly push Americans’ healthcare premiums higher.

‘SPITEFUL ACT’

“It is a spiteful act of vast, pointless sabotage leveled at working families and the middle class in every corner of America,” they said. “Make no mistake about it, Trump will try to blame the Affordable Care Act, but this will fall on his back and he will pay the price for it.”

Insurers and proponents of Obamacare have implored Trump for months to commit to making the payments. Several insurers have cited uncertainty over the payments when hiking premiums for 2018 or exiting insurance markets altogether.

About 10 million people are enrolled in the plans via the law’s marketplace. Many of them receive subsidies, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.

The White House said late on Thursday that it could not lawfully pay the subsidies anymore. A White House statement said that based on guidance from the Justice Department, “the Department of Health and Human Services has concluded that there is no appropriation for cost-sharing reduction payments to insurance companies under Obamacare.”

“In light of this analysis, the Government cannot lawfully make the cost-sharing reduction payments,” it said.

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said he was prepared to lead other attorneys general in a lawsuit.

The payments were the subject of a lawsuit brought by House Republicans against the Obama administration that alleged they were unlawful because they needed to be appropriated by Congress. A judge ruled in favor of the Republicans, and the Obama administration appealed the ruling.

The Trump administration took over the lawsuit and had delayed deciding whether to continue the Obama administration’s appeal or terminate the subsidies, but in April Trump began threatening to stop the payments.

That case became more complicated in August when a U.S. appeals court allowed 16 Democratic state attorneys general to defend the payments and have a say in the legal fight.

In a court filing released on Friday, Sessions argued that while the law provided funds for tax credits it did allow cost-sharing payments for insurers. It was in that court filing that he announced next week’s cutoff date.

Meanwhile, the political turbulence has affected insurers’ decisions. Anthem, one of the largest remaining Obamacare insurers, in August scaled back its offerings in Nevada and Georgia and blamed the moves in part on uncertainty over the payments.

Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina earlier this year raised premiums by more than 20 percent, but said it would have raised premiums by only about 9 percent if Trump agreed to fund the payments.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that cutting off the payments would cause premiums to rise 20 percent in 2018, and that 5 percent of Americans would live in areas that do not have an insurer in the individual market in 2018.

Trump has taken other steps to undermine Obamacare. Last week, his administration allowed businesses and non-profit organizations to seek religious and moral exemptions from Obamacare’s mandate that employers provide coverage for women’s birth control.

The administration also slashed the Obamacare advertising and outreach budget and halved the open enrollment period.","Trump scraps key Obamacare subsidies, urges Democrats to fix 'broken mess'",https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-healthcare/trump-scraps-key-obamacare-subsidies-urges-democrats-to-fix-broken-mess-idINKBN1CI0EE

TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar was little changed against its U.S. counterpart on Friday, clawing back earlier losses as oil prices rose and as data showing weaker-than-expected U.S. underlying inflation weighed on the greenback.

The U.S. dollar .DXY retreated against a basket of major currencies after a modest reading in the core CPI, which is likely to worry Federal Reserve officials who have been engaged in a vigorous debate on the inflation path.

In contrast, the Bank of Canada pulled the trigger with two rate increases since July, trusting its projections and betting that stronger growth will help push inflation to its target by the middle of next year.

Prices of oil, one of Canada’s major exports, were boosted by strong Chinese oil imports and turmoil in the Middle East.

U.S. crude CLc1 prices were up 1.60 percent at $51.41 a barrel.

At 9:25 a.m. ET (1325 GMT), the Canadian dollar CAD=D4 was little changed at C$1.2470 to the greenback, or 80.19 U.S. cents.

The currency traded in a range of C$1.2450 to C$1.2512.

Officials from Mexico and Canada said that talks underway to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) should not add a so-called “sunset clause” that would force renegotiation of the $1 trillion pact every five years.

The resale of Canadian homes grew 2.1 percent in September from August, led by gains in Toronto and Vancouver, suggesting national sales may be stabilizing after cooling sharply in the spring, the Canadian Real Estate Association said.

Canadian government bond prices were higher across a flatter yield curve in sympathy with U.S. Treasuries.

(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) reported an 19 percent profit decline on Friday and weaker revenue than Wall Street had expected for the fourth consecutive quarter due to mortgage issues, sending its shares down 3.5 percent.

The third-largest U.S. lender, which has been embroiled in a prolonged scandal over its sales practices, said the dip in earnings came largely from a $1 billion accrual for a legal settlement over issues stemming from before the 2007-2009 financial crisis.

But revenue at the bank also suffered from a decline in mortgage banking revenue. Wells has been trying to bounce back from a scandal over dishonest sales practices that led to interrogations by U.S. Congress and fueled the ire of millions of consumers.

Wells Fargo’s earnings dropped to $4.6 billion during the third quarter. On an adjusted basis, its profit was $1.04 per share, scraping past estimates of $1.03, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Revenue fell 2 percent to $21.9 billion, hit by a 37 percent slump in mortgage banking. Analysts had forecast revenue of $22.4 billion.

Its shares fell 3.6 percent to $53.30 in early trading.

Wells Fargo’s operating efficiency ratio, which measures expenses as a portion of revenue, was 65.5 percent during the quarter and 63.1 percent year to date.

Expenses have been a key issue for investors, and the bank has targeted a full-year ratio of 60 percent to 61 percent in 2017, aiming to improve to 55 percent to 59 percent next year.

Wells is committed to its plan to cut costs by $4 billion by the end of 2019, half of which will be reinvested into businesses, Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said in a statement.

Net income in Wells Fargo’s community banking segment, the largest of its three major businesses and the one most directly impacted by the sales scandal, was $2.2 billion, down 31 percent from a year ago due to the legal charge.

Infographic ID: '2sWkzTB'

Now foreign companies that have spent billions of dollars on U.S. factories and local leaders who host them worry that global supply networks that back those investments will fray if Trump makes good on his pledge to roll back trade liberalization.

The U.S. president has threatened to tear up North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico and slap higher tariffs on nations that run trade surpluses with the United States, such as Germany or China. The administration is also discussing tighter immigration rules and more security screening of investment.

The tough message helped sway swing northeastern and Midwestern Rust Belt states Trump’s way in the 2016 election, but puts him at odds with companies and local leaders in the south, which has driven the recent growth in manufacturing jobs.

The southern states have voted for Trump, but have also spent decades wooing foreign companies with flexible labor laws, financial incentives and investment in ports, roads and other infrastructure.

POSTER CHILD AND WHIPPING BOY

The courtship has spawned new auto plants from Kentucky to Georgia, and a new Airbus (AIR.PA) plant in Mobile, Alabama.

Few places highlight the gap between Trump’s rhetoric and local aspirations better than Spartanburg in South Carolina.

German carmaker BMW (BMWG.DE) has invested here $8 billion in a 1.2 million square foot (11.15 hectares) assembly plant, which has become the largest single exporter of cars by value from the United States.

South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster, a Republican and Trump supporter, credits the German automaker for putting his state on the global investment map.

“The presence of this company changed everything in the trajectory of our state,” McMaster said on Monday at an event unveiling BMW’s newest X3 sports utility vehicle.

Its Chief Executive Harald Krueger said the carmaker would invest additional $600 million in Spartanburg over the next four years, adding 1,000 jobs to the 9,000-strong workforce, and spend further $200 million on employee training and education.

But the poster child of South Carolina’s success also doubles as a whipping boy. In January, BMW’s plans to build a plant in Mexico drew Trump’s ire and last month the U.S. president was quoted as saying Germany was “very bad” on trade and selling too many cars in the United States.

FILE PHOTO: An overall view of the assembly line where the BMW X4 is made at the BMW manufacturing plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina March 28, 2014. REUTERS/Chris Keane/File Photo

And even as the company highlights its contribution to the U.S. economy and the benefits of free trade, it is hedging its bets by preparing for a possible protectionist backlash.

Outside of the spotlight, BMW is retooling factories in South Africa and China to build volume models like the X3 SUV, reducing its dependence on Spartanburg.

“We have a big footprint here, and we are flexible enough,“ Oliver Zipse, BMW’s board member responsible for manufacturing, told Reuters. ”We will build the X3 not only in Spartanburg, we will split it into South Africa and then to China, so we will have some flexibility to produce cars somewhere else,” he said.

“If something happens at the political level - which we don’t know yet - we are able to have a flexible response.”

The Trump administration has said it welcomes foreign investment and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, who spoke at an opening of a new Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) plant in South Carolina, said such projects showed that ”America is becoming an even stronger destination for global businesses looking to grow.”

The southern U.S. states owe much of their success to coastal port authorities and cities that have invested heavily to make their channels and docks fit for shipments to and from China and Mexico.

Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina who has often clashed with Trump, said protectionism would undermine those accomplishments and hurt American workers.

DOOMSDAY SCENARIO

“Negotiate a trade agreement with Europe, modernize NAFTA, don’t tear it up,” Graham told Reuters at the BMW factory. “We’re going in the wrong direction. We need more trade agreements, not less.”

Graham noted how low-cost competition from China and Mexico destroyed South Carolina’s once thriving textile industry and how the state reinvented itself as a manufacturing hub, bringing the likes of BMW or French tire maker Michelin (MICP.PA).

The now humming port city of Charleston has a similar story to tell. When a major navy base shut down in the 1990s wiping out 20,000 jobs, local officials worked to bring foreign manufacturers, which now employ around 10,000 in the three counties around the city and more is set to come.

Mercedes-Benz, part of Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE), is adding 1,300 jobs so it can make its Sprinter van here rather than merely assemble it with imported parts, which also means more business for local suppliers.

Up the road, Volvo Car Group, part of Chinese conglomerate Geely [GEELY.UL], is due to open its first North American plant next year with a target workforce of 2,000.

Local development officials expect more jobs and investment to come, but worry that some steps discussed by the Trump administration could have a chilling effect.

Claire Gibbons, director of global marketing at the Charleston Regional Development Alliance, said the proposed new tariffs, tougher immigration rules and stricter reviews of foreign investment projects would amount to a “doomsday scenario” for the region.

“This is an education opportunity for us all, for the people making the decisions that don’t understand the ramifications.”

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Asia’s Most Innovative Universities.","(Reuters) - The news out of South Korea is dominated by political instability, but inside the country, strong and stable relationships between academia and industry continue to drive economic growth and technological innovation. That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ second annual ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science and invent new technologies.

REUTERS TOP 75

The most innovative university in the region, for the second year running, is South Korea’s KAIST. Formerly known as the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, it is the nation’s oldest research-oriented science and engineering university, with campuses in Daejeon, Seoul and Busan.

KAIST earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than 74 out of the 75 top-ranked universities in the region, and outside researchers frequently cite KAIST inventions in their own patents and research papers. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Asia Pacific’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

Recent KAIST research highlights include the development of a “parasite” robot that controls the movements of a living host: The device is mounted onto the shell of a turtle, and uses a combination of flashing lights and food rewards to direct the animal. The research could lead to hybrid animal-robot systems that would allow access to environments that would otherwise be difficult to reach on their own. In 2015 a university team collaborated with Rainbow Co, a company spun out of KAIST’s Humanoid Robot Research Center, to win the U.S. Department of Defense’s DARPA Robotics Challenge with an adaptable humanoid robot, DRC-HUBO.

The second most innovative university in the Asia Pacific region is also based in South Korea. Seoul National University was founded in 1946 as the country’s first national university, and now operates 16 colleges, one graduate school and 10 professional schools. In 2016 SNU received more than KRW 76 billion (about $68 million) in research funding from external industry, approximately 15 percent of its total funding.

South Korean universities typically have close relationships with industry. Fourth-place Pohang University of Science & Technology, or POSTECH, was actually founded by the South Korean steel company POSCO in 1986, and its 400-acre campus is located only a few minutes away from POSCO headquarters. POSTECH ranks first among all universities on the list in terms of the percentage of research articles it produces that include a co-author from industry, and the number of times its research papers are cited by articles originating in the private sector.

Ranked #2: Seoul National University in Seoul, South Korea, August 4, 2016. REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji

Overall, South Korean universities fill four of the top five spots on the ranking and eight of the top 20. There are 22 South Korean universities among the top 75, far more than you’d expect from a relatively small nation. Korea’s population is just under 51 million, so that’s one top-ranked university per 2.3 million people. In contrast, China has the most universities on the list – 25 between Hong Kong and the mainland – but it also has a massive population of more than 1.37 billion people, or one top-ranked university per 54.9 million people. (Japan has 19 ranked universities, Australia has five, Singapore has two, and New Zealand and India each have one.)

Some nations underperform on the ranking because of the way they organize their university systems. Despite boasting the world’s second-largest population (more than 1.26 billion) and one of its largest economies, only one Indian university appears in the top 75, The Indian Institutes of Technology (#71). IIT is a network of 23 universities which centralizes its patent administration, so it's not always possible to identify which constituent university was responsible for what research. As a result, Reuters ranked the entire system as opposed to individual universities. World-class campuses like IIT Delhi and IIT Bombay may have ranked much higher on the list if they weren’t grouped in with smaller and newer institutes like IIT Tirupati and IIT Palakkad.

And some countries are missing from the list entirely. There are no ranked universities in Indonesia, which contains Asia’s third largest population. Nor are there any universities in Pakistan or Bangladesh, the region’s fourth- and fifth-most populous countries, or any universities in the Philippines and Vietnam, two of the region’s largest economies.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included universities in East Asia, South Asia, and Oceania, and then ranked them based on their performance.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Asia’s Most Innovative Universities. Five universities that ranked in the top 75 last year slipped off the list in 2017: Japan’s Nihon University, the Indian Institute of Science – Bangalore, Putra University Malaysia, the University of South Australia, and Malaysia’s University of Malaya. These drop offs were all supplanted by fast-growing institutions in China and South Korea: the China University of Petroleum (#45), the University of Ulsan (#69), the University of Electronic Science & Technology of China (#70), Yeungnam University (#73), and Tongji University (#75).

The returning university that made the biggest move on the list was the University of Hong Kong, which climbed 26 spots from #56 to #30. That change is largely attributable to adjustments in Clarivate Analytics’ methodology: The university’s 2016 ranking did not account for patents that originated at HKU but were assigned to its commercialization arm, Versitech Limited, and the addition of those patents improves the university’s overall performance. Other big movers include China’s Huazhong University of Science & Technology (up 24 spots to #33) and the Beijing University of Chemical Technology (up 13 spots to #34). Japan's Okayama University (down 14 spots to #52) and Waseda University (down 18 to #66) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Overall, the ranking remained largely stable year over year, with eight of 2016’s top 10 universities returning to the top 10, and 18 of the top 20.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of the scope of its researchers’ work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 75 in the region: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

LONDON (Reuters) - Uber [UBER.UL] lodged a court appeal on Friday to overturn a decision by London’s transport regulator that stripped the taxi app of its operating license in its most important European market, the first stop on what is set to be a long legal road.

Transport for London (TfL) shocked the Silicon Valley firm last month by deeming it unfit to run a taxi service and refusing to renew its license, citing its approach to reporting serious criminal offences and background checks on drivers.

The appeal marks the beginning of months of legal wrangling in a battle that had pitched one of the world’s richest cities against a Silicon Valley giant known for forays into new markets across the globe that have stoked competition for established cab companies.

Uber, whose backers include Goldman Sachs and BlackRock, will defend its London business at a hearing most likely due on Dec. 11, a spokesman at Britain’s Judicial Office told Reuters.

Uber, criticized by London Mayor Sadiq Khan for employing an “an army of PR experts and an army of lawyers”, said that it hoped to keep talking to TfL to find a way forward.

“While we have today filed our appeal so that Londoners can continue using our app, we hope to continue having constructive discussions with Transport for London,” an Uber spokesman said.

“As our new CEO has said, we are determined to make things right.”

Only a month into the job, Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi met TfL Commissioner Mike Brown for talks earlier in October, which both sides said were constructive as the $70-billion firm tries to repair its relationship with the regulator.

Uber’s license expired on Sep. 30 but its roughly 40,000 drivers in the British capital will be able to continue operating until the appeals process is exhausted.

Friday’s appeal was submitted to Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London as part of the first stage of a legal process which could take months or years to reach a conclusion.

The filing is a short notification of Uber’s intention to appeal rather than the detailed grounds.

DISRUPTIVE YEAR

London’s decision is one of the most serious setbacks to the taxi app, which has been forced to quit several countries, including Denmark and Hungary, and faced regulatory battles in multiple U.S. states and around the world.

It comes after a tumultuous few months for the San Francisco start-up that led to former CEO and co-founder Travis Kalanick being forced out after a series of boardroom controversies.

Earlier this month, the firm’s boss in Britain Jo Bertram said she would quit the taxi hailing app according to emails seen by Reuters.

The company is also embroiled in court action against two drivers who won a tribunal case last year entitling them to workers’ rights such as the minimum wage and holiday entitlement, threatening its business model. Uber is appealing the verdict.

TfL said on Friday it would not comment before the licensing appeal hearing due later this year.

A spokesman at the Mayor of London’s office said that Khan, a politician from the opposition Labour Party who is also chairman of TfL, continued to back the license decision and that all private hire firms must play by the rules.

He said during a monthly question time session on Thursday that the transport authority would defend its decision during the legal action.

Coordinated Rohingya insurgent attacks on 30 security posts on Aug. 25 sparked a ferocious military response in the Muslim-majority northern part of Rakhine state that the United Nations has said was ethnic cleansing.

A committee led by military Lieutenant-General Aye Win has begun an investigation into the behavior of military personnel, the office of the commander in chief said on Friday, insisting the operation was justified under Buddhist-majority Myanmar’s constitution.

According to a statement posted on Senior General Min Aung Hlaing’s Facebook page, the panel will ask, “Did they follow the military code of conduct? Did they exactly follow the command during the operation? After that (the committee) will release full information.”

Myanmar is refusing entry to a U.N. panel that was tasked with investigating allegations of abuses after a smaller military counteroffensive launched in October 2016.

But domestic investigations - including a previous internal military probe - have largely dismissed refugees’ claims of abuses committed during security forces’ so-called “clearance operations”.

Thousands of refugees have continued to arrived cross the Naf river separating Myanmar’s Rakhine state and Bangladesh in recent days, even though Myanmar insists military operations ceased on Sept. 5.

Aid agencies now estimate that 536,000 people have now arrived in Cox’s Bazar district, straining scarce resources of aid groups and local communities.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is likely to take a major step against the international nuclear deal with Iran on Friday, laying out a more aggressive approach to Iranian activities in the Middle East that risks upsetting U.S. relations with European allies.

“It is time for the entire world to join us in demanding that Iran’s government end its pursuit of death and destruction,” Trump said in a White House statement that flagged key elements of the strategy.

He is to present his plan in a 12:45 p.m. EDT (1645 GMT)speech at the White House, the product of weeks of internal discussions between him and his national security team.

U.S. officials said Trump was expected to announce that he will not certify the 2015 nuclear accord between Iran and six world powers, one he has called the “worst deal ever” as it was not, in his view, in the U.S. national interest.

Trump found himself under immense pressure as he considered de-certifying the deal, a move that would ignore warnings from inside and outside his administration that to do so would risk undermining U.S. credibility abroad.

He had formally reaffirmed it twice before but aides said he was reluctant to do so a third time.

De-certification would not pull the United States out of the deal but would give the Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions on Tehran that were suspended under the pact, negotiated during the administration of President Barack Obama.

Michael McCaul, chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Homeland Security Committee, told Reuters he thinks Trump “is likely to not completely pull out of the deal, but decertify compliance.”

If Washington quits the deal, that will be the end of it and global chaos could ensue, Iran’s influential parliament speaker, Ali Larijani, was quoted by the Russian news agency TASS as saying during a visit to St Petersburg on Friday.

“FOOTPRINTS ON THE GROUND”

U.N. nuclear inspectors say Iran is in compliance with the accord, which limited the scope of Iran’s nuclear program to help ensure it could not be put to developing bombs in exchange for a lifting of international sanctions on Tehran.

Trump says Tehran is in violation of the spirit of the agreement and has done nothing to rein in its ballistic missile program or its financial and military support for the Lebanese Shi‘ite movement Hezbollah and other militant groups.

White House Chief of Staff John Kelly said on Thursday the U.S. approach toward Iran is to work with allies in the Middle East to contain Tehran’s activities.

“We have footprints on the ground, naval and Air Force is there to just demonstrate our resolve, our friendship, and try to deter anything that any country out there may do,” Kelly told reporters.

European allies warn of a split with the United States over the nuclear agreement, in part because they are benefiting economically from a relaxation of sanctions.

A variety of European allies, including the leaders of Britain and France, have personally appealed to Trump to re-certify the nuclear accord for the sake of allied unity.

Germany’s government pledged on Friday to work for continued unity if Trump de-certified the deal as Berlin remain convinced the agreement was an important tool to prevent Iran developing nuclear weapons.

Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel underlined German views in a telephone call with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson late on Thursday, his spokeswoman Maria Adebahr told reporters.

Gabriel said on Thursday U.S. behavior was driving a wedge between Europe and its close ally United States and bringing Europeans closer to Russia and China. “It’s imperative that Europe sticks together on this issue,” said Gabriel.

Russian President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said on Friday that if the United States ditched the nuclear pact, “this will damage the atmosphere of predictability, security, stability and non-proliferation in the entire world”.

U.S. MOVE AGAINST REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS

McCaul said he expected Trump also to announce some kind of action against the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IGRC), the country’s most powerful security entity. Trump is under a legal mandate to impose U.S. economic sanctions on the Revolutionary Guards as a whole by Oct. 31 or waive them.

U.S. sanctions could seriously hurt the IRGC as it controls large swaths of Iran’s economy. The Guards’ foreign paramilitary and espionage wing, the Quds Force, is under U.S. sanctions, as is the Quds Force commander, other officials and associated individuals and entities.

The deputy Quds commander, Brigadier-General Esmail Ghaani, was quoted by Iran’ Tasnim news agency on Friday as saying Trump’s threats would “damage” the United States.

“We are not a war-mongering country. But any military action against Iran will be regretted...We have buried many...like Trump and know how to fight against America,” Ghaani said.

“EMBARRASSMENT”

The 2015 nuclear agreement, signed by the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China, the European Union and Iran, has been denounced by Trump as “an embarrassment”.

European officials have categorically ruled out renegotiating the deal but have said they share Trump’s concerns about Iran’s destabilizing influence in the Middle East.

China has said it hopes the agreement will stay intact.

Israel, Iran’s arch-adversary in the Middle East, welcomed Trump’s anticipated announcement on Friday but voiced doubt that the tougher tack by Washington could turn around the Islamic Republic.

The International Atomic Energy Agency concluded that Iran secretly researched a nuclear warhead until 2009, which Tehran denies. Iran has always insisted its uranium enrichment activity is for civilian energy purposes, not for atomic bombs.

The threat of new U.S. action has prompted a public display of unity from rival factions among Iran’s rulers.

RICS’s benchmark house price index held steady at +6 in September, slightly better than forecast in a Reuters poll of economists, but the property industry body said prospects for future prices had declined.

Price falls are expected over the next three months, and growth over the coming year is predicted to be the weakest since June 2016, when surveyors feared voting to leave the European Union would trigger broad-based decline, RICS said.

RICS chief economist Simon Rubinsohn said there was a big difference between London and southeastern England - where prices are falling and expected to decline further - and most of the rest of the United Kingdom, where prices are rising.

“We are continuing to see evidence of shortage of stock,” Rubinsohn said. “Against such a backdrop, prices are likely to remain elevated and ... continue to rise over the medium term in most parts of the country.”

During the call the client is shown in her kitchen surrounded by bills. The technology’s ability to immerse the user into a realistic scenario, makes it well suited for “empathy training”, said Schouela.

“We cannot find for the time being a real compromise as far as the remaining financial commitments of the UK are concerned. As we are not able to do this we will not be able to say in the European Council in October that now we can move to the second phase of negotiations,” Juncker said.

“They have to pay, they have to pay, not in an impossible way. I‘m not in a revenge mood. I‘m not hating the British.”

The EU has told Britain that a summit next week will conclude that insufficient progress has been made in talks for Brussels to open negotiations on a future trade deal. London has been hoping and pressing for this to happen at the summit.","'They have to pay', EU's Juncker says of Britain",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1CI12L-OCATP

LONDON/VIENNA (Reuters) - With the ink barely dry on Lufthansa’s (LHAG.DE) deal to take over large parts of insolvent Air Berlin, the airline risks having its wings clipped by regulators and rivals concerned about unfair competition.

Lufthansa signed a 210 million euro ($248 million) deal on Thursday to take over Air Berlin units Niki and LG Walter, plus some short-haul planes, to cement its position in Germany and expand its Eurowings budget brand.

Austrian competition authorities said on Friday they believed Lufthansa, which also owns Austrian Airlines, would be too dominant in Vienna if it owned Austria-based Niki.

“We see an anti-competitive Lufthansa monopoly in Vienna on many routes after the takeover of Fly Niki,” the competition authority’s spokeswoman said. “We will voice our concern about the takeover at the European Commission.”

The German cartel office said it expected the European Commission to take a close look at the deal.

The European Commission had no comment, with a spokesman saying it had not yet been formally notified of the deal.

RIVALS COMPLAIN

The deal has also raised eyebrows with rival airlines. Ryanair (RYA.I) CEO Michael O‘Leary has called it a “stitch-up”, saying it would give Lufthansa a 95 percent share of the German domestic market. Ryanair said on Thursday it would take up its case with the EU.

Lufthansa has hit back at such claims, saying the deal would have to be examined not only from the point of view of the German market but Europe as a whole.

Lufthansa has said it has a market share of 34 percent on routes to and from Germany, while Air Berlin had 14 percent. With the takeover of parts of Air Berlin that will remain below 48 percent, which Lufthansa says is equivalent to Ryanair’s market share in Ireland.

Willie Walsh, CEO of British Airways parent IAG (ICAG.L), said on Friday he saw “significant” competition concerns with the deal, which will see Lufthansa taking on around 80 of Air Berlin’s 130 planes.

Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr said on Thursday he expected the deal would be approved by the end of the year.

A company source said Lufthansa was confident of getting approval, but expected there would be some remedies, as was the case when Lufthansa acquired Austrian Airlines and Swiss International Air Lines.

PARIS (Reuters) - The United Nations’ cultural agency will elect a new chief on Friday, seeking someone who can revive UNESCO’s fortunes after the United States and Israel pulled out.

Whoever gets the job will need to restore relevance to the agency whose mission to protect the world’s cultural and natural heritage has been hobbled by regional rivalries and a lack of money.

After five days of secret balloting at UNESCO’s Paris HQ two former culture ministers, Qatar’s Hamad bin Abdulaziz al-Kawari and France’s Audrey Azoulay, face off in the final vote of the 58-member Executive Board, scheduled for Friday evening.

If the two finalists are level, they draw lots to decide who leads the agency for the next four years.

“More than ever UNESCO needs a project that rallies the member states, re-establishes trust and cuts through the political divisions for the sake of UNESCO,” French foreign ministry spokeswoman Agnes Romatet-Espagne said ahead of the vote to replace Irina Bokova, a Bulgarian who has led the body since 2009.

The United States is meant to provide a fifth of UNESCO’s funding, but had already been withholding that since 2011 when the body admitted Palestine as a full member. It announced its departure on Thursday accusing UNESCO of anti-Israeli bias. Israel itself followed.

“Unfortunately, this venue has become politicized, undermining the work of UNESCO across its mandate. It’s become a venue for anti-Israel bias, and unfortunately we are taking the decision to withdraw from UNESCO at this time,” U.S. charge d‘affaires at UNESCO, Chris Hegadorn told Reuters.

With a Qatari and an Egyptian earlier vying for the job, the election has been troubled by the standoff between Doha and several of its Arab neighbors that have severed diplomatic, trade and travel ties, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorism, something it denies.

The Qatari, Kawari, who has been subject of barbs from Egyptian officials over the last week and been subjected to online abuse said on Thursday night he was confident he would win and wanted to reunite the member states.",U.N. cultural agency to pick new chief after U.S. walkout,https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1CI15X

Indian authorities last week withdrew the amendment to the Prevention of the Money Laundering Act (PMLA) that had made jewellers subject to anti-money laundering legislation.

Jewellers felt the PMLA required them to keep records of customers’ personal identification number or tax code for transactions above 50,000 rupees ($771), limiting gold sales by buyers hesitant to give the information.

Investor sentiment has improved since the government withdrew the PMLA notification, said Harshad Ajmera, proprietor of JJ Gold House, a wholesaler in the eastern Indian city of Kolkata.

“Jewellers are increasing purchases expecting healthy retail demand during Diwali.”

Indians will celebrate Diwali next week, a holiday period when buying gold is considered auspicious.

“Dussehra (festival) sales were disappointing due to the PMLA. Now since the rule has been withdrawn, we are expecting good demand,” said Arjun Raychaudhuri, managing director of MMTC-PAMP India, the biggest refiner in the country, referring to sales during a major festival late last month.

Dealers charged a premium of up to $2 an ounce this week, for the first time since July 8. Last week, they offered a discount of up to $3 an ounce. The domestic price includes a 10 percent import tax.

(Reuters) - World number one Rafa Nadal battled past Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov 6-4 7-6(4) 6-3 and into the semi-finals of the Shanghai Masters on Friday.

The 16-times grand slam winner, who beat Dimitrov in three sets in the China Open semi-finals last week, fired 32 winners and won two crucial breaks to prevail in two and a half hours.

Nadal, who extended his winning streak to 15 matches, pegged Dimitrov back with relentless baseline hitting to take the first set with ease.

But the Bulgarian, who sent down 13 aces in the match, took the fight to the Spaniard in the second set, coming from 3-0 down in a tie-break to level.

Trailing 3-2 in the decider, Dimitrov’s forehand crashed into the net to hand Nadal the break he needed. The top seed consolidated to make it 5-2 before serving out the match.

Next up for the 30-year-old is Croatian Marin Cilic, who beat Albert Ramos-Vinolas 6-3 6-4 in another quarter-final.

His Austrian People’s Party (OVP) has been in power, always as part of a coalition, since he was five months old.

But the 31-year-old foreign minister has convinced many voters that he will bring something new to an old party even though his views beyond the central campaign issue of immigration are largely in line with the old OVP.

The keen windsurfer and hiker has rebranded the party as the “New People’s Party” and changed its colour from black to turquoise and drawn in candidates from outside the OVP ranks.

The party’s posters carry urgent slogans like “Now or never” and “This time, Kurz”. Polls show his party clearly in the lead with about a third of the vote, with the FPO and Social Democrats neck and neck.

“The OVP has been in government for more than 30 years running and its posters say ‘Time for something new’. It’s a massive contradiction but with Kurz it works,” political analyst Thomas Hofer said.

“Many people project what they want to see onto him and he’s trying not to damage that.”

Kurz frequently reminds voters that he opposed opening the borders in 2015 during Europe’s migration crisis. He also wants to restrict benefits for refugees and other new arrivals.

As foreign minister also in charge of integration in a coalition government with the Social Democrats, he has a wide mandate, but taking a hard line on immigration and avoiding another influx like 2015’s has dominated his discourse.

“Above all, we want to stop illegal immigration so there is order and security in our country,” Kurz told his last campaign rally on Saturday in the southern city of Graz, even though illegal immigration is a fraction of what it was two years ago.

“We want there to be a new fairness in our country, for social safety nets to be there for those who really need help but for immigration into our social security system to stop, to protect our social security system.”

The migration crisis played into the hands of the far-right Freedom Party. After Austria took in more than 1 percent of its population in asylum seekers in 2015, heightening many voters’ concerns about jobs and security, support for the FPO grew. Its candidate came close to winning last year’s presidential runoff.

But when the OVP picked Kurz as its new leader in May, that catapulted the party to first place in the polls from third, dislodging the Freedom Party (FPO) led by Heinz-Christian Strache from a top spot it had held for more than a year.

“He says a lot of similar things to Strache and the FPO but in a more socially acceptable way,” Hofer said of Kurz.

“SOMETHING NEW”

As foreign minister he helped broker border restrictions through the Balkans last year that largely shut what was then the main migrant route into Europe, and Kurz likes stick to the subject of immigration.

“It’s really remarkable. On every issue you manage to change the subject immediately to refugees and political Islam,” Greens leader Ulrike Lunacek said in a head-to-head debate with Kurz last month, during a segment on women’s issues.

Beyond immigration, his youth means he has a limited track record in policy making, giving him an elusive quality.

But he supports the classically conservative positions such as lowering taxes for companies and opposing gay marriage. [

His opponents try to remind voters that he represents one of the two parties that have dominated Austrian post-war politics.

In an FPO video a young man asks a tattoo parlour to etch Kurz on his back. He is horrified to find a picture of Kurz plus grey-haired OVP veterans.

“I wanted Kurz, not the OVP!” he screams. The tattoo artist replies: “What did you expect? Kurz is the OVP!”

But that is not what many voters see in a country that is frustrated by the deadlock and compromises of centrist coalitions like the current one between the OVP and Social Democrats, who have ruled together for 44 of the past 72 years.

“People are unhappy with the old OVP but not with the new OVP under Sebastian Kurz,” pollster Peter Hajek said.

“Voters are basing their judgment largely on people, partly because ideological structures are crumbling. Kurz has managed to distance himself from this government and say, ‘I‘m offering you something new’.”

If his party wins the election, Kurz will most likely need to ally with either the FPO or the Social Democrats, whose leader he is at loggerheads with, to govern.

Lee was jailed for bribery.

The surprise resignation of Samsung’s chip and display head came as he was expected to take a bigger role following Lee’s arrest in February and the departures of other key executives in the wake of the bribery scandal.

The move came on the same day the South Korean smartphone maker forecast record third-quarter operating profit on the back of the memory chip business which Kwon was instrumental in building into the world leader.

“The timing is nonsensical. Samsung tipped record earnings, it’s going to be better in the fourth-quarter, and all that’s been driven by Kwon’s components business,” said Park Ju-gun, head of research firm CEO Score.

Kwon, 64, is seen as Samsung Group No. 2. As well as being chairman of the board and a board director, he heads the components business - including memory chips - and the display business.

In a statement, the man known as “Mr Chip” said the time had come to “start anew with new spirit and young leadership”.

“We are fortunately making record earnings right now, but this is the fruit of past decisions and investments; we are not able to even get close to finding new growth engines by reading future trends right now,” he added.

The world’s biggest maker of memory chips, smartphones and TVs is set to smash its annual profit record this year, thanks partly to soaring demand for memory chips. Semiconductors were Samsung’s top earner in the three months through June, making a record 8 trillion won ($7.20 billion).

The global chip industry is undergoing a major shift with Japan’s Toshiba Corp partnering with home rival SK Hynix, and other firms consolidating in search of new growth areas like artificial intelligence and automobiles.

Shares in Samsung, worth about $310 billion, fell 1.5 percent on Friday after hitting an all-time high earlier in the day.

A Samsung Electronics spokeswoman declined comment on the exact timing of succession and potential successors for Kwon’s roles.

While Samsung Group is South Korea’s top conglomerate with businesses ranging from smartphones to hotels - it has had no ‘Plan B’ for taking big decisions following Lee’s arrest, people familiar with the matter have said.

REUTERS/Yuri Gripas

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is likely to take a major step against the international nuclear deal with Iran on Friday, laying out a more aggressive approach to Iranian activities in the Middle East that risks upsetting U.S. relations with European allies.

“It is time for the entire world to join us in demanding that Iran’s government end its pursuit of death and destruction,” Trump said in a White House statement that flagged key elements of the strategy.

He is to present his plan in a 12:45 p.m. EDT (1645 GMT)speech at the White House, the product of weeks of internal discussions between him and his national security team.

U.S. officials said Trump was expected to announce that he will not certify the 2015 nuclear accord between Iran and six world powers, one he has called the “worst deal ever” as it was not, in his view, in the U.S. national interest.

Trump found himself under immense pressure as he considered de-certifying the deal, a move that would ignore warnings from inside and outside his administration that to do so would risk undermining U.S. credibility abroad.

He had formally reaffirmed it twice before but aides said he was reluctant to do so a third time.

De-certification would not pull the United States out of the deal but would give the Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions on Tehran that were suspended under the pact, negotiated during the administration of President Barack Obama.

Michael McCaul, chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Homeland Security Committee, told Reuters he thinks Trump “is likely to not completely pull out of the deal, but decertify compliance.”

If Washington quits the deal, that will be the end of it and global chaos could ensue, Iran’s influential parliament speaker, Ali Larijani, was quoted by the Russian news agency TASS as saying during a visit to St Petersburg on Friday.

“FOOTPRINTS ON THE GROUND”

U.N. nuclear inspectors say Iran is in compliance with the accord, which limited the scope of Iran’s nuclear program to help ensure it could not be put to developing bombs in exchange for a lifting of international sanctions on Tehran.

Trump says Tehran is in violation of the spirit of the agreement and has done nothing to rein in its ballistic missile program or its financial and military support for the Lebanese Shi‘ite movement Hezbollah and other militant groups.

White House Chief of Staff John Kelly said on Thursday the U.S. approach toward Iran is to work with allies in the Middle East to contain Tehran’s activities.

“We have footprints on the ground, naval and Air Force is there to just demonstrate our resolve, our friendship, and try to deter anything that any country out there may do,” Kelly told reporters.

European allies warn of a split with the United States over the nuclear agreement, in part because they are benefiting economically from a relaxation of sanctions.

A variety of European allies, including the leaders of Britain and France, have personally appealed to Trump to re-certify the nuclear accord for the sake of allied unity.

Germany’s government pledged on Friday to work for continued unity if Trump de-certified the deal as Berlin remain convinced the agreement was an important tool to prevent Iran developing nuclear weapons.

Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel underlined German views in a telephone call with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson late on Thursday, his spokeswoman Maria Adebahr told reporters.

Gabriel said on Thursday U.S. behavior was driving a wedge between Europe and its close ally United States and bringing Europeans closer to Russia and China. “It’s imperative that Europe sticks together on this issue,” said Gabriel.

Russian President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said on Friday that if the United States ditched the nuclear pact, “this will damage the atmosphere of predictability, security, stability and non-proliferation in the entire world”.

U.S. MOVE AGAINST REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS

McCaul said he expected Trump also to announce some kind of action against the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IGRC), the country’s most powerful security entity. Trump is under a legal mandate to impose U.S. economic sanctions on the Revolutionary Guards as a whole by Oct. 31 or waive them.

U.S. sanctions could seriously hurt the IRGC as it controls large swaths of Iran’s economy. The Guards’ foreign paramilitary and espionage wing, the Quds Force, is under U.S. sanctions, as is the Quds Force commander, other officials and associated individuals and entities.

The deputy Quds commander, Brigadier-General Esmail Ghaani, was quoted by Iran’ Tasnim news agency on Friday as saying Trump’s threats would “damage” the United States.

“We are not a war-mongering country. But any military action against Iran will be regretted...We have buried many...like Trump and know how to fight against America,” Ghaani said.

“EMBARRASSMENT”

The 2015 nuclear agreement, signed by the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China, the European Union and Iran, has been denounced by Trump as “an embarrassment”.

European officials have categorically ruled out renegotiating the deal but have said they share Trump’s concerns about Iran’s destabilizing influence in the Middle East.

China has said it hopes the agreement will stay intact.

Israel, Iran’s arch-adversary in the Middle East, welcomed Trump’s anticipated announcement on Friday but voiced doubt that the tougher tack by Washington could turn around the Islamic Republic.

The International Atomic Energy Agency concluded that Iran secretly researched a nuclear warhead until 2009, which Tehran denies. Iran has always insisted its uranium enrichment activity is for civilian energy purposes, not for atomic bombs.

The threat of new U.S. action has prompted a public display of unity from rival factions among Iran’s rulers. Iran will react sharply to any U.S. move against the nuclear deal with global powers, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told the Iranian parliament on Wednesday.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenyan police shot dead two people and wounded a third when a crowd tried to storm a police station during an opposition protest against a looming presidential vote re-run, a senior official said.

Around 20 youths attempted to take over the station during an otherwise peaceful rally in the town of Bondo in the southwest county of Siaya, forcing officers to open fire, County Commissioner Josephine Onunga said by phone.

Police also used teargas to break up small demonstrations in Kenya’s three main cities - Kisumu, the capital and the port of Mombasa - defying a government ban on rallies in city centers.

Kenya’s supreme court nullified the presidential election in August, citing procedural irregularities and voiding the victory of President Uhuru Kenyatta, opening the way to a repeat vote on Oct. 26.

But opposition leader Raila Odinga has refused to take part, saying the re-run should not happen until wide-ranging reforms were brought in to prevent a repeated failure.

Related Coverage Kenya police shoot dead 2 protesters amid opposition demonstrations

The election board has said the polls will go ahead anyway, pitting Kenyatta against six other candidates, none of whom polled more than 1 percent in the August election.

Odinga told Reuters that he might consider returning to the Supreme Court for clarification on whether the Oct. 26 poll was legal.

PROVOCATIONS

“As far as we are concerned, that (original Supreme court) ruling is still valid,” Odinga said during a visit to London.

“What we are demanding is that the electoral commission should respect the Supreme Court and carry out elections in accordance with the ruling.”

He supported protesters’ right to demonstrate, he said, but he has so far stopped short of calling people onto the streets himself.

Martin Kimani, the Director of the National Counter Terrorism Centre, said the opposition was trying to manufacture a crisis.

“A lot of those provocations or demonstrations taking place is an attempt to create the appearance of a crisis,” he said. “There is a clear process on how to hold an assembly – it is about maintaining law and order.”

In Nairobi, opposition legislators were repeatedly teargassed as they tried to drive into the city center.

(Reuters) -

Sixteen days after Hurricane Maria ravaged Puerto Rico, Maria de Lourdes Sandoval heard helicopters over her village of Bajura.

She ran to signal them, forcefully waving her arms and crying for help as they touched down on a nearby soccer field. ”I‘m helpless. I don’t have a home, don’t have anywhere to live. I don’t have furniture, no bed, no clothes,” Sandoval, 47, told Reuters.

Hundreds of villages, isolated by power outages, impassable roads and downed telephone lines, are being helped by helicopter teams from the U.S. Army’s First Armored Division’s Combat Aviation Brigade and the 101st Airborne Division’s “Dustoff” unit.

Daily missions are flown out of the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station in Ceiba, which was closed in 2004 but is now being used by the Army, Air Force, Marines and Navy.

“It hurts because I remember how it used to be, and now it’s completely different,” said Sergeant First Class Eladio Tirado, who was born and raised in Carolina, Puerto Rico. After not visiting for roughly five years, he returned home in a Blackhawk helicopter.

“Everything is so much gone. The vegetation, everything is brown, everything is dead.”

On a recent mission over Luqillo, Tirado asked the pilots to fly over his family’s home because he had been unable to reach them by phone. The helicopter circled the house. No one was there, but Tirado was confident the message would reach his family: he’s here and he’s helping.

Media reports led crews to the village of San Lorenzo, which had received no federal assistance since the hurricane. Dozens of people pressed against a fence to watch helicopters land, anxiously waiting for food and water.

Crews are also transporting people to emergency centers and mapping open roads so trucks can make deliveries.

Rooftop messages like one near Humacao come through loud and clear. “HELP USA PLEASE P.R.”

Near Ciales, as Blackhawks from the 1st Armored Division flew over, people on a rooftop reached toward the sky to signal they needed water.

As helicopters scouted the island’s mountainous interior one recent Saturday a woman held a jug in the air.

They circled above houses built on top of mountains to find a level field to unload their precious cargo. One field looked open and a Blackhawk came within eight feet of the ground, but it could not land.

Loaded with 100 cases of water, the helicopter flew off, leaving behind thirst and desperation.

The crew soon found another needy community, Verde de Comerío, where it was able to land.

Villagers quickly lined up to help soldiers pass food and water to a crowd. One woman hugged Pilot Chris Greenway to thank him for water. In less than 10 minutes, hundreds of bottles of water were given to families, emptying the helicopter.

This village also needed medicine, and families with babies had no way of getting basics. Diapers and formula have become luxury goods. But every village asks for water.

The lack of potable water is slowly choking these villages and helicopters can only carry so much. Every trip leaves some who get nothing.

The crews can only hope they can return soon enough to make a difference.

”This island will never stop,” Tirado said. “People will rebuild, we will continue forward, and they’re going to see a better tomorrow.”

Puigdemont made a symbolic declaration of independence on Tuesday night, only to suspend it seconds later and call for negotiations with Madrid.

Spain’s Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has given him until Monday to clarify his position - and then until Thursday to change his mind if he insists on a split - threatening to suspend Catalonia’s autonomy if he chooses independence.

But far-left Catalan political group CUP called on Puigdemont to make an unequivocal declaration of independence in defiance of the deadlines.

“If (the central Madrid government) wants to continue to threaten and gag us, they should do it to the Republic that has already been claimed,” the party said.

The CUP only holds 10 seats in the 135-seat Catalan parliament. But Puigdemont’s minority government relies on its support to push through legislation and cannot win a majority vote in the regional parliament without its backing.

The wealthy region’s intention to break away after a referendum has plunged Spain into its worst political crisis since an attempted military coup in 1981 and could hurt economic growth targets for next year, the deputy prime minister said.

ECONOMIC RISK

“If there were no quick solution to this issue we should be forced to lower expectations of economic growth for the year 2018,” Soraya Sainz de Santamaria said on Friday.

Sources close to the Catalan government said Puigdemont and his team were working on an answer to Rajoy though they declined to say what line he would take.

The CUP statement echoes the position expressed late on Thursday by influential pro-independence civic group Asamblea Nacional Catalana which said: “Given the negative position of Spain toward dialogue, we ask the regional parliament to raise the suspension (on the declaration of independence).”

But the leader of Puigdemont’s party, Artur Mas, who served as the region’s president until 2016 and is still believed to influence key decisions, said on Friday declaring independence was not the only way forward.

“If a state proclaims itself independent and cannot act as such, it’s an independence that is merely aesthetic,” he told Catalan television TV3.

“The external factor must be taken into account in the decisions that will be made from now on,” he said.

The European Union, the United States and most other world powers have made it clear they wanted Catalonia to remain within Spain.

“If we allow Catalonia - and it is none of our business - to separate, others will do the same. I do not want that,” Jean Claude Juncker said in a speech at Luxembourg University.","Allies press Catalan leader to declare full independence, ignore Madrid deadlines",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-spain-politics-catalonia/allies-press-catalan-leader-to-declare-full-independence-ignore-madrid-deadlines-idUKKBN1CI19R

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A new package of U.S. disaster assistance sailed through the House of Representatives on Thursday, despite President Donald Trump expressing impatience with having to devote federal resources for hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico’s recovery.

The Republican-controlled House voted 353-69 to approve $36.5 billion in emergency relief for Puerto Rico and other areas hit by recent disasters. Senate approval is expected in coming weeks.

Trump and his aides on Thursday suggested that there would be a limit to how much help Puerto Rico could expect from Washington to solve some of its longer-term problems, although Trump is expected to sign the latest emergency package.

The White House on Thursday evening issued a statement saying the Trump administration was “pleased” that the House had approved the relief funds and pledged to work with Congress going forward to provide resources to recover and rebuild.

Puerto Rico has been grappling with a bankruptcy crisis and owes $72 billion to creditors. Devastation from hurricanes Irma and Maria was exacerbated by dilapidated infrastructure, including a power grid largely destroyed by the storms.

In a morning tweet, Trump warned that the United States “cannot keep FEMA, the Military & the First Responders, who have been amazing (under the most difficult circumstances) in P.R. forever!”

FEMA is the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which oversees disaster response in the United States.

Presidential aides later on Thursday provided assurances that Washington will not abandon Puerto Rico, a Caribbean U.S. territory with a population of 3.4 million.

All 69 votes against the aid package came from Trump’s fellow Republicans. Congress is expected to consider additional aid in the coming weeks but the debate could grow more contentious.

House Speaker Paul Ryan is scheduled to lead a bipartisan congressional delegation to Puerto Rico on Friday.

DISASTER FATIGUE

Some conservatives displayed early signs of spending fatigue.

Republican Representative Tom Cole, a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee, said some lawmakers have urged him to find ways to offset the costs of disaster relief.

Besides the latest aid package, Congress last month approved $15.25 billion to help with earlier storm damages, including Hurricane Harvey’s impact in Texas, and wildfires.

“There is some concern about can we couple some of this (disaster aid) with reform measures,” Cole told Reuters on Wednesday. That could include savings to a national flood insurance program or other steps, he added.

Besides helping Puerto Rico recover from Maria, the bill would also provide funds for storm-struck areas of Florida, Texas and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and fire-ravaged California.

Cole said the price tag could rise as relief efforts transition from emergency response to rebuilding.

Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, which has a sizeable Puerto Rican community, told Reuters he had urged Trump to create a high-level task force to provide advice for rebuilding Puerto Rico, and that the president was receptive to the idea.

Much of Puerto Rico remains without electricity or running water three weeks after Maria’s landfall.

Slideshow (5 Images)

“They’re basically three weeks now living in the 19th century,” Rubio said.

White House Chief of Staff John Kelly told reporters the Trump administration would “stand with those American citizens in Puerto Rico until the job is done.”

But Trump’s top legislative aide warned against expecting Washington’s help for long-term infrastructure problems.

“The president is committed to helping to make sure that we do what is necessary to help to rebuild the island, but there are some elements that pre-existed the hurricane,” Marc Short said on CNN.

The House bill includes $18.7 billion for FEMA’s disaster relief fund. Of that, $4.9 billion is earmarked for loans to local governments to ensure Puerto Rico can keep government programs operating beyond Oct. 31.

Other funds include $576.5 million for wildfire control.

Some $16 billion would go to help the National Flood Insurance Program cover claims after reaching its borrowing limit.

In its statement, the White House said it urged Congress to adopt reforms to the program to ensure its “long-term financial viability.”

Democratic Representative Nydia Velazquez of New York, which has a large Puerto Rican community, chastised Trump.

“The president of the United States is tweeting out threats to withdraw assistance, that is an outrage, that is an insult,” Velazquez said.",U.S. House approves disaster funds as Trump criticizes Puerto Rico,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-congress/u-s-house-approves-disaster-funds-as-trump-criticizes-puerto-rico-idUSKBN1CH1A7?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Crazy Horse, a French cabaret known for its topless female dancers, has returned to Singapore a decade after a franchise club failed in the conservative Southeast Asian city-state.

A Parisian institution for 66 years, the cabaret theater opened a club in Singapore in 2005 when the city was trying to spice up its image in a tourism revamp, but closed its doors two years later because of poor ticket sales.

This week the cabaret was back with “Forever Crazy”, a compilation of memorable routines that recently played in Australia.

The Singapore show was not censored by authorities, said Crazy Horse tour director Mark Brady.

“It’s the original production as we’ve just performed in Australia for nine weeks,” Brady said. “We’re not changing anything.”

Farah Nadia, a 29-year-old who attended the premiere at the Marina Bay Sands, said she was impressed watching the bare-breasted dancers going through their routines.

“As a woman, I believe that sexiness is a key to confidence and the ladies portrayed it really well,” she said.

She planned to watch the show again next week, but doubted her hometown was ready for another permanent cabaret club.

“We may have more expatriates, tourists or modern locals now, but people are still shy or conservative about shows like this,” she said.

The show, which runs for 12 nights in Singapore before moving to the Chinese-ruled territory of Macau, is restricted to those aged 18 and above.

When it came to issuing a license for “Forever Crazy”, the island’s Infocomm Media Development Authority appeared to accept the organizers’ argument the show was a form of art.

“It’s not necessarily easy to bring shows of this nature, but because I think it’s been understood that it’s a piece of art and it’s seen as art, they gave us the entertainment license,” said Chantal Prud‘homme, chief executive of BASE Entertainment Asia.

The media authority “aims to strike a balance between reflecting generally accepted social norms, while giving due consideration to the event’s artistic merits,” it said in an email statement.",French cabaret Crazy Horse returns to Singapore after a decade,https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idCAKBN1CI1CX-OCAEN

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistani troops shot out the tyres of a vehicle carrying a kidnapped U.S.-Canadian couple and their children in a raid that led to the family’s release, a Pakistani security official said on Friday.

The operation late on Wednesday freed American Caitlan Campbell, her Canadian husband Joshua Boyle and their three children who were born in captivity following five years as hostages of the Taliban-linked Haqqani network.

Taliban sources said the family spent most of their captivity at Haqqani strongholds inside Pakistan, and not in Afghanistan as early Pakistani reports had indicated.

A senior Pakistani security source on Friday detailed how the family, who were expected to leave Pakistan on Friday, were freed following a car chase in Pakistan’s northwestern tribal region bordering Afghanistan.

He said Pakistani troops and intelligence agents, acting on a U.S. intelligence tip, zeroed in on a vehicle holding the family as they were being moved in Kurram agency.

Agents from Pakistan’s Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) spy-agency and army soldiers attempted to intercept the vehicle, but it sped away and was chased into a district in northwest Pakistan, according to the security source.

“Our troops fired at the vehicle and burst its tyres,” he said, declining to be identified because he is not authorised to speak openly to the media.

The kidnappers managed to escape, the security official added, saying the troops wouldn’t fire at the fleeing captors for fear of harming the hostages. The army recovered the hostages safely from the car.

Major General Asif Ghafoor, military spokesman for Pakistan’s army, told NBC News that the vehicle’s driver and another militant had escaped to a nearby refugee camp.

A second Pakistani security official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said U.S. drones had been circling the town of Kohat, on the edge of the tribal areas on Wednesday, suggesting U.S. co-operation included sophisticated surveillance inside Pakistan.

The U.S. embassy in Pakistan declined to comment on the drone report.

The family’s rescue has been hailed by U.S. President Donald Trump as a “positive moment” for U.S.-Pakistan relations, which have frayed in recent years amid Washington’s assertions that Islamabad was not doing enough to tackle Haqqani militants who are believed to be on Pakistani soil.

Trump, in a statement, said the release of the hostages indicates Pakistan was acquiescing to “America’s wishes for it to do more to provide security in the region”.

Pakistani officials bristle at claims Islamabad is not doing enough to tackle Islamist militants. After the release of the family, they emphasised the importance of co-operation and intelligence sharing by Washington, which has threatened to cut military aid and other punitive measures against Pakistan.

HOSTAGES LOCATION

Pakistan’s military said the family were rescued after entering Pakistan from Afghanistan, but two Taliban sources with knowledge of the family’s captivity said they had been kept in Pakistan in recent years.

A U.S. government source in Washington also said there was no indication the family had been in Afghanistan.

The Haqqani network operates on both sides of the porous Afghan-Pakistani border but senior militants have acknowledged they moved a major base of operations to Kurram agency in the tribal areas.

Two U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, on Thursday told Reuters that the U.S. military had been ready to fly the family out of the country after they were freed but said Boyle, who is Canadian, had refused to board the aircraft.

Canada’s Toronto Star newspaper reported that Boyle told his parents that he asked to be taken to the Canadian High Commission in Islamabad after their rescue.

Boyle had been a staunch critic of the human rights abuses in the U.S. war on terror after the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001 and was previously married for a year to the sister of an inmate at the U.S. military detention centre at Guantanamo Bay.

The Star reported that Boyle said he sustained minor shrapnel wounds during the shootout.",Pakistan official details car chase that freed kidnapped U.S.-Canadian family,https://www.reuters.com/article/pakistan-afghanistan-kidnapping/pakistan-official-details-car-chase-that-freed-kidnapped-u-s-canadian-family-idINKBN1CI1C7

Berlin (Reuters) - Die deutsche Wirtschaft warnt vor der mit Spannung erwarteten Iran-Rede von US-Präsident Donald Trump vor einer Isolierung der Islamischen Republik.

“Die Rückkehr von Sanktionen wäre eine große Gefahr für die Wiedereingliederung des Landes in die Weltgemeinschaft”, sagte der Präsident des Bundesverbandes der Deutschen Industrie (BDI), Dieter Kempf, am Freitag in Berlin. “Die deutsche Wirtschaft ist überzeugt, dass eine wirtschaftliche Isolation des Iran die Sicherheitslage in der Region gerade nicht stabilisiert.” Es wird erwartet, dass Trump das Atomabkommen am Freitagabend nicht erneut bestätigt. Der Kongress müsste dann eine Wiedereinführung von Sanktionen prüfen.

Die Weltgemeinschaft sollte die reformorientierten Kräfte im Iran unterstützen und durch Aufhebung von Sanktionen helfen, das Land zu modernisieren, sagte Kempf. “Die Abkehr vom Nuklearprogramm muss sich für die Iraner sichtbar und im Alltagsleben lohnen. Das geht nur durch Wiedereingliederung des Iran in die Weltgemeinschaft – auch und vor allem wirtschaftlich.”

Ähnlich sieht das der Deutsche Industrie- und Handelskammertag (DIHK). Er befürchtet massive Auswirkungen auf den gerade erst in Schwung kommenden Handel mit dem Iran. “Die Unternehmen brauchen für ihre Geschäfte belastbare und stabile Rahmenbedingungen”, sagte DIHK-Außenwirtschaftschef Volker Treier. “Sollte US Präsident Trump die Bestätigung des Atomabkommens aussetzen, tritt das Gegenteil ein.” Die deutschen Unternehmen hätten in den vergangenen Monaten wichtige Kontakte geknüpft. Der Außenhandel habe sich bereits deutlich belebt - “in diesem Jahr mit über 20 Prozent Steigerung – trotz bestehenden Finanzierungsproblemen im Iran-Geschäft”, sagte Treier. “Gerade für Unternehmen, die sowohl im Iran wie in den USA tätig sind, wird die Gefahr virulent, von den USA belangt zu werden. Diese Unsicherheit wird die Geschäfte mit dem Iran wieder erheblich belasten.”","Deutsche Wirtschaft warnt vor Isolierung des Iran - ""Große Gefahr""",https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-iran-wirtschft-idDEKBN1CI1GY

Under his watch, Trump parted ways with chief strategist Steve Bannon and other top officials, while new restrictions were set to streamline meetings and material for the president.

But reports of both Kelly’s and the president’s frustrations have persisted, sparking continued speculation of pending shakeups.

Trump has confided to friends that he has felt constrained by some of Kelly’s moves to limit access to him and some administration officials have privately chafed at the restrictions as well, sources familiar with the internal dynamics of the White House have said.

Disarray within the executive branch has concerned officials outside the administration. Republican Senator Bob Corker has said Kelly is one of three officials including Secretary of Defense James Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson as “those people that help separate our country from chaos.”

Critics of the president say his frequent use of Twitter has contributed to a sense of chaos.

But the retired Marine made clear that he did not see his job as the arbiter of Trump’s tweets, pushing back at criticism that his penchant for order and organization had not extended to control over the president’s favorite mode of social media communication.

(Reuters) - U.S. Senator Susan Collins of Maine, a moderate Republican who helped block her party’s efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act this year, said she planned to remain in her current office rather than run for governor.

The four-term incumbent attracted national attention this summer as one of three Republican senators who voted in July against a bill to repeal the law often called Obamacare, a move that angered U.S. President Donald Trump. She said on Friday that remaining in the Senate would allow her to use her powerful voice in reforming the U.S healthcare system.

Collins, who like all Republicans in the Senate in 2009 voted against the sweeping healthcare legislation, said she believed urgent action was needed to improve it but criticized the way repeal efforts had been handled over the summer.

“When we’re dealing with an issue that affects millions of Americans, we need to understand the consequences of what we are doing, not vote on bills in the middle of the night that have had no substantive hearings,” Collins, 64, told a group of business leaders in Rockland, a city on the state’s midcoast.

“We must stop allowing partisanship to be the preexisting condition that prevents meaningful healthcare reform.”

Urgent action is needed to stabilize the insurance markets, including creating high-risk pools, she said. She wants to require employers to offer healthcare coverage only to people who work 40 hours a week or more, raising the threshold from 30 hours.

For weeks, Collins had flirted publicly with the idea of launching a bid to succeed Governor Paul LePage, a fiery conservative who was first elected in 2010 on a wave of support from the populist Tea Party movement. State laws forbid LePage from seeking a third term.

Collins and LePage mark out the two poles of the state’s Republican Party, with the senator working with Democrats in Washington while the governor has regularly fought with his rivals in the state capital Augusta. He has publicly criticized Collins.

Collins’ independence makes her an increasingly powerful player in Washington, one veteran Maine political observer said.

“She is at the very center of virtually every big policy debate and big vote in the U.S. Senate,” said Mark Brewer, professor of political science at the University of Maine. “She remains an incredibly important player on any issue she wants to focus on: tax reform, you name it.”","Republican Collins will stay in U.S. Senate, focused on healthcare",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-politics-collins/republican-collins-will-stay-in-u-s-senate-focused-on-healthcare-idUSKBN1CI1DK

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices recorded their biggest increase in eight months in September as gasoline prices soared in the wake of hurricane-related production disruptions at oil refineries in the Gulf Coast area, but underlying inflation remained muted.

The mixed report from the Labor Department on Friday comes as Federal Reserve officials have been engaged in a vigorous debate on the inflation path and suggests a December interest rate increase is not a done deal.

As a result, the dollar fell against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S Treasuries rose. Stocks on Wall Street rose to record highs. Policymakers could, however, find solace from another report indicating that the economy was swiftly recovering from the damage inflicted by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, with a strong rebound in retail sales last month.

“The firmness in retail sales should override the enduring mystery of low inflation to spur a December Fed rate hike,” said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.

The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index increased 0.5 percent last month after advancing 0.4 percent in August. September’s rise was the biggest since January and pushed up the year-on-year gain in the CPI to 2.2 percent from 1.9 percent in August. The increase in the CPI was broadly in line with economists’ expectations.

Gasoline prices surged 13.1 percent last month, accounting for 75 percent of the rise in the CPI. The increase in gasoline prices was the largest since June 2009 and followed a 6.3 percent advance in August.

The Labor Department said Harvey was reported to have impacted refinery capacity in the Gulf Coast and was likely a factor in last month’s increase in gasoline prices.

Outside gasoline, price pressures were benign. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, consumer prices gained 0.1 percent in September as the increase in rental accommodation slowed and the cost of new motor vehicles and medical care declined.

The so-called core CPI rose 0.2 percent in August. In the 12 months through September, the core CPI increased 1.7 percent. The year-on-year core CPI has now increased by the same margin for five consecutive months.

INTENSE INFLATION DEBATE

The Fed tracks the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy. The core PCE has consistently undershot the U.S. central bank’s 2 percent target for more than five years. Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said that temporary factors such as one-off price cuts by wireless telephone companies are holding back inflation.

Minutes of the Fed’s Sept. 19-20 meeting published on Wednesday showed ”many participants expressed concern that

the low inflation readings this year might reflect not only

transitory factors, but also the influence of developments

that could prove more persistent.”

Last month, food prices rose 0.1 percent after a similar gain in August. Owners’ equivalent rent of primary residence rose 0.2 percent after advancing 0.3 percent in August. Prices for new motor vehicles fell 0.4 percent as manufacturers resort to deep discounting to eliminate an inventory overhang.

There were also decreases in the cost of medical care, apparel, and household furnishings. But the cost of mobile phone services rose 0.4 percent after 14 straight months of declines.

In a separate report on Friday, the Commerce Department said retail sales jumped 1.6 percent in September likely as reconstruction and clean-up efforts in areas devastated by Harvey and Irma boosted demand for building materials and motor vehicles.

Retail sales were also buoyed by a surge in receipts at service stations, which reflected higher gasoline prices. Last month’s increase in retail sales was the largest since March 2015. Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales increased 0.4 percent last month after being unchanged in August. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product.

The rebound in core retail sales suggests the drag on the economy from the hurricanes will probably be modest. Economists estimate the storms could subtract at least six-tenths of a percentage point from third-quarter GDP growth.

The economy grew at a 3.1 percent annualized rate in the April-June period.

“The sudden increase in retail demand is likely to cause third-quarter growth to come in somewhat better than expected before the hurricanes hit,” said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.

“But what Mother Nature may have given in the third quarter, she will likely take away in the fourth.”","Gasoline buoys U.S. consumer prices, underlying inflation tame",https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-economy-inflation/gasoline-buoys-u-s-consumer-prices-underlying-inflation-tame-idINKBN1CI1Q0?il=0

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is likely to take a major step against the international nuclear deal with Iran on Friday, laying out a more aggressive approach to Iranian activities in the Middle East that risks upsetting U.S. relations with European allies.

“It is time for the entire world to join us in demanding that Iran’s government end its pursuit of death and destruction,” Trump said in a White House statement that flagged key elements of the strategy.

He is to present his plan in a 12:45 p.m. EDT (1645 GMT)speech at the White House, the product of weeks of internal discussions between him and his national security team.

U.S. officials said Trump was expected to announce that he will not certify the 2015 nuclear accord between Iran and six world powers, one he has called the “worst deal ever” as it was not, in his view, in the U.S. national interest.

Trump found himself under immense pressure as he considered de-certifying the deal, a move that would ignore warnings from inside and outside his administration that to do so would risk undermining U.S. credibility abroad.

He had formally reaffirmed it twice before but aides said he was reluctant to do so a third time.

De-certification would not pull the United States out of the deal but would give the Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions on Tehran that were suspended under the pact, negotiated during the administration of President Barack Obama.

Michael McCaul, chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Homeland Security Committee, told Reuters he thinks Trump “is likely to not completely pull out of the deal, but decertify compliance.”

If Washington quits the deal, that will be the end of it and global chaos could ensue, Iran’s influential parliament speaker, Ali Larijani, was quoted by the Russian news agency TASS as saying during a visit to St Petersburg on Friday.

“FOOTPRINTS ON THE GROUND”

U.N. nuclear inspectors say Iran is in compliance with the accord, which limited the scope of Iran’s nuclear program to help ensure it could not be put to developing bombs in exchange for a lifting of international sanctions on Tehran.

Trump says Tehran is in violation of the spirit of the agreement and has done nothing to rein in its ballistic missile program or its financial and military support for the Lebanese Shi‘ite movement Hezbollah and other militant groups.

White House Chief of Staff John Kelly said on Thursday the U.S. approach toward Iran is to work with allies in the Middle East to contain Tehran’s activities.

“We have footprints on the ground, naval and Air Force is there to just demonstrate our resolve, our friendship, and try to deter anything that any country out there may do,” Kelly told reporters.

European allies warn of a split with the United States over the nuclear agreement, in part because they are benefiting economically from a relaxation of sanctions.

A variety of European allies, including the leaders of Britain and France, have personally appealed to Trump to re-certify the nuclear accord for the sake of allied unity.

Germany’s government pledged on Friday to work for continued unity if Trump de-certified the deal as Berlin remain convinced the agreement was an important tool to prevent Iran developing nuclear weapons.

Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel underlined German views in a telephone call with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson late on Thursday, his spokeswoman Maria Adebahr told reporters.

Gabriel said on Thursday U.S. behavior was driving a wedge between Europe and its close ally United States and bringing Europeans closer to Russia and China. “It’s imperative that Europe sticks together on this issue,” said Gabriel.

Russian President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said on Friday that if the United States ditched the nuclear pact, “this will damage the atmosphere of predictability, security, stability and non-proliferation in the entire world”.

U.S. MOVE AGAINST REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS

McCaul said he expected Trump also to announce some kind of action against the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IGRC), the country’s most powerful security entity. Trump is under a legal mandate to impose U.S. economic sanctions on the Revolutionary Guards as a whole by Oct. 31 or waive them.

U.S. sanctions could seriously hurt the IRGC as it controls large swaths of Iran’s economy. The Guards’ foreign paramilitary and espionage wing, the Quds Force, is under U.S. sanctions, as is the Quds Force commander, other officials and associated individuals and entities.

The deputy Quds commander, Brigadier-General Esmail Ghaani, was quoted by Iran’ Tasnim news agency on Friday as saying Trump’s threats would “damage” the United States.

“We are not a war-mongering country. But any military action against Iran will be regretted...We have buried many...like Trump and know how to fight against America,” Ghaani said.

“EMBARRASSMENT”

The 2015 nuclear agreement, signed by the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China, the European Union and Iran, has been denounced by Trump as “an embarrassment”.

European officials have categorically ruled out renegotiating the deal but have said they share Trump’s concerns about Iran’s destabilizing influence in the Middle East.

China has said it hopes the agreement will stay intact.

Israel, Iran’s arch-adversary in the Middle East, welcomed Trump’s anticipated announcement on Friday but voiced doubt that the tougher tack by Washington could turn around the Islamic Republic.

The International Atomic Energy Agency concluded that Iran secretly researched a nuclear warhead until 2009, which Tehran denies. Iran has always insisted its uranium enrichment activity is for civilian energy purposes, not for atomic bombs.

The threat of new U.S. action has prompted a public display of unity from rival factions among Iran’s rulers. Iran will react sharply to any U.S. move against the nuclear deal with global powers, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told the Iranian parliament on Wednesday.

DUESSELDORF, Germany (Reuters) - Labour leaders remain sceptical about a planned merger of Thyssenkrupp’s European steel operations with those of Tata Steel, following the first meeting of a working group set up to convince workers to back the deal.

Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel last month announced plans for a joint venture that would create Europe’s second-largest steelmaker after ArcelorMittal. There would be an initial 4,000 job cuts that workers fear will be the tip of the iceberg.

To appease workers, whose approval is crucial to Thyssenkrupp’s Chief Executive Heinrich Hiesinger, a group of board members and labour representatives was set up shortly after the announcement.

“Today, we were presented with the key points of the memorandum of understanding,” Detlef Wetzel, deputy supervisory board chairman of Thyssenkrupp Steel Europe said following the group’s first meeting on Friday.

“Initially, this has raised more questions than answers,” Wetzel said, adding he expected lengthy and difficult talks.

Labour representatives hold half of the 20 seats on Thyssenkrupp’s supervisory board and while a deal can still be pushed through without their consent their approval could significantly smooth the transaction.

LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England has said that the interest rate hike it is likely to make “in the coming months” depends on whether inflation pressures continue to build and the economy moves nearer to growing at full capacity.

Most economists polled by Reuters now expect the central bank to raise rates on Nov. 2, after its next meeting, lifting the official cost of borrowing to 0.5 percent from 0.25 percent, the first increase in more than 10 years.

Below is a summary of what the BoE has said it is expecting to see in the British economy, how the economy has been performing and when the next key data releases are due.

INFLATION

What the BoE said: the central bank, which has a target of 2 percent inflation, said on Sept. 14 that consumer price growth will reach slightly above 3 percent in October, taking it to its highest since March 2012.

What has happened: In August the CPI rose to 2.9 percent in August from 2.6 percent in July. Many private-sector economists think it will hit 3 percent or slightly higher soon, before easing back.

The official inflation reading for September is due on Oct. 17, two weeks before the BoE’s next rates announcement, and economists polled by Reuters expect CPI to rise to 3.0 percent.

WAGES

What the BoE said: In August the BoE forecast that annual wage growth would be 2.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017, rising to 3.0 percent in the same period of 2018.

What has happened: Wage growth during the three months to July was a bit stronger than the BoE expected at 2.1 percent year-on-year. The BoE said some of this strength was due to bonuses. Also, private-sector pay excluding bonuses measured over a shorter time frame was growing at an annualised rate of 3 percent, in line with the BoE’s expectations.

A BoE survey has shown companies plan to offer pay deals in the 2-3 percent range, while a separate survey by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development gave a lower 2 percent average for the private sector.

The official wage growth data for the three months to August are due to be published on Oct. 18 and economists polled by Reuters expect no change from a previous reading of 2.1 percent.

ECONOMIC GROWTH

What the BoE said: Preliminary data is likely to show gross domestic product grew by 0.3 percent in the third quarter, the same slow quarterly growth as in the previous three months. But growth might be stronger due to improving consumer demand, it said.

What has happened: Financial data company Markit said its purchasing managers’ indices pointed to 0.3 percent third-quarter growth, while the National Institute of Economic and Social Research said official numbers pointed to an expansion of 0.4 percent.

August factory output beat expectations, and private-sector measures of retail sales growth have been solid. But Britain’s goods trade deficit hit a record high.

The preliminary official reading for GDP in the third quarter will be published on Oct. 25.

UNEMPLOYMENT

What the BoE said: the central bank forecast in August that unemployment would average 4.4 percent in the last three months of 2017 before rising slightly to 4.5 percent in 2018 and 2019, while labour force participation for over 16s would remain steady at 63.5 percent

What has happened: Unemployment fell faster than forecast, dropping to 4.3 percent of the workforce in the three months to July from 4.4 percent in the second quarter. That is below the 4.5 percent level that the BoE has previously said could be a trigger for higher inflation.

Labour force participation rose to 63.7 percent in June, its joint highest level since 2008.

The next official unemployment data are due on Oct. 18.

WHAT ARE FINANCIAL MARKETS SAYING?

Sterling rallied strongly in the run-up to and after the BoE’s Sept. 14 meeting, when it made its announcement, as investors had not been pricing in an interest rate rise until late 2018. Economists polled by Reuters were even more sceptical - they had expected no rate rise until 2019.

After the BoE announcement, financial markets brought forward their bets on when the rate hike would come and they are now pricing in an 85 percent chance of a hike at the Nov. 2 meeting.

Sterling peaked on Sept. 20 at $1.3656 GBP=, its highest since June 2016, but has since come under pressure and is now trading at a similar level to around the Sept. 14 meeting at just under $1.33.

È quanto emerge dai dati contenuti nel fascicolo 'Finanza pubblica, fabbisogno e debito' diffuso oggi da Banca d'Italia, secondo cui il portafoglio esteri risultava di 687,061 miliardi di euro contro i 678,048 di fine giugno (dato rivisto rispetto alla rilevazione di 676,663 miliardi fornita un mese fa). Si tratta del dato più alto dai 700,998 miliardi di novembre 2016.

Il calo è riconducibile alla cancellazione da parte del Tesoro di alcune delle aste di agosto, che ha portato ad un'offerta netta di governativi negativa per quasi 24 miliardi sul mese. TREND L'aumento in luglio dei titoli in circolazione è stato coperto oltre che dagli investitori esteri anche da quelli nazionali, nel dettaglio Bankitalia, banche italiane e retail; unica eccezione assicurazioni e fondi, il cui portafoglio è sceso di 10 miliardi circa, al 21,9% dal 22,6% del totale. Per quel che riguarda la quota di Bankitalia, si conferma la prosecuzione del trend ascendente legato all'avanzamento del Qe, riscontrabile anche su agosto (Via nazionale fornisce i dati al mese successivo anche sulla propria posizione), quando il portafoglio è ulteriormente salito a 334,083 miliardi, al 17,4% rispetto al 16,9% del mese precedente.

A Samsung Electronics spokeswoman declined comment on the exact timing of succession and potential successors for Kwon’s roles.","SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co Ltd said on Friday its CEO and Vice Chairman Kwon Oh-hyun plans to step down from management, deepening concerns over a leadership vacuum at the tech giant after group scion Jay Y. Lee was jailed for bribery.

The surprise resignation of Samsung’s chip and display head came as he was expected to take a bigger role following Lee’s arrest in February and the departures of other key executives in the wake of the bribery scandal.

The move came on the same day the South Korean smartphone maker forecast record third-quarter operating profit on the back of the memory chip business which Kwon was instrumental in building into the world leader.

“The timing is nonsensical. Samsung tipped record earnings, it’s going to be better in the fourth-quarter, and all that’s been driven by Kwon’s components business,” said Park Ju-gun, head of research firm CEO Score.

Kwon, 64, is seen as Samsung Group No. 2. As well as being chairman of the board and a board director, he heads the components business - including memory chips - and the display business.

In a statement, the man known as “Mr Chip” said the time had come to “start anew with new spirit and young leadership”.

“We are fortunately making record earnings right now, but this is the fruit of past decisions and investments; we are not able to even get close to finding new growth engines by reading future trends right now,” he added.

The world’s biggest maker of memory chips, smartphones and TVs is set to smash its annual profit record this year, thanks partly to soaring demand for memory chips. Semiconductors were Samsung’s top earner in the three months through June, making a record 8 trillion won ($7.20 billion).

The global chip industry is undergoing a major shift with Japan’s Toshiba Corp partnering with home rival SK Hynix, and other firms consolidating in search of new growth areas like artificial intelligence and automobiles.

Shares in Samsung, worth about $310 billion, fell 1.5 percent on Friday after hitting an all-time high earlier in the day.

Kwon would serve out his term as chairman of the board and board director until March 2018, the company said. He is also not stepping down immediately from his two other roles.

A Samsung Electronics spokeswoman declined comment on the exact timing of succession and potential successors for Kwon’s roles.

While Samsung Group is South Korea’s top conglomerate with businesses ranging from smartphones to hotels - it has had no ‘Plan B’ for taking big decisions following Lee’s arrest, people familiar with the matter have said.

“I‘m worried about a leadership vacuum at a time when Lee is absent from management,” Chung Sun-sup, chief executive of research firm Chaebul.com, said following Kwon’s announcement.

On Oct. 15, he will have to certify whether Tehran is observing the 2015 multinational agreement to forego nuclear weapons. Trump has reluctantly certified Iran’s compliance, which is due quarterly, twice since taking office. This time, his belligerent address to the United Nations suggests he may not.If the United States follows through on threats to stop fulfilling its commitments under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, as the Iran deal is formally known, its allies in Europe will be forced to choose between committing a crime and making a mistake. Whichever they decide, the strength of the transatlantic coalition – America’s most important and most reliable partnership – will be cast into doubt.

Iran is complying with the JCPOA. The U.S. intelligence community has repeatedly confirmed it, as have partner intelligence agencies and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). European leaders oppose refusing to certify Iranian compliance because it would make it likely that Congress will re-impose U.S. sanctions.

That would be only the first of two body blows to the agreement and to the alliance. The second would be an abuse of U.S. authority to re-impose United Nations sanctions.

The president has the power to force the United Nations to “snap back” the multilateral sanctions lifted under the deal – biting restrictions on Iranian banks and other businesses. If the United States re-imposes its own sanctions on Iran, it will inevitably avail itself of these UN sanctions, as well.

The Bush and Obama administrations persuaded Russia, China, and the UN Security Council to sanction Iran’s economy in order to limit its nuclear program. The JCPOA traded these sanctions for tight nuclear restrictions and inspections, but the United States and its partners worried that the Security Council might fail to re-impose the sanctions if Iran cheated, reducing Iran’s incentive for long-term compliance. A clever procedural solution was built into the JCPOA. Any participant in the deal can demand that the Security Council vote on a resolution to continue sanctions relief. The U.S. can veto that resolution, so even if the Security Council votes 14-1 all of the previous restrictions on Iran still snap back into place.

The JCPOA was built to respond to Iranian violations, even if Russia and China were no longer aligned with the United States and the EU. It was not designed to withstand a hawkish or isolationist America using its veto power outside of the terms of the deal or against the objections of its European partners.

Ironically, though, if the U.S. does choose to act alone, in the absence of Iranian violations and against the wishes of its allies, it might undermine the substantive goal of UN snapback, leaving empty sanctions on paper.

Once the UN applies – or in this case, re-applies – sanctions, the European Commission and European Union member countries are supposed to take a number of steps to make the UN sanctions part of EU law and regulation. This is serious business for Europe, which is strongly committed to the idea that, as a matter of international law, the UN can impose binding requirements on all members in the interest of international peace and security. The EU has occasionally faced legal challenges in applying UN sanctions, but it never has simply chosen to ignore a binding Security Council resolution as a matter of policy.

Europe would be sorely tempted to do exactly that on Iran. The snap back mechanism is designed for cases of Iranian non-compliance. Under the JCPOA, Washington does not need to prove that Iran has violated the deal, but Europe may decide that American bad faith justifies breaking from its own UN obligations. Certainly, Europe will categorically disagree with the U.S. policy. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, echoing the senior leadership of the UK, France, and Germany, said after Trump’s UN speech that the deal is working and must be preserved. If the U.S. withdraws, the EU has made clear it will do everything within its power to keep the agreement alive by sustaining newly established business ties with Iran.

Europe would thus be faced with a choice between a crime under international law and what it considers to be a policy mistake. In either case, Europe would be justifiably furious about being forced to choose between two important, deeply held policies – adherence to Security Council resolutions and implementation of the JCPOA.

Other countries, including Russia and China, may also prove lax in applying the restored sanctions, but this is both less uncommon and less important to Iran’s economic aspirations. U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA will hurt Iran’s economy badly, but will not achieve the kind of strangulating effect the broad international coalition had before the deal. A deep break between the United States, the UN and Europe will make it much less likely that the U.S. will ever be able to muster such powerful international economic pressure again.

At the UN last week, President Trump called the Iran deal “an embarrassment to the United States.” He teased that he has made a decision about whether to certify Iranian compliance to Congress but refused to tell anyone, including UK Prime Minister Theresa May, what he had decided. The weeks leading to the October 15 certification deadline may be Europe’s last, best chance to explain to President Trump and his advisors that undermining, let alone abrogating, the JCPOA would be a catastrophe not only for the goal of preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons, but also for the bond between the United States and Europe. The only winners would be Europe’s and America’s adversaries.",Commentary: Trump’s Iran threats risk a U.S. break with Europe,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blanc-iran-commentary/commentary-trumps-iran-threats-risk-a-u-s-break-with-europe-idUSKCN1C32E3

(Reuters) - Washington has dramatically increased tensions in talks to renew the North American Free Trade Agreement by proposing that the lifespan of any new deal be limited to five years, people familiar with the negotiations said on Thursday.

The proposal for a so-called sunset clause - just one of a series of U.S. initiatives that are opposed by NAFTA partners Canada and Mexico - only served to increase uncertainty about the future of the deal.

Two sources with direct knowledge of the talks described the atmosphere as “horrible” and highly charged.

The U.S. side proposed the sunset clause late on Wednesday during the fourth of seven scheduled rounds to update the rules governing one of the world’s biggest trade blocs, said two officials, who asked not to be identified because the talks are confidential.

The Trump administration says the clause, causing NAFTA to expire every five years unless all three countries agree it should continue, is to ensure the pact stays up to date.

But Mexico and Canada insist there is no point updating the pact with such a threat hanging over it, arguing the clause would stunt investment by sowing too much uncertainty about the future of the agreement.

“It’s a source of total uncertainty,” said one of the NAFTA government officials.

Speaking in Mexico City, Finance Minister Jose Antonio Meade said the government was working on plans to alter tariffs and identify substitute markets in case the NAFTA talks failed.

His remarks and the tension around NAFTA helped push the peso down 1 percent against the U.S. dollar to a five-month low.

U.S. President Donald Trump says NAFTA, originally signed in 1994, has been a disaster for the United States and has frequently threatened to scrap it unless major changes are made.

Business and farm groups say abandoning the 23-year-old pact would wreak economic havoc, disrupting cross-border manufacturing supply chains and slapping high tariffs on agricultural products.

In addition to the sunset clause, the United States wants to boost how much North American content autos must contain to qualify for tax-free status and eliminate a dispute settlement mechanisms that Canada insists must stay.

Some trade observers said it is difficult to see how negotiators could reach an agreement given U.S. demands that many see as non-starters.

The head of Unifor, Canada’s largest private sector labor union, said it was clear the United States did not want a deal.

“NAFTA is not going anywhere. This thing is going into the toilet,” Jerry Dias told reporters on Thursday.

Despite clear signs of impatience from Canada in particular, U.S. negotiators have yet to submit their proposal on rules of origin for the auto sector. That looked unlikely to come before Friday, another official familiar with the talks said.

Trump on Wednesday repeated his warnings that he might terminate the pact and said he was open to doing a bilateral deal with either Canada or Mexico.

He was speaking alongside Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who later said Canada was “braced” for Trump’s unpredictability.

Negotiators were also set to cover the difficult issue of government procurement on Thursday.

Canada and Mexico want their companies to be able to bid on more U.S. federal and state government contracts, but this is at odds with Trump’s “Buy American” agenda. U.S. negotiators have countered with a proposal that would effectively grant the other countries less access, people familiar with the talks say.

On automotive rules of origin, NAFTA negotiators face tough new U.S. demands to increase regional vehicle content to 85 percent from 62.5 percent, with 50 percent required from the United States, according to people briefed on the plan.

The rules of origin demands are among several conditions that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has labeled “poison pill proposals” that threaten to torpedo the talks.",U.S. hikes tensions in NAFTA talks with call for 'sunset clause',https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trade-nafta/u-s-hikes-tensions-in-nafta-talks-with-call-for-sunset-clause-idINKBN1CH2EO?il=0

The Commerce Department said on Friday that business inventories increased 0.7 percent after rising 0.3 percent in July. Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product.

Retail inventories gained 0.7 percent in August as estimated last month. Retail inventories were unchanged in July.

Motor vehicle inventories rose 1.3 percent instead of the previously reported 1.2 percent jump. Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, increased 0.4 percent as reported last month.

They slipped 0.1 percent in July. August’s gain suggests inventory investment could contribute to GDP in the third quarter after adding just over one-tenth of a percentage point to the 3.1 percent annualized pace of growth in the April-June period.

(Reuters) -

Sixteen days after Hurricane Maria ravaged Puerto Rico, Maria de Lourdes Sandoval heard helicopters over her village of Bajura.

She ran to signal them, forcefully waving her arms and crying for help as they touched down on a nearby soccer field. ”I‘m helpless. I don’t have a home, don’t have anywhere to live. I don’t have furniture, no bed, no clothes,” Sandoval, 47, told Reuters.

Hundreds of villages, isolated by power outages, impassable roads and downed telephone lines, are being helped by helicopter teams from the U.S. Army’s First Armored Division’s Combat Aviation Brigade and the 101st Airborne Division’s “Dustoff” unit.

Daily missions are flown out of the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station in Ceiba, which was closed in 2004 but is now being used by the Army, Air Force, Marines and Navy.

“It hurts because I remember how it used to be, and now it’s completely different,” said Sergeant First Class Eladio Tirado, who was born and raised in Carolina, Puerto Rico. After not visiting for roughly five years, he returned home in a Blackhawk helicopter.

“Everything is so much gone. The vegetation, everything is brown, everything is dead.”

On a recent mission over Luqillo, Tirado asked the pilots to fly over his family’s home because he had been unable to reach them by phone. The helicopter circled the house. No one was there, but Tirado was confident the message would reach his family: he’s here and he’s helping.

Media reports led crews to the village of San Lorenzo, which had received no federal assistance since the hurricane. Dozens of people pressed against a fence to watch helicopters land, anxiously waiting for food and water.

Crews are also transporting people to emergency centers and mapping open roads so trucks can make deliveries.

Rooftop messages like one near Humacao come through loud and clear. “HELP USA PLEASE P.R.”

Near Ciales, as Blackhawks from the 1st Armored Division flew over, people on a rooftop reached toward the sky to signal they needed water.

As helicopters scouted the island’s mountainous interior one recent Saturday a woman held a jug in the air.

They circled above houses built on top of mountains to find a level field to unload their precious cargo. One field looked open and a Blackhawk came within eight feet of the ground, but it could not land.

Loaded with 100 cases of water, the helicopter flew off, leaving behind thirst and desperation.

The crew soon found another needy community, Verde de Comerío, where it was able to land.

Villagers quickly lined up to help soldiers pass food and water to a crowd. One woman hugged Pilot Chris Greenway to thank him for water. In less than 10 minutes, hundreds of bottles of water were given to families, emptying the helicopter.

This village also needed medicine, and families with babies had no way of getting basics. Diapers and formula have become luxury goods. But every village asks for water.

The lack of potable water is slowly choking these villages and helicopters can only carry so much. Every trip leaves some who get nothing.

The crews can only hope they can return soon enough to make a difference.

”This island will never stop,” Tirado said. “People will rebuild, we will continue forward, and they’re going to see a better tomorrow.”

In a speech at the department’s Executive Office For Immigration Review, Sessions said too many immigrants were taking advantage of the rules, and urged Congress to pass legislation that could make it harder for asylum petitions to be granted.

Overhauling the U.S. asylum system was on a list of immigration proposals the White House sent Congress over the weekend that President Donald Trump wants in exchange for a legislative fix for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. Most of the principles, including a crackdown on the influx of Central American unaccompanied minors, are likely to be non-starters for Democrats.

Sessions did not announce any specific policy shifts in his speech but urged Congress to act.

“Congress must pass the legislative priorities President Trump announced this week, which included significant asylum reform, swift border returns, and enhanced interior enforcement,” he said.

He said there were “loopholes” in the law that allow immigrants, whom federal officials determine have a “credible fear” of returning to their home countries, to be released pending a hearing before a judge.

He also advocated for imposing and enforcing penalties for “baseless” asylum applications, elevating the threshold standard of proof in credible fear interviews, and expanding the ability to return asylum seekers to safe third countries.

After they pass their credible fear review, many people simply disappear and never show up at their immigration hearings, Sessions said.

He blamed the Obama administration for a policy shift in 2009 that allowed them to be released from custody, and said he believed many peoples’ credible fear claims were simply a “ruse to enter the country illegally.”

Human Rights First, a group that provides pro bono legal assistance to refugees, said the attorney general’s comments mischaracterized asylum seekers as “threats and frauds.”

Donald Trump mentioned Afghanistan just once in his speech to the United Nations Tuesday. His “new strategy for victory” there, he said, would help “crush the loser terrorists and stop the reemergence of safe havens they use to launch attacks on all of our people.”

Trump outlined that new strategy on August 21, in an address that was a curious mixture of the vague and the specific. Speaking at Fort Myer, the U.S. president announced plans to deploy additional American troops, but did not give details about numbers, policy specifics or an exit strategy. He mentioned Pakistan 12 times – criticizing it for “housing the very terrorists that we are fighting” – but did not make a single mention of the two other countries ramping up resistance to the U.S. presence in the region: Russia and Iran.

That was a serious omission on Trump’s part. No U.S. plan for Afghanistan can accomplish even its most minimal objective of destroying militant groups like al Qaeda or the Taliban unless it factors in the mounting evidence that Tehran and Moscow are playing a more aggressive role in resisting the American presence in the region.

Sharif Yaftali, chief of general staff of the Afghan national army, told the BBC in an exclusive interview on September 6 that Kabul has evidence showing that Iran had provided the Taliban with weapons and equipment in western Afghanistan. While Yaftali acknowledged that Afghan security forces have not yet found any evidence of Russian support for the Taliban, others believe Tehran is consolidating its South Asian partnership with Russia by serving as a mediator between Moscow and Afghan insurgents.

“The regional politics have changed,” Mohammed Arif Shah Jehan, an Afghan senior intelligence official recently appointed the governor of Farah province adjacent to Iran told The New York Times in August. “The strongest Taliban here are Iranian Taliban.”

Iran also helps Russia provide various types of weaponry to the Taliban, Hayatullah Hayat, the provincial governor of Helmand province, told the Washington Post. The arms deliveries include rocket-propelled grenades, landmines, sniper rifles and 82mm mortar rounds.

In a similar vein, construction of the largely India-funded Chabahar port in Iran’s southeastern Sistan and Baluchistan province is arguably pursued with a view to the Afghan war and the strategic rivalries unfolding there. A counterweight to Pakistan’s Chinese-backed Gwadar port only 62 miles away, Chabahar will enhance Delhi's foothold in landlocked Afghanistan by offering it convenient access through the Gulf of Oman, thereby enabling India to bypass rival Pakistan. This can in turn boost Iran’s military mobility and political influence over events in the conflict-ridden nation.

Perhaps the most telling sign of Tehran-Taliban collaboration dates back to May 2016, when a U.S. drone targeted a lone vehicle on a desert route in the southwest Pakistani province of Baluchistan, killing the driver and his only passenger. The passenger’s passport listed his name as Wali Mohammad; U.S. and Afghan officials said he was really Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansour.

Intriguingly, the mystery passenger was returning from Iran; the passport indicated that it was at least his second trip to the neighboring Islamic Republic that year.

The catalyst for Shiite Iran’s unlikely yet growing relationship with the Sunni Taliban has been the rise of the more militant, rabidly anti-Shiite Islamic State in parts of Afghanistan. For Iran, the Taliban is the lesser evil with the potential to serve as a local bulwark against the spread of the most aggressive anti-Iranian forces to its east.

Trump needs to recognize the profound regional shift in interests and alliances since the U.S. invaded Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington. Back in 2001, Tehran helped the U.S.-led coalition topple the Taliban, which it blamed for the killing of Iranian diplomats during the storming of Iran’s consulate in Mazar-i-Sharif three years earlier. The intelligence and military assistance offered by Iran and its Afghan allies in the Northern Alliance – a military front that also enjoyed the backing of Russia and India at the time – was indispensable to the U.S. mission.

Sixteen years on, Trump’s anti-Iran sentiments make a similar collaboration unlikely. However, Washington does have to recognize that it cannot ignore Iran’s national security concerns in its immediate neighborhood or Russia’s strategic interests in Central and South Asia. Trump doesn’t have to become Moscow or Tehran’s best friend, but he should be considering measures like offering to de-list Iran as a “state sponsor of terrorism” and easing sanctions against Tehran and Moscow in return for their withdrawing support from anti-American forces in Afghanistan. Those measures aren’t going to end Afghanistan’s internal conflict, but they might de-escalate it enough for Trump to work on a new exit strategy for U.S. troops.",Commentary: The real deal Trump has to make on Afghanistan,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-behravesh-afghanistan-commentary/commentary-the-real-deal-trump-has-to-make-on-afghanistan-idUSKCN1BV28K

LONDON/VIENNA (Reuters) - With the ink barely dry on Lufthansa’s (LHAG.DE) deal to take over large parts of insolvent Air Berlin, the airline risks having its wings clipped by regulators and rivals concerned about unfair competition.

Lufthansa signed a 210 million euro ($248 million) deal on Thursday to take over Air Berlin units Niki and LG Walter, plus some short-haul planes, to cement its position in Germany and expand its Eurowings budget brand.

Austrian competition authorities said on Friday they believed Lufthansa, which also owns Austrian Airlines, would be too dominant in Vienna if it owned Austria-based Niki.

“We see an anti-competitive Lufthansa monopoly in Vienna on many routes after the takeover of Fly Niki,” the competition authority’s spokeswoman said. “We will voice our concern about the takeover at the European Commission.”

The German cartel office said it expected the European Commission to take a close look at the deal.

The European Commission had no comment, with a spokesman saying it had not yet been formally notified of the deal.

RIVALS COMPLAIN

The deal has also raised eyebrows with rival airlines. Ryanair (RYA.I) CEO Michael O‘Leary has called it a “stitch-up”, saying it would give Lufthansa a 95 percent share of the German domestic market. Ryanair said on Thursday it would take up its case with the EU.

Lufthansa has hit back at such claims, saying the deal would have to be examined not only from the point of view of the German market but Europe as a whole.

Lufthansa has said it has a market share of 34 percent on routes to and from Germany, while Air Berlin had 14 percent. With the takeover of parts of Air Berlin that will remain below 48 percent, which Lufthansa says is equivalent to Ryanair’s market share in Ireland.

Willie Walsh, CEO of British Airways parent IAG (ICAG.L), said on Friday he saw “significant” competition concerns with the deal, which will see Lufthansa taking on around 80 of Air Berlin’s 130 planes.

Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr said on Thursday he expected the deal would be approved by the end of the year.

A company source said Lufthansa was confident of getting approval, but expected there would be some remedies, as was the case when Lufthansa acquired Austrian Airlines and Swiss International Air Lines.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Amazon Studios chief Roy Price was put on an immediate leave of absence Thursday, the company said, following allegations that he harassed a producer and ignored an actress’s claim of a sexual assault by producer Harvey Weinstein.

The Hollywood Reporter on Thursday reported an allegation by Isa Hackett, a producer on one of Amazon.com Inc’s shows, that Price had lewdly propositioned her in 2015.

Amazon said in a statement: ”Roy Price is on leave of absence effective immediately. We are reviewing our options for the projects we have with The Weinstein Co.”

Hackett did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reuters could not independently confirm the allegation. Price could not immediately be reached independently by Reuters and he declined to comment to the Hollywood Reporter.

Price’s removal creates uncertainty about the studio’s direction when Amazon is investing more on video content than ever before - some $4.5 billion this year.

The studio’s Chief Operating Officer Albert Cheng will step in as the interim chief, Amazon said.

Hackett is the daughter of famed science fiction author Philip K. Dick, whose book “The Man in the High Castle” served as the basis for Amazon’s eponymous show.

Also on Thursday, actress Rose McGowan said on Twitter that she had told Price that she had been assaulted by Weinstein, who was forced out of his company this week following reports in the New Yorker and the New York Times that he had harassed and assaulted numerous women over the years. In tweets directed at Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, she criticized the company for doing business with the Weinstein Co.

A spokeswoman for Harvey Weinstein said: “Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein.”

Price has been integral to Amazon’s movie business, helping steer it through an attempt to crowd-source television scripts and garnering Hollywood awards for shows such as “Transparent.”

Amazon hopes original movies and TV shows will draw new people to join its streaming and shopping club Prime, and in turn buy more goods from the online retailer.

The studio picked up three Oscars this year under Price’s helm, though its failure to show at the Emmy Awards last month was seen by many in Hollywood as a setback.",Amazon Studios chief Roy Price suspended following harassment allegation,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-people-roy-price/amazon-studios-chief-roy-price-suspended-following-harassment-allegation-idUSKBN1CI03X

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of U.S. hospital companies and health insurers fell on Friday after President Donald Trump decided to cut off Obamacare subsidies to health insurance companies for low-income patients in a move that sparked threats of legal action and concern about chaos in insurance markets.

The White House said late Thursday it could no longer lawfully pay the “cost-sharing reduction” subsidies, which were guaranteed to insurers under former President Barack Obama’s 2010 Affordable Care Act to help lower out-of-pocket medical expenses for low-income consumers.

Trump, like most of his fellow Republicans a strong critic of Obamacare, has made the payments each month since taking office in January, even as he attacked them as a “bailout” for insurance companies.

Still, the actual impact of the cuts on U.S. insurers could be muted. They had already factored in the possibility that the Trump administration would stop making the payments when setting next year’s rates for Obamacare plans in many states, said Jeff Jonas, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds who focuses on healthcare. Hospital companies could be hit harder.

“We already were expecting (Obamacare) enrollment to be way down last year and therefore, see slightly fewer admissions and more charity care and bad debt. This just reinforces that,” Jonas said.

Shares of hospital operators Tenet Healthcare (THC.N), Community Health Systems (CYH.N) and HCA Healthcare (HCA.N) were down 7.6 percent, 6 percent and 3.3 percent, respectively, in before-the-bell trading on Friday.

Shares of insurer Centene Corp (CNC.N) fell 7.3 percent and Molina Healthcare’s stock (MOH.N) dropped 2.3 percent.

Yet in practice she will find the going tougher in her fourth term as political, economic and demographic vulnerabilities take their toll.","Unlike the nerve-jangling elections earlier this year in the Netherlands, France and Britain, Germany’s has been notably dull. The country that invented “Sturm und Drang” is showing a distinct lack of storm and stress as Angela Merkel heads towards a fourth term as chancellor.

That seemingly inexorable outcome on Sept. 24 has raised hopes that she will push through greater integration within the euro area, in partnership with French president Emmanuel Macron, while also championing the rules-based international order that America has forsaken under Donald Trump. But Merkel will find it hard to satisfy such expectations, since she will face new political constraints at home, while the basis for her authority, German economic strength, will come under increasing strain.

A string of polls suggests that the politics of Merkel’s fourth term will be tricky. The chancellor is a long way ahead but she is not doing as well as in the last election, in 2013. Recent findings show support for her center-right CDU party (together with the CSU in Bavaria) at around 36 percent, down from the 41.5 percent she managed four years ago. Because of Germany’s electoral system, which broadly aligns the distribution of seats in the Bundestag with the parties’ share of the vote – while excluding those that fail to reach a 5 percent voting threshold - she will once again have to form a coalition.

The most stable government would be another “grand coalition” with the center-left SPD, her current partner, which is currently polling at around 22 percent. That might appeal to the SPD leadership but many party members are opposed to playing second fiddle again, not least since this does not pay off at the polls. If Merkel cannot form a coalition with the SPD, she may have to form a coalition with not just one but two smaller parties, the FDP and the Greens. This combination would be a first in the Bundestag and it could prove fissile by bringing together the free-market FDP, Merkel’s junior partner in her second term of office between 2009 and 2013, with Germany’s environmentalist party, which has in the past allied itself with the SPD.

The coalition arithmetic could change if the election throws up surprise results for the smaller parties. But whatever alliance Merkel forms after probably protracted negotiations, it will face a disturbing new political phenomenon. Until now the Bundestag has been immune from the upsurge of populism in Europe. But the far-right AfD (Alternative for Germany) looks set to break through the 5 percent threshold that held it at bay in 2013. Currently polling around 10 percent, it has mutated from its euroskeptic origins into an anti-immigration party, capitalizing upon concerns about the influx of asylum-seekers in 2015. Though riven by internal divisions and shunned by the other parties, the AfD will be able to use its presence in the Bundestag as a platform for its populist opposition to the chancellor’s policies.

The politics of Merkel’s fourth term may be more unfavorable than before, but that should be surmountable if the economy – her trump card in the election - remains buoyant. Growth prospects for this year and next year are good, continuing a robust performance in the chancellor’s last two terms. Manufacturers excel in exporting the high-quality engineering products in which Germany specializes. The current-account surplus is extraordinarily high at around 8 percent of GDP. Helped by the humming economy and low interest rates on government debt, Germany boasts healthy public finances too, running a surplus of almost 1 percent of GDP.

Peter Apps: The coming robot arms race

John Lloyd: Labor reform in France's Macron economy

German economic and fiscal strength, so crucial in underpinning the euro zone during the crisis years of 2010-12, has come to be taken for granted. Yet under the shiny paint the engine looks less reliable for the longer journey ahead. Much of the economy does not match the prowess of German manufacturers. In particular Germany lags in business services, as a report from the OECD pointed out last year. Many professions are subject to restrictions that fetter competition. Germany is overbanked with too many small lenders and the banking sector has unhelpfully high levels of public ownership.

Moreover, the business model of German manufacturing is under threat. The diesel emissions scandal that began when Volkswagen admitted cheating U.S. emissions tests has cast a shadow over the country’s premier industry and German carmakers’ big bet on the fuel now looks misplaced. They have to scramble to catch up with electric-powered models, whose time has come thanks both to technological advances and a wave of public-health measures led by cities to ban polluting vehicles. The self-driving revolution poses another challenge to German carmakers. Manufacturers fret that they may be on the wrong side of the digital divide, with Silicon Valley in effect grabbing the high value-added content of many products.

Germans are proud of their massive current-account surplus, yet the domestic counterpart is a lack of investment to absorb national savings. The government’s drive to balance the books has come at the cost of inadequate capital spending on the national infrastructure. Business investment has been subdued. Indeed, according to the OECD’s survey, German firms are behind those of other advanced countries in investing in the “knowledge-based capital”, such as software and management skills, that is increasingly important in spurring greater efficiency. That is one reason why productivity growth has been weak.

An underlying and profound weakness is that Germany’s demographics are especially unfavorable in economic terms. At almost 46, the median age of the population in 2015 was only just lower than Japan’s, the world’s oldest, according to UN data released in June. Although there was a baby boom from the mid-1950s through most of the 1960s, the birth rate fell below the replacement level (of 2.1 children per woman) at the start of the 1970s and has since been among the lowest in the world; indeed the current fertility rate of 1.5 is unusually high. These persistently low birth rates mean that there are fewer young people to replace the bulge of baby-boomers as they retire. Despite the recent upsurge in immigration the working-age population is set to fall, which will act as a persistent drag on growth by reducing the number of workers over the next couple of decades.

For the moment, Merkel still has the aura of invincibility. Yet in practice she will find the going tougher in her fourth term as political, economic and demographic vulnerabilities take their toll. That will limit her ability to meet the exaggerated expectations of what she can achieve both within Europe and on the wider international stage.",Commentary: Don’t be fooled by Merkel’s aura of invincibility,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wallace-germany-commentary/commentary-dont-be-fooled-by-merkels-aura-of-invincibility-idUSKCN1BU2BJ

PARIS (Reuters) - The United Nations’ cultural agency will elect a new chief on Friday, seeking someone who can revive UNESCO’s fortunes after the United States and Israel pulled out.

Whoever gets the job will need to restore relevance to the agency whose mission to protect the world’s cultural and natural heritage has been hobbled by regional rivalries and a lack of money.

After five days of secret balloting at UNESCO’s Paris HQ two former culture ministers, Qatar’s Hamad bin Abdulaziz al-Kawari and France’s Audrey Azoulay, face off in the final vote of the 58-member Executive Board, scheduled for Friday evening.

“More than ever UNESCO needs a project that rallies the member states, re-establishes trust and cuts through the political divisions for the sake of UNESCO,” French foreign ministry spokeswoman Agnes Romatet-Espagne said ahead of the vote to replace Irina Bokova, a Bulgarian who has led the body since 2009.

The United States is meant to provide a fifth of UNESCO’s funding, but had already been withholding that since 2011 when the body admitted Palestine as a full member. It announced its departure on Thursday accusing UNESCO of anti-Israeli bias. Israel itself followed.

“Unfortunately, this venue has become politicized, undermining the work of UNESCO across its mandate. It’s become a venue for anti-Israel bias, and unfortunately we are taking the decision to withdraw from UNESCO at this time,” U.S. charge d‘affaires at UNESCO, Chris Hegadorn told Reuters.

With a Qatari and an Egyptian earlier vying for the job, the election has been troubled by the standoff between Doha and several of its Arab neighbors that have severed diplomatic, trade and travel ties, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorism, something it denies.

The Qatari, Kawari, who has been subject of barbs from Egyptian officials over the last week and been subjected to online abuse said on Thursday night he was confident he would win and wanted to reunite the member states.",U.N. cultural agency to pick new chief after U.S. walkout,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-unesco-vote/unesco-to-pick-new-chief-after-u-s-walkout-idUKKBN1CI15X

(Reuters) - A surge in technology stocks sent the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq to record highs on Friday, but the gains were kept in check by a drop in banks as Wells Fargo missed revenue estimates for a fourth straight quarter.

Wells Fargo (WFC.N) tumbled 3 percent, set for its biggest drop since mid-April, adding to the pressure on bank stocks after results from JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Citigroup (C.N) on Thursday stoked concerns about consumer credit.

Bank of America (BAC.N), however, bucked the trend, rising 0.5 percent after the lender’s profit topped estimates due to higher interest rates and a drop in costs.

The reports from the Wall Street banks kicked off the earnings season and investors are hoping profit growth will help justify valuations after a rally that has sent the S&P 500 up about 14 percent so far this year.

The market got a boost earlier in the day after data showed retail sales surged by the most in 2-1/2 years in September, easing doubts over an economy that has been sluggish this year.

Another report showed consumer prices recorded their biggest increase in eight months last month as gasoline prices soared in the wake of hurricane-related production disruptions.

But, year-on-year core inflation was unmoved for the fifth month, putting no new pressure on the Federal Reserve to tighten borrowing costs and hamper demand any further.

“While markets are still expecting the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in December, concerns over prolonged periods of depressed inflation may cloud the prospect of higher U.S. interest rates in 2018,” Lukman Otunuga, a research analyst at FXTM said.

“Although this (retail sales) was below market estimates, this figure is still encouraging and continues to support the bullish sentiment towards the U.S. economy.”

The industry group said actual sales, not seasonally adjusted, were down 11.0 percent from September 2016, while home prices were up 10.7 percent from a year earlier, according to the group’s home price index.

“National sales appear to be stabilizing,” CREA President Andrew Peck said in a statement. “While encouraging, it’s too early to tell if this is the beginning of a longer-term trend.”

Canada’s once-sizzling housing market has cooled dramatically in recent months, particularly in Toronto, the largest city, after a foreign buyers tax was announced in April, and analysts are divided over whether the market is in the midst of a full-scale correction or will bounce back quickly.

In addition to the implementation of a foreign buyers tax in Vancouver in 2016 and Toronto in 2017, two recent interest rate hikes by the Bank of Canada has helped rein in demand.

The report showed activity was up on the month in about half of all local markets, including Vancouver and Toronto. Cities around Toronto had mixed results, with activity remaining near record lows or falling further in some markets.

Sales were down from year-ago levels in nearly three-quarters of all local markets, led by Toronto and nearby housing markets.

The 10.7 percent year-over-year increase in CREA’s Home Price Index was a continued deceleration in annual price gains earlier in the year. The actual national average price for homes sold in September was up almost 3 percent from a year ago at C$487,000 ($390,537), CREA said.

Home resale prices dropped 0.8 percent in September from August, their biggest fall in seven years, while new home prices rose 0.1 percent in August, separate reports showed on Thursday. [L2N1MN0KT]

The report showed the number of newly listed homes rebounded almost 5 percent in September from August, breaking a string of three straight declines.

The national sales-to-new listings ratio declined to 55.7 percent from 57.2 percent in August. A ratio between 40 and 60 percent is generally consistent with a balanced market.

WARSAW (Reuters) - South Korea’s LG Chem will open Europe’s largest lithium-ion battery factory in Poland next year as the region’s auto industry gears up to mass produce electric cars.

Tumbling battery prices and growing pressure to cut exhaust emissions have led carmakers to embrace electric vehicles. Manufacturers from VW Group (VOWG_p.DE) to Volvo Cars, Daimler and BMW plan to roll out a raft of new electric models in coming years.

But Europe lacks big-scale battery cell production facilities so those components are mostly imported from China and South Korea.

Calls are now growing for the region to develop its own battery industry to preserve jobs and profits, though Asian producers have a huge head start in development and scale.

LG Chem plans to spend 5.9 billion zlotys ($1.63 billion) on the factory near the southwestern city of Wroclaw, according to Polish state industry agency ARP.

Wroclaw is 190 kilometers (118 miles) from the border with Germany, home of VW Group which plans to invest more than 20 billion euros ($24 billion) in zero-emission vehicles by 2030 and make 3 million electric vehicles (EVs) a year by 2025.

LG Chem expects to produce up to 100,000 EV batteries in Poland annually from next year, it said on Thursday in a statement.

The factory will employ 2,500 people. LG Chem, a subsidiary of Korea’s LG Corp, did not name the likely customers but said they would include top car companies.

“The company has chosen Poland as the most competitive location for production to satisfy the needs of European and global car producers,” said Chang-Beom Kang, vice president at LG Chem.

It was not immediately clear if the factory would produce all the basic battery cells from scratch or import some components, but the statement said the site would include a research and development center employing “about 400 engineers from various specializations: automation, electronics, chemistry and IT”.

Asked about the source of lithium and other raw materials, a representative of LG Chem’s local arm said they would first be imported from the parent company in Korea and then hopefully from Polish suppliers.

DEMAND SURGE

The factory’s planned capacity is just a fraction of expected future demand.

Based on the typical capacity of a mid-market compact car like Nissan Leaf, 100,000 car batteries are equivalent to 4 GWh per year. This means the factory’s capacity could be slightly more than 10 percent of the production capacity that Tesla’s U.S. based “Gigafactory” is to reach in 2018.

Battery costs have been prohibitive but are falling rapidly. Average battery costs have come down from over $1,000 per kilowatt hour in 2010, to around $227 in 2016, according to analysts at Barclays.

In 2016, only 0.2 percent of new passenger cars sold in Europe were fully electric.

But Britain and France say they will ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2040 in an attempt to reduce air pollution, ending use of the fossil fuel-guzzling internal combustion engine.

LG’s Polish plant may not remain Europe’s largest car battery plant for long.

In September, Swiss engineering group ABB said it had joined a project to build Europe’s largest lithium-ion battery factory in Sweden targeting annual cell production equivalent to 32 gigawatt-hours by 2023, over 90 percent of Tesla’s Gigafactory target.

That project, named Northvolt, is led by a former manager at Tesla, which also plans to build a Gigafactory in Europe, though it has not said where.",LG to open Europe's biggest car battery factory next year,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lgchem-factory-poland/lg-to-open-europes-biggest-car-battery-factory-next-year-idUSKBN1CH21W

Researchers last year detected 3 tonnes of silver and 43 kg of gold in effluent and sludge from waste water treatment plants - amounting to around 3 million Swiss francs ($3.1 million).
This was the only region where it might make sense to recover the metals, Vriens said.

Researchers last year detected 3 tonnes of silver and 43 kg of gold in effluent and sludge from waste water treatment plants - amounting to around 3 million Swiss francs ($3.1 million).

But before people start hunting in their drains for jewelry, the government study said the tiny particles were likely to be mostly from the watchmaking, pharmaceuticals and chemical industries, which use the metals in their products and processes.

“You hear stories about an angry man or woman throwing jewelry down the toilet, but we didn’t find any rings, unfortunately,” report author Bas Vriens said on Thursday.

“The levels of gold or silver were very small, in the micrograms, or even nanograms, but when you add them up it’s pretty substantial.”

Researchers are now studying if it is worthwhile to extract the metals that end up in sewage sludge before usually being burnt, but so far it has not found to be cost effective.

Higher levels of gold were found in the western Swiss region of Jura, believed to be linked to watchmakers that use the precious metal to decorate their expensive timepieces.

There was also a higher concentration in the southern canton of Ticino due to the gold refineries in the area. This was the only region where it might make sense to recover the metals, Vriens said.

Other trace elements including rare metals such as gadolinium - used in medical imaging - were also found by the scientists from the government’s institute of aquatic science and technology (EAWAG).

Their discovery is the latest example of wealthy Switzerland finding riches in unusual places.

Last month an investigation was launched after toilets at a Geneva bank and three restaurants were blocked by about $100,000 in high-denomination banknotes - a bit different from the huge fat mass that blocked an east London sewer.

The Swiss metal concentrations complied with regulations and were removed before humans drank the water again, the study said.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to block a Chinese-backed firm from buying a U.S.-based chipmaker this week is detrimental to America’s growth and the global economy, China’s state news agency Xinhua said in a commentary on Saturday.

Canyon Bridge Capital Partners’ planned $1.3 billion acquisition of Lattice Semiconductor Corp was one of the largest attempted by a Chinese-backed firm in the U.S. microchip sector and was the first announced deal for the buyout fund, which launched last year with a focus on technology investment.

U.S. regulatory scrutiny grew after Reuters reported in November that Canyon Bridge was funded partly by capital from China’s central government and had indirect links to its space program.

Trump said in an executive order on Wednesday that Lattice and Canyon Bridge “shall take all steps necessary to fully and permanently abandon the proposed transaction” within 30 days.

“The move, which is detrimental to both America’s growth and global economic recovery, also runs counter to the mutually-beneficial and win-win nature of China-U.S. relations,” the Xinhua commentary said.

Security reviews of investments in sensitive sectors “should not be used as a tool to implement protectionism”, it added, echoing comments by a Commerce Ministry spokesman last week.

Citing analysts who said Trump’s decision was made with an eye to the 2018 midterm election, Xinhua called it “penny wise and pound foolish ... It is a short-sighted move to take protectionist measures amid sluggish global growth.”

“Chinese investment is not ‘Trojan Horse’ with hidden purposes,” it said.

Trump is set to visit China in November.

“The two countries need to strengthen dialogue and communication, promote cooperation and exchanges in various fields and properly handle issues of common concerns. Only then can China and the United States push forward the world’s most important bilateral relationship,” Xinhua said.",Trump move to block chipmaker deal bad for America - Xinhua,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-usa-trade-commentary/trump-move-to-block-chipmaker-deal-bad-for-america-xinhua-idUSKCN1BR062

LONDON (Reuters) - Amazon (AMZN.O) said on Friday it would open a new distribution center in Bolton, northwest England, in 2018, stepping up its expansion drive in its third-largest market outside North America.

Amazon has 16 distribution centers in Britain and the new center will be supported by advanced robotics technology to help lift and move products around the plant. It will also employ 1,200 new, full-time permanent people, the company said.

The new jobs mean the online retailer will have created 3,500 jobs in the region, including Bolton and two other centers, one in Manchester set up in 2016 and another in Warrington, which opened this year.

It said that, including operating costs, it had invested 6.4 billion pounds ($8.3 billion) in Britain since 2010 in logistics, order filling, research and development and head office functions.

Following criticism from politicians about weak worker protection, the company has been increasingly employing its warehouse staff directly, rather than indirectly via contract firms which offer little employment security.

On Friday it set out the levels of pay, stock options, pensions and training that would be available for any new employee. Salaries start at 7.65 pounds per hour, but also include a variety of management, engineering and support roles.

Northwest England received a blow on Tuesday when major employer BAE Systems announced the cut of 750 highly skilled jobs at two aircraft manufacturing plants in Lancashire.

The Bolton center will ship easily sortable items to customers that lend themselves to current robotics technology, including books, toys and kitchenware.

The online retailer has expanded rapidly in Britain in recent years, and is looking for the new distribution plants to expand its product selection and enable more small and medium enterprises to sell their own wares through Amazon Marketplace. Half of all units stocked in British centers are from outside firms.

Separately this week, Booths, a high-end supermarket chain located in the north of England, said it would begin offering a range of its products online through AmazonFresh for home delivery to consumers in London and southeastern England.",Amazon steps up UK expansion drive with new distribution center,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-amazon-jobs/amazon-steps-up-uk-expansion-drive-with-new-distribution-centre-idUKKBN1CI0YR

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain published proposals on Wednesday for a levy on social media firms and internet providers to help fund its online safety strategy, designed to tackle bullying, abuse and other risks for children and vulnerable users.

Prime Minister Theresa May and her ministers have been critical of firms like Twitter, Facebook, and Google, repeatedly calling on them to do more to stop the spread of extremist content online and help victims of abuse.

May first promised a levy on “social media companies and communication service providers” in her 2017 election manifesto.

On Wednesday, digital minister Karen Bradley published proposals for an Internet Safety Strategy including the levy, a code of practice on removing intimidating or humiliating content from social media, and online safety classes in schools.

“The internet has been an amazing force for good, but it has caused undeniable suffering and can be an especially harmful place for children and vulnerable people,” Bradley said in a statement.

“We need an approach to the internet that protects everyone without restricting growth and innovation in the digital economy.”

The government proposal, which invites views from the industry before being formulated into legislation, said the levy would initially be sought on a voluntary basis.

“We may then seek to underpin this levy in legislation, to ensure the continued and reliable operation of the levy,” the document said. “The levy will not be a new tax on social media.”

It likened the proposed levy to an existing one paid on a voluntary basis by the gambling sector to fund charitable work.

Social media firms have typically been exempt from regulatory fees that can apply to communication services.

LONDON (Reuters) - Uber [UBER.UL] lodged a court appeal on Friday to overturn a decision by London’s transport regulator that stripped the taxi app of its operating licence in its most important European market, the first stop on what is set to be a long legal road.

Transport for London (TfL) shocked the Silicon Valley firm last month by deeming it unfit to run a taxi service and refusing to renew its licence, citing its approach to reporting serious criminal offences and background checks on drivers.

The appeal marks the beginning of months of legal wrangling in a battle that had pitched one of the world’s richest cities against a Silicon Valley giant known for forays into new markets across the globe that have stoked competition for established cab companies.

Uber, whose backers include Goldman Sachs and BlackRock, will defend its London business at a hearing most likely due on Dec. 11, a spokesman at Britain’s Judicial Office told Reuters.

Uber, criticised by London Mayor Sadiq Khan for employing an “an army of PR experts and an army of lawyers”, said that it hoped to keep talking to TfL to find a way forward.

“While we have today filed our appeal so that Londoners can continue using our app, we hope to continue having constructive discussions with Transport for London,” an Uber spokesman said.

“As our new CEO has said, we are determined to make things right.”

Only a month into the job, Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi met TfL Commissioner Mike Brown for talks earlier in October, which both sides said were constructive as the $70-billion firm tries to repair its relationship with the regulator.

Uber’s licence expired on Sep. 30 but its roughly 40,000 drivers in the British capital will be able to continue operating until the appeals process is exhausted.

Friday’s appeal was submitted to Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London as part of the first stage of a legal process which could take months or years to reach a conclusion.

The filing is a short notification of Uber’s intention to appeal rather than the detailed grounds.

DISRUPTIVE YEAR

London’s decision is one of the most serious setbacks to the taxi app, which has been forced to quit several countries, including Denmark and Hungary, and faced regulatory battles in multiple U.S. states and around the world.

It comes after a tumultuous few months for the San Francisco start-up that led to former CEO and co-founder Travis Kalanick being forced out after a series of boardroom controversies.

Earlier this month, the firm’s boss in Britain Jo Bertram said she would quit the taxi hailing app according to emails seen by Reuters.

The company is also embroiled in court action against two drivers who won a tribunal case last year entitling them to workers’ rights such as the minimum wage and holiday entitlement, threatening its business model. Uber is appealing the verdict.

TfL said on Friday it would not comment before the licensing appeal hearing due later this year.

A spokesman at the Mayor of London’s office said that Khan, a politician from the opposition Labour Party who is also chairman of TfL, continued to back the licence decision and that all private hire firms must play by the rules.

He said during a monthly question time session on Thursday that the transport authority would defend its decision during the legal action.

“The courts now will consider the appeal from Uber and of course TfL will defend the decision they made,” he said.",Uber embarks on legal battle to retain London licence,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-uber-britain/uber-embarks-on-legal-battle-to-retain-london-licence-idUKKBN1CI14Z

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Mylan N.V. is best known for producing EpiPen emergency allergy treatments and generic drugs.

But a non-pharmaceutical offering – refined coal – has quietly generated hundreds of millions of dollars of tax credits for the company over the last six years that have boosted its bottom line, according to a Reuters review of company filings.

Since 2011, Mylan has bought 99 percent stakes in five companies across the U.S. that own plants which process coal to reduce smog-causing emissions. It then sells the coal at a loss to power plants to generate the real benefit for the drug company: credits that allow Mylan to lower its own tax bill.

Infographic ID: '2sQaEQL'

These refined coal credits were approved by Congress in 2004 in order to incentivize companies to fund production of cleaner coal. They are available to any company that is willing to invest the capital, and are set to expire after 2021.

Mylan is one of only a few public companies, and the only publicly-traded pharmaceutical maker, that uses these tax credits, a Reuters review of a comprehensive database of filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission found. It is possible other companies receive an immaterial amount of the tax credits and decline to disclose them.

Future tax credits could prove valuable to Mylan, which has seen sales of its flagship EpiPen allergy treatment sag after consumer outrage over the allergy treatment’s $600 list price. The pricing issue, which has drawn scrutiny from members of Congress and the U.S. Department of Justice, and Chairman Robert Coury’s nearly $100 million pay package last year have caused a group of investors to launch an effort to vote down the company’s board at its annual meeting on Thursday.

Mylan already carries a low tax rate after moving its headquarters overseas in 2015. The coal credits helped the company lower its effective tax rate further, to just over four percent in 2014 and 7.4 percent in 2015. Last year, the company actually had a tax benefit of $358 million, giving it an effective tax rate of negative 294 percent.

Mylan confirmed Reuters’ calculations based on figures in the tax footnotes in the company’s annual reports. According to these calculations, Mylan used more than $100 million of “clean energy and research” tax credits in both 2016 and 2015, and around $95 million in 2014.

A person familiar with the matter told Reuters these coal operations have increased Mylan’s net earnings by around $40 million to $50 million in each of the past two years. That accounts for around 9 percent of the company’s earnings last year and more than 5 percent of its 2015 earnings.

Mylan has disclosed very little about the tax credit strategy or its coal refining operations. It did not announce the coal deals when they occurred or disclose how much they cost. Mylan has not discussed them on its earnings conference calls and does not disclose exactly how much in tax credits they generate or what effect they are having on its bottom line.

Wells Fargo analyst David Maris, who has a market perform rating on the company, said he believes that, from an investor standpoint, the coal transactions adds unnecessary complexity.

“The average investor looking at their financial statements or their press releases, would have no idea what this is or how it flows through to their profit and loss statement,” he said.

“BEING MINDFUL OF TAX PLANNING”

Mylan refers to losses and interest expense generated by its “clean energy investments,” as well as the fact that they qualify for tax credits, in tables and footnotes at the bottom of its earnings releases. In filings with regulators, it discloses some risks around the investments, their carrying value, and liabilities related to the investments.

“It does sound like they are being mindful of tax planning,” said Lisa De Simone, professor of accounting at Stanford Graduate School of Business. “From the perspective of shareholder value, companies have all of the incentive in the world to try to reduce their tax payments, to increase net income and increase distributions to shareholders.”

Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin said in an emailed statement that the tax credits are available to any interested company, and often “made outside of a company’s ordinary course of business, and companies involved in such projects range across a variety of non-energy related sectors.”

Other companies Reuters found that take the credits include insurance brokerage and risk management services firm Arthur J Gallagher, Waste Management Inc and industrial supply company WW Grainger. The companies vary in their level of disclosure of the investments, but some disclose the number of tax credits they receive from the facilities.

Devlin added that the health company recognizes that the production at the refined coal facilities will no longer be eligible for a tax credit beginning in 2022. “Nonetheless, on an ongoing basis, we consider appropriate opportunities for tax planning with respect to our global operations,” she added.

New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer spoke out against the tax strategy when informed about it by Reuters. Stringer, who is leading the effort to vote down Mylan’s current board, oversees New York City pensions that together own more than 1.1 million shares of Mylan stock.

“From the EpiPen pricing debacle to embracing complex tax avoidance strategies, Mylan’s board appears more focused on financial engineering than on the company’s core business,” he said.

COAL INTEREST DATES TO 2011

Mylan made the first investment in the coal producing plants in 2011, and expanded its total holdings to 5 plants by 2014.

Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch, who has led the company since 2012, has coal country roots: she is the daughter of U.S. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the second largest coal-producing state in the country. The company declined to discuss the origin of why it adopted the tax strategy.

Mylan says in its last two annual reports that its holdings are equity method investments in five limited liability corporations that own refined coal production plants, but does not name them.

Reuters was able to identify these operations by reviewing lists of the company’s subsidiaries included with its annual reports. Mylan has 99 percent stakes in 5 LLCs that own refined coal plants: Canton Fuels Company in Illinois, Chouteau Fuels Company in Oklahoma, Deogun Manufacturing Company in Utah, Marquis Industrial Company in Indiana and Powder Street LLC in West Virginia.

Mylan is booking losses from the plants, which is not unusual for these facilities. The companies often pay a middleman who manages the coal production facilities as well as other costs.

Mylan recorded pre-tax losses of $92.3 million in 2016, $93.2 million in 2015 and $78.9 million in 2014 from the operations. The loss generated by the coal plants, as well as depreciation, is tax deductible, according to tax experts.

But the tax credits generated by the facilities are extremely valuable. Last year, companies received $6.81 in tax credits for every ton of refined coal produced. Mylan produced around 16 million tons of refined coal last year, according to a person familiar with the matter.

According to the same person, expenses – including costs paid for the assets and adjusted for tax deductions – equate to around 60 percent of the gross credits earned.",Drugmaker Mylan gets boost from unlikely source: coal,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mylan-coal-insight/drugmaker-mylan-gets-boost-from-unlikely-source-coal-idUSKBN19C0DW

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Maharashtra, India’s second-biggest cotton producing state, has stepped up seizures of “unauthorised pesticides” after chemical poisoning killed at least 30 farmers in three months, a government minister told Reuters on Friday.

The western state is investigating the deaths of the cotton farmers and labourers as a dry spell led to an outbreak of crop-eating bollworm pests that thrive in such weather.

Fundkar said it was also possible some farmers and workers were not following prescribed methods while spraying pesticides, which led them to inhale or ingest fatal quantities.

Pesticide use has risen as genetically modified (GM) cotton seeds approved in early 2000s have started to lose efficacy, farmers and government officials say.

GM cotton seeds, developed by U.S. giant Monsanto (MON.N), have helped transform India into the world's top producer and second-largest exporter of the fibre. (reut.rs/2ncBknn)

“Since the pest attack was severe this year farmers were aggressively spraying pesticides. Some of the pesticides were not recommended and poisonous,” said a top Maharashtra farm official, who declined to be named as he was not authorised to speak to media.

Some of the more than 600 farmers and labourers treated for pesticide poisoning over the past few months are still in hospital, he added.

An independent fact-finding team that visited the state this week said farmers desperate to save their investments were resorting to “various misadventures”, including use of larger dosages than recommended.

“The real culprit is the poison that has been allowed to be registered, manufactured, sold and used,” it said in a statement. “The only far-reaching way by which the current problem can be tackled is by eliminating these toxins.”",Maharashtra seizes spurious pesticides as poisoning kills at least 30,https://www.reuters.com/article/india-farmers-pesticide/maharashtra-seizes-spurious-pesticides-as-poisoning-kills-at-least-30-idINKBN1CI1BM

Republicans in Congress and the White House haven’t been able to get any major legislation passed yet. But they're betting they can pull it off with a bare-bones proposal for tax reform outlined last week, which they claim will help the middle class despite the evidence that it will overwhelmingly benefit the rich.

Their plan to overhaul what they call a broken tax code leaves out many key details. But one point gets hammered home: Republicans say they want to make filing taxes easier. The first principle for President Trump’s tax plan, their outline states, is to “make the tax code simple, fair and easy to understand.” There are a dozen more references to simplification throughout the rest of the document.

The Republican promise is that they want to make filing taxes as easy as mailing a postcard. But their plan doesn’t get anywhere close to that, while overlooking a straightforward reform that would. Instead of reducing complexity, the GOP plan mostly lowers and flattens rates. For example, it reduces the number of personal income tax brackets from seven to three.

However, the effort of filing taxes has nothing to do with how many brackets there are -- figuring out which bracket you fall in is the easy part. What makes doing taxes complicated is figuring out which deductions, credits, and loopholes to claim. Republicans would close some loopholes, but they would open others -- including a lower tax rate on pass-through businesses that will entice rich people with the right accounting team to get creative in order to reap the rewards. (Tycoons with family-owned businesses, such as Donald Trump, especially stand to benefit from this change, which would allow law firms, hedge funds, and real estate brokerages to file under a much lower rate.) Such loopholes make the code more complex to navigate, not less.

Simple tax filing isn’t a hopeless goal, however. There’s something Congress could do that would radically simplify the process of filing taxes for the vast majority of U.S. taxpayers.

It’s called return-free filing. In countries such as Chile, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Japan, Norway, Sweden, and Spain, the government basically prepares tax returns for its citizens. It already has most of the information it needs: Employers have to tell tax authorities how much they pay their employees, while forms like W-2s and 1099s provide other necessary details. In Japan, for example, the country’s tax agency sends everyone a document with how much they earned, how much was withheld, and how much they owe or are owed in taxes.

If Washington adopted this policy, the government would fill out a return for every resident with the information it already keeps on file. Taxpayers who wanted to itemize their returns or dispute the numbers would be free to do so, but otherwise they could simply sign off on the government’s math. In some countries, merely taking no action constitutes an approval and therefore counts as doing your taxes.

Instead, in the United States it’s up to every taxpayer to gather their forms, enter all the numbers into a long document, ensure that everything has been calculated accurately, and send it all in. It takes a collective 2.6 billion hours to get this done. Americans pay an average $200 each for the pleasure of doing their taxes, or around 10 percent of the average federal tax refund.

Return-free filing, on the other hand, could save an estimated collective 225 million hours of tax filing work and $2 billion in costs. Up to 60 million households would no longer have to file any returns.

The concept is not entirely foreign to the United States. President Ronald Reagan called for something just like it in his 1985 Tax Reform Act, arguing that Americans should “not even have to fill out a return.” Since then, Senator Elizabeth Warren has taken up the crusade, introducing legislation two years in a row that would instruct the IRS to develop a free, online return-free filing option, allowing taxpayers to download their information straight from the government and into a form. The idea is even supported by conservative anti-tax activist Grover Norquist.

But it hasn’t moved forward; last year, Warren’s bill didn’t even make it out of committee.

That’s because some deep-pocketed companies have worked tirelessly to bury it. If most Americans no longer needed help doing their taxes, business would dry up for tax preparers such as H&R Block and TurboTax. More than half of all individual tax returns filed in 2014 were prepared by a tax professional, while about 80 percent of Americans use either software or a preparer.

These companies have said as much publicly. Intuit, the software company that makes TurboTax, has said in filings that it “opposes IRS government tax preparation” and that such legislation “may present a continued competitive threat to our business in the foreseeable future.” Liberty Tax Service stated in 2015 that “demand for our products is related to the complexity of tax return preparation.”

So they’ve spent heavily to campaign against return-free filing. H&R Block, which ProPublica says spent $3 million on lobbying last year, fought hard against Warren’s bill. Intuit spent $2 million in the same year, much of it in favor of legislation that would block the government from offering return-free filing. The firm has lobbied in favor of a number of similar past bills.

Republicans have long claimed that they want to make taxes simpler, yet their proposals never live up to such promises. It’s not impossible, though; the answer is staring us right in the face. It would just require the government to put the interests of everyday taxpayers over big-spending corporate lobbyists.

China’s government wants stakes and board seats at web giants like Tencent, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. Beijing is already influential behind the scenes in technology, and given its tightening grip elsewhere, a power grab in this vital sector was all but inevitable. This will nonetheless cost investors.

China’s bureaucrats have held discussions with Tencent, microblog-operator Weibo, and a video-streaming platform owned by e-commerce group Alibaba, according to the Journal, which cited people close to the companies. State-backed funds would buy a 1 percent stake via “special management shares” allowing them to put a government official on the board. The powerful internet watchdog has already trialled this arrangement with two startups, the newspaper said.

Xi’s government is increasing its control on everything from traditional media to private conglomerates like Dalian Wanda and Anbang. So, Beijing’s latest focus on social media and internet companies was to be expected.

To be sure, too, the government already exerts substantial sway over the sector. Tough censorship and capital controls mean bosses like Tencent’s Pony Ma need good relations with regulators. He and rivals like Jack Ma of Alibaba are also increasingly pushing into sensitive sectors like cloud computing and finance.

That said, government intervention in decision-making will have far more impact. Recently tech groups including Alibaba, Baidu, and JD.com injected $12 billion into state-owned telecom Unicom, as part of the government’s “mixed-ownership” reform. That could be the first of a series of politically motivated investments. So capital allocation could get worse.

Foreign scrutiny of Chinese takeovers is already increasing, and politicians in the United States, Europe and elsewhere are pushing for even tighter controls based on national security concerns. The $1 billion acquisition of U.S.-based MoneyGram by Ant Financial, Jack Ma’s financial-technology group, has been delayed, with the buyer having to refile an application, Reuters reported last month. Having direct state backing will make it much harder for these groups to argue they are independent actors.",Breakingviews - Beijing’s closer embrace is bad news for Big Tech,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-tech-breakingviews/breakingviews-beijings-closer-embrace-is-bad-news-for-big-tech-idUSKBN1CH0HK

LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - Britain must commit to paying what it owes to the European Union before talks can begin about a future relationship with the bloc after Brexit, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said on Friday.

“The British are discovering, as we are, day after day new problems. That’s the reason why this process will take longer than initially thought,” Juncker said in a speech to students in his native Luxembourg.

“We cannot find for the time being a real compromise as far as the remaining financial commitments of the UK are concerned. As we are not able to do this we will not be able to say in the European Council in October that now we can move to the second phase of negotiations,” Juncker said.

“They have to pay, they have to pay, not in an impossible way. I‘m not in a revenge mood. I‘m not hating the British.”

The EU has told Britain that a summit next week will conclude that insufficient progress has been made in talks for Brussels to open negotiations on a future trade deal. London has been hoping and pressing for this to happen at the summit.","'They have to pay', EU's Juncker says of Britain",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-juncker/they-have-to-pay-eus-juncker-says-of-britain-idUSKBN1CI12L

(Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s plan to make it easier for small businesses to band together and buy stripped-down health insurance plans could violate a federal law governing employee benefit plans and will almost certainly be challenged in court, legal experts said.

Trump signed an executive order on Thursday aimed at letting small businesses join nationwide associations for the purpose of buying large-group health plans that are not subject to coverage requirements of the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare.

Industry experts said Trump’s order could ultimately enable such associations to purchase insurance from states with the fewest regulations. That would undermine Obamacare, former Democratic President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law, which Republicans have failed to repeal.

Several healthcare and employment law experts said if Trump’s plan moves forward, states could argue the federal government had overstepped its authority in violation of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), a law that governs large-group plans.

In Thursday’s order, Trump asked the Department of Labor to propose rules that would allow more employers to participate in association health plans. Legal experts said lawsuits might not be brought until such regulations are issued.

Dania Palanker, an assistant research professor at Georgetown University’s Center on Health Insurance Reforms, said ERISA granted states the right to regulate association health plans.

Attorneys general could argue the federal government had overreached if the Trump administration winds up allowing associations to buy health coverage across borders that only complies with a single state’s regulations.

”Any attempt to allow the sale of association plans to small groups across state lines will be open to legal scrutiny as to whether it is violating ERISA and undermining state authority,” said Palanker.

‘PREPARED TO FIGHT’

A White House official said that “departments will be drafting rules in a way that minimizes litigation risk.”

The Department of Labor “will be reviewing ERISA in the course of following the President’s direction” in the order, the official said.

A number of state attorneys general from Democratic-leaning states said on Thursday they would fight any efforts to weaken Obamacare, which extended health insurance to 20 million Americans, but which Republicans call intrusive and ineffective.

“It should come as no surprise that California is prepared to fight in court to protect affordable healthcare for its people,” said Xavier Becerra, the state’s Democratic attorney general.

Legal experts said states may argue the associations formed for the purpose of buying insurance are not employers under ERISA.

Although ERISA allows associations to qualify as employers and manage large-group plans, federal regulators have generally required that members of such associations have a high degree of common interest beyond buying insurance, said Allison Hoffman, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Law.

Trump’s order asks the secretary of labor, who enforces ERISA, to consider expanding the common-interest requirements to permit broader participation in association health plans.

SHORT-TERM PLANS

The idea of expanding association health plans across state lines has long been championed by Republican U.S. Senator Rand Paul, who made it a key plank of his own proposal to repeal and replace Obamacare. The Kentucky Republican was at Trump’s side when the president signed the executive order.

Paul’s proposal said ERISA was too restrictive in its definition of associations and that the law needed to be amended.

Thursday’s order also asked the Labor, Treasury and Health and Human Services Departments to look into expanding participation in cheaper, bare-bones, short-term limited-duration insurance plans, which are not subject to the ACA.

Timothy Jost, a professor at the Washington and Lee University School of Law, said such a move would face fewer legal hurdles than the expansion of association health plans.

The current three-month limitation on the use of such plans was a rule adopted by the Obama administration last year, so the Trump administration could roll it back through the normal rulemaking process.

Such plans are typically marketed to individuals who are between jobs or have a gap in coverage. They are much cheaper than ACA plans, but cover less and can exclude those with pre-existing conditions.",Trump healthcare order could run afoul of retirement plan law,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-healthcare-lawsuits-analysis/trump-healthcare-order-could-face-strong-legal-objections-idUSKBN1CH0DR

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The head of Deutsche Boerse (DB1Gn.DE) met with the German government to discuss a possible merger with London Stock Exchange (LSE.L) before he made a share purchase that sparked an insider trading investigation, according to a magazine report.

CEO Carsten Kengeter purchased 4.5 million euros in Deutsche Boerse shares in mid-December of 2015, two months before the announcement of merger talks that resulted in a sharp rise in the share price. Kengeter has denied insider trading and said the purchase was part of an executive compensation program.

Linklaters, Deutsche Boerse’s external counsel, found CEO Carsten Kengeter met with German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble on Sept. 1 and Nov. 3, 2015, the German weekly WirtschaftsWoche reported on Friday.

On Oct. 30 of that year, the exchange operator sent Schaeuble and his staff a six-page confidential note “on the preparation for a coordination with the German finance ministry on a possible merger with the LSE,” the magazine said, citing the Linklaters review.

A spokesman for Deutsche Boerse declined to comment on the WirtschaftsWoche report but quoted the summary of the Linklater review: “In our opinion, insider information was not available on the date of the acquisition of the share purchase by Mr. Kengeter on Dec. 14, 2015, up until Jan. 19, 2016.”

A spokesman for the German Finance Ministry declined to comment. Linklaters didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Deutsche Boerse last month agreed to pay 10.5 million euros of fines to try to draw a line under allegations of insider trading, but the settlement is still pending approval in a Frankfurt court. As part of the agreement, Kengeter would pay an additional 500,000 euros personally.

Despite the fines, Deutsche Boerse and Kengeter have maintained their long-held position that the allegations of insider trading were unfounded.

Puigdemont made a symbolic declaration of independence on Tuesday night, only to suspend it seconds later and call for negotiations with Madrid.

Spain’s Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has given him until Monday to clarify his position - and then until Thursday to change his mind if he insists on a split - threatening to suspend Catalonia’s autonomy if he chooses independence.

But far-left Catalan political group CUP called on Puigdemont to make an unequivocal declaration of independence in defiance of the deadlines.

“If (the central Madrid government) wants to continue to threaten and gag us, they should do it to the Republic that has already been claimed,” the party said.

The CUP only holds 10 seats in the 135-seat Catalan parliament. But Puigdemont’s minority government relies on its support to push through legislation and cannot win a majority vote in the regional parliament without its backing.

The wealthy region’s intention to break away after a referendum has plunged Spain into its worst political crisis since an attempted military coup in 1981 and could hurt economic growth targets for next year, the deputy prime minister said.

ECONOMIC RISK

“If there were no quick solution to this issue we should be forced to lower expectations of economic growth for the year 2018,” Soraya Sainz de Santamaria said on Friday.

Sources close to the Catalan government said Puigdemont and his team were working on an answer to Rajoy though they declined to say what line he would take.

The CUP statement echoes the position expressed late on Thursday by influential pro-independence civic group Asamblea Nacional Catalana which said: “Given the negative position of Spain toward dialogue, we ask the regional parliament to raise the suspension (on the declaration of independence).”

But the leader of Puigdemont’s party, Artur Mas, who served as the region’s president until 2016 and is still believed to influence key decisions, said on Friday declaring independence was not the only way forward.

“If a state proclaims itself independent and cannot act as such, it’s an independence that is merely aesthetic,” he told Catalan television TV3.

“The external factor must be taken into account in the decisions that will be made from now on,” he said.

The European Union, the United States and most other world powers have made it clear they wanted Catalonia to remain within Spain.

“If we allow Catalonia - and it is none of our business - to separate, others will do the same. I do not want that,” Jean Claude Juncker said in a speech at Luxembourg University.","Allies press Catalan leader to declare full independence, ignore Madrid deadlines",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-politics-catalonia/allies-press-catalan-leader-to-declare-full-independence-ignore-madrid-deadlines-idUSKBN1CI19X

Milhares foram às ruas na noite de quinta para comemorar o pacto firmado entre Fatah e Hamas no Cairo. Alto-falantes tocaram canções nacionalistas enquanto jovens dançavam e se abraçavam acenando com bandeiras palestinas e egípcias.

“Estou feliz, não, sou o mais feliz”, disse Ali Metwaly, engenheiro de computação de 30 anos, na manhã seguinte. “Mas ainda estou com medo de que acabe em uma decepção. Meus líderes me ensinaram que podem nos decepcionar com muita facilidade. Espero que não o façam desta vez”.

Conforme o acordo de reconciliação, o Hamas entregará o controle administrativo de Gaza, incluindo a passagem de fronteira de Rafah --que no passado foi a principal via de acesso dos dois milhões de palestinos do território ao mundo-- a um governo apoiado pelo partido majoritário Fatah.

Uma década atrás, forças do Hamas tomaram a Faixa de Gaza de forças do Fatah em uma guerra civil breve. Tentativas de mediação anteriores do Egito para reconciliar os dois rivais não proporcionaram resultados duradouros. A mais recente obteve o acordo ainda incerto depois de uma pressão econômica sobre o Hamas.

Analistas disseram que o pacto tem mais chance de vingar do que anteriores, dado o isolamento crescente do Hamas e o reconhecimento de quão difícil é administrar e reconstruir Gaza, cuja economia foi afetada por bloqueios na fronteira e que teve sua infraestrutura arrasada pelas guerras com Israel.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - The Indian government raised 113.7 billion rupees ($1.75 billion) on Friday by selling some of its shares in General Insurance Corp of India (GIC Re), the nation’s top reinsurer, in the country’s biggest listing in seven years.

The funds could be critical at a time when the government is looking to boost spending to help counter the slowest economic growth in more than three years, but has been constrained in part by lower-than-expected tax collections.

The government is aiming to raise 725 billion rupees by selling off some of its stakes in state-run companies in the year to March, including through the initial public offering (IPO) of GIC Re, which was set to close later on Friday having already attracted 1.35 times the number of shares on offer.

GIC Re’s IPO brings the total money raised through IPOs this year to more than $6 billion, not far from the record $8.65 billion in 2007, amid a market rally that has sent indexes to record highs. The NSE index closed up 0.7 percent after hitting its latest all-time high earlier in the session. [.BO]

GIC Re, which had a 60 percent share in India’s reinsurance market according to Crisil Research, is expected to benefit from growing premiums in India, which has relatively lower insurance penetration. The company is also expanding internationally.

“We are not expecting any fancy listing gains on GIC Re just like in other recent insurance company IPOs, but the company is a good long-term buy,” said Krishna Rana, an analyst with brokerage Sushil Finance.

“Insurance is a relatively new sector and the knowledge about this sector is still quite low, so retail interest in these IPOs also has been lower,” she added.

The government, which currently fully owns the reinsurer, was selling 107.5 million shares in the IPO, while the company was selling 17.2 million new shares.

The total offer of 124.7 million shares constitutes 14.2 percent of the post-offer paid up share capital.

Crisil estimates reinsurance premiums in India will grow at an average annual rate of 11-14 percent over five years to reach 700 billion rupees by March 2022.

Most analysts had recommended subscribing to the IPO, citing its reasonable valuations, although recent lacklustre listings by two big insurance companies had dampened sentiment.

GIC Re is set to debut in markets on Oct. 25.

Citi, Axis Capital, Deutsche Bank, HSBC and Kotak were the banks managing the GIC Re IPO, which was the biggest since Coal India’s 2010 share sale that raised 155 billion rupees.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices recorded their biggest increase in eight months in September as gasoline prices soared in the wake of hurricane-related production disruptions at oil refineries in the Gulf Coast area, but underlying inflation remained muted.

The mixed report from the Labor Department on Friday comes as Federal Reserve officials have been engaged in a vigorous debate on the inflation path and suggests a December interest rate increase is not a done deal.

As a result, the dollar fell against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S Treasuries rose. Stocks on Wall Street rose to record highs. Policymakers could, however, find solace from another report indicating that the economy was swiftly recovering from the damage inflicted by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, with a strong rebound in retail sales last month.

“The firmness in retail sales should override the enduring mystery of low inflation to spur a December Fed rate hike,” said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.

The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index increased 0.5 percent last month after advancing 0.4 percent in August. September’s rise was the biggest since January and pushed up the year-on-year gain in the CPI to 2.2 percent from 1.9 percent in August. The increase in the CPI was broadly in line with economists’ expectations.

Gasoline prices surged 13.1 percent last month, accounting for 75 percent of the rise in the CPI. The increase in gasoline prices was the largest since June 2009 and followed a 6.3 percent advance in August.

The Labor Department said Harvey was reported to have impacted refinery capacity in the Gulf Coast and was likely a factor in last month’s increase in gasoline prices.

Outside gasoline, price pressures were benign. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, consumer prices gained 0.1 percent in September as the increase in rental accommodation slowed and the cost of new motor vehicles and medical care declined.

The so-called core CPI rose 0.2 percent in August. In the 12 months through September, the core CPI increased 1.7 percent. The year-on-year core CPI has now increased by the same margin for five consecutive months.

INTENSE INFLATION DEBATE

The Fed tracks the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy. The core PCE has consistently undershot the U.S. central bank’s 2 percent target for more than five years. Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said that temporary factors such as one-off price cuts by wireless telephone companies are holding back inflation.

Minutes of the Fed’s Sept. 19-20 meeting published on Wednesday showed ”many participants expressed concern that

the low inflation readings this year might reflect not only

transitory factors, but also the influence of developments

that could prove more persistent.”

Last month, food prices rose 0.1 percent after a similar gain in August. Owners’ equivalent rent of primary residence rose 0.2 percent after advancing 0.3 percent in August. Prices for new motor vehicles fell 0.4 percent as manufacturers resort to deep discounting to eliminate an inventory overhang.

There were also decreases in the cost of medical care, apparel, and household furnishings. But the cost of mobile phone services rose 0.4 percent after 14 straight months of declines.

In a separate report on Friday, the Commerce Department said retail sales jumped 1.6 percent in September likely as reconstruction and clean-up efforts in areas devastated by Harvey and Irma boosted demand for building materials and motor vehicles.

Retail sales were also buoyed by a surge in receipts at service stations, which reflected higher gasoline prices. Last month’s increase in retail sales was the largest since March 2015. Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales increased 0.4 percent last month after being unchanged in August. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product.

The rebound in core retail sales suggests the drag on the economy from the hurricanes will probably be modest. Economists estimate the storms could subtract at least six-tenths of a percentage point from third-quarter GDP growth.

The economy grew at a 3.1 percent annualized rate in the April-June period.

“The sudden increase in retail demand is likely to cause third-quarter growth to come in somewhat better than expected before the hurricanes hit,” said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.

“But what Mother Nature may have given in the third quarter, she will likely take away in the fourth.”","Gasoline buoys U.S. consumer prices, underlying inflation tame",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-inflation/gasoline-buoys-u-s-consumer-prices-underlying-inflation-tame-idUKKBN1CI1NZ

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistani troops shot out the tires of a vehicle carrying a kidnapped U.S.-Canadian couple and their children in a raid that led to the family’s release after five years of being held hostage, a Pakistani security official said on Friday.

U.S. drones were hovering near the northwestern Pakistani area where American Caitlan Campbell, her Canadian husband Joshua Boyle and their three children, all born in captivity, were freed, another security official said.

Campbell and Boyle were held by the Taliban-linked Haqqani network after being kidnapped while backpacking in Afghanistan, and their rescue marked a rare positive note in often-fraught U.S.-Pakistan relations.

The family flew out of Pakistan on Friday, according to a Pakistani airport official who saw them. It was not clear whether they were bound for Canada or the United States.

A senior Pakistani security source on Friday detailed how the family were freed following a car chase in the northwestern tribal region bordering Afghanistan.

He said Pakistani troops and intelligence agents, acting on a U.S. intelligence tip, zeroed in on a vehicle holding the family as they were being moved into Kurram tribal agency near the town of Kohat, some 60 km (37 miles) inside Pakistan.

Agents from Pakistan’s Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) spy agency and soldiers attempted to intercept the vehicle, but it sped away, according to the security source.

“Our troops fired at the vehicle and burst its tires,” he said, declining to be identified because he is not authorized to speak openly to the media.

The kidnappers managed to escape, the security official added, saying the troops wouldn’t fire at the fleeing captors for fear of harming the hostages. The army recovered the hostages safely from the car.

Army spokesman Major General Asif Ghafoor told NBC News that the vehicle’s driver and another militant had escaped to a nearby refugee camp.

DRONES REPORTED NEARBY

The family’s rescue has been hailed by U.S. President Donald Trump as a “positive moment” for U.S.-Pakistan relations, which have frayed in recent years amid Washington’s assertions that Islamabad has not been doing enough to tackle Haqqani militants who are believed to be on Pakistani soil.

Trump, in a statement, said the release of the hostages showed Pakistan was acquiescing to “America’s wishes for it to do more to provide security in the region”.

A second Pakistani security official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said U.S. drones on Wednesday had been seen circling Kohat, suggesting U.S. co-operation included sophisticated surveillance inside Pakistan.

Kohat is deep inside Pakistani territory, next to the eastern edge of Kurram agency in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province - outside the Afghan frontier zone where U.S. drones have in the past been tolerated by Pakistan.

The U.S. embassy and the Pakistani military did not comment on the drone report.

However, a Taliban commander in Pakistan with knowledge of the hostage family said U.S. drones flying in the area prompted their captors to move them.

“We took care of this family like our own family members and special guests, but after frequent flying of U.S. drones on Kurram tribal region and its adjoining areas, it was decided to move them to a safer place,” said the Taliban official on condition of anonymity.

“They were being shifted to a safer place when captured by the Pakistani forces.”

HOSTAGES’ LOCATION

Pakistani officials bristle at U.S. claims Islamabad is not doing enough to tackle Islamist militants, particularly the Haqqanis. After the release of the family, they emphasized the importance of co-operation and intelligence sharing by Washington, which has threatened to cut military aid and other punitive measures against Pakistan.

Pakistan’s military indicated the family were rescued shortly after entering Pakistan from Afghanistan, and a government official repeated that assertion on Friday.

“We have been taking on the terrorists... So we have taken action based on the intelligence that was provided by the U.S. side,” said Foreign Ministry spokesman Nafees Zakaria.

He added that he had no other details on the operation “maybe because they were abducted in Afghanistan, they were there in Afghanistan, and that could be the reason why you have not heard much about it”.

However, two Taliban sources with knowledge of the family’s captivity said they had been kept in Pakistan in recent years.

A U.S. government source in Washington also said there was no indication the family had been in Afghanistan.

The Haqqani network operates on both sides of the porous Afghan-Pakistani border but senior militants have acknowledged they moved a major base of operations to Kurram agency in the tribal areas.

The United States and Afghanistan say that safe havens inside Pakistan allow the Taliban, including the Haqqani network, to plan and launch attacks against the Western-backed Afghan government and U.S. and other foreign troops that support them.

The Taliban have been fighting for 16 years to re-establish their ultra-Islamist regime that was toppled in a U.S.-backed military operation over sheltering the al Qaeda terrorist network that planned the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on U.S. cities.",Pakistan official details car chase that freed kidnapped U.S.-Canadian family,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pakistan-afghanistan-kidnapping-chase/pakistan-official-details-car-chase-that-freed-kidnapped-u-s-canadian-family-idUSKBN1CI1D2

YANGON (Reuters) - Rohingya Muslims are not native to Myanmar, the army chief told the U.S. ambassador in a meeting in which he apparently did not address accusations of abuses by his men and said media was complicit in exaggerating the number of refugees fleeing.

The U.N. human rights office said on Wednesday Myanmar forces had brutally driven out half a million Rohingya from northern Rakhine state to Bangladesh in recent weeks, torching homes, crops and villages to prevent them from returning.

Thousands of Rohingya were leaving the state on Thursday, aiming to reach Bangladesh by boat, citing a shortage of food and fear of repression, residents said. A Myanmar official said people were leaving but he dismissed the suggestion hunger and intimidation were factors.

The army chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, gave his most extensive account of the Rohingya refugee crisis aimed at an international audience in the meeting with Ambassador Scot Marciel, according to a report posted on his Facebook page.

The general is the most powerful person in Buddhist-majority Myanmar and his apparently uncompromising stance would indicate little sensitivity about the military’s image over a crisis that has drawn international condemnation and raised questions about a transition to democracy under Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.

The military campaign is popular in Myanmar, where there is little sympathy for the mostly stateless Rohingya, and where Buddhist nationalism has surged.

Min Aung Hlaing, referring to Rohingya by the term “Bengali”, which they regard as derogatory, said British colonialists were responsible for the problem.

“The Bengalis were not taken into the country by Myanmar, but by the colonialists,” he told Marciel, according to the account of the meeting posted on Thursday.

“They are not the natives.”

Coordinated Rohingya insurgent attacks on some 30 security posts on Aug. 25 sparked a ferocious military response.

The U.N. rights office said in its report, based on 65 interviews with Rohingya who had arrived in Bangladesh, that abuses had begun before the Aug. 25 attacks and included killings, torture and rape of children.

U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley last month denounced a “brutal, sustained campaign to cleanse the country of an ethnic minority” and called on countries to suspend providing weapons to Myanmar until its military put sufficient accountability measures in place.

The European Union and the United States are considering targeted sanctions against Myanmar’s military leaders, officials familiar with the discussions said this week.

Suu Kyi was swept into office last year after winning an election, but the military holds immense power, including exclusive say over security.

‘FEEL INSECURE’

U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra‘ad al-Hussein has described the government operations as “a textbook example of ethnic cleansing” and said the action appeared to be “a cynical ploy to forcibly transfer large numbers of people without possibility of return”.

Min Aung Hlaing did not refer to such accusations, according to the published account, but said the insurgents had killed 90 Hindus and 30 Rohingya linked to the government.

Insurgent opposition to a citizenship verification campaign, which used the term Bengali, was behind the Aug. 25 attacks that sparked the violence, he said.

“Local Bengalis were involved in the attacks under the leadership of ARSA. That is why they might have fled as they feel insecure,” he said, referring to the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army insurgents.

“The native place of Bengalis is really Bengal,” he said.

He said it was an exaggeration to say a “very large” number were fleeing to Bangladesh and there had been “instigation and propaganda by using the media from behind the scene”.

He did not elaborate but said the “real situation” had to be relayed to the international community. U.N. political affairs chief Jeffrey Feltman is due to visit on Friday.

Rohingya residents of Rakhine said up to 10,000 people had left on Wednesday and Thursday.

One resident, a teacher, said there had been no military offensive recently but people were going.

“There’s no work, nowhere to get food and the government isn’t helping,” said the teacher, who, like the first resident, declined to be identified.

Rakhine state’s secretary, Tin Maung Swe, said people were leaving “every day” to join relatives already in Bangladesh.

”Nobody is starving in death in Myanmar. The government is trying to support those in need,“ he said. ”They can fish or catch shrimps in the creeks near their villages.

“No one’s killing them or intimidating them.”

Suu Kyi, in a televised address, spoke about the importance of humanitarian assistance for all people in Rakhine and said the government would accept refugees back.

She said aid groups, international organizations and Myanmar expatriates would help with the long-term development of the state. She did not refer to accusations of rights abuses by the army.","Myanmar army chief says Rohingya Muslims 'not natives,' numbers fleeing exaggerated",https://www.reuters.com/article/myanmar-rohingya/myanmar-army-chief-says-rohingya-muslims-not-natives-numbers-fleeing-exaggerated-idINKBN1CH0I3

(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) reported an 19 percent profit decline on Friday and weaker revenue than Wall Street had expected for the fourth consecutive quarter due to mortgage issues, sending its shares down 3.5 percent.

The third-largest U.S. lender, which has been embroiled in a prolonged scandal over its sales practices, said the dip in earnings came largely from a $1 billion accrual for a legal settlement over issues stemming from before the 2007-2009 financial crisis.

But revenue at the bank also suffered from a decline in mortgage banking revenue. Wells has been trying to bounce back from a scandal over dishonest sales practices that led to interrogations by U.S. Congress and fueled the ire of millions of consumers.

Wells Fargo’s earnings dropped to $4.6 billion during the third quarter. On an adjusted basis, its profit was $1.04 per share, scraping past estimates of $1.03, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Revenue fell 2 percent to $21.9 billion, hit by a 37 percent slump in mortgage banking. Analysts had forecast revenue of $22.4 billion.

Its shares fell 3.6 percent to $53.30 in early trading.

Wells Fargo’s operating efficiency ratio, which measures expenses as a portion of revenue, was 65.5 percent during the quarter and 63.1 percent year to date.

Expenses have been a key issue for investors, and the bank has targeted a full-year ratio of 60 percent to 61 percent in 2017, aiming to improve to 55 percent to 59 percent next year.

Wells is committed to its plan to cut costs by $4 billion by the end of 2019, half of which will be reinvested into businesses, Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said in a statement.

Net income in Wells Fargo’s community banking segment, the largest of its three major businesses and the one most directly impacted by the sales scandal, was $2.2 billion, down 31 percent from a year ago due to the legal charge.

(Reuters) - U.S. Senator Susan Collins of Maine, a moderate Republican who helped block her party’s efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act this year, said she planned to remain in her current office rather than run for governor.

The four-term incumbent attracted national attention this summer as one of three Republican senators who voted in July against a bill to repeal the law often called Obamacare, a move that angered U.S. President Donald Trump. She said on Friday that remaining in the Senate would allow her to use her powerful voice in reforming the U.S healthcare system.

Collins, who like all Republicans in the Senate in 2009 voted against the sweeping healthcare legislation, said she believed urgent action was needed to improve it but criticized the way repeal efforts had been handled over the summer.

“When we’re dealing with an issue that affects millions of Americans, we need to understand the consequences of what we are doing, not vote on bills in the middle of the night that have had no substantive hearings,” Collins, 64, told a group of business leaders in Rockland, a city on the state’s midcoast.

“We must stop allowing partisanship to be the preexisting condition that prevents meaningful healthcare reform.”

Urgent action is needed to stabilize the insurance markets, including creating high-risk pools, she said. She wants to require employers to offer healthcare coverage only to people who work 40 hours a week or more, raising the threshold from 30 hours.

For weeks, Collins had flirted publicly with the idea of launching a bid to succeed Governor Paul LePage, a fiery conservative who was first elected in 2010 on a wave of support from the populist Tea Party movement. State laws forbid LePage from seeking a third term.

Collins and LePage mark out the two poles of the state’s Republican Party, with the senator working with Democrats in Washington while the governor has regularly fought with his rivals in the state capital Augusta. He has publicly criticized Collins.

Collins’ independence makes her an increasingly powerful player in Washington, one veteran Maine political observer said.

“She is at the very center of virtually every big policy debate and big vote in the U.S. Senate,” said Mark Brewer, professor of political science at the University of Maine. “She remains an incredibly important player on any issue she wants to focus on: tax reform, you name it.”","Republican Collins will stay in U.S. Senate, focused on healthcare",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-politics-collins/republican-collins-will-stay-in-u-s-senate-focused-on-healthcare-idUSKBN1CI1DK?il=0

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks advanced for a fourth straight day on Friday on expectations of broad-based global growth, while the dollar was on course for its worst week in five as investors awaited U.S. inflation data.

MSCI’s world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up 0.1 percent after hitting record highs on Thursday.

Earlier in Asia, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan hit a 10-year high.

European shares rose to their highest level in nearly four months, helped by some well-received earnings updates. The pan-European STOXX600 rose 0.3 percent and was set for its fifth straight week of gains as were world stocks.

Germany’s DAX index was up 0.1 percent, just below an all-time high hit in the previous session, while Britain’s FTSE eased back 0.1 percent after a record close on Thursday.

Wall Street futures indicated a positive open for the S&P 500 index.

“We’re seeing positive economic news even in the midst of so called geopolitical risk, I think investors are generally more optimistic right now,” said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA, referring to strong corporate earnings.

“Earnings in the second quarter were very positive, and looking beyond the impact of hurricanes, it seems like there’s improved fundamentals in the U.S. and Europe.”

Emerging market stocks were buoyant too as another 0.2 percent rise set their latest 6-year peak.

In currencies, the dollar stayed on the defensive after minutes from the last U.S. Federal Reserve meeting showed policymakers remained divided on U.S. inflation prospects.

The index which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies was flat ahead of consumer price inflation data, due at 1230 GMT.

“Abating political risks in the U.S. and growing Fed rate hike bets have pushed the dollar higher in recent weeks,” Credit Agricole strategists said in a note.

“With a December rate hike almost fully priced in by now, however, investors are starting to focus on the Fed’s still cautious forward guidance and hence the limited scope for a further increase of the dollar’s rate advantage.”

NEW FED CHIEF

On top of the near-term inflation readings, investors are looking at whom U.S. President Donald Trump will nominate as successor to Fed Chair Janet Yellen, whose term expires next February.

White House Chief of Staff John Kelly said on Thursday that Trump was “some time away” from making a decision, while another official said Trump had met with Stanford University economist John Taylor -- of economics text book Taylor-rule fame -- to discuss the job.

Meanwhile, the euro was flat but still set for its biggest weekly rise in a month. [FRX/]

European Central Bank policymakers broadly agreed to extend asset purchases at a lower volume at their October policy meeting with views converging on a nine-month extension, sources at the central bank told Reuters.

The most eye-catching move, however, was from digital currency Bitcoin as it soared by as much as 7.4 percent after Thursday’s 13 percent gain, to hit a record high of $5,846. It is up more than 450 percent this year.

The chief financial officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co said the firm was open-minded about the future potential use of digital currencies, appearing to dial back comments last month from his boss, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, who said bitcoin was a “fraud”.

Among commodities, copper prices held firm after hitting a one-month high on Thursday as optimism over the demand outlook from major consumer China fuelled buying.

London copper futures were at $6,898.50 a tonne, up 0.2 percent on the day.

Oil prices also climbed after data showed both U.S. crude production and inventories had declined. Crude was set for its sixth weekly rise in the last seven weeks. U.S. crude jumped 2 percent to $51.59 a barrel. Brent crude rose 2.2 percent to $57.50 a barrel.

Coordinated Rohingya insurgent attacks on 30 security posts on Aug. 25 sparked a ferocious military response in the Muslim-majority northern part of Rakhine state that the United Nations has said was ethnic cleansing.

A committee led by military Lieutenant-General Aye Win has begun an investigation into the behavior of military personnel, the office of the commander in chief said on Friday, insisting the operation was justified under Buddhist-majority Myanmar’s constitution.

According to a statement posted on Senior General Min Aung Hlaing’s Facebook page, the panel will ask, “Did they follow the military code of conduct? Did they exactly follow the command during the operation? After that (the committee) will release full information.”

Myanmar is refusing entry to a U.N. panel that was tasked with investigating allegations of abuses after a smaller military counteroffensive launched in October 2016.

But domestic investigations - including a previous internal military probe - have largely dismissed refugees’ claims of abuses committed during security forces’ so-called “clearance operations”.

Thousands of refugees have continued to arrived cross the Naf river separating Myanmar’s Rakhine state and Bangladesh in recent days, even though Myanmar insists military operations ceased on Sept. 5.

Aid agencies now estimate that 536,000 people have now arrived in Cox’s Bazar district, straining scarce resources of aid groups and local communities.

The Trump administration on Friday disclosed the date of the subsidies cutoff after announcing late on Thursday the most dramatic action the president has taken to undercut Democratic former President Barack Obama’s signature 2010 healthcare law.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the administration will not make the next payment to insurers scheduled for next Wednesday. The payments cost $7 billion this year and were estimated to be $10 billion in 2018, according to congressional analysts.

Trump has made the payments, guaranteed to insurers under Obamacare to help lower out-of-pocket medical expenses for low-income consumers, each month since taking office in January. But he has repeatedly threatened to cut them off and disparaged them as a “bailout” for insurance companies.

The move drew swift condemnation from congressional Democrats, who accused Trump of sabotaging the law, and threats from Democratic state attorneys general in New York and California to take legal action.

Trump, a Republican who promise as a candidate last year to dismantle the law formally called the Affordable Care Act, urged opponents to reach out to him to make a deal.

“The Democrats ObamaCare is imploding. Massive subsidy payments to their pet insurance companies has stopped. Dems should call me to fix!” Trump said in a post on Twitter early on Friday, calling the law “a broken mess.”

Shares of hospitals and health insurers fell in premarket trading on Friday after Trump’s decision. Shares of Anthem Inc, Molina Healthcare Inc, Cigna Corp and Centene Corp, which are all offering plans on Obamacare markets for 2018, were all lower.

Trump has been frustrated by the failure of his fellow Republicans who control Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare despite seven years of promises to get rid of the law that has brought health insurance to 20 million people.

His decision is likely to please those in his hard-line conservative political base who detest the Affordable Care Act, which many Republicans have attacked as an unneeded government intrusion in Americans’ healthcare.

In a nod to that same constituency, the president signed an executive order on Thursday intended to make it easier for Americans to buy bare-bones health insurance plans exempt from Obamacare requirements.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi derided the subsidies cut-off in a joint statement, saying Trump would single-handedly push Americans’ healthcare premiums higher.

‘SPITEFUL ACT’

“It is a spiteful act of vast, pointless sabotage leveled at working families and the middle class in every corner of America,” they said. “Make no mistake about it, Trump will try to blame the Affordable Care Act, but this will fall on his back and he will pay the price for it.”

Insurers and proponents of Obamacare have implored Trump for months to commit to making the payments. Several insurers have cited uncertainty over the payments when hiking premiums for 2018 or exiting insurance markets altogether.

About 10 million people are enrolled in the plans via the law’s marketplace. Many of them receive subsidies, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.

The White House said late on Thursday that it could not lawfully pay the subsidies anymore. A White House statement said that based on guidance from the Justice Department, “the Department of Health and Human Services has concluded that there is no appropriation for cost-sharing reduction payments to insurance companies under Obamacare.”

“In light of this analysis, the Government cannot lawfully make the cost-sharing reduction payments,” it said.

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said he was prepared to lead other attorneys general in a lawsuit.

The payments were the subject of a lawsuit brought by House Republicans against the Obama administration that alleged they were unlawful because they needed to be appropriated by Congress. A judge ruled in favor of the Republicans, and the Obama administration appealed the ruling.

The Trump administration took over the lawsuit and had delayed deciding whether to continue the Obama administration’s appeal or terminate the subsidies, but in April Trump began threatening to stop the payments.

That case became more complicated in August when a U.S. appeals court allowed 16 Democratic state attorneys general to defend the payments and have a say in the legal fight.

In a court filing released on Friday, Sessions argued that while the law provided funds for tax credits it did allow cost-sharing payments for insurers. It was in that court filing that he announced next week’s cutoff date.

Meanwhile, the political turbulence has affected insurers’ decisions. Anthem, one of the largest remaining Obamacare insurers, in August scaled back its offerings in Nevada and Georgia and blamed the moves in part on uncertainty over the payments.

Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina earlier this year raised premiums by more than 20 percent, but said it would have raised premiums by only about 9 percent if Trump agreed to fund the payments.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that cutting off the payments would cause premiums to rise 20 percent in 2018, and that 5 percent of Americans would live in areas that do not have an insurer in the individual market in 2018.

Trump has taken other steps to undermine Obamacare. Last week, his administration allowed businesses and non-profit organizations to seek religious and moral exemptions from Obamacare’s mandate that employers provide coverage for women’s birth control.

The administration also slashed the Obamacare advertising and outreach budget and halved the open enrollment period.","Trump scraps key Obamacare subsidies, urges Democrats to fix 'broken mess'",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-healthcare/trump-nails-obamacare-with-decision-to-cut-off-billions-in-subsidies-idUSKBN1CI0E4

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China’s Great Wall Motor Co Ltd (601633.SS) (2333.HK) on Friday said it was in talks with BMW (BMWG.DE) to cooperate on vehicles including those the German firm produces under the Mini brand, and that the pair have not yet agreed on any new ventures.

Great Wall made the comments in a stock exchange filing.

Reuters earlier this week reported the two automakers were looking to establish a joint venture in China.

Great Wall said trading in its Hong Kong and mainland-listed shares would resume on Monday. The company suspended trading in the shares on Oct. 12 and Sept. 29 respectively.

BMW, in a separate statement, said it aimed to expand business in China and could imagine partnership and cooperation for the Mini brand.

BERLIN (Reuters) - It is up to Britain to move Brexit talks forward, Germany said on Friday, warning that “time is running out” for London to negotiate the deal it wants.

A day after the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said the talks were deadlocked over money and could not progress to discussions about future trade ties, German government spokesman Steffen Seibert urged Britain to act before an EU summit in December.

EU leaders will discuss Brexit at that meeting, Seibert said. “This means Great Britain still has it in its own hands whether there will be enough progress so that the second phase of negotiations can be started.”

British Prime Minister Theresa May told parliament on Monday it was up to the European Union to move talks to the next phase, saying: “the ball is in their court”.

But her spokesman said on Friday that May would have “more to say” on the financial settlement at an EU summit next week.

Going into the high-profile encounter, Juergen Klopp’s side sit seventh in the table following three wins from seven league games, while United trail leaders Manchester City on goal difference after recording six wins and a draw.

A leaky defence and a failure to convert their goal-scoring opportunities have hindered the Merseyside club but Can believes Liverpool can rise to the occasion and regain some momentum with a win in their first home game since mid-September.

“It will be a very, very tough game because Manchester United have done very well this season so far. But we know we are strong too and we are really looking forward to the game,” Can told Liverpool’s official website. (www.liverpoolfc.com)

”We have to be hard in the tackles, we have to try to dominate the game and score the goals when we create chances. We will see what happens.

“It’s always special to play at Anfield and now against Man United... We are really excited and looking forward to the game and to play at Anfield again.”

Liverpool’s poor finishing has led them to one win in their last seven games across all competitions and Can is well aware that positive results will only come if the side can improve their goal-scoring record.

“The last few weeks before the international break were not the best for us because we didn’t get the results we wanted. But it was not that bad -- we played good football and in most of the games we dominated but couldn’t score,” Can added.

”But we have to all stick together and try to give our best on the pitch -- then we will come back to winning ways.

“We try, we play well and we create very good chances. We have to score the goals and if we do, we’ll be back on track.”

Five months into Trump’s presidency, the survey spanning 37 nations showed U.S. favorability ratings in the rest of the world slumping to 49 percent from 64 percent at the end of Barack Obama’s eight years in the White House.

But the falls were far steeper in some of America’s closest allies, including U.S. neighbors Mexico and Canada, and European partners like Germany and Spain.

Trump took office in January pledging to put “America First”. Since then he has pressed ahead with plans to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, announced he will pull out of the Paris climate accord, and accused countries including Canada, Germany and China of unfair trade practices.

On his first foreign trip as president in early June, Trump received warm welcomes in Saudi Arabia and Israel, but a cool reception from European partners, with whom he clashed over NATO spending, climate and trade.

Just 30 percent of Mexicans now say they have a favorable view of the United States, down from 66 percent at the end of the Obama era. In Canada and Germany, favorability ratings slid by 22 points, to 43 percent and 35 percent, respectively.

In many European countries, the ratings were comparable to those seen at the end of the presidency of George W. Bush, whose 2003 invasion of Iraq was deeply unpopular.

“The drop in favorability ratings for the United States is widespread,” the Pew report said. “The share of the public with a positive view of the U.S. has plummeted in a diverse set of countries from Latin America, North America, Europe, Asia and Africa”.

BELOW PUTIN AND XI

The survey, based on the responses of 40,447 people and conducted between Feb. 16 and May 8 this year, showed even deeper mistrust of Trump himself, with only 22 percent of those surveyed saying they had confidence he would do the right thing in world affairs, compared to 64 percent who trusted Obama.

Both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, with confidence ratings of 27 percent and 28 percent respectively, scored higher than Trump. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, with a confidence rating of 42 percent, scored highest among the four leaders in the survey.

The countries with the lowest confidence in Trump were Mexico, at 5 percent and Spain at 7 percent. The only two countries where ratings improved compared to Obama were Russia, where confidence in the U.S. president surged to 53 percent from 11 percent, and Israel, where it rose 7 points to 56 percent.

Globally, 75 percent of respondents described Trump as “arrogant”, 65 percent as “intolerant” and 62 percent as “dangerous”. A majority of 55 percent also described him as a “strong leader”.

The survey showed widespread disapproval of Trump’s signature policy proposals, with 76 percent unhappy with his plan to build the wall on the border with Mexico, 72 percent against his withdrawal from major trade agreements and 62 percent opposed to his plans to restrict travel to the U.S. from some majority-Muslim countries.

Cutting the corporate rate immediately to 20 percent would reduce U.S. tax revenues by nearly $2 trillion over a decade, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center think tank.

Tax writers in the House of Representatives may opt to phase in the 20 percent corporate rate over three to five years by lowering it in stages from the current 35 percent, said two sources close to the tax discussions.

A phase-in surfaced as an option among Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee as it closed in on completion of actual tax legislation, working off of a nine-page “framework” unveiled by Trump on Sept. 27.

The House was expected to be inactive on Friday and all of next week. “We’ll come back in a week and be able to put together the bill that will move through committee,” Republican Representative Kristi Noem told reporters.

One of the biggest problems confronting the Republican tax reform push is the federal budget deficit, which would be hugely expanded by Trump’s proposals, according to independent analyses.

Cutting the corporate rate immediately to 20 percent would reduce U.S. tax revenues by nearly $2 trillion over a decade, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center think tank.

Sources said House Republicans believed they could halve the projected revenue loss if the rate cut were phased in. Details of such an option were unavailable.

The administration contends the cuts would pay for themselves through stronger economic growth generating new tax revenues, although most economists say that is unlikely.

‘CORPORATE INTEGRATION’

A different approach may emerge from the Senate, where Republicans are writing their own tax legislation. Sources with knowledge of the discussions said senators might settle on a corporate tax rate above 20 percent, but use an unorthodox “corporate integration” strategy to achieve an effective rate of 20 percent or less.

Corporate integration, a brainchild of Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, would help lower corporations’ tax bill by giving them a deduction for shareholder dividends, analysts said. The idea has faced opposition in the past.

Both the House and Senate alternatives surfaced this week as top Republicans and Trump administration officials confronted skepticism that the Republican-controlled Congress could cut the corporate rate to 20 percent without ballooning the deficit.

Trump, who earlier in the year called for a 15 percent corporate tax rate and only reluctantly agreed to 20 percent, is now insisting that it go no higher.

“The president has made it clear. He wants 20 percent. That’s the one part of this bill that’s not negotiable,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC.

House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady told reporters on Thursday: “We continue to drive toward the framework ... ensuring that our businesses don’t have anything higher than 20 percent on the corporate side.”

Asked if that meant a 20 percent rate in the first year, he said: “We’re moving toward that whole design.”",Republicans eye alternatives for getting to 20 percent corporate tax rate,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax/republicans-eye-alternatives-for-getting-to-20-percent-corporate-tax-rate-idUSKBN1CH369?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s annual consumer price inflation remained steady in September from the previous month, but hopes of a rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India remain bleak as it expects higher inflation in coming months.

India’s annual consumer inflation (CPI) in September rose to 3.28 percent from a year earlier, government data showed on Thursday.

Analysts polled by Reuters had expected September’s CPI inflation rate would edge up to 3.60 percent from August’s downwardly revised 3.28 percent.

Earlier this month, the RBI left interest rates unchanged, after cutting the key rate by 25 basis points in August, while raising its retail inflation projection for October-March to a range of 4.2 to 4.6 percent, and lowered its economic growth estimates.

Analysts said the chances of a rate cut were bleak as higher sales during India’s long festival season that begins next week, coupled with higher petrol and diesel prices, could feed into broader prices.

“Aside from volatile food and fuel prices, core inflation is likely to accelerate,” said Shilan Shah, an economist at Capital Economics in Singapore.

“There is also a risk that excessive liquidity in the banking sector could seep into inflation.”

Since Aug. 1, retail petrol prices in Delhi have gone up 4.7 percent and diesel 2.6 percent despite a cut in taxes by the federal government.

Retail inflation has been steadily rising since June, when it eased to 1.46 percent - its slowest pace since India started releasing such figures in January 2012, based on combined data for rural and urban consumers.

Separately, annual industrial output grew at a nine-month high of 4.3 percent in August, compared with the forecast of 2.4 percent by economists in a Reuters poll, the data showed.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who faces crucial state elections in his home state of Gujarat and hilly state of Himachal Pradesh in December, is under pressure to revive growth, which slipped to 5.7 percent in the April-June quarter, the slowest pace in three years.

Last week, the government cut taxes on 27 items, mostly food products, and eased rules for small and medium-sized companies, as it rushes to address growing criticism of its new tax launched in July.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices firmed on Friday as bullish news from strong Chinese oil imports to turmoil in the Middle East put Brent on track for a nearly 3 percent weekly gain.

The developments added to other signs that the market was finally rebalancing after years of excess, but analysts warned that the 2018 balance was still shaky.

Brent LCOc1 was at $57.20 at 1335 GMT, up 95 cents. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 was at $51.44 per barrel, up 84 cents from its last settlement.

The contracts were on track for weekly gains of more than 2 percent and 4 percent, respectively.

Chinese oil imports hit 9 million barrels per day (bpd) in September, data showed on Friday. Imports averaged 8.5 million bpd between January and September, solidifying China’s position as the world’s biggest oil importer.

“We woke up with the strong data from China. That’s on the supportive side,” said Olivier Jakob, managing director of oil consultancy PetroMatrix.

China’s huge imports have been strongly driven by purchases for its strategic petroleum reserves (SPR).

The nation has spent around $24 billion on building its crude reserves since 2015 and now holds around 850 million barrels of oil in inventory, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).

Unrest in Iraq, and possible U.S. action on the Iran nuclear deal, also underpinned prices.

On Friday, local television reported that tens of thousands of Kurdish fighters had deployed in the Kirkuk oil region to confront possible “threats” from Iraqi forces.

Tensions between the two, which traders fear could impinge on oil exports from the region, have been building since Iraq’s Kurds overwhelmingly backed independence in a Sept. 25 vote.

Later on Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to announce that he will not certify the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. The deal has to be re-certified every 90 days and is due for renewal on Sunday.

The step would give the U.S. Congress 60 days to decide whether to impose sanctions, but Iran’s parliament speaker told the TASS news agency that decertification would “be the end” of the deal and cause “global chaos”.

“U.S. sanctions could cut off a lot of Iranian oil trade finance,” Jeff Brown, president of energy consultancy FGE, told Reuters this week.

Despite the bullish signals, analysts warned that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries needed to extend its agreement to reduce oil output beyond its current March 2018 expiry date in order to clear stocks.

OPEC, with other producers including Russia, has agreed to production cuts of 1.8 million bpd.

“OPEC-led cuts have breathed new life into oil bulls but unless the organization digs deeper, the drawdown in global oil stockpiles will soon fizzle out,” broker PVM’s Stephen Brennock wrote.",Oil rallies on Chinese import boost and Mideast tensions,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil/oil-rallies-on-chinese-import-boost-and-mideast-tensions-idINKBN1CI01K?il=0

The industry group said actual sales, not seasonally adjusted, were down 11.0 percent from September 2016, while home prices were up 10.7 percent from a year earlier, according to the group’s home price index.

“National sales appear to be stabilizing,” CREA President Andrew Peck said in a statement. “While encouraging, it’s too early to tell if this is the beginning of a longer-term trend.”

Canada’s once-sizzling housing market has cooled dramatically in recent months, particularly in Toronto, the largest city, after a foreign buyers tax was announced in April, and analysts are divided over whether the market is in the midst of a full-scale correction or will bounce back quickly.

In addition to the implementation of a foreign buyers tax in Vancouver in 2016 and Toronto in 2017, two recent interest rate hikes by the Bank of Canada has helped rein in demand.

The report showed activity was up on the month in about half of all local markets, including Vancouver and Toronto. Cities around Toronto had mixed results, with activity remaining near record lows or falling further in some markets.

Sales were down from year-ago levels in nearly three-quarters of all local markets, led by Toronto and nearby housing markets.

The 10.7 percent year-over-year increase in CREA’s Home Price Index was a continued deceleration in annual price gains earlier in the year. The actual national average price for homes sold in September was up almost 3 percent from a year ago at C$487,000 ($390,537), CREA said.

Home resale prices dropped 0.8 percent in September from August, their biggest fall in seven years, while new home prices rose 0.1 percent in August, separate reports showed on Thursday. [L2N1MN0KT]

The report showed the number of newly listed homes rebounded almost 5 percent in September from August, breaking a string of three straight declines.

The national sales-to-new listings ratio declined to 55.7 percent from 57.2 percent in August. A ratio between 40 and 60 percent is generally consistent with a balanced market.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Marenco Swiss Helicopter is raising 150 million Swiss francs (115.64 million pounds)in fresh capital as it prepares to deliver its carbon-fibre aircraft to customers in 2019, it said on Friday.

The company is aiming for the single-engine light helicopter market dominated by Airbus (AIR.PA), Textron’s Bell Helicopter (TXT.N), Lockheed-Martin’s (LMT.N) Sikorsky and Italy’s Leonardo (LDOF.MI).

Chief Executive Andreas Loewenstein, an ex-Airbus executive, said he expected the capital hike to be completed by early 2018. Rothschild is advising Marenco.

Reuters had earlier reported the plan.

Loewenstein said the market for versatile helicopters that can accommodate passengers, patients or payloads is ripe for a Swiss upstart with new technology since many existing helicopters’ designs date to the 1970s.

“There’s a great opportunity to become a challenger in this segment,” Loewenstein said. “We aim to produce and sell well over 100 helicopters annually.”

He estimated the market at 600-700 machines annually, led by Airbus.

Switzerland’s long aviation history includes 78-year-old planemaker Pilatus.

Still, getting tiny Marenco off the ground means overcoming competition from well-known aerospace giants with enormous pricing power and vast maintenance networks, in an industry where surprises from complex technology often lead to cost overruns.

Loewenstein, whose helicopter is undergoing European Aviation Safety Agency certification, expects the capital increase’s proceeds to cover needs until Marenco breaks even, planned for 2022.

His 5,500-pound aircraft seats eight, cruises at 260 km/h (162 mph) and will cost $3.3 million. Marenco makes components like rotor blades itself, while tapping suppliers for others, including turbines from Honeywell (HON.N).

“To be a helicopter maker, you must be capable of creating a production organisation, a support group and distribution,” Loewenstein said. “We’ve begun building these elements and want to move swiftly to the global market.”

Initial orders have come from Air Zermatt, whose services include rescuing imperilled climbers from Switzerland’s 4,478-metre (14,692-foot) Matterhorn. Air Zermatt, which now flies Bell and Airbus aircraft, did not respond to a request for comment.

In all, Marenco has received down payments for 12 aircraft and more than 100 letters of intent, Loewenstein said, with half from the United States and the rest from Europe, Asia and South America.

The decade-old company, located on an ex-Swiss military airfield in the village of Mollis, has so far been bankrolled by Russian billionaire Alexander Mamut, who plans to remain on board.

New investors could include strategic partners or family offices, Loewenstein said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Facebook Inc (FB.O) Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said on Thursday the company was committed to helping U.S. congressional investigators publicly release Russia-backed political ads that ran during the 2016 U.S. election.

“Things happened on our platform in this election that should not have happened,” Sandberg said in an interview in Washington with Axios news that was broadcast on its website. “We told Congress and the intelligence committees that when they are ready to release the ads, we are ready to help them.”

Axios asked Sandberg what the world’s largest social network knew about the extent of Russia’s use of its platform and if ads on Facebook that had been placed by Russian accounts and Donald Trump’s presidential campaign had overlapped in terms of target audiences. She appeared to sidestep the questions and said only that targeting on Facebook was often very broad.

The interview was the first by a senior Facebook executive since the company disclosed last month that it had found some 3,000 politically divisive ads believed to have been bought by Russia before and after the presidential campaign. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia used cyber-enabled means in an attempt to help Trump win the White House, an allegation the Kremlin has denied.

Sandberg was in Washington for meetings with U.S. lawmakers.

Sandberg told the Congressional Black Caucus on Thursday that Facebook planned to add an African-American to its board of directors, a source familiar with the closed-door meeting said, but she offered no details. The board has been criticized for its lack of diversity.

She and two other Facebook executives, Erin Egan and Elliot Schrage, also met privately with Representative Jackie Speier, a California Democrat and member of the House Intelligence Committee.

Facebook and other major internet companies including Alphabet’s Google (GOOGL.O) and Twitter (TWTR.N) are on the defensive as they try to limit fallout from a torrent of revelations about how Moscow sought to use their platforms to sow discord in the United States and influence the election.

Sandberg told Axios that Facebook began hearing rumours around Election Day last November of Russian attempts to use the platform to spread propaganda but did not give a precise timeline about when the company began its review.

Sandberg said she supported the public release of those ads, and the pages to which they were connected. Information about how the ads targeted specific types of users would also be released, she said.

Asked if Facebook contributed to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton’s defeat last year, Sandberg, an open Clinton supporter during the campaign, did not answer directly but said it was important the website was “free from abuse” during any election in any country.

Congressional committees and special counsel Robert Mueller are investigating Russian interference in the election, including whether there was any collusion between Trump associates and Moscow. Trump has denied that there was any collusion between his campaign and associates and Russia.

ANGRY, UPSET

Sandberg acknowledged that the company had erred in how it handled the issue of foreign interference last year.

“It’s not just that we apologise. We’re angry, we’re upset. But what we really owe the American people is determination to do a better job of preventing foreign meddling,” she said.

“We don’t want this kind of foreign interference” on Facebook, Sandberg said.

She said the company had been too permissive at times in terms of how advertisers were allowed to target users.

Sandberg said it was important to protect “free expression” on Facebook and that if the Russian ads had been bought by legitimate accounts instead of fraudulent ones, many would have been allowed to run on the site.

She criticized Twitter’s decision this week to remove a campaign video from Republican Representative Marsha Blackburn, who is running for a U.S. Senate seat in Tennessee. Twitter took down the video, saying a remark Blackburn made about opposing abortion was inflammatory. Twitter later reversed its decision.

“In that ad, there are a lot of things that people don’t like, that I don’t like. ... But the question is, ‘Should divisive political or issue ads run?’ Our answer is yes because when you cut off speech for one person you cut off speech for all people,” she said.

Sandberg said Facebook wanted other internet companies to work towards making ad purchases more transparent, and she said Facebook was talking with lawmakers who want to introduce legislation on the issue.

Representatives from Facebook, Google and Twitter are expected to testify about Russian influence at hearings before the Senate and House intelligence committees on Nov. 1.","Facebook will help investigators release Russia ads, Sandberg tells Axios",https://in.reuters.com/article/trump-russia-cyber/facebook-will-help-investigators-release-russia-ads-sandberg-tells-axios-idINKBN1CH1XN

TOKYO (Reuters) - Boeing Co (BA.N), the world’s biggest maker of passenger jets, has used Kobe Steel (5406.T) products that include those falsely certified by the Japanese company, a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.

Boeing does not consider the issue a safety problem, the source stressed, but the revelation may raise compensation costs for the Japanese company, which is embroiled in a widening scandal over the false certification of the strength and durability of components supplied to hundreds of companies.

The U.S. airline maker is carrying out a survey of aircraft to ascertain the extent and type of Kobe Steel components in its planes and will share the results with airline customers, said the source who has knowledge of the investigation.

The source asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue.

Even if the falsely certified parts do not affect safety, given the intense public scrutiny that airlines operate under they may opt to replace suspect parts rather than face any backlash over concerns about safety.

Any large-scale program to remove those components, even during scheduled aircraft maintenance, could prove costly for Kobe Steel if it has to foot the bill.

Boeing’s European rival Europe’s Airbus (AIR.PA) said it does not buy products directly from Kobe Steel but is investigating whether any suppliers have been affected.

“So far we have not identified any suppliers that procure materials from Kobe Steel for parts fitted on our aircraft,” an Airbus spokesman said by email.

Airbus does, however, buy titanium landing gear parts for its latest long-haul jet, the A350, from France’s Safran (SAF.PA), which are manufactured by Japan Aeroforge, a joint venture between Kobe Steel and Hitachi Metals (5486.T).

A spokesman for Kobe Steel said Japan Aeroforge products were not under investigation “at this point.”

Kobe Steel’s CEO, Hiroya Kawasaki, on Thursday said his company’s credibility was at “zero.” On Friday he pledged that Kobe Steel would pay customers’ costs resulting from the data fabrication of that may stretch back 10 years..

In the U.S., General Motors (GM.N) said it is checking whether its cars contain falsely certified components from Kobe Steel, joining Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) and around 200 other firms that have received falsely certified parts from the company.

Boeing does not buy products such as aluminum composites, used in aircraft because of their light weight, directly from Kobe Steel. Its key Japanese suppliers, including Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (7011.T), Kawasaki Heavy Industries (7012.T) and Subaru Corp (7270.T), however, do.

Mitsubishi Aircraft, a Mitsubishi Heavy subsidiary, said it uses Kobe Steel in the Mitsubishi regional Jet (MRJ), Japan’s first passenger aircraft in half a century. The aircraft has yet to enter service.

“We have concluded at this time that it will not impact the MRJ as it remains within the design standards we originally set for aircraft safety,” a spokeswoman for Mitsubishi Aircraft said.

Japanese companies are a key part of Boeing’s global supply chain, building one fifth of its 777 jetliner and 35 percent of its carbon composite 787 Dreamliner.

“Boeing has been working closely and continuously with our suppliers since being notified of the issue to ensure timely and appropriate action,” Boeing said in a statement earlier this week after Kobe Steel’s bombshell announcement over the weekend.

“Nothing in our review to date leads us to conclude that this issue presents a safety concern,” it added.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A new package of U.S. disaster assistance sailed through the House of Representatives on Thursday, despite President Donald Trump expressing impatience with having to devote federal resources for hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico’s recovery.

The Republican-controlled House voted 353-69 to approve $36.5 billion in emergency relief for Puerto Rico and other areas hit by recent disasters. Senate approval is expected in coming weeks.

Trump and his aides on Thursday suggested that there would be a limit to how much help Puerto Rico could expect from Washington to solve some of its longer-term problems, although Trump is expected to sign the latest emergency package.

The White House on Thursday evening issued a statement saying the Trump administration was “pleased” that the House had approved the relief funds and pledged to work with Congress going forward to provide resources to recover and rebuild.

Puerto Rico has been grappling with a bankruptcy crisis and owes $72 billion to creditors. Devastation from hurricanes Irma and Maria was exacerbated by dilapidated infrastructure, including a power grid largely destroyed by the storms.

In a morning tweet, Trump warned that the United States “cannot keep FEMA, the Military & the First Responders, who have been amazing (under the most difficult circumstances) in P.R. forever!”

FEMA is the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which oversees disaster response in the United States.

Presidential aides later on Thursday provided assurances that Washington will not abandon Puerto Rico, a Caribbean U.S. territory with a population of 3.4 million.

All 69 votes against the aid package came from Trump’s fellow Republicans. Congress is expected to consider additional aid in the coming weeks but the debate could grow more contentious.

House Speaker Paul Ryan is scheduled to lead a bipartisan congressional delegation to Puerto Rico on Friday.

DISASTER FATIGUE

Some conservatives displayed early signs of spending fatigue.

Republican Representative Tom Cole, a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee, said some lawmakers have urged him to find ways to offset the costs of disaster relief.

Besides the latest aid package, Congress last month approved $15.25 billion to help with earlier storm damages, including Hurricane Harvey’s impact in Texas, and wildfires.

“There is some concern about can we couple some of this (disaster aid) with reform measures,” Cole told Reuters on Wednesday. That could include savings to a national flood insurance program or other steps, he added.

Besides helping Puerto Rico recover from Maria, the bill would also provide funds for storm-struck areas of Florida, Texas and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and fire-ravaged California.

Cole said the price tag could rise as relief efforts transition from emergency response to rebuilding.

Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, which has a sizeable Puerto Rican community, told Reuters he had urged Trump to create a high-level task force to provide advice for rebuilding Puerto Rico, and that the president was receptive to the idea.

Much of Puerto Rico remains without electricity or running water three weeks after Maria’s landfall.

Slideshow (5 Images)

“They’re basically three weeks now living in the 19th century,” Rubio said.

White House Chief of Staff John Kelly told reporters the Trump administration would “stand with those American citizens in Puerto Rico until the job is done.”

But Trump’s top legislative aide warned against expecting Washington’s help for long-term infrastructure problems.

“The president is committed to helping to make sure that we do what is necessary to help to rebuild the island, but there are some elements that pre-existed the hurricane,” Marc Short said on CNN.

The House bill includes $18.7 billion for FEMA’s disaster relief fund. Of that, $4.9 billion is earmarked for loans to local governments to ensure Puerto Rico can keep government programs operating beyond Oct. 31.

SARAJEVO (Reuters) - A military helicopter lands to evacuate people wounded during a police raid against terrorists who took hostages at Sarajevo airport - part of the first joint drill by the EU peacekeeping force (EUFOR) in Bosnia and local army and police.

In the exercise, part of the drill dubbed “Quick Response 2017”, Sarajevo is hit by severe flooding, and EUFOR flies in to help the population. There are also protests across the country and a risk of terrorist groups linked to organized crime rings smuggling arms and fake documents.

“This was a realistic exercise and an opportunity to demonstrate that we have capacities, power and determination to quickly and efficiently respond to any security threat,” said Bosnia’s Security Minister Dragan Mektic.

More than 20 years since the end of its war in the 1990s, Bosnia is still troubled by ethnic politicking and external influences. While separatist aspirations by the Bosnian Serb and Croat nationalists grow stronger, there is also a threat of radicalization among traditionally moderate Bosnian Muslims.

The five-day drill, by the 600- strong EUFOR along with 400 British and NATO troops, also includes reconnaissance and surveillance of wide areas across Bosnia.

In 2015, parts of Bosnia were hit by the greatest flooding in a century, leaving thousands without homes and hurting the economy. The same year, two soldiers and a police officer were killed in separate terrorist attacks.

Lee, the billionaire heir to South Korea’s Samsung Group, should find some comfort that its crown jewel Samsung Electronics Co Ltd has reported record profit every quarter since he was jailed in February, making him even richer.

Detained over charges that he bribed former president Park Geun-hye, Lee has since missed the launch of two new flagship phones and three record-breaking quarterly earnings, including July-September earnings guidance on Friday.

He will also be briefed that his top lieutenant and chief executive of Samsung Electronics, Kwon Oh-hyun, has decided to step down to make way for a new leader.

Kwon, who was expected to take a bigger role following Lee’s arrest and the departures of other key executives in the wake of the bribery scandal, made the surprise announcement on Friday when Samsung also forecast record quarterly profit on the back of the memory chip business.

While Lee is unable to do much to minimise a leadership vacuum at one of the world’s biggest technology firms, the 49-year-old Samsung scion will get some solace that Samsung is chugging along without him.

He may also like to know his wealth, in terms of his stake in Samsung Electronics, has increased by at least 45 percent since his arrest.

His Samsung Electronics stake, albeit below one percent, is now worth 2.3 trillion won ($2.0 billion). Lee also received at least 11.8 billion won ($10.5 million) in dividends from Samsung Electronics during his detention, and 837 million won in pay during the first half of 2017. He owns stakes in other Samsung affiliates.

He will miss another record earnings announcement expected in the fourth quarter as he is expected to stay in prison at least until February, when the appellate court hearing his case is likely to try to rule on the bribery suit.

While some investors worry about a prolonged leadership vacuum, and Kwon warned that Samsung was struggling to find new growth engines, others seem more sanguine.

“I think Samsung has a firm system to run the company even in the absence of its head, as we saw from the case of both Lee Kun-hee and (his son) Jay Y. Lee,” said a fund manager who owns Samsung shares, referring to the Samsung Group patriarch who was incapacitated in 2014 following a heart attack.

“Someone will replace him somehow. It’s just like Apple doing fine even after Steve Jobs,” he said, declining to be named as he was not authorised to talk to the media.

LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Goldman Sachs is trying to extricate itself from a box by thinking outside it. The Wall Street firm has set up a small team in what’s known internally as the Innovation Lab, to cook up supposedly clever ideas for big clients. The resulting acquisitions may end up destroying value for the shareholders of the companies involved, but Goldman’s own investors should be pleased the investment bank is trying new things.

Giving advice is at the core of the $94 billion institution run by Lloyd Blankfein, which routinely ranks atop the closely watched league tables. Clients such as ride-hailing app Uber and e-commerce giant Amazon turn to Goldman for assistance. Competition is fierce, though, especially since smaller shops started gobbling more market share after the financial crisis. And fees are shrinking.

Dealmaking in the United States is equivalent to 6 percent of total company market value, according to data collated by Credit Suisse. That’s stubbornly below the historical 9 percent average. Adding to the sense of urgency perhaps is Goldman’s trading operation. It makes up a bigger share of the top line, and has been lackluster.

Revenue from buying and selling bonds, yen, oil and the like fell 40 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier. Earnings due next week are likely to be glum again amid low levels of volatility and a market that, most banks warn, is down around 15 percent.

Adding some luster to the M&A franchise therefore makes sense. The trouble is that for a big institution, small initiatives can take years to show results. Goldman is also growing its retail-bank offering, Marcus, which could generate returns on equity that surpass 15 percent, it says – but is still too small to require separate disclosure. That, and Goldman’s plans to freshen up its trading arm, will command far more attention than whatever may come out of the Innovation Lab. At this point, though, experimentation is to be encouraged.",Breakingviews - Goldman necessity mothers M&A invention,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-goldman-sachs-m-a-breakingviews/breakingviews-goldman-necessity-mothers-ma-invention-idUSKBN1CG2FU

The Waymo self-driving car unit also asked that an independent monitor be appointed to ensure Uber does not use Waymo technology in the future, the sources said.

Uber rejected those terms as non-starters, said the sources, who were not authorized to publicly discuss settlement talks. The precise dollar amount requested by Waymo and the exact time the offer was made could not be learned.

Waymo’s tough negotiating stance, which has not been previously reported, reflects the company’s confidence in its legal position after months of pretrial victories in a case which may help to determine who emerges in the forefront of the fast-growing field of self-driving cars.

The aggressive settlement demands also suggest that Waymo is not in a hurry to resolve the lawsuit, in part because of its value as a distraction for Uber leadership, said Elizabeth Rowe, a trade secret expert at the University of Florida Levin College of Law.

Waymo recently persuaded a San Francisco federal judge to delay a trial to decide the dispute from October to early December, citing the need to investigate evidence Uber had not disclosed earlier.

No further settlement talks are currently scheduled, the sources said. The judge overseeing the case mandated that the companies enter mediation with a court-appointed magistrate.

Amy Candido, a Waymo attorney, declined to comment on any settlement talks, but said the company’s reasons for suing Uber are “pretty clear.”

“Waymo had one goal: to stop Uber from using its trade secrets,” she said. “That remains its goal.”

An Uber spokesperson declined to comment.

DISRUPTIVE

Waymo sued Uber in February, claiming that former engineer Anthony Levandowski downloaded more than 14,000 confidential files before leaving to set up a self-driving truck company, called Otto, which Uber acquired soon after.

Uber denied using any of Waymo’s trade secrets.

FILE PHOTO: The Waymo logo is displayed during the company's unveil of a self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivan during the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., January 8, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo

Waymo’s lawsuit has been disruptive for Uber. U.S. District Judge William Alsup granted Waymo’s request for a pretrial injunction in May, which prohibited Levandowski from working on Lidar, a key sensor technology for self-driving cars that is the crux of the current litigation.

Uber later fired Levandowski, regarded as a visionary in autonomous technology, after he refused to return Waymo documents at the heart of the case. Levandowski has asserted his constitutional right against self-incrimination and declined to answer questions from Waymo lawyers.

Meanwhile, Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick stepped down as chief executive in June after allegations of widespread misconduct at the company became public. Kalanick has since become embroiled in a boardroom fight with fellow Uber investor Benchmark Capital.

Benchmark cited Waymo’s allegations of trade secret theft in separate litigation aimed at forcing Kalanick off Uber’s board. A Delaware judge put that lawsuit on hold and sent it to private arbitration.

On Sunday Oct. 1, the day before Kalanick was scheduled to give a deposition in the Waymo case, Kalanick’s lawyers called Waymo and asked to postpone the deposition, lawyers for both companies said in court last week.

Kalanick’s lawyers said he was in the middle of a fight to appoint new board members and was therefore too busy, Waymo attorneys said in court. Waymo refused the request, forcing Kalanick to attend the deposition.

DISTRACTING A COMPETITOR

Causing such distractions for a competitor are a clear benefit to Waymo, Rowe said. Uber has hired three law firms to litigate the case and devoted thousands of hours to probe Uber servers for Waymo confidential information.

“I‘m counting all those as good reasons to keep the lawsuit going,” Rowe said.

Waymo has estimated damages in the case at about $1.9 billion, according to court filings, which Uber disputes. Despite that figure and the big settlement demands, Waymo views winning a permanent injunction against Uber using any Waymo intellectual property as the main priority, another source familiar with the company’s thinking said.

Much of the technical evidence in the case has been filed under seal, making it impossible for outside observers to independently assess the strength of each side's arguments. In court last week, Alsup said Uber's product was ""dissimilar"" from Waymo's.

Even if a jury finds that Uber stole Waymo trade secrets, Uber says in court filings that its engineers have designed around the Waymo technology at issue in the case. If that is true, that would lessen the impact on Uber in the event of a defeat in court.

Waymo is skeptical of Uber’s claim, however. In a court filing on Monday, it requested an order forcing Uber to disclose its source code, or underlying software, for its Lidar products.

The Alphabet subsidiary said in the filing that it recently learned that former employees took Waymo source code when they went to work at Uber, “including software related to the ‘brains’ of the vehicle that determines how the car moves.”",Exclusive: Alphabet's Waymo demanded $1 billion in settlement talks with Uber - sources,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-uber-lawsuit/exclusive-alphabets-waymo-demanded-1-billion-in-settlement-talks-with-uber-sources-idUSKBN1CH0QC

State prosecutors set aside the charges in April 2009, paving the way for Zuma -- who has faced and denied numerous corruption allegations made since then -- to run for president later that year.

Zuma and the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) were appealing against the High Court ruling, made in April 2016.

In his decision to reject their appeal, Judge Lorimer Leach said it was “irrational” for the NPA to have set the charges aside.

The NPA has responsibility for deciding whether to reinstate the charges, which relate to a 30 billion rand ($2 billion) government arms deal arranged in the late 1990s. It was unclear when such a decision might be taken.

It was also not immediately clear if Zuma would approach the Constitutional Court to try to set aside the Supreme Court’s ruling.

The NPA would need to consider the judgment, spokesman Luvuyo Mfaku said, adding it would “at all times do the right thing within the confines of the rule of law and in the interest of proper administration of justice.”

The rand extended gains against the dollar after the Supreme Court’s ruling, which was unanimous.

“It is difficult to understand why the present regime at the NPA (National Prosecuting Authority) considered that the decision to terminate the prosecution could be defended,” Judge Leach said.

The focus of the corruption allegations that Zuma has faced since taking office has been on leaked emails pointing to the Gupta family, business friends of the president, using their influence to secure lucrative state contracts for their companies.

The Trump administration on Friday disclosed the date of the subsidies cutoff after announcing late on Thursday the most dramatic action the president has taken to undercut Democratic former President Barack Obama’s signature 2010 healthcare law.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the administration will not make the next payment to insurers scheduled for next Wednesday. The payments cost $7 billion this year and were estimated to be $10 billion in 2018, according to congressional analysts.

Trump has made the payments, guaranteed to insurers under Obamacare to help lower out-of-pocket medical expenses for low-income consumers, each month since taking office in January. But he has repeatedly threatened to cut them off and disparaged them as a “bailout” for insurance companies.

The move drew swift condemnation from congressional Democrats, who accused Trump of sabotaging the law, and threats from Democratic state attorneys general in New York and California to take legal action.

Trump, a Republican who promise as a candidate last year to dismantle the law formally called the Affordable Care Act, urged opponents to reach out to him to make a deal.

“The Democrats ObamaCare is imploding. Massive subsidy payments to their pet insurance companies has stopped. Dems should call me to fix!” Trump said in a post on Twitter early on Friday, calling the law “a broken mess.”

Shares of hospitals and health insurers fell in premarket trading on Friday after Trump’s decision. Shares of Anthem Inc, Molina Healthcare Inc, Cigna Corp and Centene Corp, which are all offering plans on Obamacare markets for 2018, were all lower.

Trump has been frustrated by the failure of his fellow Republicans who control Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare despite seven years of promises to get rid of the law that has brought health insurance to 20 million people.

His decision is likely to please those in his hard-line conservative political base who detest the Affordable Care Act, which many Republicans have attacked as an unneeded government intrusion in Americans’ healthcare.

In a nod to that same constituency, the president signed an executive order on Thursday intended to make it easier for Americans to buy bare-bones health insurance plans exempt from Obamacare requirements.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi derided the subsidies cut-off in a joint statement, saying Trump would single-handedly push Americans’ healthcare premiums higher.

‘SPITEFUL ACT’

“It is a spiteful act of vast, pointless sabotage leveled at working families and the middle class in every corner of America,” they said. “Make no mistake about it, Trump will try to blame the Affordable Care Act, but this will fall on his back and he will pay the price for it.”

Insurers and proponents of Obamacare have implored Trump for months to commit to making the payments. Several insurers have cited uncertainty over the payments when hiking premiums for 2018 or exiting insurance markets altogether.

About 10 million people are enrolled in the plans via the law’s marketplace. Many of them receive subsidies, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.

The White House said late on Thursday that it could not lawfully pay the subsidies anymore. A White House statement said that based on guidance from the Justice Department, “the Department of Health and Human Services has concluded that there is no appropriation for cost-sharing reduction payments to insurance companies under Obamacare.”

“In light of this analysis, the Government cannot lawfully make the cost-sharing reduction payments,” it said.

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said he was prepared to lead other attorneys general in a lawsuit.

The payments were the subject of a lawsuit brought by House Republicans against the Obama administration that alleged they were unlawful because they needed to be appropriated by Congress. A judge ruled in favor of the Republicans, and the Obama administration appealed the ruling.

The Trump administration took over the lawsuit and had delayed deciding whether to continue the Obama administration’s appeal or terminate the subsidies, but in April Trump began threatening to stop the payments.

That case became more complicated in August when a U.S. appeals court allowed 16 Democratic state attorneys general to defend the payments and have a say in the legal fight.

In a court filing released on Friday, Sessions argued that while the law provided funds for tax credits it did allow cost-sharing payments for insurers. It was in that court filing that he announced next week’s cutoff date.

Meanwhile, the political turbulence has affected insurers’ decisions. Anthem, one of the largest remaining Obamacare insurers, in August scaled back its offerings in Nevada and Georgia and blamed the moves in part on uncertainty over the payments.

Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina earlier this year raised premiums by more than 20 percent, but said it would have raised premiums by only about 9 percent if Trump agreed to fund the payments.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that cutting off the payments would cause premiums to rise 20 percent in 2018, and that 5 percent of Americans would live in areas that do not have an insurer in the individual market in 2018.

Trump has taken other steps to undermine Obamacare. Last week, his administration allowed businesses and non-profit organizations to seek religious and moral exemptions from Obamacare’s mandate that employers provide coverage for women’s birth control.

The administration also slashed the Obamacare advertising and outreach budget and halved the open enrollment period.","Trump scraps key Obamacare subsidies, urges Democrats to fix 'broken mess'",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-healthcare/trump-scraps-key-obamacare-subsidies-urges-democrats-to-fix-broken-mess-idUSKBN1CI0E4?il=0

(Reuters) - Washington has dramatically increased tensions in talks to renew the North American Free Trade Agreement by proposing that the lifespan of any new deal be limited to five years, people familiar with the negotiations said on Thursday.

The proposal for a so-called sunset clause - just one of a series of U.S. initiatives that are opposed by NAFTA partners Canada and Mexico - only served to increase uncertainty about the future of the deal.

Two sources with direct knowledge of the talks described the atmosphere as “horrible” and highly charged.

The U.S. side proposed the sunset clause late on Wednesday during the fourth of seven scheduled rounds to update the rules governing one of the world’s biggest trade blocs, said two officials, who asked not to be identified because the talks are confidential.

The Trump administration says the clause, causing NAFTA to expire every five years unless all three countries agree it should continue, is to ensure the pact stays up to date.

But Mexico and Canada insist there is no point updating the pact with such a threat hanging over it, arguing the clause would stunt investment by sowing too much uncertainty about the future of the agreement.

“It’s a source of total uncertainty,” said one of the NAFTA government officials.

Speaking in Mexico City, Finance Minister Jose Antonio Meade said the government was working on plans to alter tariffs and identify substitute markets in case the NAFTA talks failed.

His remarks and the tension around NAFTA helped push the peso down 1 percent against the U.S. dollar to a five-month low.

U.S. President Donald Trump says NAFTA, originally signed in 1994, has been a disaster for the United States and has frequently threatened to scrap it unless major changes are made.

Business and farm groups say abandoning the 23-year-old pact would wreak economic havoc, disrupting cross-border manufacturing supply chains and slapping high tariffs on agricultural products. Trade between the United States, Canada and Mexico has quadrupled under NAFTA, now topping $1.2 trillion a year.

In addition to the sunset clause, the United States wants to boost how much North American content autos must contain to qualify for tax-free status and eliminate a dispute settlement mechanisms that Canada insists must stay.

Some trade observers said it is difficult to see how negotiators could reach an agreement given U.S. demands that many see as non-starters.

The head of Unifor, Canada’s largest private sector labor union, said it was clear the United States did not want a deal.

“NAFTA is not going anywhere. This thing is going into the toilet,” Jerry Dias told reporters on Thursday.

Despite clear signs of impatience from Canada in particular, U.S. negotiators have yet to submit their proposal on rules of origin for the auto sector. That looked unlikely to come before Friday, another official familiar with the talks said.

Trump on Wednesday repeated his warnings that he might terminate the pact and said he was open to doing a bilateral deal with either Canada or Mexico.

He was speaking alongside Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who later said Canada was “braced” for Trump’s unpredictability.

Negotiators were also set to cover the difficult issue of government procurement on Thursday.

Canada and Mexico want their companies to be able to bid on more U.S. federal and state government contracts, but this is at odds with Trump’s “Buy American” agenda. U.S. negotiators have countered with a proposal that would effectively grant the other countries less access, people familiar with the talks say.

On automotive rules of origin, NAFTA negotiators face tough new U.S. demands to increase regional vehicle content to 85 percent from 62.5 percent, with 50 percent required from the United States, according to people briefed on the plan.

The rules of origin demands are among several conditions that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has labeled “poison pill proposals” that threaten to torpedo the talks.",U.S. hikes tensions in NAFTA talks with call for 'sunset clause',https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trade-nafta/u-s-hikes-tensions-in-nafta-talks-with-call-for-sunset-clause-idUSKBN1CH2EO?il=0

(Reuters) -

Sixteen days after Hurricane Maria ravaged Puerto Rico, Maria de Lourdes Sandoval heard helicopters over her village of Bajura.

She ran to signal them, forcefully waving her arms and crying for help as they touched down on a nearby soccer field. ”I‘m helpless. I don’t have a home, don’t have anywhere to live. I don’t have furniture, no bed, no clothes,” Sandoval, 47, told Reuters.

Hundreds of villages, isolated by power outages, impassable roads and downed telephone lines, are being helped by helicopter teams from the U.S. Army’s First Armored Division’s Combat Aviation Brigade and the 101st Airborne Division’s “Dustoff” unit.

Daily missions are flown out of the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station in Ceiba, which was closed in 2004 but is now being used by the Army, Air Force, Marines and Navy.

“It hurts because I remember how it used to be, and now it’s completely different,” said Sergeant First Class Eladio Tirado, who was born and raised in Carolina, Puerto Rico. After not visiting for roughly five years, he returned home in a Blackhawk helicopter.

“Everything is so much gone. The vegetation, everything is brown, everything is dead.”

On a recent mission over Luqillo, Tirado asked the pilots to fly over his family’s home because he had been unable to reach them by phone. The helicopter circled the house. No one was there, but Tirado was confident the message would reach his family: he’s here and he’s helping.

Media reports led crews to the village of San Lorenzo, which had received no federal assistance since the hurricane. Dozens of people pressed against a fence to watch helicopters land, anxiously waiting for food and water.

Crews are also transporting people to emergency centers and mapping open roads so trucks can make deliveries.

They circled above houses built on top of mountains to find a level field to unload their precious cargo. One field looked open and a Blackhawk came within eight feet of the ground, but it could not land.

Loaded with 100 cases of water, the helicopter flew off, leaving behind thirst and desperation.

The crew soon found another needy community, Verde de Comerío, where it was able to land.

Villagers quickly lined up to help soldiers pass food and water to a crowd. One woman hugged Pilot Chris Greenway to thank him for water. In less than 10 minutes, hundreds of bottles of water were given to families, emptying the helicopter.

This village also needed medicine, and families with babies had no way of getting basics. Diapers and formula have become luxury goods. But every village asks for water.

The lack of potable water is slowly choking these villages and helicopters can only carry so much. Every trip leaves some who get nothing.

The crews can only hope they can return soon enough to make a difference.

”This island will never stop,” Tirado said. “People will rebuild, we will continue forward, and they’re going to see a better tomorrow.”

Lee was jailed for bribery.

The surprise resignation of Samsung’s chip and display head came as he was expected to take a bigger role following Lee’s arrest in February and the departures of other key executives in the wake of the bribery scandal.

The move came on the same day the South Korean smartphone maker forecast record third-quarter operating profit on the back of the memory chip business which Kwon was instrumental in building into the world leader.

“The timing is nonsensical. Samsung tipped record earnings, it’s going to be better in the fourth-quarter, and all that’s been driven by Kwon’s components business,” said Park Ju-gun, head of research firm CEO Score.

Kwon, 64, is seen as Samsung Group No. 2. As well as being chairman of the board and a board director, he heads the components business - including memory chips - and the display business.

In a statement, the man known as “Mr Chip” said the time had come to “start anew with new spirit and young leadership”.

“We are fortunately making record earnings right now, but this is the fruit of past decisions and investments; we are not able to even get close to finding new growth engines by reading future trends right now,” he added.

The world’s biggest maker of memory chips, smartphones and TVs is set to smash its annual profit record this year, thanks partly to soaring demand for memory chips. Semiconductors were Samsung’s top earner in the three months through June, making a record 8 trillion won ($7.20 billion).

The global chip industry is undergoing a major shift with Japan’s Toshiba Corp partnering with home rival SK Hynix, and other firms consolidating in search of new growth areas like artificial intelligence and automobiles.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong’s leader denied on Friday that China had taken over immigration controls in the city after a British activist was refused entry, but she couldn’t rule out barring even the last colonial governor and frequent China critic, Chris Patten.

Chief Executive Carrie Lam defended Hong Kong’s autonomy amid deepening questions over the Chinese-ruled financial hub’s reputation as a free and international city, after a Conservative Party rights activist, Benedict Rogers, was barred from entering on Wednesday.

When asked on a radio talk show whether Patten, who has criticized perceived Chinese interference in Hong Kong affairs, would be the next to be barred, Lam stopped short of ruling it out.

“I can’t exclude any possibilities because immigration matters will change depending on the case,” she told public broadcaster RTHK.

Patten, who spoke extensively during a recent Hong Kong visit and was critical of the jailing of several democracy activists, has angered some in the pro-Beijing establishment.

Britain handed Hong Kong back to Chinese rule in 1997 amid promises that its widespread freedoms and autonomy would be respected under a “one country, two systems” formula.

But China’s Foreign Ministry said it had the right to allow or refuse any persons wanting to enter Hong Kong, in response to Rogers’ case, as this was a matter of state sovereignty.

The promise of autonomy is enshrined in the mini-constitution, known as the Basic Law, that creates a separate Hong Kong legal and policing regime, including immigration controls. But China has sovereign control over defense and foreign affairs - which critics fear Beijing is exploiting to erode the city’s freedoms.

“I want to clarify any worries ... that this whole matter of immigration is now being taken over by the Central People’s Government. That’s certainly, definitely not the case,” Lam said.

“The case has to be regarded and treated and fall under what constitutes a foreign affairs matter.”

Patten did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

China lodged a diplomatic complaint with London after British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson demanded an urgent explanation from Hong Kong and China for Rogers’ expulsion.

The case has also sparked outcry from the city’s pro-democracy activists, including former number two official Anson Chan, who said Beijing was using the case to send a message.

Local English newspaper The Standard wrote in an editorial on Friday that “if the situation is allowed to evolve into such a state that whoever disliked is barred, it could be the moment we begin to lose our international appeal”.The U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong also expressed concern.

“We urge China to respect Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy consistent with the principle of ‘one country, two systems’,” U.S. consulate spokeswoman Kristin Haworth told Reuters.

The Chinese Embassy in London, in an email reply to Reuters late on Thursday, did not respond directly to Rogers’ allegation that it had warned him through a middleman that he could be refused entry to Hong Kong.

“It is a matter of Chinese sovereignty whether or not to allow entry of any foreigners,” it said, echoing the foreign ministry.",Hong Kong leader can't rule out barring even former governor Patten as China flexes muscles,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-hongkong-china-immigration/hong-kong-leader-cant-rule-out-barring-even-former-governor-patten-as-china-flexes-muscles-idUKKBN1CI14P

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Divisions along national lines, including actions taken by the United States against Russia’s Kaspersky Lab, are making it harder to effectively fight cross-border cyber crime, a senior Interpol official told Reuters on Tuesday.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration barred U.S. government agencies from using Kaspersky Lab anti-virus products in September, saying it was concerned the firm was vulnerable to Kremlin influence and using its software could jeopardize national security.

Kaspersky Lab has strongly denied the allegations, arguing that it has been caught up in a wider geopolitical spat between Moscow and Washington following allegations Russian hackers interfered in last year’s U.S. presidential election.

Moscow denies the accusations and some researchers have pointed to the company’s problems in the United States as an example of growing fragmentation in the cyber security industry after a series high-profile attacks which have fueled distrust and suspicion between countries.

“Balkanisation, especially in the cyber security community - that is happening and that needs to be corrected,” said Noboru Nakatani, executive director of Interpol’s Global Complex for Innovation.

“The reality is criminals, they are working together by sharing information by helping each other to make money,” he said at a cyber crime conference in Moscow. “Do you think the governments or the good people are doing the same?”

Speaking on the sidelines of the conference organized by Russian cyber security firm Group-IB, Nakatani said Kaspersky Lab’s situation was an example of Balkanisation.

He said Interpol, which coordinates international efforts to fight cyber and other crimes, had not received any information from the United States about the allegations against the company.

“Kaspersky is fighting against cyber criminals, it is very clear. Kaspersky is working with governments and companies across the world,” he said. “We should work together.”

A U.S. House of Representatives committee said last week it had scheduled a new hearing to review accusations Russia could use Kaspersky Lab products to conduct espionage.

The Oct. 25 hearing was announced a day after two newspapers reported that Russian hackers stole U.S. cyber secrets in 2015 from a National Security Agency contractor who had Kaspersky software installed on his laptop.

(Reuters) - A surge in technology stocks sent the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq to record highs on Friday, but the gains were kept in check by a drop in banks as Wells Fargo missed revenue estimates for a fourth straight quarter.

Wells Fargo (WFC.N) tumbled 3 percent, set for its biggest drop since mid-April, adding to the pressure on bank stocks after results from JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Citigroup (C.N) on Thursday stoked concerns about consumer credit.

Bank of America (BAC.N), however, bucked the trend, rising 0.5 percent after the lender’s profit topped estimates due to higher interest rates and a drop in costs.

The reports from the Wall Street banks kicked off the earnings season and investors are hoping profit growth will help justify valuations after a rally that has sent the S&P 500 up about 14 percent so far this year.

The market got a boost earlier in the day after data showed retail sales surged by the most in 2-1/2 years in September, easing doubts over an economy that has been sluggish this year.

Another report showed consumer prices recorded their biggest increase in eight months last month as gasoline prices soared in the wake of hurricane-related production disruptions.

But, year-on-year core inflation was unmoved for the fifth month, putting no new pressure on the Federal Reserve to tighten borrowing costs and hamper demand any further.

“While markets are still expecting the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in December, concerns over prolonged periods of depressed inflation may cloud the prospect of higher U.S. interest rates in 2018,” Lukman Otunuga, a research analyst at FXTM said.

“Although this (retail sales) was below market estimates, this figure is still encouraging and continues to support the bullish sentiment towards the U.S. economy.”

LONDON (Reuters) - After three centuries as banker to Britain’s rich and famous, from Charles Dickens to Queen Elizabeth II, Coutts, one of the world’s oldest banks, is trying to modernise.

Britain’s largest private bank wants to update not only its technology and ways of doing business, but also its 325-year-old brand to sell more products to more customers, tackle competition from international rivals and boost revenues.

Chief Executive Peter Flavel aims to increase Coutts’ appeal to a younger generation of wealthy Britons, including vloggers, gamers and other entrepreneurs getting rich from new technologies, as well as its traditional clients.

“We don’t want to live in the history or live in the past, we need to be modern and contemporary and relevant today,” Flavel told Reuters.

”The client base we have here is of course what you would expect, the landed estates and the gentry, that traditional wealth, and that’s a big part of what we’ve had as a bank.

“But the bigger part of what we do today is banking entrepreneurs and helping them develop their businesses.”

Australian-born Flavel, previously CEO of private wealth management at JP Morgan (JPM.N) in Asia and global head of Standard Chartered’s (STAN.L) private bank, was brought in by parent Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) 18 months ago.

Since his arrival, he has pushed for stronger cooperation between the private bank and the universal services offered by RBS.

He has also been exploring more quirky ways to update Coutts’ image.

One of these more off-beat projects is the expansion of a roof garden at Coutts’ central London headquarters, adding fresh fruit and vegetable patches and three bee hives, which produce Coutts-branded honey soon to be given out to new customers.

“We’re having a bit of a think about how we might just be a little different,” Flavel said.

“Banks are serious and boring and risk averse. You can create that little sense of not taking yourself too seriously at - and this is the big one - the appropriate time, because you’re dealing with people’s money.”

Flavel has focussed on tapping RBS’s commercial bank for client referrals, which has helped to broaden its customer base.

Entrepreneurs now make up a growing portion of its business, and outside of London account for 80 percent of the client base.

Coutts is adding 1,700-1,800 new clients annually. But RBS’s wealth management division has struggled to translate a 2.8 percent increase in customer deposits in the first half of this year into revenues, which fell by around 3 percent.

“Private banking is not a volume game,” Flavel said. “New clients are interesting but new clients with significant amounts of their relationship with us are much more interesting.”

To that aim, the bank’s specialist advisers now have to work across traditional product silos to try to tap into the whole spectrum of their clients’ financial needs, from borrowing to wealth management.

COMPETITORS

But Coutts also now faces competition from international rivals, including Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) and Julius Baer (BAER.S), which are expanding private banking in Britain.

After suffering big losses at their investment banks from huge bets on the U.S. housing market and costly legal settlements, many European lenders are turning to private banking in the hope that the traditionally low-risk business can provide more stable returns.

But the business of managing the fortunes of the world’s wealthy is not without its challenges.

Many clients are still risk adverse even 10 years on from the financial crisis, while the increased competition from traditional banks as well as online platforms is putting pressure on the amount banks can charge for their services.

Private banking accounts for less than 5 percent of the profits of state-backed RBS, which chose to keep Coutts through a major restructuring over the past decade. But it sold off Coutts’ international operations in 2015, leaving it to focus solely on Britain’s wealth market, worth about 825 billion pounds.

CHANGING TIMES

Since its establishment in 1692, the core of Coutts’ business has been looking after the wealth of Britain’s aristocracy, landed gentry and celebrities.

The latter includes sports stars - a significant number of the England football team for instance.

But when it comes to attracting up-and-coming wealth, Sebastian Dovey, analyst at wealth management research firm Scorpio Partnership, said Coutts has a challenge ahead.

“They (Coutts) can play the prestige card ... but that doesn’t rub so well now as perhaps it used to,” he said.

“We’re in a much more abrasive consumer market. They’re top quartile but they have to understand that they don’t have a natural right to winning entrepreneurs.”

Helped by cost-cutting, RBS’s private banking division boosted its operating profit by about 60 percent to 82 million pounds in the first half of the year, but its cost-income ratio remains high, at 72.3 percent.

For Flavel, some small costs are worth absorbing to enhance clients’ experience, such as exchange rate fees for users of its multi-currency card.

Coutts is also spending 20 million pounds a year on digital initiatives, including a new online platform launched earlier this year that lets clients execute their own investments.

“We need that mixture of the history and the future,” Flavel said. “That’s exciting and a bit of a challenge at the same time.”",Queen's bank goes for younger clients as rivals try to steal crown,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-rbs-coutts/queens-bank-goes-for-younger-clients-as-rivals-try-to-steal-crown-idUKKBN1CI0ID

Frankfurt (Reuters) - Europas Aktienanleger haben sich auch am Donnerstag kaum aus der Deckung gewagt.

Zum einen lastete weiterhin die Unsicherheit über die politische Entwicklung in Spanien auf den Gemütern. Zum anderen dämpfte der feste Euro die Kauflaune. Der Dax notierte am frühen Nachmittag mit 12.970 Punkten kaum verändert in Sichtweite der 13.000er Marke, die er bislang noch nie erreicht hat.

Die gute Stimmung an der Wall Street, wo sich die großen Indizes zuletzt fast täglich von Rekord zu Rekord hangelten, ließ die meisten Anleger hierzulande kalt. Doch auch in New York sah es am Donnerstag nach einer leichteren Tendenz aus. Für die Eröffnung signalisierten die US-Futures ein Minus von etwa 0,1 bis 0,2 Prozent.

Spaniens Ministerpräsident Mariano Rajoy hatte am Mittwoch mit der Entmachtung der Regierung in Barcelona gedroht. Es sei abzuwarten, ob die Auseinandersetzung ein Risiko bleibe, sagte ein Händler. An der Börse in Madrid zeigten sich die meisten Anleger aber weiterhin beruhigt. Der Leitindex verharrte auf dem Niveau vom Mittwoch. Unterstützt wurde er von einer Empfehlung der Deutschen Bank für spanische Aktien. Die Analysten sehen ein geringeres Risiko für ein Auseinanderbrechen des Landes.

Die Stimmung an den europäischen Börsen litt auch unter dem hohen Euro, der die Absatzchancen der Exportunternehmen auf dem Weltmarkt verringert. Die Gemeinschaftswährung zog zeitweise um 0,2 Prozent auf ein Zweieinhalb-Wochen-Hoch von 1,1880 Dollar an. Am Finanzmarkt wächst nach Einschätzung von Analysten die Skepsis über den geldpolitischen Zeitplan der US-Notenbank Fed.

Die Veränderungen bei der Lufthansa sähen “zu gut aus, um wahr zu sein”, kommentierten die Analysten der Bank HSBC. Der Aktienkurs von Air Berlin liegt nur noch bei 25 Euro-Cent. In London gewannen die Titel von Easyjet 2,4 Prozent. Die britische Airline steht ebenfalls in Verhandlungen mit Air Berlin.

One of the new mobile apps, FemiTaxi, has expanded into six Brazilian cities and is eyeing other Latin American markets. Competing app LadyDriver, which launched in Sao Paulo in March, will start operations in Rio de Janeiro in October.

Ride-hailing apps for female drivers and passengers are not unique to Brazil. All-women ride hailing app See Jane Go launched in California in 2016, and rival Safr launched in Boston this year.

Yet their rapid growth in cities such as Sao Paulo, Uber’s biggest market by rides, underscores rising concerns about public safety in Brazil and efforts to shield women from the discomfort and danger of a culture steeped in machismo.

Reports of sexually charged crimes such as attempted rape rose by double digits in Sao Paulo state in August from a year earlier, and high-profile cases of sexual assault on public buses have drawn attention to the issue.

Metros in the cities of Belo Horizonte and Recife rolled out female-only train cars in the past year, taking up an idea pioneered by Rio more than a decade ago.

“I think the problem of sexual harassment in public transport always existed, but it wasn’t discussed,” said Gabriela Correa, founder and CEO of LadyDriver. “Now woman are standing up, taking initiatives like our own to seek safety.”

Uber, along with peers such as Spain’s Cabify and local rival 99, which is backed by China’s Didi Chuxing and Japan’s SoftBank Group (9984.T), have also stepped up efforts to improve safety for drivers and passengers this year.

Press representatives for all three apps said they were working to guarantee safe and comfortable experiences for users.

Uber [UBER.UL], which reported more than 500 million rides in Brazil in the past three years, said it runs background checks on drivers, bans users who behave inappropriately and allows riders to share their location in real-time with friends and family.

Cabify also said it has a 24-hour help line and runs rigorous background checks on its drivers.

Embracing demand for female drivers registered in a passenger survey, 99 said it began offering a women-only option on its app late last year, which is second only to air conditioning among preferences set by users.

Lady Driver, which has over 100,000 users and 8,000 drivers in Sao Paulo, will expand to Rio in October, Correa said.

FemiTaxi now has more than 20,000 rides per month and 1,000 drivers. Founder Charles-Henry Calfat said he plans to expand into two more Brazilian cities in coming months, then Mexico and Argentina early next year.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenyan police shot dead two people and wounded a third when a crowd tried to storm a police station during an opposition protest against a looming presidential vote re-run, a senior official said.

Around 20 youths attempted to take over the station during an otherwise peaceful rally in the town of Bondo in the southwest county of Siaya, forcing officers to open fire, County Commissioner Josephine Onunga said by phone.

Police also used teargas to break up small demonstrations in Kenya’s three main cities - Kisumu, the capital and the port of Mombasa - defying a government ban on rallies in city centers.

Kenya’s supreme court nullified the presidential election in August, citing procedural irregularities and voiding the victory of President Uhuru Kenyatta, opening the way to a repeat vote on Oct. 26.

But opposition leader Raila Odinga has refused to take part, saying the re-run should not happen until wide-ranging reforms were brought in to prevent a repeated failure.

The election board has said the polls will go ahead anyway, pitting Kenyatta against six other candidates, none of whom polled more than 1 percent in the August election.

Odinga told Reuters that he might consider returning to the Supreme Court for clarification on whether the Oct. 26 poll was legal.

PROVOCATIONS

“As far as we are concerned, that (original Supreme court) ruling is still valid,” Odinga said during a visit to London.

“What we are demanding is that the electoral commission should respect the Supreme Court and carry out elections in accordance with the ruling.”

He supported protesters’ right to demonstrate, he said, but he has so far stopped short of calling people onto the streets himself.

Martin Kimani, the Director of the National Counter Terrorism Centre, said the opposition was trying to manufacture a crisis.

“A lot of those provocations or demonstrations taking place is an attempt to create the appearance of a crisis,” he said. “There is a clear process on how to hold an assembly – it is about maintaining law and order.”

In Nairobi, opposition legislators were repeatedly teargassed as they tried to drive into the city center.

“We are asking Uhuru’s government to ... let us protest in peace and truth and we are saying we want change and we do not want Uhuru and his people,” said protester Mellen Kirumbo.

In Kisumu, a stronghold of Odinga support, protesters reacted angrily when police turned water cannon on them to prevent them from entering the city center.

“Our demonstrations have a (valid) basis and are peaceful,” said Odinga supporter Hezron Tirus Aloyo. “We condemn the directive ... on the limitation of our rights to demonstrate.”",Kenya police shoot dead two during opposition protest: commissioner,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1CI0ZX-OZATP

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders reiterated on Friday the group could face significant fines as the result of UK and French corruption investigations into the use of middlemen in plane sales.

“I cannot predict the outcome of this investigation but it is not impossible that the fine will be significant,” Enders told Le Monde in an interview.

“We know that all this is weighing on the company but we have no alternative.”

Britain and France have pledged to co-operate in their investigations, which were launched after Airbus disclosed anomalies last year in past filings on the use of agents.

It also faces an Austrian probe over a 2003 fighter sale.

Enders told Le Monde he was not aware of any investigation being carried by the U.S. Department of Justice.

Airbus is also conducting its own internal investigation in the hope of being offered a deal by UK prosecutors as a reward for co-operation and sharing results with investigators.

Legal experts say any settlement could cost significantly more than the roughly 700 million pounds paid by Rolls-Royce under a similar deal earlier this year.

Speaking separately to Le Monde, Airbus Chairman Denis Ranque said the board was mindful of the fact that a conviction could cost Airbus, a major defense and space supplier, access to public markets.

“The consequences of such a scenario would be very heavy. Full and utter co-operation is the only path possible,” he said.

People familiar with the matter have said the size of sums involved in the probe, spread over dozens of deals, and mounting internal tensions have generated alarm at board level.

The board expressed full trust and confidence in Enders on Thursday, but two people familiar with the matter said it only did so after commissioning its own study of top management.

Le Monde said the board had appointed its own lawyers and that Ranque had declined to confirm or deny this.

Two people with knowledge of the move said the board has also recently hired head hunters. One of the people said, however, that this was part of a normal talent review.

Enders earlier this year announced his intention to renew his three-year mandate in 2016.

LONDON (Reuters) - Uber [UBER.UL] lodged a court appeal on Friday to overturn a decision by London’s transport regulator that stripped the taxi app of its operating license in its most important European market, the first stop on what is set to be a long legal road.

Transport for London (TfL) shocked the Silicon Valley firm last month by deeming it unfit to run a taxi service and refusing to renew its license, citing its approach to reporting serious criminal offences and background checks on drivers.

The appeal marks the beginning of months of legal wrangling in a battle that had pitched one of the world’s richest cities against a Silicon Valley giant known for forays into new markets across the globe that have stoked competition for established cab companies.

Uber, whose backers include Goldman Sachs and BlackRock, will defend its London business at a hearing most likely due on Dec. 11, a spokesman at Britain’s Judicial Office told Reuters.

Uber, criticized by London Mayor Sadiq Khan for employing an “an army of PR experts and an army of lawyers”, said that it hoped to keep talking to TfL to find a way forward.

“While we have today filed our appeal so that Londoners can continue using our app, we hope to continue having constructive discussions with Transport for London,” an Uber spokesman said.

“As our new CEO has said, we are determined to make things right.”

Only a month into the job, Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi met TfL Commissioner Mike Brown for talks earlier in October, which both sides said were constructive as the $70-billion firm tries to repair its relationship with the regulator.

Uber’s license expired on Sep. 30 but its roughly 40,000 drivers in the British capital will be able to continue operating until the appeals process is exhausted.

Friday’s appeal was submitted to Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London as part of the first stage of a legal process which could take months or years to reach a conclusion.

The filing is a short notification of Uber’s intention to appeal rather than the detailed grounds.

DISRUPTIVE YEAR

London’s decision is one of the most serious setbacks to the taxi app, which has been forced to quit several countries, including Denmark and Hungary, and faced regulatory battles in multiple U.S. states and around the world.

It comes after a tumultuous few months for the San Francisco start-up that led to former CEO and co-founder Travis Kalanick being forced out after a series of boardroom controversies.

Earlier this month, the firm’s boss in Britain Jo Bertram said she would quit the taxi hailing app according to emails seen by Reuters.

The company is also embroiled in court action against two drivers who won a tribunal case last year entitling them to workers’ rights such as the minimum wage and holiday entitlement, threatening its business model. Uber is appealing the verdict.

TfL said on Friday it would not comment before the licensing appeal hearing due later this year.

A spokesman at the Mayor of London’s office said that Khan, a politician from the opposition Labour Party who is also chairman of TfL, continued to back the license decision and that all private hire firms must play by the rules.

He said during a monthly question time session on Thursday that the transport authority would defend its decision during the legal action.

MANILA (Reuters) - A group of civil society organizations has demanded that Apple Inc (AAPL.O) remove from its app store games it said violated the tech firm’s guidelines and promoted violence and killings commonplace in the Philippines’ war on drugs.

The group named several apps featuring characters based on Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte and his national police chief, Ronaldo “Bato” dela Rosa, who engage criminals in gun battles and fistfights.

“These games valorise and normalise the emerging tyranny of Duterte’s presidency and his government’s disregard for human rights principles,” the Asian Network of People who Use Drugs (ANPUD) said in an open letter to Apple’s Chief Executive Officer, Tim Cook.

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters.

The group listed 131 organizations from numerous countries as supportive of the Oct. 10 complaint to Apple, among them groups working on human rights, youth and drug policy reform.

They urged Apple to issue an apology for hosting such “insensitive content”.

Thousands of Filipinos have been killed in Duterte’s 15-month-old war on drugs, a campaign that has caused international alarm. Human rights groups say state-sponsored executions are taking place, an assertion the authorities vehemently reject.

The group said games such as “Fighting Crime 2”, “Duterte knows Kung Fu”, “Duterte Running Man Challenge”, “Tsip Bato” and “Duterte Vs Zombies” “might seem harmless and fun” but were offensive and distasteful because in reality, murder and impunity had prevailed.

“Duterte Running Man Challenge” was not available for download on Friday, and three of the app developers could not be reached for comment.

Ben Joseph Banta, a managing partner of Ranida Games, which developed “Tsip Bato”, said the game sought to discourage drug use with the use of banner messages opposing drugs that were visible to players.

“The aim of our game is not to promote violence,” Banta said in an emailed response, adding that it featured “supplemental digital content against the use of illegal drugs.”

“We understand the human rights groups and we’re very much open to make changes in the game in order to remove the stigma that the game is promoting violence,” he said.",Activists urge Apple to drop apps that play up Philippine drugs war,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-philippines-drugs-apple-apps/activists-urge-apple-to-drop-apps-that-play-up-philippine-drugs-war-idUSKBN1CI13Z

TORONTO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackBerry Ltd (BB.TO) said a licensing deal it signed with low-end Android handset maker BLU Products Inc will bring it recurring revenue, ending a legal dispute over patents that rival Google has asked the U.S. government to revoke.

BlackBerry did not disclose financial terms and its shares were little changed after the news, rising 0.5 percent in late Thursday morning Nasdaq trade (BBRY.O).

BlackBerry filed two lawsuits against Miami-based BLU in June 2016, part of an effort by the Canadian company to generate revenue from its trove of technology patents.

Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google responded to lawsuits against a maker of phones running its Android operating system by challenging six of the patents at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

In late August and early September, a patent office appeal board said that Google had a “reasonable likelihood” of winning the invalidation of four patents in a full review.

The deal between BlackBerry and BLU was likely secured prior to a July 19 memorandum of understanding filed with the court hearing their patent dispute. The two firms have declined to disclose financial terms of that agreement.

BlackBerry Chief Executive Officer John Chen said on a Sept. 28 earnings call that his company had received revenue from BLU, but did not elaborate.

It was not clear if that payment was included in that quarter’s earnings, which beat analysts’ forecast on a jump in licensing fees that includes patent payouts and royalties on BlackBerry-branded devices and software sold by others.

Patent licensing deals are typically structured with an upfront payment to cover past sales and ongoing royalty payments tied to future sales.

Market intelligence company IDC estimates that BLU accounts for less than 1 percent of global smartphone market share.

BlackBerry said in its statement on Thursday that the completion of the BLU deal allows it to focus on other licensing targets in the mobile communications industry.

“Anytime you have royalty-bearing licenses, you are setting a market rate,” said David Pridham, chief executive of Dallas-based patent consulting firm Dominion Harbor Group, which recently analyzed BlackBerry’s patent portfolio on behalf of a group of handset manufacturers.

“Doing so with a smaller player will be helpful as BlackBerry turns its attention to larger market incumbents,” he said.

BlackBerry is also waging two other patent lawsuits, one involving Nokia Oyj’s (NOKIA.HE) mobile networking technology filed in February and another broadly targeting Avaya products that was filed in July 2016.",BlackBerry details patent deal with Android maker BLU,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blackberry-patents/blackberry-details-patent-deal-with-android-maker-blu-idUSKBN1CH1GE

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders reiterated on Friday the group could face significant fines as the result of UK and French corruption investigations into the use of middlemen in plane sales.

“I cannot predict the outcome of this investigation but it is not impossible that the fine will be significant,” Enders told Le Monde in an interview.

“We know that all this is weighing on the company but we have no alternative.”

Britain and France have pledged to co-operate in their investigations, which were launched after Airbus disclosed anomalies last year in past filings on the use of agents.

It also faces an Austrian probe over a 2003 fighter sale.

Enders told Le Monde he was not aware of any investigation being carried by the U.S. Department of Justice.

Airbus is also conducting its own internal investigation in the hope of being offered a deal by UK prosecutors as a reward for co-operation and sharing results with investigators.

Legal experts say any settlement could cost significantly more than the roughly 700 million pounds paid by Rolls-Royce under a similar deal earlier this year.

Speaking separately to Le Monde, Airbus Chairman Denis Ranque said the board was mindful of the fact that a conviction could cost Airbus, a major defense and space supplier, access to public markets.

“The consequences of such a scenario would be very heavy. Full and utter co-operation is the only path possible,” he said.

People familiar with the matter have said the size of sums involved in the probe, spread over dozens of deals, and mounting internal tensions have generated alarm at board level.

The board expressed full trust and confidence in Enders on Thursday, but two people familiar with the matter said it only did so after commissioning its own study of top management.

Le Monde said the board had appointed its own lawyers and that Ranque had declined to confirm or deny this.

Two people with knowledge of the move said the board has also recently hired head hunters. One of the people said, however, that this was part of a normal talent review.

Enders earlier this year announced his intention to renew his three-year mandate in 2016.

PARIS (Reuters) - De la CFDT au Parti socialiste en passant par le MoDem et même La République en marche (LREM), l‘exécutif français est invité à infléchir vers davantage de justice sociale une politique perçue dans l‘opinion comme oublieuse des plus fragiles.

Les tentatives de mise en lumière des choix d‘Emmanuel Macron, notamment fiscaux, n‘ont jusqu‘ici guère atténué les attaques contre un président vu comme le défenseur d‘une élite dont il est issu, voire méprisant avec les défavorisés.

Reçu vendredi à l‘Elysée dans le cadre des consultations sur les prochaines réformes, le secrétaire général de la CFDT, Laurent Berger, a déploré “un certain nombre de dispositions prises ces derniers mois qui tombent souvent du mauvais côté, c‘est-à-dire pas du côté de la justice sociale”.

Baisse de l‘aide publique au logement (APL), réduction des emplois aidés, adoption par ordonnances d‘une réforme du travail contestée dans la rue : beaucoup de Français, notamment sympathisants d‘une gauche qui estiment avoir fait élire le jeune président de 39 ans, déplorent ces choix.

“Emmanuel Macron a été élu face au Front national. Il y avait une attente d‘une forme de bienveillance, d‘une politique de cohésion sociale. Ça n‘a pas été dans ce sens-là”, a regretté Laurent Berger sur Europe 1.

METTRE EN MARCHE LA “JAMBE SOCIALE”

Malgré les explications du gouvernement, notamment via son porte-parole Christophe Castaner, la revalorisation des minima sociaux, de l‘allocation adulte handicapé et de la prime d‘activité envisagés dans le budget 2018 ont été moins visibles que la suppression de l‘impôt sur la fortune (ISF) et son remplacement par une taxe sur la fortune immobilière (IFI).

Les exceptions consenties sur les signes ostentatoires de richesse comme les yachts n‘ont guère modifié la donne. Selon un sondage Odoxa publié jeudi, une écrasante majorité de Français (82%) pense ainsi que les grandes fortunes sont “plutôt avantagées” par la politique fiscale.

Le sujet fait débat au Parlement, jusqu‘au sein de la majorité. Si les députés Républicains “constructifs” plaident pour une suppression totale de l‘ISF, les centristes réclament, eux, un meilleur “équilibre social”.

Dans un entretien aux Echos, le député MoDem Jean-Louis Bourlanges demande d‘aller “plus loin sur la voie d‘une redistribution fiscale que l‘impôt sur le revenu assume de plus en plus mal.”

Au sein du groupe LREM, peu expressif jusqu‘ici, environ 130 députés ont signé une tribune explicative sous le titre : “Promesses tenues : le budget de la justice sociale et de l‘efficacité économique”.

La fibre sociale s‘exprime aussi via des élus comme Brigitte Bourguignon, qui évoque dans Le Parisien la nécessité “de mettre en marche la ‘jambe sociale’ du projet du chef de l‘Etat”.

Sans vouloir créer un courant et encore moins une “fronde”, l‘élue LREM du Pas-de-Calais, présidente de la commission des Affaires sociales à l‘Assemblée, se veut “une force de proposition” sur des sujets comme la pauvreté et les seniors.

La tentation libérale du gouvernement ne fait en revanche aucun doute pour les députés de gauche, minoritaires au Parlement, notamment issus de La France insoumise qui a combattu dans la rue la réforme du Code du travail.

Au PS, l‘ancien ministre de l‘Economie Michel Sapin a fustigé un budget 2018 des “très, très riches”, mettant Bercy au défi de publier la somme dont vont bénéficier les 100 premières fortunes de France du fait de la transformation de l‘ISF.

“FAIRE LES POCHES DES PAUVRES, CE N‘EST PAS LE PROGRÈS”

Pour le député socialiste Boris Vallaud, l‘Elysée se trompe de logiciel.

“Faire les poches des pauvres, ce n‘est pas le progrès”, a-t-il dit à Reuters. “Pour Emmanuel Macron, une politique efficace sera forcément juste. Or pour nous, seule une politique juste peut être efficace”.

Conscient des potentiels dégâts sur l‘image de ce début de quinquennat, l‘exécutif tente de redresser la barre.

“Le président lance une concertation avec les acteurs associatifs qui se conclura par la présentation d‘une stratégie de prévention de lutte contre la pauvreté”, souligne l‘Elysée. “Au moment de cette présentation, le chef de l‘Etat fera sans doute un discours”.

En attendant, le Premier ministre Edouard Philippe a présenté vendredi un plan contre les déserts médicaux.

Sur RTL, le secrétaire d‘État chargé du Numérique, Mounir Mahjoubi, a évoqué le souci d’“une France qui est performante” mais où “personne n‘est laissé sur le côté.”

“Quand on n‘a pas internet, quand on n‘a pas le médecin, quand on n‘a pas l‘école, évidemment qu‘on se sent un peu à part”, a-t-il dit. “Toute la politique de notre gouvernement, c‘est d‘aller vers ces territoires, dans les quartiers populaires, et de dire : ‘On est là’”.",L'exécutif interpellé de tous côtés pour plus de justice sociale,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idFRKBN1CI1RO-OFRTP

Washington (Reuters) - US-Präsident Donald Trump treibt mit einem Doppelschlag gegen Obamacare die Demontage der Gesundheitsreform seines Vorgängers voran.

Nach einem weitreichend Erlass am Donnerstagmorgen (Ortszeit) kündigte das Präsidialamt in Washington am späten Abend an, auch die umstrittenen Milliardenzahlungen des Bundes an Versicherer einzustellen. Der Schritt könnte unabhängigen Experten zufolge zu einem massiven Anstieg der Prämien führen. Kritiker sprachen von einem Angriff des Präsidenten auf die Mittelschicht und Arbeiterfamilien. Die Republikaner im Kongress waren trotz ihrer Mehrheit mehrfach mit dem Versuch gescheitert, Obamacare per Gesetz aufzuheben, eines von Trumps zentralen Wahlversprechen. Nun versucht es Trump offenbar mit einem schrittweisen Rückbau von Obamacare.

Bislang zahlt der Bund Gelder direkt an die Versicherer mit dem Ziel, besonders Amerikaner mit niedrigen Einkommen zu unterstützen. In diesem Jahr dürften diese Zahlungen sieben Milliarden Dollar betragen. Republikanische Abgeordnete hatten gegen die Subvention geklagt mit der Begründung, dass der Demokrat Barack Obama damit seine Befugnisse überschritten habe: Nur der Kongress könne derartige Ausgaben genehmigen. Das Verfahren läuft noch. In der Erklärung des Präsidialamtes vom Donnerstagabend hieß es nun, das Gesundheitsministerium sei zu dem Schluss gekommen, dass die juristische Grundlage für eine Beteiligung an den Kosten fehle. “In Anbetracht dieser Analyse kann die Regierung die Hilfszahlungen rechtmäßig nicht leisten.”

“BOSHAFTER AKT DER SINNLOSEN SABOTAGE”

Das Haushaltsbüro des Kongresses (CBO) hatte geschätzt, dass ohne die Bundeshilfen die Prämien für einige US-Bürger 2018 um ein Fünftel steigen könnten. Demokraten kritisierten den Schritt scharf. Es handle sich um einen “boshaften Akt der sinnlosen Sabotage gegen Arbeiterfamilien und die Mittelschicht in jedem Winkel Amerikas”, erklärten die Minderheitsführer in Senat und Repräsentantenhaus, Chuck Schumer und Nancy Pelosi. Trump werde versuchen, die Auswirkungen seiner Politik als Folge von Obamacare selbst darzustellen. “Aber das wird auf ihn zurückfallen und er wird den Preis dafür zahlen.”

Trump hatte seit seiner Amtsübernahme im Januar zwar die Zahlungen weiterlaufen lassen, sie jedoch wiederholt kritisiert. In den vergangenen Monaten drängten Versicherer den Präsidenten dazu, sich langfristig zu den Hilfen zu bekennen, da sich bereits die Unsicherheit auf den US-Versicherungsmarkt auswirke. Im Bundesstaat North Carolina hoben etwa die Gesellschaften Blue Cross und Blue Shield ihre Prämien um 20 Prozent an mit dem Hinweis, dass es bei einer gesicherten Finanzierung nur neun Prozent gewesen wären. Zuletzt haben an den US-Börsen die Aktien von Versicherern wie Anthem, Molina, Cigna und Centene gelitten.

KLEINUNTERNEHMEN KRITISIEREN OBAMACARE-KOSTEN

Durch die Gesundheitsreform haben etwa 20 Millionen Amerikaner erstmals Zugang zu einer Krankenversicherung erhalten. Viele von Trumps Republikanern lehnen das Regelwerk jedoch als unzulässigen Eingriff des Staates in den Gesundheitsmarkt ab. Zu den lautesten Kritikern gehören Kleinunternehmen, die auf gestiegene Kosten verweisen. Trumps Erlass vom Donnerstagmorgen zielte unter anderem darauf ab, sie zu entlasten: Sie sollen leichter über die Grenzen der Bundesstaaten hinweg Verbände bilden können, die von einigen Regeln befreit sein würden.[nL8N1MO1AV] Zudem soll der Abschluss von Minimalversicherungen erleichtert werden.

Viele dieser Maßnahmen dürften frühestens 2019 greifen. Zudem dürften sie vor Gericht angefochten werden. Am Donnerstag kündigte der Justizminister von Kalifornien, Xavier Becerra, umgehend seine Bereitschaft zu einer Klage an. Sein Kollege Eric Schneiderman im Bundesstaat New York schloss sich an. Er warf Trump vor, er wolle Obamacare “ausweiden, egal, was es kostet”.",Trump demontiert Obamacare - Kein Geld für Versicherte,https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-gesundheit-idDEKBN1CI0K9

(Reuters) - Maria Sharapova swatted aside Swiss qualifier Stefanie Voegele 6-3 6-1 in just over an hour at the Tianjin Open on Friday to reach her second semi-final since returning from a 15-month doping ban.

Sharapova was broken in the first game but fought back to draw level before going on to take the first set with a hold to love.

The former world number one, targeting a first title since returning to the tour in April, raced to a 4-0 lead in the second set as an error-prone Voegele struggled on serve.

Voegele handed Sharapova three match points when she made her eighth double fault of the contest while trailing 5-1.

The Russian sealed the match with a forehand winner and will meet defending champion Peng Shuai on Saturday.

Sri Lanka’s civil aviation minister, Nimal Siripala, said the country had been looking for alternative investors in the Hambantota area, where China has built a seaport and is in discussions to build an investment zone and a refinery.

“It was during this time India came up with a proposal,” Siripala said Monday. “They were ready for a joint venture with the Airport and Aviation Services Limited,” he said, referring to the state-run company that runs Sri Lanka’s main airport in the capital Colombo and the one in the south, in Mattala.

The town of Hambantota sits near one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes and is an important part of the Belt and Road initiative, aimed at building trade and transport links across Asia and beyond to Europe.

China runs the seaport with a 99-year lease and was planning to expand its footprint in the area with the refinery, which would be Sri Lanka’s largest, and an investment zone of about 6,000 hectares (15,000 acres).

Beijing’s projects, backed by loans extended by the Chinese government and initiated by a previous Sri Lankan government, have faced widespread opposition in Sri Lanka.

Local residents facing eviction to make way for the projects have staged numerous protests. Other critics say the Sri Lankan government signed up for unnecessary and loss-making projects, pushing the country into long-term indebtedness.

India has offered to set up a joint venture with Sri Lanka to manage and expand facilities at the loss-making Mattala airport, which sits adjacent to the Hambantota seaport, according to Siripala and an Indian government source, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.

There was no immediate response from the Indian foreign ministry to a request for comment on the airport deal.

The initial investment would be $293 million, of which India will provide 70 percent on a 40-year lease, according to a Sri Lankan cabinet paper reviewed by Reuters that details the Indian plan to make the airport viable.

The airport, built at a cost of $253 million by China, which also provided $230 million of funding, gets one flight a day, from Dubai, and has been dubbed the world’s emptiest airport for its long, empty corridors.

The Indian government source said India had proposed establishing a flying school and a maintenance hub at Mattala to boost airport revenues while it builds up traffic. There are also hopes the airport could be a destination for Indian tourists.

“We are trying for a large integration of the Sri Lankan and Indian eco-systems, we want to boost tourism in our two countries,” the source said.

China said it was not aware that Sri Lanka was considering allowing India to manage the airport. China also put in a bid to operate the facility, but the two sides failed to agree on financial terms.

“China hopes the relevant country does more to play a constructive role in increasing mutual trust and cooperation between nations in the region and promoting regional peace, stability and development,” the Chinese foreign ministry said in response to an email request for comment.

OLD BONDS

India and Sri Lanka have centuries-old ethnic and cultural bonds, but these frayed amid New Delhi’s support for Sri Lanka’s Tamil minority during the island’s 26-year civil war, which ended in 2009.

China was among the first countries that stepped in to help in the post-war reconstruction of Sri Lanka, building roads, power stations and ports.

By 2014, Chinese navy submarines were also docking in Colombo, raising alarm in New Delhi and prompting a push by the administration of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to claw back influence in the region.

The Indian source said New Delhi would allow Sri Lanka to determine the size of the Indian stake in the airport venture and whether it would involve state or private companies.

However, some opposition groups are concerned that turning to India is equally fraught with risk.

Dullas Alahapperuma, an opposition member of parliament, said the government was making a mistake by handing over national assets to China and India in Hambantota.

“In the end, there could be dangerous consequences,” he said.

On Tuesday, police detained three opposition MPs protesting in Hambantota against the airport lease plan. The three included Namal Rajapaksa, the son of Mahinda Rajapaksa, the former president who signed the construction deal with China.

Siripala, the aviation minister, said any deal to give India the right to manage the airport was purely commercial and would not compromise Sri Lanka’s security interests.","India eyes airport in Sri Lanka, near Chinese Belt and Road outpost",https://www.reuters.com/article/sri-lanka-port-india/india-eyes-airport-in-sri-lanka-near-chinese-belt-and-road-outpost-idINKBN1CI0I3

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices firmed on Friday as bullish news from strong Chinese oil imports to turmoil in the Middle East put Brent on track for a nearly 3 percent weekly gain.

The developments added to other signs that the market was finally rebalancing after years of excess, but analysts warned that the 2018 balance was still shaky.

Brent LCOc1 was at $57.20 at 1335 GMT, up 95 cents. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 was at $51.44 per barrel, up 84 cents from its last settlement.

The contracts were on track for weekly gains of more than 2 percent and 4 percent, respectively.

Chinese oil imports hit 9 million barrels per day (bpd) in September, data showed on Friday. Imports averaged 8.5 million bpd between January and September, solidifying China’s position as the world’s biggest oil importer.

“We woke up with the strong data from China. That’s on the supportive side,” said Olivier Jakob, managing director of oil consultancy PetroMatrix.

China’s huge imports have been strongly driven by purchases for its strategic petroleum reserves (SPR).

The nation has spent around $24 billion on building its crude reserves since 2015 and now holds around 850 million barrels of oil in inventory, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).

Unrest in Iraq, and possible U.S. action on the Iran nuclear deal, also underpinned prices.

On Friday, local television reported that tens of thousands of Kurdish fighters had deployed in the Kirkuk oil region to confront possible “threats” from Iraqi forces.

Tensions between the two, which traders fear could impinge on oil exports from the region, have been building since Iraq’s Kurds overwhelmingly backed independence in a Sept. 25 vote.

Later on Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to announce that he will not certify the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. The deal has to be re-certified every 90 days and is due for renewal on Sunday.

The step would give the U.S. Congress 60 days to decide whether to impose sanctions, but Iran’s parliament speaker told the TASS news agency that decertification would “be the end” of the deal and cause “global chaos”.

“U.S. sanctions could cut off a lot of Iranian oil trade finance,” Jeff Brown, president of energy consultancy FGE, told Reuters this week.

Despite the bullish signals, analysts warned that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries needed to extend its agreement to reduce oil output beyond its current March 2018 expiry date in order to clear stocks.

OPEC, with other producers including Russia, has agreed to production cuts of 1.8 million bpd.

“OPEC-led cuts have breathed new life into oil bulls but unless the organization digs deeper, the drawdown in global oil stockpiles will soon fizzle out,” broker PVM’s Stephen Brennock wrote.",Oil rallies on Chinese import boost and Mideast tensions,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-global-oil/oil-rallies-on-chinese-import-boost-and-mideast-tensions-idUKKBN1CI01L?il=0

The S&P 500 Bank Index has surged 12 percent since Sept. 8. That is not justified by the trajectory of earnings, as JPMorgan and Citigroup showed on Thursday with results that were no better than steady. Tax cuts would support higher stocks, but they’re at best some way off. In the meantime, banks have other concerns.

JPMorgan and Wells Fargo each trade around 50 percent above their book value. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are neck-and-neck at some 1.3 times book, while laggards Bank of America and Citi trade at par.

Using the rule of thumb that big banks need to deliver 10 percent returns for their shareholders, JPMorgan’s valuation means it ought soon to be cranking out a 15 percent return on book equity. Yet the bank run by Jamie Dimon will only hit an ROE of 13.6 percent by 2020, according to estimates collated by Thomson Reuters. Across the first three quarters of 2017, it managed only an annualized 11 percent.

If President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress succeed in cutting corporate tax rates to, say, 25 percent from the current 35 percent headline rate that could, in theory, boost any tax-paying U.S. company’s net profit by 15 percent – turning JPMorgan’s sub-14 percent return into one above 15 percent. It’s a similar story at Citi. An ROE of just over 7 percent so far this year increasing to an estimated 8.7 percent in 2020 could get near 10 percent with lower taxes.

The trouble is, that wouldn’t just require difficult tax legislation. It also needs banks to dodge problems elsewhere. Sluggish loan growth is one. That’s especially true for large banks, where lending has grown just 1 percent this year, compared with 6 percent at smaller banks, according to the Federal Reserve. JPMorgan managed a 3 percent increase in the year to September - though core loans grew faster. Citi’s loan book expanded by 2 percent.

Loan defaults are rising, too. Citi has already warned of higher losses in its U.S. credit-card unit. Even share buybacks, which reduce book equity and share count thereby increasing ROE and earnings per share, offer less bang for the buck: bank stocks are over a third more expensive than on the eve of last November’s U.S. election.

There may be no obvious calamity ahead. But there are enough obstacles to slow U.S. bank bulls down.",Breakingviews - Wall Street bank owners too optimistic on taxes,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-banks-breakingviews/breakingviews-wall-street-bank-owners-too-optimistic-on-taxes-idUSKBN1CH2RK

But the heart of European innovation isn’t a major metropolis –it’s a small city in the Dutch-speaking region of Flanders. That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ second annual ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science, invent new technologies, and help drive the global economy (Compare all 100 schools here).

REUTERS TOP 100

The most innovative university in Europe, for the second year running, is Belgium’s KU Leuven. This nearly 600-year-old institution was founded by Pope Martin V, but today it’s better known for technology than theology: KU Leuven maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet. In fiscal 2015, the university’s research spending exceeded €454 million, and its patent portfolio currently includes 586 active families, each one representing an invention protected in multiple countries.

How does a relatively small Catholic university out-innovate bigger, better-known institutions across Europe? KU Leuven earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than most other universities on the continent, and outside researchers frequently cite KU Leuven inventions in their own patent applications. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

The second most innovative university in Europe is Imperial College London, an institution whose researchers have been responsible for the discovery of penicillin, the development of holography and the invention of fiber optics. The third-place University of Cambridge has been associated with 91 Nobel Laureates during its 800-year history. And the fourth-place Technical University of Munich has spun off more than 800 companies since 1990, including a variety of high-tech startups in industries including renewable energy, semiconductors and nanotechnology.

Overall, the same countries that dominate European business and politics dominate the ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities. German universities account for 23 of the 100 institutions on the list, more than any other country, and the United Kingdom comes in second, tied with France, each with 17 institutions. But those three countries are also among the most populous and richest countries on the continent. Control for those factors, and it turns out that countries with much smaller populations and modest economies often outperform big ones.

The Republic of Ireland has only three schools on the entire list, but with a population of less than 5 million people, it can boast more top 100 innovative universities per capita than any other country in Europe. On the same per capita basis, the second most innovative country on the list is Denmark, followed by Belgium, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Germany, the United Kingdom and France rank in the middle of the pack, an indication that they may be underperforming compared with their smaller neighbors: On a per capita basis, none of those countries has half as many top 100 universities than Ireland.

Students walk out of a faculty building of Imperial College London, Britain, May 27, 2016. REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo

And the same trends hold true if you look at national economies. According to the International Monetary Fund, in 2016 Germany’s gross domestic product exceeded $3.49 trillion –11 times larger than Ireland at $307 billion, yet Germany has only 7 times as many top 100 innovative universities.

Some countries underperform even more drastically. Russia is Europe’s most populous country and has the region’s fifth largest economy, yet none of its universities count among the top 100. Other notable absences include any universities from Ukraine or Romania–a fact that reveals another divide between Western and Eastern Europe.

To compile the ranking of Europe’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included European universities, and then ranked them based on their performance.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and three universities that ranked in the top 100 in 2016 fell off the list entirely: the Netherland’s Eindhoven University of Technology, Germany’s University of Kiel, and the UK’s Queens University Belfast. All three universities filed fewer than 50 patents during the period examined for the ranking, and thus were eliminated from consideration. They’ve been replaced by three new entrants to the top 100: the University of Glasgow (#54), the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis (#94), and the Autonomous University of Madrid (#100).

The returning universities that made the biggest moves on the list were the Netherland’s Leiden University (up 21 spots to #17) and Germany’s Technical University of Berlin (up 21 spots to #41). Belgium’s Université Libre of Brussels (down 17 to #38) and the UK’s University of Leeds (down 17 to #73) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Generally, though, the list remained largely stable: Nine of the top ten schools of 2016 remained in the top 10 for 2017, and 17 of the top 20. This stability is understandable because something as large as university paper output and patent performance is unlikely to change quickly.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the continent: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

Liberals have a tricky task ahead, to address two different publics: one alarmed by hate speech and militant messages, the other by measures to stop them.","In a flurry of confident pronouncements within an hour of the massacre at a Las Vegas country music festival, conservative commentators and activists linked the perpetrator, Stephen Paddock, to liberal or Islamist influences. Rush Limbaugh, still the doyen of right-wing talk radio, credited Islamic State with being Paddock’s ideological home, arguing that it was disguised by the liberal media because “for the American left, there is no such thing as militant Islamic terrorism.” Pat Robertson, the socially conservative activist and televangelist, said the shooting stemmed from the news media’s and liberal protesters’ “profound disrespect for our president” and other institutions.

On the other side of the American culture war, a CBS vice president and legal counsel, Hayley Geftman-Gold, posted a Facebook comment that she was “not even sympathetic” to the victims because “country music fans often are Republican gun toters.” Unlike her right wing opposites, she suffered for her opinion: she was fired from what must have been a lawyer’s dream job.

Should any of these comments ­­­− the work of, at most, a few minutes when not that of a few seconds − be the concern of the state? They easily fall into the category of bad taste. Some remarks, especially Geftman-Gold’s sneeringly callous comment – for which she has since apologized – could cause further misery in those seeking to cope with the trauma of injury or loss of someone close to them.

The general opinion, especially in the United States, is that governments should stay out of it. For Washington, the anger such remarks may rouse and the distress they may cause must be endured in deference to the near-absolute right of free speech protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

But should we tolerate such verbal brutality? Can it not be “cured?” Do people have to suffer distress because of the voiced prejudices of others who often – as Limbaugh does – make a rich living from their display? There’s a growing faction saying no, and it has reached, at least in Europe, the stage of state action. The European Union Justice Commissioner, Vera Jourova has told the social media giants, such as Facebook and Twitter, that they must eliminate both hate speech and fake news, or face legislation criminalizing them for not doing so. That’s a sweeping statement: unpacking what it might mean in practice takes us deep into an area which should be marked with signs saying: “Danger! Free speech in Peril!”

Fake news is not the same as hate speech, but it can also be used to inflame social tensions. In Italy, the anti-trust chief Giovanni Petruzella has said that EU countries should create government-appointed bodies to remove fake news and even fine the media for violations. But how is fake news to be distinguished, by either artificial or human intelligence, from true news? It’s a delicate operation, since much news striving to be “true” contains false information, and much fake news has the ring of truth and would take careful investigation to disprove.

In Germany, a new law came into force this month criminalizing some digital platforms being used for hate speech. Called, challengingly, the Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz, NetzDG for short, it commands that Facebook and Twitter take down “blatantly illegal” hate speech within 24 hours or, if the offending material is less obviously illegal, in a week – on pain of a fine of up to 50 million euro ($58.6 million). The problem with it, critics claim, is that it is imprecise about what constitutes hate speech. It merely points to the passage in the German Criminal Code which declares the ""defamation of religions, religious and ideological associations"" illegal. What is defamation? When is one person’s unbearable insult another’s opinion?

Sticks and stones may break my bones/But words will never hurt me” has been a comfort of sorts to those who have been the victims of taunting and insult, but modern psychiatry claims it isn’t so. Lisa Feldman Barrett, professor of psychology at Northeastern University, in a careful parsing of what constitutes harmful speech, argues that “there is a difference between permitting a culture of casual brutality and entertaining an opinion you strongly oppose. The former is a danger to a civil society (and to our health); the latter is the lifeblood of democracy.” Speech of the first kind, which “bullies and torments,” is “from the perspective of our brain cells… literally a form of violence.”

Put that way, it appears obvious: the speech which harms should be criminalized, as much as a physical assault, and in parts of Europe it is being so. Facebook, Twitter and Google are now under increasing state and public pressure to clean up their sites, to stop posting material that causes more than distress but, apparently, real damage to the brain. Embattled UK Prime Minister Theresa May spoke out at the United Nations last month, calling on the tech companies to go much further and faster in combating the dangerous messages they carry.

At a background-only session with Google staff in London this past week, where these issues were broached, I was told that the concerns of governments and the public were registered, and reform was on the way.

When I quoted the view of Fiyaz Mughal, head of the anti-extremist British advocacy organization Faith Matters, that the companies with which he had been working are “not dealing with the problem” because their “bottom line is money,” I was met with an assurance that this was not so. The automatic default of the communications behemoths to absolutism in free speech has been replaced, it was said, by a finer-grained examination of cause and effect, and of what could reasonably be done to address concerns.

It’s true that to juggle the demands of free speech and those of security now constitutes one of the largest ethical and practical problems facing democratic states − and the tech corporations. And it’s also true that even if Mughal is right that the companies’ first care is the bottom line – for which corporation is that not true? – the large fines now being prepared for not heeding the call to reform would be a large incentive to change.

Yet in the course of this complex balancing act, between security and liberty, profit and regulation, there is the danger of substantial damage to the freedoms of speech and the news media which democracies have been able to safeguard for most of the post-World War Two period.

SMBC Nikko Securities said in a note to clients that investors in Kobe Steel face a prolonged period of uncertainty.","TOKYO (Reuters) - The cheating crisis engulfing Kobe Steel Ltd (5406.T) just got bigger.

Chief Executive Hiroya Kawasaki on Friday revealed that about 500 companies had received its falsely certified products, more than double its earlier count, confirming widespread wrongdoing at the steelmaker that has sent a chill along global supply chains.

The scale of the misconduct at Japan’s third-largest steelmaker pummeled its shares as investors, worried about the financial impact and legal fallout, wiped about $1.8 billion off its market value this week.

As the company revealed tampering of more products, the crisis has rippled through supply chains across the world in a body blow to Japan’s reputation as a high-quality manufacturing destination.

A contrite Kawasaki told a briefing the firm plans to pay customers’ costs for any affected products.

“There has been no specific requests, but we are prepared to shoulder such costs after consultations,” he said, adding the products with tampered documentation account for about 4 percent of the sales in the affected businesses.

Yoshihiko Katsukawa, a managing executive officer, told reporters that 500 companies were now known to be affected by the tampering.

Kobe Steel initially said 200 firms were affected when it admitted at the weekend it had falsified data about the quality of aluminum and copper products used in cars, aircraft, space rockets and defense equipment.

Asked if he plans to step down, Kawasaki said: “My biggest task right now is to help our customers make safety checks and to craft prevention measures.”

PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES

Boeing Co (BA.N), has some of the falsely certified products, a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters, while stressing that the world’s biggest maker of passenger jets does not consider the issue a safety problem.

More than 30 non-Japanese customers had been affected by the firm’s data fabrication, the Nikkei newspaper reported on Friday.

A Kobe Steel spokesman said the companies received its products but would not confirm they had any of the falsely certified components.

Nuclear power plant parts are the latest to join the list of affected equipment as Fukushima nuclear operator Tokyo Electric Power (9501.T) (Tepco) said on Friday it had taken delivery of pipes from Kobe Steel that were not checked properly.

The pipes were delivered to its Fukushima Daini station, located near the destroyed Fukushima Daiichi plant, but have not been used, Tepco said, adding it was checking all its facilities.

Faulty parts have also been found in Japan’s famous bullet trains that run at speeds as high as around 300 kilometers (180 miles) per hour and a space rocket that was launched in Japan earlier this week. One bullet train operator has already said it will seek compensation from Kobe Steel.

The government has ordered Kobe Steel to address safety concerns within about two weeks and report on how the misconduct occurred in a month.

CREDIBILITY ‘ZERO’

No safety issues have yet been identified in the unfolding imbroglio.

Kobe Steel shares fell nearly 9 percent on Friday and have fallen more than 40 percent since the scandal broke.

The steelmaker faces a range of legal risks, including compensation sought by clients or their customers, penalties for violating unfair competition laws for false representation, shareholder lawsuits for the fall in the company’s stock price and class lawsuits from overseas customers seeking punitive damages, a lawyer, specializing in corporate laws and risk management, said.

“It is hard to predict the extent of legal costs,” said Motokazu Endo, a lawyer at Tokyo Kasumigaseki law office.

“We cannot rule out the possibility that this will shake Kobe Steel to its foundation.”

The company has forecast a profit for the year through March 2018 after two successive annual losses.

Kobe Steel was founded in 1905 and has been a pillar of Japan’s manufacturing sector. Such are its establishment bona fides that Shinzo Abe, the prime minister and scion of a political dynasty, worked at the company decades ago, before entering politics.

But those credentials have been shattered, a point amplified by CEO Kawasaki who earlier said the credibility of the firm “has plunged to zero.”

Kobe Steel said it was examining possible data falsification going back 10 years - a familiar echo of a string of other cheating scandals involving Japan inc.

The corrosive business practices have raised broader questions over corporate governance in Japan, and cast doubt on the integrity of a manufacturing industry once the envy of the world.

Previous cases in Japan involving falsified data included Nissan Motor (7201.T), Mitsubishi Motors (7211.T) and Takata Corp., which filed for bankruptcy this year over faulty airbags that were blamed for 17 deaths and scores of injuries.

In 2015, it was revealed that Toyo Tire & Rubber (5105.T) fabricated data to secure government approval for materials to absorb shocks from earthquakes. Conglomerate Toshiba Corp (6502.T) is still battling the fallout of a scandal over reporting inflated profits.

SMBC Nikko Securities said in a note to clients that investors in Kobe Steel face a prolonged period of uncertainty.

Berlin (Reuters) - Viele betrachten das Atomabkommen mit dem Iran von 2015 als einen historischen Erfolg, doch US-Präsident Donald Trump hält es für eine Schande.

Am (heutigen) Freitag (18.45 Uhr MESZ) will er eine neue, härtere Iran-Strategie vorstellen. Dabei wird Trump vermutlich zwar nicht direkt den Ausstieg aus der Vereinbarung verkünden, dennoch könnte seine Rede der Anfang vom Ende des Atomabkommens sein. Die Konsequenzen dürften weit über den Iran hinausreichen: Eine Abkehr vom Atomabkommen würde die Glaubwürdigkeit der USA als internationaler Vertragspartner schwer erschüttern und eine Verhandlungslösung im Atomkonflikt mit Nordkorea fast unmöglich machen, warnen Experten. Was aber sind die Knackpunkte im Streit über das Atomabkommen mit dem Iran?

STEIGT TRUMP AUS DEM ATOMABKOMMEN AUS?

Der US-Präsident muss alle drei Monate darüber entscheiden, ob er die Vereinbarung erneut zertifiziert und sie damit bestätigt. Zwei Mal hat Trump dies bereits getan. Experten gehen aber davon aus, dass er die Zertifizierung dieses Mal verweigern wird. Dies bedeutet allerdings noch nicht unmittelbar die Aufkündigung des Abkommens durch die USA. Die Entscheidung darüber würde Trump dem Kongress aufbürden: Dieser müsste binnen 60 Tagen erklären, ob die nach der Atom-Einigung ausgesetzten Sanktionen gegen den Iran wieder inkraftgesetzt werden sollen. Vor zwei Jahren hatten vor allem die Republikaner Front gegen die Vereinbarung gemacht. Aktuell scheint es allerdings nicht so, als wolle sich der Kongress mit dem Thema befassen und einen Ausstieg der USA aus dem Abkommen vorantreiben. Damit bliebe die Vereinbarung zwar inkraft, hinge aber in der Schwebe.

WELCHE WEITEREN MASSNAHMEN KÖNNTE TRUMP ANKÜNDIGEN?

Es wird davon ausgegangen, dass Trump die iranischen Revolutionsgarden auf die Liste der Terrororganisationen setzt. Dies könnte massive wirtschaftliche Konsequenzen nach sich ziehen: Denn die Garden sind nicht nur der mächtigste Zweig der Sicherheitsbehörden in der Islamischen Republik, sondern ihnen untersteht auch ein gigantisches Unternehmens-Imperium. An der Mehrzahl der Firmen im Iran sind sie zumindest beteiligt. Banken, die in den USA Geschäfte machen, müssen nach US-Recht aber sicherstellen, dass ihre Kunden nicht auf einer Terrorliste stehen. Die Listung der Garden würde damit die wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit mit dem Iran deutlich erschweren. Bisher haben die USA zwar die Kuds-Brigaden als Eliteeinheit der Garden für Operationen im Ausland sowie einzelne mit den Garden verbundene Personen und Organisationen gelistet, aber nicht die Revolutionsgarden selbst.

WAS KRITISIEREN DIE USA AN DER VEREINBARUNG?

Fachleute auch innerhalb der US-Regierung bescheinigen dem Iran, alle Verpflichtungen zu erfüllen. Verteidigungsminister Jim Mattis plädierte offen für einen Verbleib im Abkommen. Trump wirft dem Iran dennoch vor, gegen den Geist der Atomvereinbarung zu verstoßen, die im übrigen nicht genügend tue, um dem Iran den Erwerb von Atmwaffen zu verwehren. Ein Großteil von Trumps Kritik richtet sich allerdings weniger gegen die Vereinbarung an sich als gegen andere Aktivitäten des Iran, etwa dessen Raketenprogramm und die Unterstützung von Extremistenorganisationen wie der Hisbollah. Möglich, dass der US-Präsident eigentlich ein verschärftes Sanktionsregime gegen die Iran erreichen will - oder die Drohung mit verschärften Sanktionen als Hebel einsetzen möchte, um das Atomabkommen nachzuverhandeln.

Experten halten diese Strategie für riskant und kontraproduktiv: Mit dem Atomabkommen sei ein wesentliches Problem der internationalen Gemeinschaft mit dem Iran angegangen worden, schreibt Dina Esfandiary vom King’s College in London. Natürlich gebe es auch andere berechtigte Vorwürfe gegen den Iran, um die man sich kümmern müsse. “Aber eine Dezertifizierung würde das Gegenteil erreichen: Es würde ein Thema wieder auf den Tisch bringen, das vor zwei Jahren bereits erledigt wurde, und einen Spalt zwischen die USA und ihre Verbündeten treiben, ohne dass die Regierung in Washington zusätzlichen Einfluss auf den Iran erhielte.” Klüger wäre es ihrer Einschätzung nach, an dem Abkommen festzuhalten und auf diesem Erfolg aufbauend auch über Fragen wie das Raketenprogramm zu verhandeln. Ohne die Atomvereinbarung dagegen sei der Dialog mit dem Iran tot.

WELCHE SANKTIONEN GELTEN AKTUELL GEGEN DEN IRAN?

Die wegen des Atomprogramms gegen den Iran verhängten Sanktionen wurden nach der Einigung 2015 weitgehend aufgehoben. Die Regierung in Washington hält allerdings einseitig noch einige Strafmaßnahmen wegen des iranischen Raketenprogramms und der Unterstützung von Terrorgruppen wie der Hisbollah aufrecht. Dies lässt internationale Banken im Umgang mit dem Iran vorsichtig agieren, was wiederum die wirtschaftliche Erholung des Landes bremst. Auch außerhalb der USA gelten weitere Strafmaßnahmen gegen den Iran, die unter anderem mit Verstößen des Landes gegen die Menschenrechte begründet werden: Es existiert ein Waffenembargo, daneben gibt es Finanzsanktionen mit Blick auf bestimmte Personen, Einrichtungen und Organisationen im Iran.

WIE KÖNNTEN DIE ÜBRIGEN VERTRAGSSTAATEN WEITERMACHEN?

Sollten die USA aus dem Abkommen aussteigen, würden sie sich damit gegen den erklärten Willen der übrigen Vertragspartner Deutschland, Frankreich, Großbritannien, Russland und China stellen. Diese hatten Trump beschworen, an der Vereinbarung festzuhalten. Das Abkommen nach einem Ausstieg der USA weiter umzusetzen, wäre kaum möglich: Sobald die USA die Sanktionen gegen den Iran wieder inkraftsetzen, wäre eine wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit mit dem Land praktisch nicht mehr machbar.

WIE WIRD DER IRAN REAGIEREN?

Für den Iran wäre es ein Schlag ins Gesicht, falls Trump das Abkommen nicht zertifiziert. Schließlich bescheinigt die Internationale Atomenergie-Behörde (IAEA) dem Land, alle Verpflichtungen der Vereinbarung zu erfüllen. Trump würde vor allem den iranischen Präsidenten Hassan Ruhani schwächen, der als relativ liberal gilt. Die Iraner hatten ihn in der Hoffnung gewählt, dass er die wirtschaftliche Lage in dem seit langem unter den Sanktionen leidenden Land verbessert. Kann er dieses Versprechen nicht wahrmachen, dürfte dies den Hardlinern neuen Auftrieb geben. Der iranische Rial hat wegen der Unsicherheit über die Zukunft des Abkommens bereits an Wert gegenüber dem Dollar verloren.

In a speech at the department’s Executive Office For Immigration Review, Sessions said too many immigrants were taking advantage of the rules, and urged Congress to pass legislation that could make it harder for asylum petitions to be granted.

Overhauling the U.S. asylum system was on a list of immigration proposals the White House sent Congress over the weekend that President Donald Trump wants in exchange for a legislative fix for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. Most of the principles, including a crackdown on the influx of Central American unaccompanied minors, are likely to be non-starters for Democrats.

Sessions did not announce any specific policy shifts in his speech but urged Congress to act.

“Congress must pass the legislative priorities President Trump announced this week, which included significant asylum reform, swift border returns, and enhanced interior enforcement,” he said.

He said there were “loopholes” in the law that allow immigrants, whom federal officials determine have a “credible fear” of returning to their home countries, to be released pending a hearing before a judge.

He also advocated for imposing and enforcing penalties for “baseless” asylum applications, elevating the threshold standard of proof in credible fear interviews, and expanding the ability to return asylum seekers to safe third countries.

After they pass their credible fear review, many people simply disappear and never show up at their immigration hearings, Sessions said.

He blamed the Obama administration for a policy shift in 2009 that allowed them to be released from custody, and said he believed many peoples’ credible fear claims were simply a “ruse to enter the country illegally.”

Human Rights First, a group that provides pro bono legal assistance to refugees, said the attorney general’s comments mischaracterized asylum seekers as “threats and frauds.”

The defeat of ultra-nationalist parties in the Netherlands and in France earlier this year gave European leaders the sense that fear of a far-right surge had, after all, been misplaced. As it turns out, it was the relief that was misplaced.

Europe remains a battleground between nationalist forces, conventional right or left governments and parties which cleave to broadly liberal positions. It is not alone. Across the world, the same impulses to define a state according to ethnic or historic criteria, or to put existing states “first,” grow in diverse forms.

Two referenda illuminate the trend. One, in the Kurdistan region of Iraq on Sept. 25, produced an almost 93 percent vote in favor of Kurdish independence, followed by an immediate demand from the Iraqi government to invalidate the vote and a threat to use the army to suppress any move to independence. On Sunday the citizens of the Catalonia region will vote on whether to secede from Spain – provided that the Spanish state, which has already arrested leaders of the referendum and confiscated voting materials, does not carry out threats to block all voting stations.

The tone in the democratic world is often set by the United States – no longer the champion of greater openness and cooperation, but now the promoter of America First. Work began earlier this week on prototypes for Donald Trump’s “beautiful” wall between Mexico and the United States; the president extended his travel ban to the citizens of three more states (Chad, North Korea and Venezuela) while dropping one, Somalia, from the list – this to align immigration “with his America First foreign policy vision.”

Europe, though, is the hub of nationalist struggles. In large part, this is because the nationalist politicians pit themselves against the continent’s large ambition to create a European Union which, in its enthusiasts’ view, should become a powerful, federal state through progressive integration – a perspective powerfully supported by the European Commission’s president, Jean-Claude Juncker in his “state of the Union” address earlier this month.

Immigration has been and remains the spur for the nationalists. Its growing unpopularity fills out their sails and brings them votes from all over the political compass, including a significant proportion from working class voters accustomed to voting left, even far left.

In Germany’s general election last weekend, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) soared to become the third-largest party in the Bundestag (parliament) behind the governing CDU/CSU center-right coalition and the center-left SPD, largely on strong opposition to immigration. One of the AfD leaders, Alexander Gauland, called Chancellor Angela Merkel’s opening of the borders to some one million migrants “a gift” to his party, which it gratefully accepted and used more successfully than even the party thought possible. Some commentators believe the shock to the German system – built for decades on a moderate consensus opposed to right-wing extremism of any kind – will “condemn Europe to permanent crisis.”

In Sweden, which has taken proportionately more migrants than any other European country over the past two years, crime, including shootings and riotous behavior, seems to have increased. The extent of that has been distorted by the right, but a careful analysis in the National Review does conclude that Sweden has “a growing problem with crime that is linked to immigration.”

The phenomenon was enough for the Migration Minister from neighboring Norway, Sylvi Listhaug – a member of the nationalist Progress Party, part of the governing coalition - to make a media-trailed visit to a Swedish “no-go area,” claiming during the visit that there are ""conditions of lawlessness and criminals in control"" in places with ""a large quantity of people with immigrant backgrounds."" The subtext was that this would not be permitted to happen in Norway. Her Swedish counterpart cancelled a scheduled meeting with her, saying her statement was “complete nonsense.""

In Central Europe, the Visegrad Group of states – the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia – have rejected requests from fellow members of the European Union to take in a quota of migrants. Earlier this week in Prague, I asked the leader of the ANO party, Andrej Babis, strongly favored to be prime minister after the October general election, what his policy toward the EU would be. He answered that he would demand a return of powers from Brussels to the national level, since the EU had no business dictating national policy – a popular view in the country. He has already made clear that he is wholly opposed to migrants being received in Europe.

In her speech on Brexit in Florence last week, UK Prime Minister Theresa May said that the British had “never felt entirely comfortable” in the EU. It’s probably a fair summation of a national mood; most British have always seen the EU as a transactional, rather than political, union. When a sizable part of the population came to believe that the EU is both incomprehensible and overbearing, Brexit resulted.

Across the English Channel, Emmanuel Macron has put himself at the head of a revived and fiercely proactive campaign to rouse the EU to continue its forward march. In a speech Tuesday, the French president proclaimed that “the only path that assures our future is the rebuilding of a Europe that is sovereign, united and democratic.” Integration – in defense, security and within the eurozone, had to be more profound, he said.

It was the vision in which one will not compromise with the nationalist forces – forces which will weaken Merkel, his strongest ally, as she tries to balance Germany’s contending forces rather than embrace his euro-optimism.

Brexit has had the headlines, and attracted the most derision from the EU enthusiasts. But nationalism – the wish to create, or to strengthen, the nation state against real or mythic enemies – remains a dominant current in the politics of the democratic countries.

Tens of thousands of Kurdish Peshmerga soldiers were already stationed in and around Kirkuk and another 6,000 have arrived since Thursday, Kosrat Rasul said, amid mounting tensions between the northern territory and Baghdad.

Iraq’s government has taken a series of measures to isolate the region since the Kurds’ Sept. 25 referendum on independence, including banning international flights from going there and pushing for a halt to its crude oil sales.

Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has repeatedly said he has no plans to go further and actually attack the territory.

But the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG)’s Security Council expressed alarm late on Thursday at what it said was a significant Iraqi military build-up south of Kirkuk, “including tanks, artillery, Humvees and mortars”.

“These forces are approximately 3 kilometers (1.9 miles) from Peshmerga forces. Intelligence shows intentions to take over nearby oil fields, airport and military base,” it said in a statement.

An Iraqi military spokesman said military movements near Kirkuk are meant to “inspect and secure” the nearby region of Hawija recaptured from Islamic State militants a week ago.

KRG authorities have repeatedly called for negotiations since the referendum, in which an overwhelming majority voted for independence. Baghdad has ruled out talks unless the KRG renounces the referendum results.

Kirkuk lies just outside the KRG autonomous territory but Peshmerga forces moved in when the Iraqi army collapsed in the face of an Islamic State onslaught in 2014, preventing the region’s oil fields from falling under jihadist control.

Germany, which has traditionally good ties with both Baghdad and the KRG, called for steps to ease the tensions.

“We would like to ask them to meet those responsibilities and not to escalate the conflict,” German government spokesman Steffen Seibert told reporters in Berlin.

Iraq’s tough line toward the Kurds has the support of neighbors Turkey and Iran, which strongly oppose the secessionist movement given their own sizable Kurdish minorities.

President Tayyip Erdogan’s spokesman said on Thursday Turkey would gradually close border crossings with northern Iraq in coordination with the central Iraqi government and Iran.

Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim is expected to visit Baghdad on Sunday to meet with Abadi.

Iraqi forces and Shi‘ite Muslim paramilitaries, known as Popular Mobilisation, are deployed south and west of Kirkuk, after having recaptured the areas from Islamic State (IS).

La capitalisation boursière du troisième sidérurgiste nippon a fondu de quelque 1,89 milliard de dollars cette semaine et son action a encore perdu 8,7% vendredi sur une Bourse de Tokyo qui a elle fini en hausse de 0,96%. L‘action a perdu plus de 40% depuis que le scandale a éclaté.

Kobe Steel avait annoncé dimanche avoir falsifié des données de contrôle qualité afin que ses produits à base d‘aluminium et de cuivre répondent aux cahiers des charges de ses clients de l‘automobile, de l‘aéronautique et de l‘espace et de la défense.

Il avait également admis mercredi la possibilité d‘une falsification des données sur ses produits à base de poudre de fer et a précisé qu‘il avait ouvert une enquête en interne à la suite des révélations de la presse.

Le scandale prend une telle ampleur que plusieurs grands groupes internationaux, notamment de l‘automobile et de l‘aéronautique, ont cru bon de réagir, d‘autant que le quotidien financier Nikkei écrit qu‘une trentaine de clients non japonais, dont Airbus et Daimler, sont affectés par cette affaire de fraude aux données.

Selon un responsable de Kobe Steel, le sidérurgiste a fourni des matériaux industriels douteux à quelque 500 entreprises de par le monde.

General Motors a dit jeudi qu‘il vérifiait si ses automobiles comportaient des pièces ou des composants fournis par le sidérurgiste japonais.

PSA et Daimler ont fait savoir que Kobe Steel ne figurait pas au nombre de leurs fournisseurs.

Airbus a déclaré qu‘il n‘achetait pas directement de pièces à Kobe Steel mais a ajouté qu‘il menait une enquête pour savoir si des fournisseurs étaient touchés.

En revanche, selon une source proche du dossier, Boeing a employé des produits du sidérurgiste dont la certification a été falsifiée.

Le constructeur aéronautique ne considère pas toutefois qu‘il y ait pour autant un problème de sécurité dans l‘immédiat mais il procède à une enquête sur ses produits et informera les compagnies aériennes clientes de ses conclusions, a ajouté la source.

Le secteur du nucléaire est également concerné. Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), le gestionnaire du site de Fukushima, a dit vendredi qu‘il avait pris livraison de tuyaux produits par Kobe Steel qui n‘avait pas été correctement vérifiés.

Les tuyaux ont été livrés à la centrale de Fukushima Daini, non loin de la centrale détruite Fukushima Daiichi, mais n‘ont pas été utilisés, a précisé Tepco, ajoutant qu‘il procédait à une inspection de tous ses sites.

Des pièces incorrectement certifiées ont également été détectées dans les TGV japonais et dans une fusée lancée par le Japon cette semaine. L‘un des opérateurs des Shinkansen a déjà fait savoir qu‘il réclamerait un dédommagement à Kobe Steel.

CRÉDIBILITÉ “RÉDUITE À NÉANT”

Le ministère japonais de l‘Economie, du Commerce et de l‘Industrie a donné deux semaines à Kobe Steel pour faire connaître les résultats des contrôles de sécurité et les raisons de ces falsifications, et un mois pour prendre des mesures afin que cela ne se renouvelle pas.

Le directeur général Hiroya Kawasaki a dit vendredi, lors d‘une conférence de presse, que son entreprise comptait dédommager les clients des coûts engendrés par le scandale, tout en ajoutant qu‘il n‘avait reçu aucune demande en ce sens pour le moment.

Il a précisé que les matériaux affectés par un certification truquée ou par l‘absence de vérification requise représentaient 4% environ du chiffre d‘affaires total de la division aluminium et cuivre.

Kobe Steel s‘expose à des poursuites aussi bien des autorités, que de ses clients ou encore des actionnaires qui pourraient lui reprocher la chute de l‘action qui a fait suite aux révélations.

“Difficile d‘anticiper l‘étendue des coûts juridiques”, a dit Motokazu Endo, avocat du cabinet Tokyo Kasumigaseki. “On ne peut exclure la possibilité que Kobe en soit ébranlé au plus profond”.

Kobe Steel, fondé en 1905, est l‘un des piliers du secteur industriel du Japon. Le Premier ministre Shinzo Abe avait travaillé dans cette entreprise avant de bifurquer vers la politique.

Mais son blason s‘est considérablement terni comme l‘a dit le directeur général Kawasaki pour qui la crédibilité de l‘entreprise “est réduite à néant”.

LONDON/VIENNA (Reuters) - With the ink barely dry on Lufthansa’s (LHAG.DE) deal to take over large parts of insolvent Air Berlin, the airline risks having its wings clipped by regulators and rivals concerned about unfair competition.

Lufthansa signed a 210 million euro ($248 million) deal on Thursday to take over Air Berlin units Niki and LG Walter, plus some short-haul planes, to cement its position in Germany and expand its Eurowings budget brand.

Austrian competition authorities said on Friday they believed Lufthansa, which also owns Austrian Airlines, would be too dominant in Vienna if it owned Austria-based Niki.

“We see an anti-competitive Lufthansa monopoly in Vienna on many routes after the takeover of Fly Niki,” the competition authority’s spokeswoman said. “We will voice our concern about the takeover at the European Commission.”

The German cartel office said it expected the European Commission to take a close look at the deal.

The European Commission had no comment, with a spokesman saying it had not yet been formally notified of the deal.

RIVALS COMPLAIN

The deal has also raised eyebrows with rival airlines. Ryanair (RYA.I) CEO Michael O‘Leary has called it a “stitch-up”, saying it would give Lufthansa a 95 percent share of the German domestic market. Ryanair said on Thursday it would take up its case with the EU.

Lufthansa has hit back at such claims, saying the deal would have to be examined not only from the point of view of the German market but Europe as a whole.

Lufthansa has said it has a market share of 34 percent on routes to and from Germany, while Air Berlin had 14 percent. With the takeover of parts of Air Berlin that will remain below 48 percent, which Lufthansa says is equivalent to Ryanair’s market share in Ireland.

Willie Walsh, CEO of British Airways parent IAG (ICAG.L), said on Friday he saw “significant” competition concerns with the deal, which will see Lufthansa taking on around 80 of Air Berlin’s 130 planes.

Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr said on Thursday he expected the deal would be approved by the end of the year.

A company source said Lufthansa was confident of getting approval, but expected there would be some remedies, as was the case when Lufthansa acquired Austrian Airlines and Swiss International Air Lines.

LONDON (Reuters) - For years the options market that companies and investors use to hedge against big swings in currencies viewed the euro as a bigger political and structural risk than Britain’s pound.

No more.

In the political and market turmoil immediately before and following Britain’s decision last June to leave the European Union, financial market investors flipped their long-held bias against the euro and now expect sterling to be the riskier party for years to come.

Reuters data going back to 2012 shows three- and five-year risk reversals -- the cost of taking out an option to buy or sell the pound -- have consistently been below zero.

That indicated it was almost always more expensive to hedge against the risk of euro exchange rates collapsing than of the same happening in sterling.

There are always blips. On a handful of occasions since Mario Draghi’s promise to do “whatever it takes” to prop up the euro in 2012, the single currency has briefly been valued as steadier for the long term.

But since an initial jump in the first six months of 2016, both three- and five-year euro-sterling risk reversal contracts have held consistently in positive territory, indicating the tail risk -- the risk of a low probability, high impact event -- is now instead with the pound.

That is the first time in Reuters’ historical data on the options market and means it will be increasingly costly for investors exposed to the pound’s exchange rate to insure portfolios against further slides.

With the pound pummelled by political and economic uncertainty, the euro/sterling five-year risk reversal on Thursday matched its highest in 11 months, showing an increased bias towards sterling weakness.

This followed open disagreement among Bank of England policymakers on the outlook for interest rates and, by extension, the pound.

On Tuesday BoE Governor Mark Carney said now was not the time to raise rates, warning of weak wage growth as Britain prepared to quit the EU.

On Wednesday, the central bank’s chief economist, Andy Haldane, said he was likely to join those voting for a hike later this year.

Bankers are cautious about predicting further steep falls in the pound, but some senior currency market players wonder what will happen to sterling if Brexit talks turn bad.

Some in the sales teams that focus on selling cheap option plays to hedge fund investors wanting to speculate on currency moves say the change is reflective of the broad swing in political risk.

“Risk reversals tend to price fear,” said the head of hedge fund sales with one of the big five international banks who run 40 percent of the $5 trillion a day global currency market.

“It is when you are thinking you are going to get a big gap move. And historically the gap move that was on people’s minds over the last five years was the euro break-up story. This signals a change in the potential tail risks.”

At a time when global measures of volatility are at rock bottom, those in sterling have jumped in the past fortnight, driven initially by a shock electoral turnaround that saw Prime Minister Theresa May deprived of her parliamentary majority.

Analysts say the move in the longer-term risk reversals, however, point to a broader questioning of faith in the pound.

“The market is willing to pay a higher premium to hedge against a large sterling depreciation,” said Sam Lynton-Brown, a strategist with BNP Paribas in London.

“That is a change.”","Forget euro zone breakup, sterling now deemed riskier",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-sterling-options-analysis/forget-euro-zone-breakup-sterling-now-deemed-riskier-idUSKBN19E0WV

(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) reported an 19 percent profit decline on Friday and weaker revenue than Wall Street had expected for the fourth consecutive quarter due to mortgage issues, sending its shares down 3.5 percent.

The third-largest U.S. lender, which has been embroiled in a prolonged scandal over its sales practices, said the dip in earnings came largely from a $1 billion accrual for a legal settlement over issues stemming from before the 2007-2009 financial crisis.

But revenue at the bank also suffered from a decline in mortgage banking revenue. Wells has been trying to bounce back from a scandal over dishonest sales practices that led to interrogations by U.S. Congress and fueled the ire of millions of consumers.

Wells Fargo’s earnings dropped to $4.6 billion during the third quarter. On an adjusted basis, its profit was $1.04 per share, scraping past estimates of $1.03, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Revenue fell 2 percent to $21.9 billion, hit by a 37 percent slump in mortgage banking. Analysts had forecast revenue of $22.4 billion.

Its shares fell 3.6 percent to $53.30 in early trading.

Wells Fargo’s operating efficiency ratio, which measures expenses as a portion of revenue, was 65.5 percent during the quarter and 63.1 percent year to date.

Expenses have been a key issue for investors, and the bank has targeted a full-year ratio of 60 percent to 61 percent in 2017, aiming to improve to 55 percent to 59 percent next year.

Wells is committed to its plan to cut costs by $4 billion by the end of 2019, half of which will be reinvested into businesses, Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said in a statement.

Net income in Wells Fargo’s community banking segment, the largest of its three major businesses and the one most directly impacted by the sales scandal, was $2.2 billion, down 31 percent from a year ago due to the legal charge.

GENEVA (Reuters) - West African migrants trying to reach Europe are dying in far greater numbers in the Sahara than in the Mediterranean but efforts to dissuade them may cause new routes to open up, the United Nations migration agency said on Thursday.

So far this year 2,569 migrant deaths have been recorded in the central Mediterranean, while more than 107,000 migrants, mainly West Africans, have reached Italy.

“One thing we still don’t have is any estimate of number of deaths in the desert,” Richard Danziger, the U.N. International Organization for Migration director for West and Central Africa, told a news conference in Geneva.

“We assume, and I think we have said before, that it has to be at least double those who die in the Mediterranean. But we really have no evidence of that, it’s just an assumption. We just don’t know.”

In Niger, a main transit route, people smugglers were increasingly scared of the authorities, which might make them more prone to abandon migrants in the desert, he said.

Many migrants had told of deaths in the desert, and some said the smugglers believed that if they drove fast through minefields they would be safe, said the IOM’s Niger mission chief, Giuseppe Loprete.

Migrant numbers heading through Niger have fallen dramatically after strong action by the government to close migrant “ghettoes” and arrest people smugglers, he said.

IOM was also trying to spread the word that “you do not want to get caught in Libya,” Danziger said.

“What happens in Libya is far scarier to people than dying, the horror stories that returnees come back with.”

Many of the smugglers did not see themselves as criminals, and were often former desert guides trying to make money. Many of them had given up, while organized criminals with contacts in Libya were continuing, Loprete said.

“Right now they are looking for alternative routes, I think at least equally dangerous,” he said.

“When you plug one hole, other holes are going to open up,” Danziger said.

Niger had two routes to Libya: one closer to Chad that was used to smuggle migrants and one closer to the Algerian border that was far more dangerous and was used by extremist groups and for drugs and gun-running.

An alternative was through northern Mali, a region beset by conflicts between rival groups, but but there did not seem to have been a dramatic rise there, Danziger said.

The route considered the safest was along the western coast of Africa, via Senegal, Mauritania and Morocco to the Strait of Gibraltar, and migrant flows there had increased, he said.",Migrant deaths in the Sahara likely twice Mediterranean toll: U.N.,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1CH25N-OZATP

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stock sectors that are particularly dependent on economic growth recently grabbed hold of the market’s rally and are poised to keep the reins should further signs of global expansion emerge.

Such sectors, including energy, industrials and financials, beat the S&P 500’s 1.9 percent gain in September. Those sectors had previously lagged behind the benchmark S&P .SPX, which has climbed 14 percent this year while feasting on a steady diet of record highs. Instead, shares of technology and healthcare companies, whose profits are more impervious to economic down cycles, have led 2017’s rally.

The question for equity investors is now: Was September just a catch-up period for the lagging, cyclical sectors, or can an economic lift support a sustained run?

“If it’s just a mean-reversion trade, then it’s probably going to last another few weeks and then we’re back to the old winners,” said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital Associates in Greenwood, South Carolina. “If it’s something more fundamental, it should be longer lasting than that.”

A test comes next week, as third-quarter corporate earnings season kicks into high gear. Reports from industrial conglomerates General Electric (GE.N) and Honeywell International (HON.N), railroads CSX Corp (CSX.O) and Kansas City Southern (KSU.N) and steel company Nucor Corp (NUE.N) stand to yield insight into the economy’s health.

September’s stock action, which also included outsized gains for small-cap stocks, had echoes of the immediate aftermath of President Donald Trump’s election in November 2016.

The same areas showed strength on hopes that a Republican-led federal government would push through an agenda, including tax cuts and deregulation, that juices economic growth. Those trades faded as Trump struggled to rack up any significant legislative wins.

Now, investors say, September’s stock rally for those groups again stemmed at least in part from policy hopes, as Trump revved up his tax-reform push.

“In many ways, we began to replicate the market performance following Trump’s election,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey.

But an improving economic picture in the United States and globally lends confidence for the cyclical sector rally.

The Citi economic surprise index for the United States .CESIUSD, a measure of economic data that can come in weaker or stronger than forecast, is around a five-month high, with the barometer trending higher since hitting multi-year lows this summer.

This week, the International Monetary Fund upgraded its global economic growth forecast for 2017 by 0.1 percentage point to 3.6 percent, and to 3.7 percent for 2018, from its April and July outlook, driven by a pickup in trade, investment, and consumer confidence.

The U.S. Commerce Department last month revised its estimate for second-quarter gross domestic product growth to 3.1 percent, up from 3 percent.

“We’ve just had better data,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis, who also points to indicators such as firming industrial commodity and oil prices and a rise in the Baltic Exchange’s main sea freight index .BADI.

“Those things are all kind of reflecting a realism of economic momentum, not just a one-off, Trump pie-in-the-sky expectation about policy change,” Paulsen said.

Bets seemed to build on the cyclical sectors in the first week of October, which saw flows into the largest sector exchange-traded funds for financials (XLF.P), industrials (XLI.P) and energy (XLE.P), and outflows for technology (XLK.P) and healthcare (XLV.P), according to Lipper data.

“There is some momentum developing in these underperforming sectors,” said Anthony Saglimbene, global market strategist at Ameriprise in Troy, Michigan.

Earnings results could sway that momentum. Technology, which has gained 29 percent this year, topping all sectors, is expected to post a 12.2 percent increase in third-quarter profits, more than twice the expected rise for cyclical groups such as industrials and materials.

Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis, said global growth ”hasn’t been strong enough for investors to feel comfortable that we will continue to see the earnings delivered by those companies in the way that tech and healthcare have consistently delivered stronger earnings.”

“For the cyclicals to continue to outperform, we have got to see signs that economic growth globally is accelerating, even compared to what we have seen so far this year,” Warne said.",Cyclical sector rally banks on global economic expansion,https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-stocks-weekahead/wall-street-weekahead-cyclical-sector-rally-banks-on-global-economic-expansion-idINKBN1CI1D5

Guardiola’s team, who host Stoke City on Saturday, rounded off their clean sweep in September with a hard fought 1-0 victory at defending champions Chelsea to take their total to 17 goals scored with none conceded during the month.

Kane got back on track the following weekend with another double as Tottenham ran out 3-2 winners at West Ham United before adding two more goals in their 4-0 demolition of promoted Huddersfield Town on Sept. 30.

Kwon, who was expected to take a bigger role following Lee’s arrest and the departures of other key executives in the wake of the bribery scandal, made the surprise announcement on Friday when Samsung also forecast record quarterly profit on the back of the memory chip business.

While Lee is unable to do much to minimize a leadership vacuum at one of the world’s biggest technology firms, the 49-year-old Samsung scion will get some solace that Samsung is chugging along without him.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices recorded their biggest increase in eight months in September as gasoline prices soared in the wake of hurricane-related production disruptions at oil refineries in the Gulf Coast area, but underlying inflation remained muted.

The mixed report from the Labor Department on Friday comes as Federal Reserve officials have been engaged in a vigorous debate on the inflation path and suggests a December interest rate increase is not a done deal.

As a result, the dollar fell against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S Treasuries rose. Stocks on Wall Street rose to record highs. Policymakers could, however, find solace from another report indicating that the economy was swiftly recovering from the damage inflicted by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, with a strong rebound in retail sales last month.

“The firmness in retail sales should override the enduring mystery of low inflation to spur a December Fed rate hike,” said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.

The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index increased 0.5 percent last month after advancing 0.4 percent in August. September’s rise was the biggest since January and pushed up the year-on-year gain in the CPI to 2.2 percent from 1.9 percent in August. The increase in the CPI was broadly in line with economists’ expectations.

Gasoline prices surged 13.1 percent last month, accounting for 75 percent of the rise in the CPI. The increase in gasoline prices was the largest since June 2009 and followed a 6.3 percent advance in August.

The Labor Department said Harvey was reported to have impacted refinery capacity in the Gulf Coast and was likely a factor in last month’s increase in gasoline prices.

Outside gasoline, price pressures were benign. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, consumer prices gained 0.1 percent in September as the increase in rental accommodation slowed and the cost of new motor vehicles and medical care declined.

The so-called core CPI rose 0.2 percent in August. In the 12 months through September, the core CPI increased 1.7 percent. The year-on-year core CPI has now increased by the same margin for five consecutive months.

INTENSE INFLATION DEBATE

The Fed tracks the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy. The core PCE has consistently undershot the U.S. central bank’s 2 percent target for more than five years. Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said that temporary factors such as one-off price cuts by wireless telephone companies are holding back inflation.

Minutes of the Fed’s Sept. 19-20 meeting published on Wednesday showed ”many participants expressed concern that

the low inflation readings this year might reflect not only

transitory factors, but also the influence of developments

that could prove more persistent.”

Last month, food prices rose 0.1 percent after a similar gain in August. Owners’ equivalent rent of primary residence rose 0.2 percent after advancing 0.3 percent in August. Prices for new motor vehicles fell 0.4 percent as manufacturers resort to deep discounting to eliminate an inventory overhang.

There were also decreases in the cost of medical care, apparel, and household furnishings. But the cost of mobile phone services rose 0.4 percent after 14 straight months of declines.

In a separate report on Friday, the Commerce Department said retail sales jumped 1.6 percent in September likely as reconstruction and clean-up efforts in areas devastated by Harvey and Irma boosted demand for building materials and motor vehicles.

Retail sales were also buoyed by a surge in receipts at service stations, which reflected higher gasoline prices. Last month’s increase in retail sales was the largest since March 2015. Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales increased 0.4 percent last month after being unchanged in August. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product.

The rebound in core retail sales suggests the drag on the economy from the hurricanes will probably be modest. Economists estimate the storms could subtract at least six-tenths of a percentage point from third-quarter GDP growth.

The economy grew at a 3.1 percent annualized rate in the April-June period.

“The sudden increase in retail demand is likely to cause third-quarter growth to come in somewhat better than expected before the hurricanes hit,” said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.

“But what Mother Nature may have given in the third quarter, she will likely take away in the fourth.”","Gasoline buoys U.S. consumer prices, underlying inflation tame",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-economy/gasoline-buoys-u-s-consumer-prices-underlying-inflation-tame-idUKKBN1CI1ST?il=0

If Spanish authorities hoped strong-arm tactics against the referendum independence for Catalonia would nip nationalist feeling in the bud, they will almost certainly be proved badly wrong. Sunday’s footage of violent police action against unarmed demonstrators may prove just the catalyst pro-independence groups wanted, handing Europe yet another crisis when it needed it least.

Ironically, the government of Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy would have done better to simply ignore the non-binding referendum. It was always likely to produce a vote for independence, if only because those who favored it were far more likely to vote. Broader opinion polls conducted before the weekend ballot never showed majority support for independence, and most estimates suggest it has been ebbing steadily since 2013 to around 40 percent.

The scale of the violence this weekend and the brutality of the national police attempts to stop the ballot – almost 900 injured, according to local authorities – has changed everything. While the referendum was expected to be a polarizing event, the Spanish authorities have now effectively guaranteed it will be seen as a defining moment not just for Catalonia but the country at large. It would be astounding if it did not yield a substantial spike in separatist feeling. In a single day, the Rajoy government may have taken what should have been a manageable issue and escalated it into an existential challenge for Spain.

Catalonia’s governor Carles Puigdemont could always have been hoping to declare independence in the aftermath of the ballot. The widely reported violence, however, delivers a degree of political legitimacy to that fact. That doesn’t mean Spain will necessarily fracture – but it does dramatically increase the chances of that happening in the longer run.

A Spanish break-up will have broad implications for a continent that has spent much of the last decade bouncing from crisis to crisis, but had been having a better year than many U.S. and British pundits had anticipated. French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel both bested far-right challenges in national elections, growth is improving in eurozone economies and the refugee crisis appears to have stabilized.

Events in Spain, however, are a stark reminder that almost every European country remains trapped in a slow-burning political crisis with an ever-growing chance of unusual, unorthodox and outright aggressive nationalist or radical politics eroding the center ground.

In France, the National Front is clearly poised to take advantage of the faltering popularity of Macron, who defeated far-right leader Marine LePen in May. In Germany, Alternative for Germany (AfD) came in a strong third in last week’s election, and is now in parliament for the first time. The festering sore of Brexit continues to raise a host of challenges for both the EU and Britain, while Greece, Italy and Spain continue to struggle economically despite strong broader European growth.

So far, European nations are struggling to work out what their position should be with Spain. For all the public criticism of what is clearly seen as an unnecessarily heavy-handed Spanish clampdown, few European leaders have been willing to criticize Rajoy in public. Behind closed doors, however, the message will almost certainly be that the weekend’s scenes cannot be repeated.

Spain is not the only European country with separatist regions, and that will certainly be little appetite for a wider upswing in the regional nationalism. Just as serious, however, is the way events in Spain reinvigorate the wider European narrative of crisis.

Already, the euro was trading slightly lower on Monday on the news. Russian broadcasters and social media feeds – always keen to jump on anything that undermines the European political mainstream – gave front-page coverage to the news of riot police using rubber bullets and batons to stop the Catalonia vote. Wider international attention can be expected to continue, potentially exacerbating political polarization at every step.

Rajoy’s government is in a tricky situation. It must realize that more heavy-handed use of law enforcement will simply strengthen the separatist cause. Unlike more authoritarian states, Spain does not have the option of bludgeoning dissent into the ground. But nor can it afford to ignore events in Catalonia, for fear the now-heightened momentum behind the pro-independence movement grows still further.

The most obvious solution would be to offer Catalonians more regional autonomy. So far, however, there are few signs of that – and Rajoy’s early statements praising the police response and denying that the referendum has any legal force look set to aggravate tensions rather than ameliorate them.",Commentary: Spain's missteps supercharge the Catalonia crisis,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apps-catalonia-commentary/commentary-spains-missteps-supercharge-the-catalonia-crisis-idUSKCN1C724O

Not all in the administration seem to agree with Trump’s harder-line approach on Iran. Defense Secretary James Mattis has publicly stated that Trump “should consider staying” in the deal, while Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has reportedly argued against decertification. Speaking after his first meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, Tillerson also seemed to indicate a willingness to take a longer-term view when he told a media conference that the Washington-Tehran relationship had “never had a stable, happy moment in it.” ”Is this going to be the way it is for the rest of our lives and our children’s lives and our grandchildren’s lives,” he asked.



Tillerson’s remarks evoked an encounter told to me by Mohsen Rafiqdoost, a former Iranian Revolutionary Guards Commander, of a 1982 meeting he had with Ayatollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic.

Rafiqdoost recalled suggesting that the U.S. embassy grounds in Tehran be converted to a Revolutionary Guards base. Ayatollah Khomeini rejected the idea, asking “Why would you go there? Are we not going to have relations with America for a thousand years?”

It’s clear that decades of estrangement have led to a fundamental misunderstanding of Iran in Washington. Notwithstanding the Obama administration’s nuclear negotiations, every U.S. administration since the 1979 Iranian revolution has failed in its declared objective to contain Iran.

If Trump wishes to free future generations of anxiety over U.S.-Iran tensions, he should pay careful attention to five points in formulating his Iran policy.

First, American officials need to stop speaking about Iran in threatening and insulting terms. The Iranian people are proud of their thousands of years of history and above all else view mutual respect as integral to their foreign relations. However, Foreign Minister Zarif told me that Trump’s speech to the United Nations General Assembly last month was the “most insulting speech of any American president toward Iran since the revolution” and that it “made any potential for dialogue with the United States meaningless.”

Second, U.S. regime-change policies have been self-defeating. The principal reason for lasting Iranian distrust of the United States since the revolution has been U.S. policies aimed at undermining and overturning the Iranian political system. In June, Tillerson openly declared that U.S. policy towards Iran included regime change -- a statement not heard from a senior U.S. official in years and which marked a sharp departure from conventional U.S. rhetoric of seeking Iranian “behavior” change.

In stark contrast, Barack Obama told the UN that “we are not seeking regime change and we respect the right of the Iranian people to access peaceful nuclear energy.” Consequently, he was able to diplomatically engage Iran on its nuclear program, and reach the July 2015 nuclear deal. The respectful letters exchanged between Obama and Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei helped set the process in motion. This would not happen today even if Trump made a similar overture, as the key to successful negotiations with Iran is to first drop regime-change policies.

Third, since the 1953 U.S.-led coup that overthrew democratically-elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddeq, Iranians have resented U.S. interference in Iran. The political landscape of conservatives, moderates, and reformists in Iran is in many ways similar to the competition between Democrats and Republicans in the United States. As such, any agreement between Washington and Tehran must be negotiated in a way that transcends the partisan divide in each country -- or else it would be inherently fragile. The challenges the nuclear deal has been subject to in Washington by the Republican Party is testament to this need. With respect to Iran too, negotiations must be carried out in a way that respects Iran’s political makeup and hierarchies.

Fourth, the Trump administration needs to accept that Iran, as a large country with immense natural resources and an educated population, has legitimate security concerns and interests in its neighborhood. Washington must recognize that U.S. policies aimed at isolating Tehran and refusing to accept a legitimate Iranian role in the region have only seen Iranian influence grow in countries such as Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and Lebanon while U.S. influence wanes in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and elsewhere. From Iran’s perspective, its post-1979 foreign policy has been driven by the aim of deterring foreign aggression and securing the country’s borders rather than the pursuit of regional hegemony. After the revolution, Iran was invaded by Saddam Hussein’s Iraq and, for much of the past decade, chaos on its thousands of miles of borders with Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan – all factors that have compelled it to play a regional role. If the United States wants to avoid scenarios where regional states aggressively compete for power it must encourage the creation of a regional security system involving the six Gulf Cooperation Council countries along with Iraq and Iran.

Finally, the record of U.S.-Iran negotiations shows that “dual track” policies of pressure and diplomacy are destined to fail. While Trump appears to be trying to bring Iran to the negotiating table in a position of weakness, Iranian policymakers tend to respond to pressure by retaliating in kind.

In a recent Washington Post op-ed, former Secretary of State John Kerry highlighted how by the time he entered into negotiations with Iran, after years of sanctions, Iran had “mastered the nuclear fuel cycle” and built a uranium stockpile large enough to make 10 to 12 bombs. “In other words, Iran was already a nuclear-threshold state,” wrote Kerry.

The lesson for Washington here is that if push comes to shove, Tehran will develop its own bargaining chips --- not capitulate in the face of whatever threats are made when Trump delivers his next policy speech on Iran.",Commentary: A former Iranian diplomat on what Trump needs to know about Iran,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mousavian-iran-commentary/commentary-a-former-iranian-diplomat-on-what-trump-needs-to-know-about-iran-idUSKBN1CE22K

(The Sports Xchange) - Addison Russell had two hits and four RBIs as the Chicago Cubs scored four runs off Max Scherzer in the fifth inning to beat the Washington Nationals 9-8 on Thursday in the fifth and deciding game of their National League Division Series.

The Nationals had a chance to tie the game in the eighth, but backup catcher Jose Lobaton, who entered the game for starter Matt Wieters, was picked off first for the last out.

The winning pitcher was Cubs reliever Brian Duesning (1-0), who recorded two outs without giving up a run. Chicago closer Wade Davis allowed one run but got the final seven outs for his third save of the series.

The Cubs advance to play the Dodgers on Saturday in Los Angeles in Game One of the NL Championship Series. Washington has lost in the first round of all four of its playoff showings since 2012.

The game featured 15 walks and three wild pitches.

Russell hit an RBI double in the sixth to give the Cubs an 8-4 lead. The Nationals scored two in the bottom of the sixth as Jayson Werth came home on a wild pitch and Daniel Murphy added an RBI double to make it 8-6.

The Cubs’ Kris Bryant drove in a run in the seventh on a fielder’s choice to make it 9-6. The Nationals challenged that Jon Jay’s slide into Murphy at second amounted to interference, but the call stood.

Bryce Harper drove in a run with a sacrifice fly in the seventh and Michael A. Taylor had an RBI hit in the eighth to make it 9-8.

Taylor also hit a three-run homer in the second inning. He drove in four runs for the second game in a row, as he hit a grand slam in Chicago on Wednesday.

Jay led off the game with a double that stood after a reply challenge. He went to third on a wild pitch and scored on a groundout by Anthony Rizzo.

The Nationals scored four in the second inning as Murphy led off with a homer, and later in the inning Taylor hit a three-run shot to left to make it 4-1.

In the third, the Cubs trimmed the lead to 4-3 as Russell drove in a run on a grounder, and another run scored on a wild pitch.

Chicago then scored four runs in the fifth off Washington ace Scherzer, who took over after Matt Albers threw a scoreless fourth.

Russell had a two-run double and scored on a throwing error by Wieters. Scherzer then hit Jay with a pitch with the bases loaded with two outs to make it 7-4.

SMBC Nikko Securities said in a note to clients that investors in Kobe Steel face a prolonged period of uncertainty.","TOKYO (Reuters) - The cheating crisis engulfing Kobe Steel Ltd (5406.T) just got bigger.

Chief Executive Hiroya Kawasaki on Friday revealed that about 500 companies had received its falsely certified products, more than double its earlier count, confirming widespread wrongdoing at the steelmaker that has sent a chill along global supply chains.

The scale of the misconduct at Japan’s third-largest steelmaker pummeled its shares as investors, worried about the financial impact and legal fallout, wiped about $1.8 billion off its market value this week.

As the company revealed tampering of more products, the crisis has rippled through supply chains across the world in a body blow to Japan’s reputation as a high-quality manufacturing destination.

A contrite Kawasaki told a briefing the firm plans to pay customers’ costs for any affected products.

“There has been no specific requests, but we are prepared to shoulder such costs after consultations,” he said, adding the products with tampered documentation account for about 4 percent of the sales in the affected businesses.

Yoshihiko Katsukawa, a managing executive officer, told reporters that 500 companies were now known to be affected by the tampering.

Kobe Steel initially said 200 firms were affected when it admitted at the weekend it had falsified data about the quality of aluminum and copper products used in cars, aircraft, space rockets and defense equipment.

Asked if he plans to step down, Kawasaki said: “My biggest task right now is to help our customers make safety checks and to craft prevention measures.”

PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES

Boeing Co (BA.N), has some of the falsely certified products, a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters, while stressing that the world’s biggest maker of passenger jets does not consider the issue a safety problem.

More than 30 non-Japanese customers had been affected by the firm’s data fabrication, the Nikkei newspaper reported on Friday.

A Kobe Steel spokesman said the companies received its products but would not confirm they had any of the falsely certified components.

Nuclear power plant parts are the latest to join the list of affected equipment as Fukushima nuclear operator Tokyo Electric Power (9501.T) (Tepco) said on Friday it had taken delivery of pipes from Kobe Steel that were not checked properly.

The pipes were delivered to its Fukushima Daini station, located near the destroyed Fukushima Daiichi plant, but have not been used, Tepco said, adding it was checking all its facilities.

Faulty parts have also been found in Japan’s famous bullet trains that run at speeds as high as around 300 kilometers (180 miles) per hour and a space rocket that was launched in Japan earlier this week. One bullet train operator has already said it will seek compensation from Kobe Steel.

The government has ordered Kobe Steel to address safety concerns within about two weeks and report on how the misconduct occurred in a month.

CREDIBILITY ‘ZERO’

No safety issues have yet been identified in the unfolding imbroglio.

Kobe Steel shares fell nearly 9 percent on Friday and have fallen more than 40 percent since the scandal broke.

The steelmaker faces a range of legal risks, including compensation sought by clients or their customers, penalties for violating unfair competition laws for false representation, shareholder lawsuits for the fall in the company’s stock price and class lawsuits from overseas customers seeking punitive damages, a lawyer, specializing in corporate laws and risk management, said.

“It is hard to predict the extent of legal costs,” said Motokazu Endo, a lawyer at Tokyo Kasumigaseki law office.

“We cannot rule out the possibility that this will shake Kobe Steel to its foundation.”

The company has forecast a profit for the year through March 2018 after two successive annual losses.

Kobe Steel was founded in 1905 and has been a pillar of Japan’s manufacturing sector. Such are its establishment bona fides that Shinzo Abe, the prime minister and scion of a political dynasty, worked at the company decades ago, before entering politics.

But those credentials have been shattered, a point amplified by CEO Kawasaki who earlier said the credibility of the firm “has plunged to zero.”

Kobe Steel said it was examining possible data falsification going back 10 years - a familiar echo of a string of other cheating scandals involving Japan inc.

The corrosive business practices have raised broader questions over corporate governance in Japan, and cast doubt on the integrity of a manufacturing industry once the envy of the world.

Previous cases in Japan involving falsified data included Nissan Motor (7201.T), Mitsubishi Motors (7211.T) and Takata Corp., which filed for bankruptcy this year over faulty airbags that were blamed for 17 deaths and scores of injuries.

In 2015, it was revealed that Toyo Tire & Rubber (5105.T) fabricated data to secure government approval for materials to absorb shocks from earthquakes. Conglomerate Toshiba Corp (6502.T) is still battling the fallout of a scandal over reporting inflated profits.

SMBC Nikko Securities said in a note to clients that investors in Kobe Steel face a prolonged period of uncertainty.

“It will likely continue to be extremely difficult to make judgments on creditworthiness and investment until the safety of the products and the extent of damages are clarified.”","As crisis at Kobe Steel deepens, CEO says cheating engulfs 500 firms",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-kobe-steel-scandal/as-crisis-at-kobe-steel-deepens-ceo-says-cheating-engulfs-500-firms-idUSKBN1CI097?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices recorded their biggest increase in eight months in September as gasoline prices soared in the wake of hurricane-related production disruptions at oil refineries in the Gulf Coast area, but underlying inflation remained muted.

The mixed report from the Labor Department on Friday comes as Federal Reserve officials have been engaged in a vigorous debate on the inflation path and suggests a December interest rate increase is not a done deal.

As a result, the dollar fell against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S Treasuries rose. Stocks on Wall Street rose to record highs. Policymakers could, however, find solace from another report indicating that the economy was swiftly recovering from the damage inflicted by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, with a strong rebound in retail sales last month.

“The firmness in retail sales should override the enduring mystery of low inflation to spur a December Fed rate hike,” said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.

The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index increased 0.5 percent last month after advancing 0.4 percent in August. September’s rise was the biggest since January and pushed up the year-on-year gain in the CPI to 2.2 percent from 1.9 percent in August. The increase in the CPI was broadly in line with economists’ expectations.

Gasoline prices surged 13.1 percent last month, accounting for 75 percent of the rise in the CPI. The increase in gasoline prices was the largest since June 2009 and followed a 6.3 percent advance in August.

The Labor Department said Harvey was reported to have impacted refinery capacity in the Gulf Coast and was likely a factor in last month’s increase in gasoline prices.

Outside gasoline, price pressures were benign. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, consumer prices gained 0.1 percent in September as the increase in rental accommodation slowed and the cost of new motor vehicles and medical care declined.

The so-called core CPI rose 0.2 percent in August. In the 12 months through September, the core CPI increased 1.7 percent. The year-on-year core CPI has now increased by the same margin for five consecutive months.

INTENSE INFLATION DEBATE

The Fed tracks the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy. The core PCE has consistently undershot the U.S. central bank’s 2 percent target for more than five years. Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said that temporary factors such as one-off price cuts by wireless telephone companies are holding back inflation.

Minutes of the Fed’s Sept. 19-20 meeting published on Wednesday showed ”many participants expressed concern that

the low inflation readings this year might reflect not only

transitory factors, but also the influence of developments

that could prove more persistent.”

Last month, food prices rose 0.1 percent after a similar gain in August. Owners’ equivalent rent of primary residence rose 0.2 percent after advancing 0.3 percent in August. Prices for new motor vehicles fell 0.4 percent as manufacturers resort to deep discounting to eliminate an inventory overhang.

There were also decreases in the cost of medical care, apparel, and household furnishings. But the cost of mobile phone services rose 0.4 percent after 14 straight months of declines.

In a separate report on Friday, the Commerce Department said retail sales jumped 1.6 percent in September likely as reconstruction and clean-up efforts in areas devastated by Harvey and Irma boosted demand for building materials and motor vehicles.

Retail sales were also buoyed by a surge in receipts at service stations, which reflected higher gasoline prices. Last month’s increase in retail sales was the largest since March 2015. Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales increased 0.4 percent last month after being unchanged in August. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product.

The rebound in core retail sales suggests the drag on the economy from the hurricanes will probably be modest. Economists estimate the storms could subtract at least six-tenths of a percentage point from third-quarter GDP growth.

The economy grew at a 3.1 percent annualized rate in the April-June period.

“The sudden increase in retail demand is likely to cause third-quarter growth to come in somewhat better than expected before the hurricanes hit,” said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.

“But what Mother Nature may have given in the third quarter, she will likely take away in the fourth.”","Gasoline buoys U.S. consumer prices, underlying inflation tame",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-inflation/gasoline-buoys-u-s-consumer-prices-underlying-inflation-tame-idUSKBN1CI1NZ

Macron's labor reforms will make it easier for French employers to hire and fire workers.
REUTERS/Stoyan NenovThough both Macron’s labor and economic reforms have won support from the center-right and from many economists, France remains doubtful, even hostile.
To put major emphasis on labor reforms may, in any case, not be the main point.
If France’s CGT and the left/far-right cannot mobilize enough opposition, the labor reforms will be implemented, and they could be part of a general renaissance of the French economy.","Protestors against President Emmanuel Macron’s proposed liberalization of French labor laws were on the streets of the country’s cities on Tuesday. The marchers, chanting slogans and brandishing placards, halted traffic as they moved slowly through the streets. A fringe of anarchists broke windows; police responded by firing tear gas. But this was no rerun of the mass marches of past years, let alone the semi-revolutionary eruptions of 1968.

France’s second-largest union, the Conféderation Générale du Travail (CGT) was the only one of the three main workers’ organizations that took part. Another protest, this one organized by the far-left France Insoumise (France Unbowed) party is scheduled for Sept. 23. This week’s marching columns numbered, nationwide, in the few hundred thousand rather than the many millions hoped for – the police claimed 223,000, the organizers 400,000. There was little effect on production, services or transport.

It was neither victory nor defeat for either side. Instead, Macron’s changes to the vast labor code – hiring and firing will be easier, some workplace issues will be negotiated at company level – hang in the balance. The CGT, the left and the far-right National Front all oppose them, but Macron and his government have a solid, if inexperienced, majority in the Assembly.

More than his predecessors who tried and failed to liberalize France’s labor market – the center-right Nicolas Sarkozy and the center-left Francois Hollande – Macron has pinned the credibility of his presidency on systemic, cultural change, a deliberate jolting of French society and economy out of the rut into which he believes it has fallen. He is contemptuous of both former presidents (he knew Hollande well, having been both his advisor and Finance Minister), believing them to have given up too soon and too easily. When Macron spoke, as he did earlier this month, of “slackers,” he said when challenged that he meant those who retreated from the necessary surgery on France’s body politic The marchers, however, seized on the word and put it on their placards: “Macron, the slackers will kick you out,” read one.

The slackers have a point. Indeed, they have several. Labor productivity in France is relatively good, only a little behind that of the United States and the highest of Europe’s major economies. When French workers work, they work well.

Though both Macron’s labor and economic reforms have won support from the center-right and from many economists, France remains doubtful, even hostile. Perhaps the best-known Frenchman in political and intellectual circles before Macron was the economist Thomas Piketty, whose “Capital in the 21st Century” (2013) is a best seller and who has excoriated his country both for its steeply rising inequality and its hypocrisy in pretending it is egalitarian. Hypocritical it may be, but it clings to the myth, and perfectly bourgeois Frenchmen and -women may recoil from an obvious widening of the income and wealth gaps.

To put major emphasis on labor reforms may, in any case, not be the main point. Germany liberalized its labor market through the so-called Hartz reforms between 2003 and 2005, but unlike France the German unions were relatively moderate, wage bargaining was already localized and investment was rising. In addition, the costs of German unification had already been paid.

If France’s CGT and the left/far-right cannot mobilize enough opposition, the labor reforms will be implemented, and they could be part of a general renaissance of the French economy. That is also dependent on other ifs – if the present improvement in the European Union economy continues (the European Commission, while underscoring that all members are growing, warns of “higher-than-usual uncertainty) and if investment increases, then France could become more like Germany. The German (and EU) leader Chancellor Angela Merkel wants to see that, and Macron wishes to show her he can deliver.

Yet delivery of this kind of economy now comes with an apparently unavoidable cost. Faster growth and even a fall in unemployment produces an ever-larger underclass, composed both of those with few qualifications and the still-increasing numbers of immigrants, often from poor countries. Macron’s opponents like to quote the Cambridge University economist Christopher Bickerton, who argued in a New York Times column that “not since the economic boom of the 1950s and ’60s has capitalism in Europe been dynamic enough to combine high levels of employment with long-term material gains for the masses.” It will not do so, he believes, under Macron.

The deeper movement, about which Macron can do little, is that the greater integration into the global economy that he champions produces huge gains for the top one percent, more modest rises for the well educated and skilled, but a much larger tail of the precarious, insecure and low paid. The leftist German think tank, the Rosa Luxemburg Institute, called this trend “the end of social capitalism.” A sign of this is the general decline of social democratic parties such as the once-mighty German Social Democrats and the shrunken French Socialists. Only in the UK has the main left party, Labour, made substantial political gains with a far-left leadership.

Social democracy depended on, and greatly furthered, “social capitalism.” It did so in France, under socialist governments, did so again in Germany and still does, though with difficulty, in the Scandinavian states. Organized labor had a place, even an honored and at times powerful one. Now, its gains are a hindrance, its ideology no longer attractive. The leaders of the further left – such as Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn in the UK and Jean-Luc Melenchon, leader of France Insoumise in France - gain by being fundamentalists, opposed to capitalism itself, social or not.

In moving France towards the globalist model, Macron echoes the claim made nearly four decades ago by British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, that there is no alternative. In this, he may be more right than she: there is presently no popular base, no public assent, no powerful parties able to show that cooperation with capitalism is best for the workers. And that, sooner or later, will be a large problem – for leftists, or course, for the state which must provide some support for the poor and ultimately, for the capitalist system itself.",Commentary: Labor reform in France’s Macron economy,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lloyd-macron-commentary/commentary-labor-reform-in-frances-macron-economy-idUSKCN1BQ2DJ

(The Sports Xchange) - Quarterback Carson Wentz threw three touchdown passes as the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the Carolina Panthers 28-23 in a match-up of NFC division leaders at Bank of America Stadium on Thursday.

Philadelphia (5-1) won its fourth game in a row and became the NFC’s first five-game winner as Wentz was 16-of-30 for 222 yards and no interceptions.

Late in the fourth quarter, the Panthers (4-2) needed to go 69 yards in 2:03 without a timeout. They reached the Philadelphia 48 before a failed fourth-and-one pass.

Trailing by five earlier, Carolina regained possession at its 23-yard line with 5:49 left. Courtesy of a fourth-down pickup, the Panthers reached the Philadelphia 41.

Three plays later, Jalen Mills intercepted Cam Newton’s pass with 3:06 to play, but the Eagles ended up punting again.

Philadelphia scored on two drives of less than 20 yards after Carolina turnovers, then drove 75 yards with Wentz throwing 24 yards to Nelson Agholor on the first play of the fourth quarter. The Eagles’ lead grew to 28-16.

The Panthers scored with 8:04 remaining on Newton’s one-yard pass to running back Christian McCaffrey.

Newton finished 28-of-52 for 239 yards with one touchdown pass and three interceptions.

Patrick Robinson’s interception of a pass that running back Jonathan Stewart dropped gave Philadelphia the ball at the Panthers 17-yard line less than a minute into the second half.

Two plays later, tight end Zach Ertz caught a 17-yard touchdown pass. A Carolina penalty on the extra-point kick resulted in the Eagles going for a two-point conversion, with LeGarrette Blount running in for an 18-10 lead.

A 20-yard field goal by Graham Gano less than three minutes later cut the Panthers’ deficit to 18-13. Jake Elliott’s 48-yard field goal boosted the lead to 21-13 before Gano’s 46-yard boot cut the gap to five points again.

The Panthers lost linebacker Luke Kuechly, a former NFL Defensive Player of the Year, in the second quarter. He was placed in the concussion protocol.

Newton ran 16 yards untouched for a touchdown, giving Carolina a 10-3 lead with 10:34 left in the second quarter.

Rasul Douglas’ interception of a pass that Newton threw while he was being hit set up the Eagles at the Carolina 12-yard line.

It took seven plays -- including a fourth-down conversion -- for Philadelphia to score, with Wentz hitting Ertz on a one-yard pass play.

Philadelphia outgained the Panthers 123-28 in the first quarter. The Eagles opened the scoring on Elliott’s 50-yard field goal. Gano tied it later in the first quarter with a 39-yarder.

The Eagles drove into Carolina territory on the game’s first possession, but were thwarted by Wentz’s fumble.

YOKKAICHI, Japan (Reuters) - Toshiba Corp said it is discussing joint investment in a new chip production line with Western Digital Corp - its estranged business partner after the Japanese firm chose a different suitor to buy its $18 billion semiconductor business.

After a long and highly contentious auction, Toshiba agreed last month to sell the prized chip unit to a consortium led by Bain Capital LP, overcoming a key hurdle as it scrambles for funds to cover billions of dollars in liabilities arising from its now bankrupt U.S. nuclear unit Westinghouse.

Western Digital, which became Toshiba’s chip venture partner with its acquisition of SanDisk last year, argues that any deal will need its consent and has sought an injunction with the International Court of Arbitration.

Given competition with Samsung Electronics Co, it is best to have amicable ties with Sandisk, Yasuo Naruke, the head of the flash memory chip unit told a news conference.

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks advanced for a fourth straight day on Friday on expectations of broad-based global growth, while the dollar was on course for its worst week in five as investors awaited U.S. inflation data.

MSCI’s world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up 0.1 percent after hitting record highs on Thursday.

Earlier in Asia, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan hit a 10-year high.

European shares rose to their highest level in nearly four months, helped by some well-received earnings updates. The pan-European STOXX600 rose 0.3 percent and was set for its fifth straight week of gains as were world stocks.

Germany’s DAX index was up 0.1 percent, just below an all-time high hit in the previous session, while Britain’s FTSE eased back 0.1 percent after a record close on Thursday.

Wall Street futures indicated a positive open for the S&P 500 index.

“We’re seeing positive economic news even in the midst of so called geopolitical risk, I think investors are generally more optimistic right now,” said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA, referring to strong corporate earnings.

“Earnings in the second quarter were very positive, and looking beyond the impact of hurricanes, it seems like there’s improved fundamentals in the U.S. and Europe.”

Emerging market stocks were buoyant too as another 0.2 percent rise set their latest 6-year peak.

In currencies, the dollar stayed on the defensive after minutes from the last U.S. Federal Reserve meeting showed policymakers remained divided on U.S. inflation prospects.

The index which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies was flat ahead of consumer price inflation data, due at 1230 GMT.

“Abating political risks in the U.S. and growing Fed rate hike bets have pushed the dollar higher in recent weeks,” Credit Agricole strategists said in a note.

“With a December rate hike almost fully priced in by now, however, investors are starting to focus on the Fed’s still cautious forward guidance and hence the limited scope for a further increase of the dollar’s rate advantage.”

NEW FED CHIEF

On top of the near-term inflation readings, investors are looking at whom U.S. President Donald Trump will nominate as successor to Fed Chair Janet Yellen, whose term expires next February.

White House Chief of Staff John Kelly said on Thursday that Trump was “some time away” from making a decision, while another official said Trump had met with Stanford University economist John Taylor -- of economics text book Taylor-rule fame -- to discuss the job.

Meanwhile, the euro was flat but still set for its biggest weekly rise in a month. [FRX/]

European Central Bank policymakers broadly agreed to extend asset purchases at a lower volume at their October policy meeting with views converging on a nine-month extension, sources at the central bank told Reuters.

Britain’s pound rose to a 10-day high, boosted by a report in Germany’s Handelsblatt newspaper that the European Union could offer Britain a two-year transitional Brexit deal. [GBP/]

The most eye-catching move, however, was from digital currency Bitcoin as it soared by as much as 7.4 percent after Thursday’s 13 percent gain, to hit a record high of $5,846. It is up more than 450 percent this year.

The chief financial officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co said the firm was open-minded about the future potential use of digital currencies, appearing to dial back comments last month from his boss, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, who said bitcoin was a “fraud”.

Among commodities, copper prices held firm after hitting a one-month high on Thursday as optimism over the demand outlook from major consumer China fuelled buying.

London copper futures were at $6,898.50 a tonne, up 0.2 percent on the day.

Oil prices also climbed after data showed both U.S. crude production and inventories had declined. Crude was set for its sixth weekly rise in the last seven weeks. U.S. crude jumped 2 percent to $51.59 a barrel. Brent crude rose 2.2 percent to $57.50 a barrel.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Amazon Studios chief Roy Price was put on an immediate leave of absence Thursday, the company said, following allegations that he harassed a producer and ignored an actress’s claim of a sexual assault by producer Harvey Weinstein.

The Hollywood Reporter on Thursday reported an allegation by Isa Hackett, a producer on one of Amazon.com Inc’s shows, that Price had lewdly propositioned her in 2015.

Amazon said in a statement: ”Roy Price is on leave of absence effective immediately. We are reviewing our options for the projects we have with The Weinstein Co.”

Hackett did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reuters could not independently confirm the allegation. Price could not immediately be reached independently by Reuters and he declined to comment to the Hollywood Reporter.

Price’s removal creates uncertainty about the studio’s direction when Amazon is investing more on video content than ever before - some $4.5 billion this year.

The studio’s Chief Operating Officer Albert Cheng will step in as the interim chief, Amazon said.

Hackett is the daughter of famed science fiction author Philip K. Dick, whose book “The Man in the High Castle” served as the basis for Amazon’s eponymous show.

Also on Thursday, actress Rose McGowan said on Twitter that she had told Price that she had been assaulted by Weinstein, who was forced out of his company this week following reports in the New Yorker and the New York Times that he had harassed and assaulted numerous women over the years. In tweets directed at Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, she criticized the company for doing business with the Weinstein Co.

A spokeswoman for Harvey Weinstein said: “Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein.”

Price has been integral to Amazon’s movie business, helping steer it through an attempt to crowd-source television scripts and garnering Hollywood awards for shows such as “Transparent.”

Amazon hopes original movies and TV shows will draw new people to join its streaming and shopping club Prime, and in turn buy more goods from the online retailer.

BLOEMFONTEIN, South Africa (Reuters) - South Africa’s Supreme Court of Appeal on Friday upheld a High Court ruling to reinstate hundreds of corruption charges filed against Jacob Zuma before he became president.

State prosecutors set aside the charges in April 2009, paving the way for Zuma -- who has faced and denied numerous corruption allegations made since then -- to run for president later that year.

Zuma and the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) were appealing against the High Court ruling, made in April 2016.

In his decision to reject their appeal, Judge Lorimer Leach said it was “irrational” for the NPA to have set the charges aside.

The NPA has responsibility for deciding whether to reinstate the charges, which relate to a 30 billion rand ($2 billion) government arms deal arranged in the late 1990s. It was unclear when such a decision might be taken.

It was also not immediately clear if Zuma would approach the Constitutional Court to try to set aside the Supreme Court’s ruling.

The NPA would need to consider the judgment, spokesman Luvuyo Mfaku said, adding it would “at all times do the right thing within the confines of the rule of law and in the interest of proper administration of justice.”

The rand extended gains against the dollar after the Supreme Court’s ruling, which was unanimous.

“It is difficult to understand why the present regime at the NPA (National Prosecuting Authority) considered that the decision to terminate the prosecution could be defended,” Judge Leach said.

The focus of the corruption allegations that Zuma has faced since taking office has been on leaked emails pointing to the Gupta family, business friends of the president, using their influence to secure lucrative state contracts for their companies.

While the White House’s distaste for the 2015 pact may be sweet to the ears of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his government is mindful of the limits of any unilateral U.S. action in the face of dissent from other big power signatories.

Some Israeli officials quietly question whether Washington has the will to follow through, noting what they deem insufficient U.S. efforts to stem the entrenchment in next-door Syria of Iran-allied forces helping Damascus in the civil war.

Trump was expected to say in a 1645 GMT speech that he will not re-certify the nuclear agreement in light of Iran’s ballistic missile projects and involvement in regional trouble-spots. That would give the U.S. Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions on Tehran that were suspended in return for it rolling back technologies with nuclear bomb-making potential.

Netanyahu spokesmen declined to comment on the pending speech. A veteran Israeli cabinet minister from Netanyahu’s Likud party sounded cheered by Trump’s resolve, but appeared to note the depth of partisan rifts around the U.S. administration.

“The outcome that could happen, and this is the only positive outcome we can see at this stage, is that Congress manages to come together around new, significant sanctions,” the minister, Tzachi Hanegbi, told Tel Aviv radio station 102 FM.

“(That) will confront a lot of gigantic international companies which are today streaming to the Iranians ... with a dilemma of having to choose between the Iranians and trading with the world’s biggest economy, which is the United States.”

“FIX IT OR NIX IT”

Netanyahu has lobbied hard against the Iran deal, delivering a speech in Congress shortly before it was signed that angered then-U.S. President Barack Obama.

Addressing the U.N. General Assembly last month, Netanyahu urged world powers that negotiated the deal to “fix it or nix it.” He called specifically for cancelling a core “sunset clause” that removes caps on Iran’s nuclear projects after a number of years.

Asked about the sunset clause in the radio interview, Hanegbi gave no indication Israel believed it would be reviewed. He noted the resistance that Trump’s new measures faced from European powers, Russia and Iran, which has threatened to quit the nuclear deal if the U.S. imposes new sanctions against it.

Iran, Hanegbi assessed, “will not yield at all - period - in other words, not just not within 60 days, but neither within 60 months or 60 years, because they really do not believe that the world will reverse course. They look rather mockingly at the United States.”

But he added, “If the United States reverses course and begins a process of building delegitimation for the agreement, it could be that the world, part of the West, will join it in a process that could take time ... There is still a long way to go until the dangers of this deal pass.”

Israel is believed to have the Middle East’s only nuclear arsenal with about 200 warheads and sees Iran’s nuclear activity as a threat to its existence. It refuses to confirm or deny that it has nuclear weapons.

There has been dissent within Israel over the nuclear deal, with several Netanyahu ex-advisers grudgingly coming out in its favour. His former defence minister, Ehud Barak, told the New York Times on Wednesday: “Like many Israelis, I think the Iran deal is a bad deal. But it is a done deal.”

Barak warned that any U.S. withdrawal from the agreement would not be followed by other world powers and could prompt Iran - which denies seeking nuclear weapons - to work on a bomb.

Hanegbi dismissed such predictions as “nonsense”.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Mitch Golden scrutinizes hedge fund managers and their investment ideas in a variety of settings from the back of a motor scooter in Ho Chi Minh City to a park bench in New York’s Central Park. The lieutenant of billionaire investor David Einhorn says it gives him the sort of perspective he can’t get from sitting in an office.

“This is a really hard job to do by just looking at the stuff that comes across your desk. You have to go out and find it,” the 45-year old portfolio manager told Reuters.

His approach is paying off. Golden, who runs an $800 million portfolio for Einhorn's $8.3 billion hedge fund firm Greenlight Capital, is producing some of the best numbers in the fund of funds industry and also, in the past two years, beating his boss.

Infographic ID: '2s8LJrm'

Greenlight Masters beat or matched the benchmark in 12 out of the last 15 years of its existence and its average annualized return of 7.7 percent through the end of 2016 handily exceeded Hedge Fund Research’s HFRI Fund of Funds Composite Index’s 3.3 percent return over the same period.

It is rare for a company to run a so-called fund of funds alongside a hedge fund. By doing so, the Greenlight Masters portfolio offers clients valuable access to star investors such as Einhorn plus those still unknown on Wall Street, says Steve Algert, managing director and assistant treasurer at The J. Paul Getty Trust, one of Golden’s clients.

Golden is known for the time he takes – sometimes years - and the lengths he will go to in researching potential managers. If he believes in their ideas he will wait for them to pay off - a rarity in an industry where skittish investors often pull out at the first sign of trouble.

He can afford to do that because a significant amount of the capital in the portfolio comes from Einhorn and his partners at Greenlight Capital.

“Mitch hustles hard to know who’s out there and to develop relationships with people even if Greenlight Masters isn’t ready to invest immediately,” said Firefly Value Partners partner Ariel Warszawski, whose fund has been in the Greenlight Masters’ portfolio for a decade.

To beat the market, a manager has to be contrarian, Golden says, but he is wary of big egos and is looking for a dose of humility in candidates.

“We look for people who have confidence in their work and can pick a fight with the markets,” Golden said. “It is a very subtle balance.”

Brian Shapiro, whose firm Simplify LLC performs due diligence on hedge funds for wealthy clients, values Golden for his cool-headed analysis. “For him, if it is not in the numbers, it is not real.”

The native New Yorker likes to go beyond the usual interactions between managers and would-be investors in conference rooms which he describes as a “Kabuki dance” in reference to a Japanese dance-drama that involves stylized expressions and melodramatic plots.

Sometimes that means accompanying fund managers on company visits to gauge how they interact with management.

Earlier this year, he zipped around Vietnam’s biggest city on the back of a scooter to visit a company that one of his managers was considering investing in. He declined to name the company.

PLAYGROUND CHATS

On Saturday mornings, Golden says he will sometimes sit in a playground in Central Park talking stocks with one of his portfolio managers as their children careen down the slides.

Unlike many other funds of funds, Greenlight Masters does not automatically sell if a portfolio fund falls by a certain amount or steadily declines over a longer period.

In 2015, for example, Golden stuck with energy-focused funds despite plunging oil prices and Greenlight Masters lost 8.4 percent that year. Those funds roared back in 2016, helping it gain 13.4 percent and beat the 9.4 percent returned by Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital and a flat performance by the average fund of funds.

He has 18 funds in the portfolio now, having exited three and added two last year. Thomas Hill’s $110 million PlusTick Partners and Nathaniel August’s $750 million Mangrove Partners, which invest in distressed energy assets, were Golden’s top performers in 2016 with gains of more than 50 percent each.

Golden acknowledges that the downside to the prolonged scrutiny is that sometimes promising fund managers will not wait and seek capital elsewhere or Greenlight Masters misses out on candidates’ early dramatic gains.

“That can be very costly,” he said, declining to name the opportunities he had missed.

Greenlight Masters is Einhorn’s brainchild, created in 2002, to uncover the next generations of stars and to give his partners a chance to diversify their holdings.

Golden joined it in 2012 as a co-portfolio manager after earlier stints as an analyst at two hedge funds and the manager of his own firm, and has run Greenlight Masters on his own since 2013.

After many months spent analyzing investments on his own, Golden brings promising candidates to a “D-meet” with Einhorn at Greenlight’s midtown Manhattan offices.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A new package of U.S. disaster assistance sailed through the House of Representatives on Thursday, despite President Donald Trump expressing impatience with having to devote federal resources for hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico’s recovery.

The Republican-controlled House voted 353-69 to approve $36.5 billion in emergency relief for Puerto Rico and other areas hit by recent disasters. Senate approval is expected in coming weeks.

Trump and his aides on Thursday suggested that there would be a limit to how much help Puerto Rico could expect from Washington to solve some of its longer-term problems, although Trump is expected to sign the latest emergency package.

The White House on Thursday evening issued a statement saying the Trump administration was “pleased” that the House had approved the relief funds and pledged to work with Congress going forward to provide resources to recover and rebuild.

Puerto Rico has been grappling with a bankruptcy crisis and owes $72 billion to creditors. Devastation from hurricanes Irma and Maria was exacerbated by dilapidated infrastructure, including a power grid largely destroyed by the storms.

In a morning tweet, Trump warned that the United States “cannot keep FEMA, the Military & the First Responders, who have been amazing (under the most difficult circumstances) in P.R. forever!”

FEMA is the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which oversees disaster response in the United States.

Presidential aides later on Thursday provided assurances that Washington will not abandon Puerto Rico, a Caribbean U.S. territory with a population of 3.4 million.

All 69 votes against the aid package came from Trump’s fellow Republicans. Congress is expected to consider additional aid in the coming weeks but the debate could grow more contentious.

House Speaker Paul Ryan is scheduled to lead a bipartisan congressional delegation to Puerto Rico on Friday.

DISASTER FATIGUE

Some conservatives displayed early signs of spending fatigue.

Republican Representative Tom Cole, a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee, said some lawmakers have urged him to find ways to offset the costs of disaster relief.

Besides the latest aid package, Congress last month approved $15.25 billion to help with earlier storm damages, including Hurricane Harvey’s impact in Texas, and wildfires.

“There is some concern about can we couple some of this (disaster aid) with reform measures,” Cole told Reuters on Wednesday. That could include savings to a national flood insurance program or other steps, he added.

Besides helping Puerto Rico recover from Maria, the bill would also provide funds for storm-struck areas of Florida, Texas and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and fire-ravaged California.

Cole said the price tag could rise as relief efforts transition from emergency response to rebuilding.

Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, which has a sizeable Puerto Rican community, told Reuters he had urged Trump to create a high-level task force to provide advice for rebuilding Puerto Rico, and that the president was receptive to the idea.

Much of Puerto Rico remains without electricity or running water three weeks after Maria’s landfall.

“They’re basically three weeks now living in the 19th century,” Rubio said.

White House Chief of Staff John Kelly told reporters the Trump administration would “stand with those American citizens in Puerto Rico until the job is done.”

But Trump’s top legislative aide warned against expecting Washington’s help for long-term infrastructure problems.

“The president is committed to helping to make sure that we do what is necessary to help to rebuild the island, but there are some elements that pre-existed the hurricane,” Marc Short said on CNN.

The House bill includes $18.7 billion for FEMA’s disaster relief fund. Of that, $4.9 billion is earmarked for loans to local governments to ensure Puerto Rico can keep government programs operating beyond Oct. 31.

Other funds include $576.5 million for wildfire control.

Some $16 billion would go to help the National Flood Insurance Program cover claims after reaching its borrowing limit.

In its statement, the White House said it urged Congress to adopt reforms to the program to ensure its “long-term financial viability.”

Democratic Representative Nydia Velazquez of New York, which has a large Puerto Rican community, chastised Trump.

“The president of the United States is tweeting out threats to withdraw assistance, that is an outrage, that is an insult,” Velazquez said.",U.S. House approves disaster funds as Trump criticizes Puerto Rico,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-congress/u-s-house-approves-disaster-funds-as-trump-criticizes-puerto-rico-idUSKBN1CH1A7

If there’s been one common thread running through almost every industry in the last decade, it has been how a handful of tech firms have revolutionized how the world does business. There’s Google for accessing information; Twitter for sharing opinion and news; Facebook for interacting with friends; Amazon for shopping, AirBnB for places to stay and Uber for getting around.

Until relatively recently, most consumers and governments took this as a positive trend. While there were disputes over individual and limited issues – not least the companies’ unwillingness to pay tax or comply with requests from local regulators – they usually were seen as good for the economy and job opportunities. With their slick lobbying and PR operations, the tech entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley were courted by politicians and civil society alike.

That is changing. The decision by London authorities to strip Uber of its license to operate in the British capital is part of a wider backlash in a rapidly escalating war between governments and the tech firms they believe have become too powerful and contemptuous of rules and democratic authority. Uber and its biggest rival Lyft were ejected from the Texas capital of Austin last year for refusing to fingerprint their drivers. In 2013 in San Francisco and Oakland, tech giants such as Google and Apple’s private employee buses, which were illegally using public bus stops, were blocked by protesters.

Other cities are clearly watching carefully. New York’s city regulators said Monday they were looking at their own probe into Uber, looking specifically at its impact on the city’s own yellow cab sector.

Political perceptions of these tech firms are changing too. After the so-called “Arab Spring,” many Western governments – and the Obama administration in particular – openly praised the tech firms as being a positive global influence, helping democratize the world.

That assumption unraveled as the same platforms later fueled the rise of far right parties in Europe and the Trump presidential campaign. Under Congressional pressure, Facebook voluntarily turned over details of 3,000 election-related ads that appeared to have been paid for by Russia-linked buyers.

Such scrutiny may only be the beginning. Increasingly, firms such as Facebook and Twitter are being blamed for seismic changes in Western political systems, accused of allowing themselves to be hijacked by automatic bots and hardliners to radicalize politics and often spread extremism.

Getting too close to tech firms now brings its own political dangers. U.S. think tanks that happily embraced funding from Google now find themselves criticized for it, accused of reining in any debate critical of the company and its counterparts.

Instead of spreading opportunity, such firms are increasingly blamed for killing jobs. Amazon’s success is at the heart of what trade analysts referred to as the “retail apocalypse,” the shutting of growing numbers of stores across the United States and beyond. Uber has proved toxic to more tightly controlled taxi industries. The drivers of London’s famous black cabs have been particularly hard hit, and their aggressive lobbying of politicians is seen as one of the key factors behind London mayor Sadiq Khan’s decision to suspend Uber’s operating license.

The decision proved immediately contentious. For all the criticisms of Uber – that it ignores regulators and the employment rights of those who drive for it, and that there have been reports of abuse and sexual assaults by drivers – it has slashed transport costs for its users. It has also provided opportunities – although without much in the way of job security – for hundreds of thousands around the world. An Uber-launched petition to reverse the London ban quickly notched up 600,000 signatures.

For the firms themselves, this is a familiar dynamic. Facebook, Google and Twitter in particular have been tangling with national governments since they began operating in relatively autocratic countries such as Russia, China and those in the Middle East, where those in authority have long felt threatened by the quick and easy access they offer to information. Sometimes, the tech companies have found themselves blocked outright.

Increasingly, the perception has become that many of these firms are simply willing to push their luck to see what they can get away with.

Technology firms do have a difficult balance to strike. Google, Apple and others have long made a virtue of protecting user data against what they see as overly intrusive requests for access by authorities. In some areas, the rights and wrongs are arguable. In others, however – such as the payment of tax – governments and campaigners believe the issues are much more clear-cut.

In many respects, Uber and AirBnB are seen amongst the most egregious examples of companies that have seriously and deliberately pushing the limits of what is strictly legal. While London’s already more stringent taxi regulation means Uber needs a license, in many other cities both it and its drivers operate outside the conventional taxi licensing system. AirBnB lets out rooms in cities that explicitly ban short-term rentals. Both have based their entire business model on working around, if not entirely flouting, pre-existing local regulations. Authorities often seemed to lack the ability, or the political will, to enforce the rules.

The London Uber decision is perhaps the most significant escalation in that war so far. It’s not that the firm will necessarily be ultimately banned from the streets, as it will continue to operate pending an appeal. The most likely scenario is that the firm and regulators reach a deal – although that could be a difficult process.

Early signs are that the firm is indeed willing to compromise. On Monday, its chief executive sent London authorities a contrite letter saying that the firm realized it had to change. Mayor Khan welcomed the statement, saying he favored talks to resolve the issue.

What Khan – a fast-rising star within the opposition Labour Party – has demonstrated, however, is that the firm can only operate if authorities allow it to do so. It is fundamentally replaceable – indeed, that have already been suggestions that a quickly-formed rival with better employment and safety practices might take its place. Something similar happened in Austin: although the Texas state government overruled the ban on Uber and Lyft in May, both companies now face more local competition.

Giant tech firms are unlikely to go away. But neither are national or local governments, democratically elected or otherwise. With a host of new technologies coming down the line – self-driving cars, automatic shops, artificial intelligence – many controlled by the same companies, these fights are only going to get bloodier.",Commentary: Uber’s London fight a sign of tech battles to come,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apps-uber-commentary/commentary-ubers-london-fight-a-sign-of-tech-battles-to-come-idUSKCN1C223I

Indian authorities last week withdrew the amendment to the Prevention of the Money Laundering Act (PMLA) that had made jewellers subject to anti-money laundering legislation.

Jewellers felt the PMLA required them to keep records of customers’ personal identification number or tax code for transactions above 50,000 rupees ($771), limiting gold sales by buyers hesitant to give the information.

LORDSTOWN, Ohio (Reuters) - Wall Street is fretting that the U.S. auto industry is heading for a downturn, but for thousands of workers at General Motors Co factories in the United States, the hard times are already here.

Matt Streb, 36, was one of 1,200 workers laid off on Jan. 20 - inauguration day for Republican U.S. President Donald Trump - when GM canceled the third shift at its Lordstown small-car factory here. Sales of the Chevrolet Cruze sedan, the only vehicle the plant makes, have nosedived as U.S. consumers switch to SUVs and pickup trucks.

Streb is looking for another job, but employers are wary because they assume he will quit whenever GM calls him back.

“I get it,” said Streb, who has a degree in communications, “but it’s frustrating.”

Layoffs at Lordstown and other auto plants point to a broader challenge for the economy in Midwestern manufacturing states and for the Trump administration.

The U.S. auto industry's boom from 2010 through last year was a major driver for manufacturing job creation. The fading of that boom threatens prospects for U.S. industrial output and job creation that were central to President Trump's victory in Ohio and other manufacturing states.

Infographic ID: '2smL7NQ'

“This is about economics, not what Trump says,” said Robert Morales, president of United Auto Workers (UAW) union Local 1714, which represents workers at GM’s stamping plant at Lordstown. “Even if Trump went out and bought 10,000 Cruzes a month, he wouldn’t get the third shift back here.”

Last week the Federal Reserve said U.S. factory output fell 0.4 percent in May, the second decline in three months, due partly to a 2-percent drop in motor vehicles and parts production.

Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, has compiled data from government sources that show the auto industry punching higher than its weight in job creation in recent years - accounting for between 60 percent and 80 percent of all U.S. manufacturing jobs added in 2015 and 2016.

In the first quarter of this year, the auto industry accounted for less than 2 percent of the 45,000 manufacturing jobs created.

“There’s no argument with the idea that auto has been pulling the manufacturing sled up the mountain for the last three or four years,” Muro said. “If you take auto out, you’re left with a very tepid outlook indeed.”

Long-term auto layoffs could threaten the economies of communities and states directly affected, although after decades of boom and bust, many communities in the auto manufacturing heartland have diversified.

In Ohio’s Mahoning Valley, which was battered by the collapse of the once-dominant steel industry, the boom in drilling for shale gas helps offset job cuts at auto plants.

Lordstown Mayor Arno Hill says the town salted away money during the boom to pay down its debts and new businesses are coming in, including a $900-million power plant being built in town that will burn cheap natural gas produced in the region.

GM makes up 40 percent of tax receipts versus 85 percent in the early 1990s, he said.

“GM is still the brightest star in the Mahoning Valley, but luckily we have diversified our economy,” Hill said. “There is pain for the laid-off workers, but it won’t hurt us as bad it used to.”

Lordstown’s workers have taken steps to blunt the impact of layoffs, with help from GM.

Matt Streb’s wife is due to start work soon after getting a degree, while he hopes to return to a former job as a mailman. In the meantime, GM gave advance notice of job cuts so he saved extra money and has drastically cut his spending.

""The auto industry is cyclical and has always had its ups and downs,"" Streb said. ""This is just another Lordstown downturn.""

STALLING SEDAN SALES

The decline in U.S. auto sales is still minor compared to the dramatic collapse during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, when demand for new vehicles plunged to its lowest levels in decades.

However, the days when auto assembly and parts plants throughout the Midwest were running flat-out because of high demand for nearly every type of vehicle are over. Recent sales trends show consumers becoming more selective, shunning older models and especially smaller cars.

For much of the boom that ran from 2010 through to a record year in 2016 of 17.55 million new vehicles sold, the share of cars has declined versus “light trucks” - or pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers.

After peaking at 51.32 percent of all sales in 2012, passenger cars fell to 40.4 percent of sales in 2016. That decline equates to the output of seven or eight vehicle assembly plants.

Through the first five months of this year, sedan sales fell 11 percent, even as the light truck category rose 4.7 percent.

To avoid profit-sapping discounts, and reverse a decline in prices of used vehicles, automakers are ordering more and deeper production cuts.

GM has laid off more than 5,000 workers so far this year - including 1,000 at its Fairfax plant in Kansas that makes the Chevrolet Malibu midsize sedan. GM has also laid off 1,100 workers at a plant in Lansing because it has ended production of the GMC Acadia SUV there.

More GM workers will be hit with temporary layoffs this summer. Lordstown will shut up shop for five weeks this summer, much longer than the usual two-week summer vacation closure.

Many laid-off GM workers are finding temporary employment at other facilities or taking permanent transfers to plants like its Arlington, Texas, facility where production of large sport utility vehicles continues unabated. However, those temporary postings require workers to relocate hundreds of miles from home.

Randy Freeman, president of UAW Local 652 which represents workers at GM’s Grand River plant in Lansing, Michigan, which makes sedans, says he has been pleased by GM’s efforts to rehire workers and relations with the automaker “are on an upward swing.”

The threats to U.S. workers building sedans are not likely to ease, barring a spike in the price of gasoline. Ford Motor Co signaled its long-term pessimism about small-car demand in the United States by announcing plans on Tuesday to shift production of its Focus compact car model to China. The Michigan plant that builds the Focus currently is expected to switch to building trucks and SUVs in 2018.

At GM’s Lordstown and Lansing Grand River plants, UAW representatives say they are focused on improving quality in the hope that GM will pick their plant when it’s time to find a location for producing a new truck or SUV.

At Lordstown, for instance, union officials tout the fact the plant has just won a quality award for local innovation on a part that helps the Cruz run better.

“We’re working hard to make the best product we can,” said Glenn Johnson, president of UAW Local 1112 at Lordstown, “so we can raise our hands and say to GM ‘look at what we can do.”

PARIS (Reuters) - Plane giants are preparing to squeeze the last drop out of a once raging torrent of airplane orders without the razzmatazz of recent years, as the aerospace industry heads to a belt-tightening Paris Airshow looking for new sources of revenue.

The June 19-25 gathering takes place against the backdrop of surprisingly strong airline traffic driven by economic growth, but a steep drop in the appetite for new planes following robust demand for the latest fuel-efficient models in recent years.

Instead, many firms will talk up efforts to extract new revenues out of powerful data-crunching services, while the first Paris display of a U.S. stealth jet in decades, the F-35, points to a defense recovery at the world’s largest air show.

The meeting also comes amid tensions in the Gulf over a transport and economic boycott of Qatar that is fuelling questions over the resilience of a major source of demand.

Dominating an otherwise thin slate of commercial orders will be a new version of Boeing’s (BA.N) most-sold airliner, the 737.

The 190-to-230-seat Boeing 737 MAX 10, designed to narrow a gap against European rival Airbus, will be launched on Monday with over 100 orders, two people familiar with the plans said.

Analysts said one unknown quantity is how many of the MAX 10 orders may merely be replacing previous orders for other variants as Boeing rejigs its medium-haul portfolio.

Low-cost giants Lion Air of Indonesia and Ireland’s Ryanair (RYA.I) have confirmed Reuters reports of interest in the new jet, though talks with Ryanair could take longer to complete.

CDB Aviation, the aircraft leasing arm of China Development Bank, is in talks to place orders with both Boeing and Airbus and could complete at least one of the deals by the show.

It may buy 40-50 Boeings, including about 5 MAX 10s, and a similar number of Airbus jets, two sources said.

Boeing is seen anxious to win backing of major operators for the new catch-up model and has also talked to United Airlines.

""I think you'll see some activity on this in Paris and that will start the process of seeing how airlines react to it,"" said Peter Barrett, chief executive of SMBC Aviation Capital.

‘DIFFERENT DYNAMIC’

Seeking to leapfrog Airbus (AIR.PA) after a mixed few years for the MAX series, Boeing will also give more details on a larger new mid-market jet employing a novel fuselage designed to try to capture projected growth in demand for 220-270 seaters.

But few expect a repeat of the more than 400 orders and commitments at last year’s Farnborough Airshow in Britain.

“I think it is going to be a relatively quiet air show compared to previous years,” said Robert Martin, chief executive of BOC Aviation.

Instead, some of the airlines that have become synonymous with air show hoopla in previous years, such as Malaysia’s AirAsia (AIRA.KL), may return to sign up for digital services to make their new fleets more efficient to operate and maintain.

Manufacturers are exploiting breakthroughs in data storage and other technologies to cut development times by a third while offering services like “predictive maintenance” to airlines, mimicking the post-sales success of their engine suppliers.

“We have 10,000 aircraft flying and we have to apply these technologies to these aircraft,” Airbus chief operating officer and planemaking president Fabrice Bregier said.

It will also be the first air show since China and Russia successfully flew new passenger jets in recent weeks, completing a series of debuts by new entrants that also include Japan.

Mitsubishi’s MRJ90 will appear in Paris for the first time.

While there is no immediate threat to Airbus and Boeing, delegates say the feeling is taking hold in boardrooms and governments that their duopoly cannot be taken for granted.

“There is a long road from first flight to certification and all that goes with it, but I think it will be a slightly different dynamic than we might have had in previous air shows where they were paper or theoretical airplanes and now we have real aircraft,” Barrett said of the would-be challengers.

In another turning point, it may be the last major air show for Airbus super-salesman John Leahy, who has said he will retire soon. He has presided over sales of over 10,000 planes.

With the New Yorker’s departure, the swagger and deliberate baiting of rivals at such shows may become a thing of the past, but the industry is unlikely to retreat from fierce competition.

The more muted tone, and cost-cutting to focus on production after years of strong sales, are reflected in the logistics.

The move came on the same day the South Korean smartphone maker forecast record third-quarter operating profit on the back of the memory chip business which Kwon was instrumental in building into the world leader.

“The timing is nonsensical. Samsung tipped record earnings, it’s going to be better in the fourth-quarter, and all that’s been driven by Kwon’s components business,” said Park Ju-gun, head of research firm CEO Score.

Kwon, 64, is seen as Samsung Group No. 2. As well as being chairman of the board and a board director, he heads the components business - including memory chips - and the display business.

In a statement, the man known as “Mr Chip” said the time had come to “start anew with new spirit and young leadership”.

“We are fortunately making record earnings right now, but this is the fruit of past decisions and investments; we are not able to even get close to finding new growth engines by reading future trends right now,” he added.

The world’s biggest maker of memory chips, smartphones and TVs is set to smash its annual profit record this year, thanks partly to soaring demand for memory chips. Semiconductors were Samsung’s top earner in the three months through June, making a record 8 trillion won ($7.20 billion).

The global chip industry is undergoing a major shift with Japan’s Toshiba Corp partnering with home rival SK Hynix, and other firms consolidating in search of new growth areas like artificial intelligence and automobiles.

Shares in Samsung, worth about $310 billion, fell 1.5 percent on Friday after hitting an all-time high earlier in the day.

CHANGING THE OLD GUARD

The departure of 32-year Samsung veteran Kwon after five years in the top job comes at a time of leadership uncertainty at the company.

Choi Gee-sung, Jay Lee’s mentor, quit earlier this year for his alleged role in the bribery scandal, and Samsung Electronics now needs to fill several more key roles with Kwon’s exit.

Kwon would serve out his term as chairman of the board and board director until March 2018, the company said. He is also not stepping down immediately from his two other roles.

A Samsung Electronics spokeswoman declined comment on the exact timing of succession and potential successors for Kwon’s roles.

While Samsung Group is South Korea’s top conglomerate with businesses ranging from smartphones to hotels - it has had no ‘Plan B’ for taking big decisions following Lee’s arrest, people familiar with the matter have said.

“I‘m worried about a leadership vacuum at a time when Lee is absent from management,” Chung Sun-sup, chief executive of research firm Chaebul.com, said following Kwon’s announcement.

The leadership changes also could be an opportunity for a new generation to emerge, he added.",Samsung Electronics CEO Kwon announces shock resignation as profits surge,https://www.reuters.com/article/samsung-elec-kwon/samsung-ceo-kwon-announces-shock-resignation-as-profits-surge-idINKBN1CI03R

SMBC Nikko Securities said in a note to clients that investors in Kobe Steel face a prolonged period of uncertainty.","TOKYO (Reuters) - The cheating crisis engulfing Kobe Steel Ltd (5406.T) just got bigger.

Chief Executive Hiroya Kawasaki on Friday revealed that about 500 companies had received its falsely certified products, more than double its earlier count, confirming widespread wrongdoing at the steelmaker that has sent a chill along global supply chains.

The scale of the misconduct at Japan’s third-largest steelmaker pummeled its shares as investors, worried about the financial impact and legal fallout, wiped about $1.8 billion off its market value this week.

As the company revealed tampering of more products, the crisis has rippled through supply chains across the world in a body blow to Japan’s reputation as a high-quality manufacturing destination.

A contrite Kawasaki told a briefing the firm plans to pay customers’ costs for any affected products.

“There has been no specific requests, but we are prepared to shoulder such costs after consultations,” he said, adding the products with tampered documentation account for about 4 percent of the sales in the affected businesses.

Yoshihiko Katsukawa, a managing executive officer, told reporters that 500 companies were now known to be affected by the tampering.

Kobe Steel initially said 200 firms were affected when it admitted at the weekend it had falsified data about the quality of aluminum and copper products used in cars, aircraft, space rockets and defense equipment.

Asked if he plans to step down, Kawasaki said: “My biggest task right now is to help our customers make safety checks and to craft prevention measures.”

PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES

Boeing Co (BA.N), has some of the falsely certified products, a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters, while stressing that the world’s biggest maker of passenger jets does not consider the issue a safety problem.

More than 30 non-Japanese customers had been affected by the firm’s data fabrication, the Nikkei newspaper reported on Friday.

A Kobe Steel spokesman said the companies received its products but would not confirm they had any of the falsely certified components.

Nuclear power plant parts are the latest to join the list of affected equipment as Fukushima nuclear operator Tokyo Electric Power (9501.T) (Tepco) said on Friday it had taken delivery of pipes from Kobe Steel that were not checked properly.

The pipes were delivered to its Fukushima Daini station, located near the destroyed Fukushima Daiichi plant, but have not been used, Tepco said, adding it was checking all its facilities.

Faulty parts have also been found in Japan’s famous bullet trains that run at speeds as high as around 300 kilometers (180 miles) per hour and a space rocket that was launched in Japan earlier this week. One bullet train operator has already said it will seek compensation from Kobe Steel.

The government has ordered Kobe Steel to address safety concerns within about two weeks and report on how the misconduct occurred in a month.

CREDIBILITY ‘ZERO’

No safety issues have yet been identified in the unfolding imbroglio.

Kobe Steel shares fell nearly 9 percent on Friday and have fallen more than 40 percent since the scandal broke.

The steelmaker faces a range of legal risks, including compensation sought by clients or their customers, penalties for violating unfair competition laws for false representation, shareholder lawsuits for the fall in the company’s stock price and class lawsuits from overseas customers seeking punitive damages, a lawyer, specializing in corporate laws and risk management, said.

“It is hard to predict the extent of legal costs,” said Motokazu Endo, a lawyer at Tokyo Kasumigaseki law office.

“We cannot rule out the possibility that this will shake Kobe Steel to its foundation.”

The company has forecast a profit for the year through March 2018 after two successive annual losses.

Kobe Steel was founded in 1905 and has been a pillar of Japan’s manufacturing sector. Such are its establishment bona fides that Shinzo Abe, the prime minister and scion of a political dynasty, worked at the company decades ago, before entering politics.

But those credentials have been shattered, a point amplified by CEO Kawasaki who earlier said the credibility of the firm “has plunged to zero.”

Kobe Steel said it was examining possible data falsification going back 10 years - a familiar echo of a string of other cheating scandals involving Japan inc.

The corrosive business practices have raised broader questions over corporate governance in Japan, and cast doubt on the integrity of a manufacturing industry once the envy of the world.

Previous cases in Japan involving falsified data included Nissan Motor (7201.T), Mitsubishi Motors (7211.T) and Takata Corp., which filed for bankruptcy this year over faulty airbags that were blamed for 17 deaths and scores of injuries.

In 2015, it was revealed that Toyo Tire & Rubber (5105.T) fabricated data to secure government approval for materials to absorb shocks from earthquakes. Conglomerate Toshiba Corp (6502.T) is still battling the fallout of a scandal over reporting inflated profits.

SMBC Nikko Securities said in a note to clients that investors in Kobe Steel face a prolonged period of uncertainty.

“It will likely continue to be extremely difficult to make judgments on creditworthiness and investment until the safety of the products and the extent of damages are clarified.”","As crisis at Kobe Steel deepens, CEO says cheating engulfs 500 firms",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kobe-steel-scandal/as-crisis-at-kobe-steel-deepens-ceo-says-cheating-engulfs-500-firms-idUSKBN1CI097

Aldermore, founded in 2009 by a former Barclays executive with backing from private equity firm AnaCap, said on Friday it had received an “indicative proposal” from South Africa’s biggest lender by value of 313 pence per share in cash.

“(The) Board of Aldermore has indicated to FirstRand that it is likely to recommend a firm offer at this (313 pence) level,” it said in a statement.

Britain’s challenger banks emerged after the financial crisis to fill a gap in small business lending and capitalise on problems at big banks such as Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds.

However, they have been seen as ripe for takeovers recently as a prolonged period of low interest rates and sluggish UK economic growth have squeezed earnings, while the pound’s fall has made them cheaper for foreign buyers.

FirstRand said Aldermore would help build a deposit base to fund and diversify its UK business.

At 1225 GMT, Aldermore’s shares were up 18.6 percent at 303.7 pence, their best day since listing in 2015. The proposed offer is a 22.2 percent premium to Thursday’s closing price. FirstRand’s shares were down 0.7 percent at 53.98 rands.

FirstRand has been looking to return to developed markets in recent months following a strategy revamp prompted by slowing growth and rising risks elsewhere in Africa, which was once at the heart of its expansion plans.

African markets have been depressed by a slump in oil and other commodity prices - export mainstays of many economies - leading companies from insurer MMI Holdings (MMIJ.J) to food maker Tiger Brands (TBSJ.J) to scale back operations.

Aldermore has been one of the better performing UK challenger banks, reporting a 32 percent rise in profit for the first half of the year, helped by strong demand from small- and medium-sized businesses, homeowners and landlords.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump will outline a tougher U.S. strategy for countering Iran on Friday that will seek to strengthen the enforcement of what he considers a flawed nuclear deal and deny funding for Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.

“It is time for the entire world to join us in demanding that Iran’s government end its pursuit of death and destruction,” Trump said in a White House statement that laid out key elements of the strategy.

Trump is to deliver a speech at 12:45 p.m. EDT (1645 GMT) to announce a confrontational new approach to U.S. policy toward Iran. In a big shift, he is expected to say he will not certify Iran’s compliance with a 2015 nuclear accord negotiated by world powers including Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama.

The new strategy will include three key goals: Fixing the nuclear deal to make it harder for Iran to develop a weapon, addressing its ballistic missile program and countering Iranian activities that Washington says contribute to instability in the Middle East.

Trump believes the nuclear deal as it is now structured will eventually allow Iran to develop a weapon and wants to toughen U.S. policy to prohibit that eventuality. Iran says its nuclear program is peaceful and denies it is developing nuclear weapons.

As the administration announced its plan for Iran, Republican Senators Bob Corker and Tom Cotton said they had developed legislation intended to address what they see as deficiencies in the Iran nuclear deal.

In a proposed legislative framework, they offered a plan to automatically reimpose sanctions if Iran’s nuclear program were to get to a point where Tehran could develop a nuclear weapon in less than one year, known as a “breakout” period.

They said their measure, if passed by Congress, would remain in force indefinitely, lead to tougher inspections and limit Iran’s centrifuge development.

It was unclear what chance the measure, expected to be offered as an amendment to the existing Iran nuclear review law, would have of winning enough support to be passed by both the House of Representatives and Senate.

The measure’s backers said their intention was to set conditions to halt Iran’s nuclear program and provide time “for diplomacy and pressure to work.”

Trump’s intent with his new strategy is to expand U.S. policy beyond just the nuclear agreement and take steps to address other Iranian behavior.

“The United States’ new Iran strategy focuses on neutralizing the government of Iran’s destabilizing influence and constraining its aggression, particularly its support for terrorism and militants,” the White House fact sheet said.

The White House statement said Trump would work to deny funding for the Iranian government, particular its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).

“We will rally the international community to condemn the IRGC’s gross violations of human rights and its unjust detention of American citizens and other foreigners on specious charges,” the White House said.

“Most importantly, we will deny the Iranian regime all paths to a nuclear weapon,” it said.","Trump to target Iran nuclear deal, Revolutionary Guard in speech",https://in.reuters.com/article/iran-nuclear-policy/trump-to-target-iran-nuclear-deal-revolutionary-guard-in-speech-idINKBN1CI10N

With Radar, BlackBerry enables customers to track trailers across country, and drivers can quickly locate vacant trailers scattered across vast parking lots.
On its last earnings call, the company named Trailer Wizards, a Canadian trailer rental and storage company with 25,000 trailers, as its third Radar customer.
Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.
“Its future earnings growth as a software company is only starting to be understood,” said Rivett.","BOLTON, Ontario (Reuters) - A visit to trucking firm Titanium Transportation helps explain why BlackBerry’s stock is once again a darling in Canadian markets, having soared 70 percent in two months.

Nestled in an industrial area some 50 kilometers north of Toronto, the trucker is an early adopter of a new BlackBerry fleet-tracking service known as Radar, which uses $400 boxes to collect and transmit information on movement, temperature and physical contents of Titanium’s 1,300 truck trailers.

Efficiency gains tied to Radar should allow Titanium to get maximum utilization of its fleet, positioning it to cut the number of trailers by five percent and also reduce labor costs, company executive Marilyn Daniel told Reuters.

“Time is everything in our world,” she said. “Being able to tell a driver where exactly a trailer is as opposed to having a driver search through a yard for sometimes hours has been a definite improvement.”

Radar is emblematic of BlackBerry Chief Executive John Chen’s strategy for turning around the Canadian icon, by steering the company away from consumer electronics and back to its roots of selling products to businesses.

Beyond Radar, BlackBerry is also betting on other types of software for industrial customers. It is leveraging its QNX subsidiary’s software foothold deep inside car infotainment consoles to expand into self-driving technology, while promoting its cyber-security software and services to thwart increased threats from hacking.

BlackBerry’s stock rallied after it showed signs of progress in quarterly earnings results at the end of March, followed by news in April of a nearly $1 billion cash windfall from arbitration with Qualcomm expected to fund future investments in growth. That comes in the face of an expected revenue decline to below $1 billion this year for the first time since 2004. At its smartphone peak, BlackBerry had annual sales of $20 billion.

Among the recent BlackBerry bulls are institutional investors such as Nokota Management, which took a new position with almost 4.8 million shares in the first quarter, and Oppenheimer Funds, which added 3.3 million more shares to its existing 4 million share stake, according to U.S. securities filings.

Iridian Asset Management and Connor, Clark & Lunn Investment Management, two of BlackBerry’s biggest shareholders, each raised their stakes by around a quarter as of the end of March.

Nokota did not respond to requests for comment, while the others all declined to discuss their stakes in BlackBerry.

“HOPE AND PROMISE”

The strategy is not without risks. BlackBerry faces challenges entering the telematics market, where analysts say rivals include Omnitracs, Teletrac Navman [VCRCPM.UL], Tomtom NV, Trimble Inc and U.S. telecommunications giant Verizon Communications Inc. Verizon last year paid some $2.4 billion to buy GPS vehicle tracking firm Fleetmatics Group Plc.

Radar “is not a unique and earth-shattering product,” said Nicholas Farhi, a partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants who advises companies on optimizing logistics operations.

That’s why some investors advise caution, saying it is too soon to figure out how to properly value the new BlackBerry offerings.

“It’s not the type of situation you can justify from a valuation standpoint,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management, which manages more than $1.5 billion and exited the stock a decade ago, when BlackBerry phones were still dominant. “It is all about hope and promise.”

Picture taken on June 7, 2017. REUTERS/Mark Blinch

And yet hope and promise among BlackBerry investors were hard to come by in the aftermath of Apple and Samsung walking away with the consumer hand-held phone business.

Since taking the company’s helm in 2013 to attempt a turnaround, Chen has turned to technology products used inside automobiles and corporate cyber security services, in addition to targeting the gritty trucking industry with Radar.

He also bolstered the company’s ability to manage rival devices in the workforce - still the single largest contributor to sales - with the purchase of rival Good Technology in 2015. And he outsourced production of handsets last year, meaning the company receives a cut from any devices sold by its partners rather than carrying the risk and revenue on its own books.

With Radar, BlackBerry enables customers to track trailers across country, and drivers can quickly locate vacant trailers scattered across vast parking lots. Previously, where drivers had to walk around those lots, banging on trailers in search of a hollow sound indicating it was empty.

BlackBerry charges $10 to $20 per month for every trailer connected to Radar, a product that an analyst at investment bank Macquarie says could play a pivotal role in a more than doubling of BlackBerry’s sales by 2020.

Sandeep Chennakeshu, president of the BlackBerry Technology Solutions unit that oversees Radar, told Reuters that large package delivery firms and big carriers of lumber and home goods are among the more than 50 companies testing it.

“It really depends on us convincing our customers to try our solution,” he said. “Once they try it, we’re very confident they’ll see the benefit.”

BlackBerry says that it is targeting some 16 million to 20 million trailers, chassis, vans, refrigerated units and piece of construction equipment for the Radar service, with a new variant on the hardware due to launch later this year.

On its last earnings call, the company named Trailer Wizards, a Canadian trailer rental and storage company with 25,000 trailers, as its third Radar customer.

AT&T will supply needed cellular connections for Radar in North America, and a second carrier is lined up to provide such services when it expands to Europe and Asia, Chennakeshu said.

The company expands Radar’s functionality with quarterly updates. The next one will tell customers if a trailer is a quarter, half or three-quarters full and improve integration with warehouse inventory management systems, he said.

The Radar boxes can send alerts when a trailer door is opened, its internal temperature goes beyond a set range, has been emptied or travels through a specific geography, features which Chennakeshu said are attractive for tightly-regulated movers including pharmaceutical companies.

Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.

Macquarie analyst Gus Papageorgiou is even more bullish, saying combined hardware sales and subscription fees could hit $540 million in fiscal 2020.

“The best is yet to come for BlackBerry,” said Paul Rivett, president of Fairfax Financial, the company’s second largest shareholder and owner of BlackBerry debt that can be converted into shares at $10 a piece in late 2020.

“Its future earnings growth as a software company is only starting to be understood,” said Rivett.",Born-again BlackBerry: Canadian icon hopes to ride trucks to growth,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blackberry-recovery/born-again-blackberry-canadian-icon-hopes-to-ride-trucks-to-growth-idUSKBN1901P1

Refining, petrochemicals and oil and gas exploration businesses, which account for over 90 percent of the company’s overall revenue and profit, delivered an 11.5 percent rise in quarterly revenue from operations to 717.61 billion rupees.

Gross refining margin, the profit earned on each barrel of crude processed, was $12.0 for the quarter, outperforming the benchmark Singapore complex margins by $3.7 per barrel.

On a consolidated basis, which also includes Reliance Industries’ U.S. shale gas, retail and other operations, profit came in at 81.09 billion rupees, the company said in a filing on Friday.

Its telecoms arm Jio Infocomm Ltd, which upended the telecoms industry with its free calls and cheaper data plans, posted a loss of 2.71 billion rupees.

Just a day after Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies severed transport links with Qatar over a diplomatic row, bans on Doha’s fleet using regional ports and anchorages threatened to halt some of its exports and disrupt those of liquefied natural gas (LNG).

Traders worried that Riyadh’s allies would refuse to accept LNG shipments from the Gulf state, and that Egypt might even bar tankers carrying Qatari cargoes from using the Suez Canal as they head to Europe and beyond - although Cairo is bound by an international agreement to let them use the waterway.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

U.S. President Donald Trump joined in the dispute on Tuesday, saying leaders he met on a Middle East trip had warned him that Doha was funding “radical ideology”. Qatar vehemently denies the accusations made against it.

Qatar is now unable to load crude oil onto supertankers together with other Gulf-based grades, and price agency S&P Global Platts said it would not automatically include the country in its Middle East price benchmark.

The agency noted that tankers usually combine Qatari shipments with crude from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Oman before heading from the Gulf. “Restrictions on vessels calling into Qatar and associated uncertainty could impact the inherent value of crude loading from Qatar,” it said.

More worryingly, food imports are affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies. Sources said the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already cut exports of white sugar to Qatar. Consumption is traditionally higher during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is currently being observed.

Qatar, which largely depends on food imports for its population of 2.5 million, has assured residents it has taken measures to assure that normal life continues.

However, Maersk (MAERSKb.CO), the world’s biggest container shipping line, said it can no longer transport goods in or out of Qatar.

Containers carrying food and other consumer goods are usually shipped to Qatar via the UAE port of Jebel Ali. A Maersk Line spokesman said: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

Shoppers packed stores in Doha on Monday to stock up. On Tuesday, fresh poultry and some types of milk were in short supply at two supermarkets visited by a Reuters reporter. However, plenty of fruit and vegetables remained on the shelves.

EXCLUSION ZONES

With exclusion zones sweeping into effect, vessels from Qatar are no longer able to dock in the UAE or Saudi Arabia as planned. According to shipping data on Thomson Reuters Eikon, around half a dozen oil, chemical and LNG tankers have had to leave UAE waters or have halted in the open ocean.

Bans on Qatar-linked oil and LNG vessels refueling at the UAE’s port of Fujairah have added to chaos, pushing shippers to find new refueling points at extra cost, industry sources said.

Lying near the Strait of Hormuz, through which ships pass on their way to customers in Asia, the United States or Europe, Fujairah is one of the world’s most important ports for the global energy market.

Qatar, the world’s biggest LNG seller, is moving to send a first batch of LNG tankers as far afield as Singapore and Gibraltar to refuel with Fujairah now off limits. Some trade sources said this could increase costs and delay deliveries to its clients globally.

The UAE’s ban also effectively halts deliveries of LNG produced in Qatar to the Gulf state, trade sources said. Royal Dutch Shell has a deal with the Dubai Supply Authority to deliver up to three LNG cargoes per month, typically sourced from Qatar.

“This shouldn’t affect the spot market though. Shell will simply need to go into its global portfolio and find LNG from elsewhere to send to Dubai. It’s a minor inconvenience,” one LNG trader said.

LNG traders are on high alert for signs of disruption through the Suez Canal. They are tracking the Al Ruwais LNG tanker, which is nearing the waterway and plans to become the first Qatari cargo to pass through since the row erupted.

Cairo has made no official statement. However, a Suez Canal Authority official said that under an international agreement, Cairo allows all ships to pass through except for those from countries at war with Egypt. The Suez Canal does not have the power to prevent Qatari ships from passing, the official added, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Any tanker barred from using the canal would have to sail around Africa, adding a month to shipping times. Such disruption could boost demand for Russian gas, just as Europe is trying to reduce its reliance on such supplies due to disputes with Moscow over its role in the Ukraine crisis.

Another test will be a batch of LNG shipments of Qatari origin being brought by commodity trader Trafigura to Egypt. These are due to arrive at the country’s Ain Sokhna port over the coming days and weeks, trade sources said.

Any sign that state-run importer Egyptian Natural Gas Holding would bar LNG of Qatari origin would probably push up spot prices sharply as middlemen seek alterative supplies.

Last year Qatar produced 60 percent of all LNG imported by Egypt, all of which was brought in by third-party traders such as Trafigura, Glencore and Vitol.

“The biggest impact will be if Egypt tries to restrict vessels coming through the canal or if they ban Qatari LNG from local ports,” a trading source said.

The rift has also hit aluminum exports from a Qatari plant part-owned by Norway’s Norsk Hydro (NHY.OL) as it has lost access to the Jebel Ali port, through which it typically runs exports operations.

Circumventing barriers to customers in Asia, Europe and the United States will take some time, the company said, showing how the diplomatic face-off is inflicting havoc on global supply chains.",Port bans choke Qatar's commodity trade as gas supply worries grow,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gulf-qatar-commodities/port-bans-choke-qatars-commodity-trade-as-gas-supply-worries-grow-idUSKBN18X1Y2

LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - Border controls inside what should normally be Europe’s cherished zone of free travel are here to stay for now, EU ministers said on Friday, citing continued terrorist threats and the need to control migration.

Germany, France, Austria, Sweden, Denmark and Norway told their Schengen zone peers they will extend until mid-May internal frontier checks first put in place in 2015 to counter unprecedented levels of migration and Islamist attacks.

At a meeting of European Union interior ministers in Luxembourg, Germany’s Thomas de Maiziere said Berlin was still committed to freedom of movement, “but at the moment we cannot do without checks.”

“The reason is the tense security situation in Europe with regards to international terrorism and the still inadequate protection of our external borders,” he said.

France, which imposed emergency border controls after Islamist attackers killed 130 people in Paris in November, 2015, also wants to keep them in place.

“The issues around terrorism are still extremely important for us,” French Interior Minister Gerard Colomb said. “France wants to extend border controls by six months.”

The other four countries announced the same move, citing “serious threat to public policy or internal security” before the authorization to impose the border checks expires next month.

Nearly all EU states consider the free-travel Schengen area as a major benefit of decades of European integration, and are keen to avoid disruptions to travel and trade.

But border checks have become the new reality over the last two years and the bloc is working on changing its laws to allow for the introduction of such measures more easily and for longer periods.","Border checks to stay in Europe weary of attacks, migration",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-europe-security-borders/border-checks-to-stay-in-europe-weary-of-attacks-migration-idUKKBN1CI1EV

Troops and attack helicopters opened fire on protesters calling for independence at rallies on Oct. 1, killing more than 20 people and escalating a long-simmering conflict with the Francophone-dominated central government.

A central government spokesman was not available for comment on Friday, but authorities have repeatedly denied that soldiers use disproportionate force against protesters.

English-speaking communities in the Northwest and Southwest regions say they suffer economic and social discrimination at the hands of the government of long-time leader President Paul Biya.

Amnesty said in a statement that hundreds of people have been arbitrarily detained since the protests in Buea, the capital of Southwest region, including as many as 100 as they walked to church the following week in the Mile 16 area of the city.

Some have been charged with secession, others with not possessing identity papers, destruction of public property or failing to respect an order by the governor banning protests and other public activities.

“This mass arrest of protesters, most of whom were acting peacefully, is not only a violation of human rights, but is also likely to be counter-productive,” said Ilaria Allegrozzi, Amnesty’s Lake Chad region researcher.

The protests have rallied opposition against Biya, who has ruled for the last 35 years, and given momentum to the more radical separatist activists, some of them armed, among Cameroon’s 5 million English speakers.

Amnesty also said local prisons have become overcrowded because of the mass arrests, and some wounded protesters have fled hospitals out of fear of arrest.

Demonstrations in the English-speaking regions began nearly a year ago when Anglophone lawyers and teachers protested against having to work in French, saying it showed the wider marginalization of the English-speaking minority.

Milhares foram às ruas na noite de quinta para comemorar o pacto firmado entre Fatah e Hamas no Cairo. Alto-falantes tocaram canções nacionalistas enquanto jovens dançavam e se abraçavam acenando com bandeiras palestinas e egípcias.

“Estou feliz, não, sou o mais feliz”, disse Ali Metwaly, engenheiro de computação de 30 anos, na manhã seguinte. “Mas ainda estou com medo de que acabe em uma decepção. Meus líderes me ensinaram que podem nos decepcionar com muita facilidade. Espero que não o façam desta vez”.

Conforme o acordo de reconciliação, o Hamas entregará o controle administrativo de Gaza, incluindo a passagem de fronteira de Rafah --que no passado foi a principal via de acesso dos dois milhões de palestinos do território ao mundo-- a um governo apoiado pelo partido majoritário Fatah.

Uma década atrás, forças do Hamas tomaram a Faixa de Gaza de forças do Fatah em uma guerra civil breve. Tentativas de mediação anteriores do Egito para reconciliar os dois rivais não proporcionaram resultados duradouros. A mais recente obteve o acordo ainda incerto depois de uma pressão econômica sobre o Hamas.

Analistas disseram que o pacto tem mais chance de vingar do que anteriores, dado o isolamento crescente do Hamas e o reconhecimento de quão difícil é administrar e reconstruir Gaza, cuja economia foi afetada por bloqueios na fronteira e que teve sua infraestrutura arrasada pelas guerras com Israel.

Para Huwaida al-Hadidi, uma mãe de sete filhos que tem 34 anos de idade, o alívio econômico é mais do que bem-vindo. Como cerca de 250 mil outros habitantes do território, seu marido está desempregado. Incapaz de pagar o aluguel, a família está morando em uma barraca desde que foi expulsa por seu locador três dias atrás.

Com o controle das passagens de fronteira de Gaza com Israel e o Egito, a Autoridade Palestina --que é dominada pelo Fatah e exerce um governo limitado na Cisjordânia ocupada-- pode permitir uma movimentação mais livre de pessoas e bens pela divisa.

Ainda segundo o acordo, cerca de 3 mil seguranças do Fatah devem se unir à força policial de Gaza, mas o Hamas continuará sendo a facção palestina armada mais poderosa com seus cerca de 25 mil militantes bem equipados.

Hamas e Fatah também estão debatendo uma data em potencial para eleições presidenciais e legislativas e reformas na Organização pela Libertação da Palestina, responsável pelos esforços de paz há muito estancados com Israel.",Acordo entre facções palestinas gera misto de alegria e cautela em Gaza,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idBRKBN1CI1RC-OBRTP

Puigdemont made a symbolic declaration of independence on Tuesday night, only to suspend it seconds later and call for negotiations with Madrid.

Spain’s Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has given him until Monday to clarify his position - and then until Thursday to change his mind if he insists on a split - threatening to suspend Catalonia’s autonomy if he chooses independence.

But far-left Catalan political group CUP called on Puigdemont to make an unequivocal declaration of independence in defiance of the deadlines.

“If (the central Madrid government) wants to continue to threaten and gag us, they should do it to the Republic that has already been claimed,” the party said.

The CUP only holds 10 seats in the 135-seat Catalan parliament. But Puigdemont’s minority government relies on its support to push through legislation and cannot win a majority vote in the regional parliament without its backing.

The wealthy region’s intention to break away after a referendum has plunged Spain into its worst political crisis since an attempted military coup in 1981 and could hurt economic growth targets for next year, the deputy prime minister said.

ECONOMIC RISK

“If there were no quick solution to this issue we should be forced to lower expectations of economic growth for the year 2018,” Soraya Sainz de Santamaria said on Friday.

Sources close to the Catalan government said Puigdemont and his team were working on an answer to Rajoy though they declined to say what line he would take.

The CUP statement echoes the position expressed late on Thursday by influential pro-independence civic group Asamblea Nacional Catalana which said: “Given the negative position of Spain toward dialogue, we ask the regional parliament to raise the suspension (on the declaration of independence).”

But the leader of Puigdemont’s party, Artur Mas, who served as the region’s president until 2016 and is still believed to influence key decisions, said on Friday declaring independence was not the only way forward.

“If a state proclaims itself independent and cannot act as such, it’s an independence that is merely aesthetic,” he told Catalan television TV3.

“The external factor must be taken into account in the decisions that will be made from now on,” he said.

The European Union, the United States and most other world powers have made it clear they wanted Catalonia to remain within Spain.

“If we allow Catalonia - and it is none of our business - to separate, others will do the same. I do not want that,” Jean Claude Juncker said in a speech at Luxembourg University.","Allies press Catalan leader to declare full independence, ignore Madrid deadlines",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-politics-catalonia/allies-press-catalan-leader-to-declare-full-independence-ignore-madrid-deadlines-idUSKBN1CI19X

Last June’s referendum result on Brexit was close – 52 percent voted for Britain to leave the European Union; 48 percent to stay – but indisputable. Unlike in the U.S., no one believes that Russia altered the outcome. And this was a vote not to “drain the swamp” of Westminster, but to strengthen it. As Gisela Stuart, one of the few Labour MPs who campaigned enthusiastically for Brexit as the head of the “Vote Leave” campaign put it, the electors “wanted to restore genuine democratic government and take back control of the laws that govern them.”

Brexit is what happened when people were given a voice. No doubt that many who voted for it were uninformed; some were voting for a better yesterday; many were fearful of the effects of mass immigration – especially of Muslims. A few Britons didn’t want any foreigners at all. But above all, they wanted to “take back control,” and believed that political power should reside in the British parliament – which is comprehensible in its workings and dignified by centuries of existence – rather than in a series of institutions in Brussels, confusing in their overlapping and largely mysterious operations.

No matter that those with more sophisticated views of governance saw the desire as foolish: “an attempt to create a romantic idea of what Britain could be like out of the EU,” said the Liverpool University political scientist Andrew Crines. The majority wanted politics to be at least within their understanding, their representatives – liked or loathed – familiar.

It is this view that has rumbled along beneath the surface for most of the 44 years in which Britain has been a member of the European Union; it is what Prime Minster Theresa May meant in her Brexit speech to politicians in Florence on Friday, when she said that the EU “never felt to us like an integral part of our national story.”

That feeling was quiescent at times, especially during the 13 years of a Labour government, from 1997 to 2010, fevered at others. It was most turbulent during Conservative administrations: the last three Conservative Prime Ministers – Margaret Thatcher (1979-1990) John Major (1990-1997) and David Cameron (2010-2016) all lost power because they were fatally weakened by the internal argument on Europe within their party. No one gives Theresa May much hope of avoiding the Brussels curse which has wreaked so much damage on her predecessors.

The British prime minister is seen as someone clinging on to power, at the mercy of fellow ministers who could, at any time, bring her down. The most ambitious of these, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, has revealed his desire to lead his country most clearly. In an article in the Telegraph, he lauded the UK in the most elevated rhetoric employed in the Brexit cause, largely devoid of his trademark jests, expressing a bounding belief that “we can become the greatest country on earth.”

Giving only the briefest mention to his prime minister, he took over 4000 words to make the vision of a liberated Britain his own, striking a Churchillian pose with “I do not underestimate the scale of the task ahead as we take back control of our destiny” – the kind of rhetoric wholly absent from May’s cautious, if more precise, speeches.

Her Florence speech, clearly something of a compromise between her cabinet factions, vague on many details, nevertheless laid down a process, if not a destination: honoring commitments (that is, probably a 20 billion GBP – about $27 billion – payment to the EU), adopting new laws to protect the existing rights of European citizens living in the UK and passing through a two-year transition to give both sides, especially the UK, time to adjust to a customized relationship not based on the trade pacts which other, non-EU countries, have with the EU.

May’s all-but-impossible job is – as she interprets it – to keep a party and a cabinet with many Remainers in it relatively united, and to retain at least the acquiescence of the senior diplomats and civil servants, of the Bank of England and the main institutions of state, many – probably most – of whom believe Brexit to be most grievously self-wounding, consigning Britain not to greatness but to marginality.

Speaking in Washington earlier this week, Mark Carney, the Canadian who leads the Bank of England, warned of higher inflation, interest rate rises and slower growth, and forecast that Britain – unlike the other advanced countries – would be “an example of deglobalization, not globalization.”

The former close aide to the prime minister, Nick Timothy – whom May was told to fire after nearly losing the election in June – wrote ahead of May’s Florence speech that Chancellor Philip Hammond, was “maneuvering” towards a partial Brexit, failing to promote its advantages and, in his behind-the-scenes arguments with Boris Johnson, playing “games” with the future of the country.

These “maneuvers,” and many more at every level of government, are deployed around the office of an embattled prime minister who, with a relatively modest personality (for a senior politician), has no powerful public presence with which to offset the impression of barely-controlled chaos. Meanwhile, every institution at home and abroad affected by Brexit – there are many – call loudly and daily for a certainty at which the government has not yet arrived, and an easy transition which it cannot guarantee.

In a much-discussed book, “The Road to Somewhere”, the journalist David Goodhart (disclosure: a former Financial Times colleague, and a friend, of this columnist) sees in British society a widening split. On one side there are those who are anywhere people: at home in a globalizing world, with liberal views, enthusiastically pro-European, scornful of rootedness - “progressive individualists.” On the other, somewhere people, much more rooted in family and local work and friendships, not (in the main) bigoted but slow to adapt, worried by too-rapid change - “decent populists.”

Admitting that each side usually shares aspects of the other, he argues that the somewhere people have lost out in status, income and visibility in the last few decades, to the point where they often tell pollsters that they barely recognize the country they live in. Much more strongly represented in the working and lower middle class, less often university-educated, generally older than the anywheres, they still are the largest bloc in the country – and in the referendum, their pent-up vexations were allowed a release.

Their decision was probably not a wise act, but it was a thoroughly democratic one. They have given their country’s leadership one monster of a job: to reconcile what is a still globalizing world with their need for esteem and a restored sense that their country is recognizable, and that it is theirs.

Puigdemont made a symbolic declaration of independence on Tuesday night, only to suspend it seconds later and call for negotiations with Madrid.

Spain’s Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has given him until Monday to clarify his position - and then until Thursday to change his mind if he insists on a split - threatening to suspend Catalonia’s autonomy if he chooses independence.

But far-left Catalan political group CUP called on Puigdemont to make an unequivocal declaration of independence in defiance of the deadlines.

“If (the central Madrid government) wants to continue to threaten and gag us, they should do it to the Republic that has already been claimed,” the party said.

The CUP only holds 10 seats in the 135-seat Catalan parliament. But Puigdemont’s minority government relies on its support to push through legislation and cannot win a majority vote in the regional parliament without its backing.

The wealthy region’s intention to break away after a referendum has plunged Spain into its worst political crisis since an attempted military coup in 1981 and could hurt economic growth targets for next year, the deputy prime minister said.

ECONOMIC RISK

“If there were no quick solution to this issue we should be forced to lower expectations of economic growth for the year 2018,” Soraya Sainz de Santamaria said on Friday.

Sources close to the Catalan government said Puigdemont and his team were working on an answer to Rajoy though they declined to say what line he would take.

The CUP statement echoes the position expressed late on Thursday by influential pro-independence civic group Asamblea Nacional Catalana which said: “Given the negative position of Spain toward dialogue, we ask the regional parliament to raise the suspension (on the declaration of independence).”

But the leader of Puigdemont’s party, Artur Mas, who served as the region’s president until 2016 and is still believed to influence key decisions, said on Friday declaring independence was not the only way forward.

“If a state proclaims itself independent and cannot act as such, it’s an independence that is merely aesthetic,” he told Catalan television TV3.

“The external factor must be taken into account in the decisions that will be made from now on,” he said.

The European Union, the United States and most other world powers have made it clear they wanted Catalonia to remain within Spain.

“If we allow Catalonia - and it is none of our business - to separate, others will do the same. I do not want that,” Jean Claude Juncker said in a speech at Luxembourg University.","Allies press Catalan leader to declare full independence, ignore Madrid deadlines",https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1CI19R

REUTERS/Yuri Gripas

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is likely to take a major step against the international nuclear deal with Iran on Friday, laying out a more aggressive approach to Iranian activities in the Middle East that risks upsetting U.S. relations with European allies.

“It is time for the entire world to join us in demanding that Iran’s government end its pursuit of death and destruction,” Trump said in a White House statement that flagged key elements of the strategy.

He is to present his plan in a 12:45 p.m. EDT (1645 GMT)speech at the White House, the product of weeks of internal discussions between him and his national security team.

U.S. officials said Trump was expected to announce that he will not certify the 2015 nuclear accord between Iran and six world powers, one he has called the “worst deal ever” as it was not, in his view, in the U.S. national interest.

Trump found himself under immense pressure as he considered de-certifying the deal, a move that would ignore warnings from inside and outside his administration that to do so would risk undermining U.S. credibility abroad.

He had formally reaffirmed it twice before but aides said he was reluctant to do so a third time.

De-certification would not pull the United States out of the deal but would give the Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions on Tehran that were suspended under the pact, negotiated during the administration of President Barack Obama.

Michael McCaul, chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Homeland Security Committee, told Reuters he thinks Trump “is likely to not completely pull out of the deal, but decertify compliance.”

If Washington quits the deal, that will be the end of it and global chaos could ensue, Iran’s influential parliament speaker, Ali Larijani, was quoted by the Russian news agency TASS as saying during a visit to St Petersburg on Friday.

“FOOTPRINTS ON THE GROUND”

U.N. nuclear inspectors say Iran is in compliance with the accord, which limited the scope of Iran’s nuclear program to help ensure it could not be put to developing bombs in exchange for a lifting of international sanctions on Tehran.

Trump says Tehran is in violation of the spirit of the agreement and has done nothing to rein in its ballistic missile program or its financial and military support for the Lebanese Shi‘ite movement Hezbollah and other militant groups.

White House Chief of Staff John Kelly said on Thursday the U.S. approach toward Iran is to work with allies in the Middle East to contain Tehran’s activities.

“We have footprints on the ground, naval and Air Force is there to just demonstrate our resolve, our friendship, and try to deter anything that any country out there may do,” Kelly told reporters.

European allies warn of a split with the United States over the nuclear agreement, in part because they are benefiting economically from a relaxation of sanctions.

A variety of European allies, including the leaders of Britain and France, have personally appealed to Trump to re-certify the nuclear accord for the sake of allied unity.

Germany’s government pledged on Friday to work for continued unity if Trump de-certified the deal as Berlin remain convinced the agreement was an important tool to prevent Iran developing nuclear weapons.

Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel underlined German views in a telephone call with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson late on Thursday, his spokeswoman Maria Adebahr told reporters.

Gabriel said on Thursday U.S. behavior was driving a wedge between Europe and its close ally United States and bringing Europeans closer to Russia and China. “It’s imperative that Europe sticks together on this issue,” said Gabriel.

Russian President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said on Friday that if the United States ditched the nuclear pact, “this will damage the atmosphere of predictability, security, stability and non-proliferation in the entire world”.

U.S. MOVE AGAINST REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS

McCaul said he expected Trump also to announce some kind of action against the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IGRC), the country’s most powerful security entity. Trump is under a legal mandate to impose U.S. economic sanctions on the Revolutionary Guards as a whole by Oct. 31 or waive them.

U.S. sanctions could seriously hurt the IRGC as it controls large swaths of Iran’s economy. The Guards’ foreign paramilitary and espionage wing, the Quds Force, is under U.S. sanctions, as is the Quds Force commander, other officials and associated individuals and entities.

The deputy Quds commander, Brigadier-General Esmail Ghaani, was quoted by Iran’ Tasnim news agency on Friday as saying Trump’s threats would “damage” the United States.

“We are not a war-mongering country. But any military action against Iran will be regretted...We have buried many...like Trump and know how to fight against America,” Ghaani said.

“EMBARRASSMENT”

The 2015 nuclear agreement, signed by the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China, the European Union and Iran, has been denounced by Trump as “an embarrassment”.

European officials have categorically ruled out renegotiating the deal but have said they share Trump’s concerns about Iran’s destabilizing influence in the Middle East.

China has said it hopes the agreement will stay intact.

Israel, Iran’s arch-adversary in the Middle East, welcomed Trump’s anticipated announcement on Friday but voiced doubt that the tougher tack by Washington could turn around the Islamic Republic.

The International Atomic Energy Agency concluded that Iran secretly researched a nuclear warhead until 2009, which Tehran denies. Iran has always insisted its uranium enrichment activity is for civilian energy purposes, not for atomic bombs.

The threat of new U.S. action has prompted a public display of unity from rival factions among Iran’s rulers. Iran will react sharply to any U.S. move against the nuclear deal with global powers, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told the Iranian parliament on Wednesday.

Il a ajouté que l‘intérêt des investisseurs s‘est révélé bien plus fort qu‘attendu et provient aussi bien de banques, de fonds spéculatifs que de courtiers.

“L‘intérêt découle vraiment du tapage médiatique.”

Le président russe Vladimir Poutine a mis en garde mercredi contre les “graves dangers” liés à ce marché naissant, tandis que la banque centrale russe a dit qu‘elle allait interdire les sites internet de trading de cryptomonnaies, ce qui n‘a pas empêché le bitcoin de gagner environ 10% depuis.

Une étude publiée la semaine dernière par SEMrush, un cabinet spécialisée dans l‘analyse des requêtes sur les moteurs de recherches, a fait ressortir une corrélation de 91% entre les requêtes sur le terme bitcoin sur Google et l‘évolution du prix de la cryptomonnaie, laissant entendre que les nouvelles, bonnes comme mauvaises, la concernant alimentent la demande même si les mauvaises nouvelles peuvent temporairement peser sur le cours.

Le bitcoin avait tutoyé les 5.000 dollars début septembre avant de chuter lourdement après des déclarations du patron de JP Morgan, Jamie Dimon, qualifiant la cryptomonnaie de “fraude” qui allait exploser en vol. Les autorités chinoises ont par ailleurs fermé plusieurs plateformes d‘échange et de financement en bitcoin faisant craindre des restrictions plus larges.

Après être retombé sous le seuil des 3.000 dollars, le bitcoin a rebondi gagnant plus de 75% en quatre semaines.

Selon des informations de presse publiées au début du mois, Goldman Sachs étudierait la possibilité de lancer une activité de trading dédiée au bitcoin.

“Le bitcoin a été conçu pour fonctionner en dehors de l‘influence des gouvernements et des banques centrales et c‘est exactement ce qui se passe”, a dit Iqbal Gandham, directeur général de l‘application de trading sur téléphone mobile eToro, qui a enregistré une forte croissance des volumes d‘échange en cryptomonnaies.

Vers 15h00 GMT, le bitcoin était en hausse de près de 8% par rapport à la veille à 5.202,13 dollars sur la plateforme d‘échange luxembourgeoise Bitstamp.

En dépit de nombreuses mises en garde sur la formation d‘une bulle sur le bitcoin, y compris par le vice-président de la Banque centrale européenne Vitor Constancio, les tenants d‘une poursuite de la hausse ne manquent pas, d‘autant qu‘il est difficile d‘en déterminer la valeur.

“Pour la plupart des devises, il y a plusieurs méthodologies reconnues pour estimer la valeur relative, généralement fondées sur les fondamentaux économiques”, relève Daniel Murray, responsable de la recherche chez EFG Asset Management. “Pour le bitcoin, de tels fondamentaux n‘existent pas.”

D‘autres cryptomonnaies, dont les cours sont étroitement corrélés à celui du bitcoin, ont aussi monté. Leur valorisation totale a dépassé 160 milliards de dollars pour la première fois depuis le début du mois de septembre, selon le site internet spécialisé Coinmarketcap.com.","Le Bitcoin à plus de 5.000 dollars, quintuplement depuis fin 2016",https://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idFRKBN1CH2I8-OFRIN

While the White House’s distaste for the 2015 pact may be sweet to the ears of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his government is mindful of the limits of any unilateral U.S. action in the face of dissent from other big power signatories.

Some Israeli officials quietly question whether Washington has the will to follow through, noting what they deem insufficient U.S. efforts to stem the entrenchment in next-door Syria of Iran-allied forces helping Damascus in the civil war.

Trump was expected to say in a 1645 GMT speech that he will not re-certify the nuclear agreement in light of Iran’s ballistic missile projects and involvement in regional trouble-spots. That would give the U.S. Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions on Tehran that were suspended in return for it rolling back technologies with nuclear bomb-making potential.

Netanyahu spokesmen declined to comment on the pending speech. A veteran Israeli cabinet minister from Netanyahu’s Likud party sounded cheered by Trump’s resolve, but appeared to note the depth of partisan rifts around the U.S. administration.

“The outcome that could happen, and this is the only positive outcome we can see at this stage, is that Congress manages to come together around new, significant sanctions,” the minister, Tzachi Hanegbi, told Tel Aviv radio station 102 FM.

“(That) will confront a lot of gigantic international companies which are today streaming to the Iranians ... with a dilemma of having to choose between the Iranians and trading with the world’s biggest economy, which is the United States.”

“FIX IT OR NIX IT”

Netanyahu has lobbied hard against the Iran deal, delivering a speech in Congress shortly before it was signed that angered then-U.S. President Barack Obama.

Addressing the U.N. General Assembly last month, Netanyahu urged world powers that negotiated the deal to “fix it or nix it.” He called specifically for cancelling a core “sunset clause” that removes caps on Iran’s nuclear projects after a number of years.

Asked about the sunset clause in the radio interview, Hanegbi gave no indication Israel believed it would be reviewed. He noted the resistance that Trump’s new measures faced from European powers, Russia and Iran, which has threatened to quit the nuclear deal if the U.S. imposes new sanctions against it.

Iran, Hanegbi assessed, “will not yield at all - period - in other words, not just not within 60 days, but neither within 60 months or 60 years, because they really do not believe that the world will reverse course. They look rather mockingly at the United States.”

But he added, “If the United States reverses course and begins a process of building delegitimation for the agreement, it could be that the world, part of the West, will join it in a process that could take time ... There is still a long way to go until the dangers of this deal pass.”

Israel is believed to have the Middle East’s only nuclear arsenal with about 200 warheads and sees Iran’s nuclear activity as a threat to its existence. It refuses to confirm or deny that it has nuclear weapons.

There has been dissent within Israel over the nuclear deal, with several Netanyahu ex-advisers grudgingly coming out in its favor. His former defense minister, Ehud Barak, told the New York Times on Wednesday: “Like many Israelis, I think the Iran deal is a bad deal. But it is a done deal.”

Barak warned that any U.S. withdrawal from the agreement would not be followed by other world powers and could prompt Iran - which denies seeking nuclear weapons - to work on a bomb.

Hanegbi dismissed such predictions as “nonsense”.

“Iran has no interest in withdrawing from the agreement (because that) would immediately unite Russia and China to the United States” against it, he told the radio station. He noted - as have U.N. nuclear inspectors - that the Iranians “have not budged a hair’s breadth from their commitments under the deal”.",Israel buoyed by Trump tack against Iran atom deal but sees long way to go,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-israel/israel-buoyed-by-trump-tack-against-iran-atom-deal-but-sees-long-way-to-go-idUSKBN1CI1G1?il=0

“The uncertainty that the (election) result brings means that you have a degree of the risk premia re-establishing itself,” said Barclays strategist Hamish Pepper.","LONDON (Reuters) - Last week’s shocking British election result and the period of political uncertainty that looks set to follow may have come at the worst of times for the country’s economy and the value of the pound sterling.

Until 10 p.m. London time last Thursday, Prime Minister Theresa May’s decision to call the snap poll did not look like a pivotal point for the most-sold major currency of last year.

Sterling lost almost a fifth of its value between June 2016, when Britons voted to leave the European Union, and November. Many had begun to assume that would be the full extent of the “Brexit discount” demanded by overseas investors to keep faith with the world’s fifth-largest economy.

But May’s loss of her majority drove a 2 percent fall in the pound on Friday and another 1 percent on Monday, and traders now say the election could prove another turning point for sterling.

After the biggest-ever move in favor of the pound in the four weeks to mid-May, market positioning has reversed.

For many strategists, the election result not only makes the likely shape of Brexit even more uncertain, it also creates a political hiatus that risks the sort of sudden stop to economic activity that many feared would follow last year’s referendum.

“Markets are still trying to work out what the new risk premium is for sterling,” says James Binny, head of currencies at U.S. financial group State Street Global Advisors in London.

“If the Conservatives back a softer Brexit, sterling would seem to want to go up. But if it became much clearer that things were heading downhill from a growth perspective, then that might create a bigger move down.”

VICIOUS CYCLE

Markets now assume May’s failure to secure her party a majority will lead to a softening of the government’s Brexit stance to give greater priority to a close trading relationship with the EU.

But there’s little confidence that the planned loose support agreement with Northern Irish Unionists can keep her minority Conservative government afloat for long, or whether May herself can cling on as premier for the two years of divorce talks.

Anxiety that Britain’s economy may be entering a downward spiral was already growing before the election.

Sterling’s weakness in the wake of the Brexit vote has driven inflation above the Bank of England’s target at a time when household wages and overall growth are not keeping pace, as data on Wednesday underlined.

But high and increasingly static housing costs that eat into the pay packets of young Britons without feeding optimism among their older neighbors mean the Bank of England is forced to ignore rising prices and keep credit conditions ultra-loose.

The combination of high inflation and cheap money then just undermines the pound further.

That presents a stark contrast with the euro zone, now on its best economic run for a decade, and leaves sterling looking most exposed against the euro.

Some airport exchange bureaus are already offering holidaymakers less than a euro per pound and the options markets companies use to insure against currency moves have flipped from positive on sterling in mid-April to universally negative. EURGBPVOL=

“The fundamentals still are not positive, they are negative,” said Josh O‘Byrne, a currency strategist with Citi, the world’s single biggest currency trader, in London.

”We have this cyclical underperformance. We have this political divergence where the UK is looking less stable, Europe looks more so.

“And also the positioning does not favor sterling. People are taking another look but waiting for more clarity.”

Barclays, which was positive on the pound before last week, has put its forecasts on review and is likely to cut them.

“The uncertainty that the (election) result brings means that you have a degree of the risk premia re-establishing itself,” said Barclays strategist Hamish Pepper. “The currency is vulnerable to that in the near term.”

Much will depend on how fiscal and monetary policies mesh over the next year, and some hedge funds and other major speculative investors are already wondering if more quantitative easing (QE) asset purchases from the BoE will be in the mix.

That would further loosen monetary policy and probably prove negative for sterling, although it would provide a backstop bid for British government bonds, known as gilts.

Ed Al-Hussainy, senior interest rate and currency analyst at Columbia Threadneedle, which manages $467 billion of assets, said ordinarily investors would sell gilts and demand higher interest rates to hold them, pressuring public finances.

”But here’s the twist: we have an opportunity for the Bank to restart QE,“ he said. ”The threshold for that is still very high -- we need to see a much greater deterioration.

“But in that scenario it is not clear that rates will go up.”","Hard or soft Brexit aside, pound nervous of economic slowdown",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-markets-sterling-analysis/hard-or-soft-brexit-aside-pound-nervous-of-economic-slowdown-idUSKBN19528B

Source: University of Chicago Booth

LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - What do you get when you merge psychology with economics? Richard Thaler, who just won the Nobel Memorial Prize in the latter field, has an answer, which he calls behavioural economics. The University of Chicago professor’s approach to the study of the mind is more dismal than cheerful. He made his reputation pointing out some of the ways that people do not think straight.

Psychology, though, is a far more than a catalogue of human confusions. The economic benefits of psychological research are far greater than most of today’s behavioural economists seem to realise.

Take the standard economic model of how corporate bosses choose their investments. They are supposed to invest if – and only if – the expected return on a project is higher than the weighted average cost of the capital required to finance it. In fact, the future is far too opaque for the needed estimates to be more than educated guesses. Indeed, the model-makers don’t even bother to keep up with changes in the real world. As Breakingviews’ Swaha Pattanaik pointed out (here), the typical estimated cost of capital has not declined along with nominal and real interest rates.

The models are accurate to within a 10th of 1 percent, but the results almost always confirm the intuition of the boss. That insight comes from applying some not always well understood rules of thumb to the limited data that is actually available.

Academic psychology can help with those rules of thumb, which it studies as heuristics. In many professions, machines can replicate and even improve on human intuition. Automatons can integrate more data than people, and can be trained to learn from mistakes. If these expert systems can help doctors give better diagnoses, they can probably help companies make better investments. It’s certainly worth a try.

Or take thinking about statistics. The normal human brain seems to struggle to find good heuristics for the science of probabilities and statistical significance. Scientists are often no more naturally statistical than lay people. It took decades to persuade doctors to prefer studies of statistically significant sample groups to anecdotal experience.

A firmer grasp on the psychology of learning could help avoid awesomely bad statistical heuristics, such as that shown by David Viniar as the financial crisis started a decade ago. The chief financial officer of Goldman Sachs said the bank’s traders had suffered “25-standard deviation moves, several days in a row”. In lay terms, he was saying that they suffered from incredible bad luck. That is a terrible explanation. Such a level of misfortune would be as likely to occur by chance as often as winning the big prize in the UK’s National Lottery 42 days in a row.

The typical economist is probably better than average in understanding what statistics can and cannot explain. A remarkable proportion of current research in the field is dedicated to using sophisticated statistical techniques to find hidden patterns in vast amounts of data. Still, deeper study of how to think about statistics could help economists think more clearly, and avoid the all-too-common mistake of confusing correlation with causality.

Better statistical intuition might also help economists analyse trade-offs, such as between higher costs and less pollution. Ultimately, though, such debates require the use of a different part of the mind: the ethical or moral faculty. Economists generally claim to be ethically neutral, but without a clear method to debate what makes an economy or a society truly good, they typically fall back on ethically sloppy goals such as maximising efficiency or output.

When psychologists talk about morality, they are essentially philosophers. Economists would gain from joining them. The millennia of philosophical debate about the nature of the good life and the good society may not have reached any definitive conclusions. But studying the works of Plato and John Stuart Mill makes Thaler’s criticisms of the classic economists’ ideal of rational actors maximising their utility seem pretty trivial.

A truly informed psychological economics would elevate current debates. Take the furore over inequality. With better heuristics, researchers could give policymakers a clearer idea of the likely effects of changes in taxes, pay structures and migration policy. With better statistical reasoning, more people could understand the significance of measures of, say, income differentials and intergenerational social mobility.

And with deeper moral thinking, questions of justice, which are hardly broached in the current inequality debate, could be addressed more intelligently. The difference between equality of opportunity and of outcome deserves more attention, as does the possible obligation of residents in rich countries to help narrow the gap with poor countries. Branko Milanovic, a researcher at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, has shown that this cross-border gap creates far more global income inequality than is found inside rich lands.

Behavioural economics is a fairly modest step in the right direction for a profession that is too often isolated from other currents of modern thought. A true psychological economics, with a touch of philosophy, would be a much larger improvement.",Breakingviews - Hadas: Economists need more psychological abuse,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-economics-theory-breakingviews/breakingviews-hadas-economists-need-more-psychological-abuse-idUSKBN1CG276

As of the end of September, at least 205 civilians had been killed and 261 wounded this year in air strikes in Afghanistan, U.N. investigators said in a quarterly report.

At least 38 percent of those casualties were caused by international military forces, while the majority were attributed to the Afghan Air Force, which has begun to conduct more attacks on its own.

More than two thirds of the civilian victims were women and children, the report said.

In September, U.S. warplanes dropped more bombs than in any single month since 2010, driven largely by Trump’s strategy of trying to reassert pressure on militants after several years of drawdown by foreign troops.

A spokesman for the U.S. military command did not immediately comment on the report.

General Dawlat Waziri, spokesman for the Afghan Ministry of Defence, rejected the findings and said the government took civilian casualties seriously.

“It is quite obvious that Taliban and other insurgent groups cause more civilian casualties,” he said, adding that insurgents also “use civilians as human shields and hide in residential areas”.

Overall civilian casualties decreased slightly compared to the same period last year, the report said.

At least 2,640 civilians were killed and 5,379 injured this year, compared to 2,616 killed and 5,915 injured in the same period of 2016.

The drop reflected fewer casualties from fighting in populated areas, the report noted, as militants failed to capture any major cities.

The head of the U.N. mission in Afghanistan, Tadamichi Yamamoto, praised the Afghan government for formally endorsing a national policy designed to reduce civilian casualties.

“The government owes it to its citizens, particularly the victims of the armed conflict, to ensure full implementation of the policy through a concrete action plan,” he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - A top U.S. government legal official has given strong backing to Britain’s campaign to force Silicon Valley to compromise on encrypted communications, rebuking tech firms for failing to balance crime-fighting demands with privacy needs.

U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein met with senior British government officials including interior minister Amber Rudd and the chief of MI5 intelligence agency on Thursday to discuss encryption. He plans to see the head of Britain’s GCHQ service on Friday, he told Reuters.

“At this point we are coordinating with our foreign partners as to what the challenges are,” Rosenstein said in response to a question from a reporter at the Global Cyber Security Summit, organized by Skytop Strategies.

Top officials in Prime Minister Theresa May’s government, including Rudd, have been trying to rein in encryption but have been met quiet resistance from tech leaders like Facebook (FB.O), Google (GOOGL.O) and Twitter (TWTR.N). Critics see the demands as a back door for government snooping.

In his speech, Rosenstein decried what he called “warrant-proof encryption that puts zero value on law enforcement”.

British and U.S. officials argue that default encryption settings on free messaging apps, such as Facebook’s WhatsApp, hinder authorities’ ability to collect evidence needed to pursue criminals, even with clear, court-ordered mandates.

“Increasingly, the tools we use to collect evidence run up against encryption tools which are designed to defeat them,” Rosenstein said.

Britain is trying to step up attempts to counter criminal activity online after a series of Islamist militant attacks this year but must ensure it balances the demands of state security with the freedoms of democratic societies.

Tech companies and many cyber security experts say that requiring law enforcement access be given access to encrypted products will broadly weaken security for everything from online banking to shopping to casual conversations among friends.

The U.S. deputy attorney general said he was not seeking to criticize technology firms but rather to lay out the trade-offs.

”In many ways the economic interests of technology companies align with law enforcement,“ Rosenstein said. ”But in one particular area - encryption - competitive forces drive technology companies to resist cooperating with governments.

“I wouldn’t describe my goal is to put pressure on the tech industry,” he said, adding “regulation is a potential option”.

But in a speech earlier this week Rosenstein accused Silicon Valley of being more willing to comply with foreign government demands for data than those made by their home country.

Every Republican in Congress opposed the international accord reached under Democratic former President Barack Obama two years ago. Joined by several Democrats, they nearly passed legislation to kill the deal in which Iran agreed to curb its disputed nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief.

However, with the agreement in place and strongly supported by co-signers Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China, many Republicans who still abhor the pact nevertheless do not want to blow it up for fear that doing so would erode U.S. credibility. They want to find other ways to clamp down on Tehran.

Meeting with officials from the Trump and Obama administrations, European diplomats and among themselves, they have been preparing strategies to save it, including pushing for tougher inspections, changing the law requiring Trump to certify Tehran’s compliance and setting new sanctions over Iran’s non-nuclear activities.

“As flawed as the deal is, I believe we must enforce the hell out of it,” Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said on Wednesday.

On Friday, Trump is expected to unveil a broad strategy for Iran, including announcing that he will decertify the agreement ahead of an Oct. 15 deadline, although he could always change his mind.

If the Republican president goes ahead, that would open a 60-day window in which Congress could reimpose sanctions, a step toward an unraveling of the deal.

PRESSURE ON REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS

However, Trump is not expected to call on lawmakers to revive those sanctions. If he stops short of recommending that, it gives Republicans room to stand pat for now.

Daniel Kurtzer, a former U.S. ambassador to Israel who is now a professor at Princeton University, said the political pressure could be intense. “There will be an onslaught of phone calls and letters and visits to senators to ‘do something’ about Iran,” he said.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has urged Washington to either fix the Iran deal or “nix it.”

On Wednesday, H.R. McMaster, Trump’s national security adviser, discussed Iran with the Republican chairmen of House of Representatives national security committees. On Thursday, intelligence officials scheduled a classified briefing for members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, a key player in the Iran debate, has suggested changing the Iran Review Act he co-authored to eliminate the requirement that Trump recertify Iran’s compliance with the deal every 90 days, several congressional sources said.

Trump, who pledged during his campaign to rip up the Iran deal, has recertified it twice since taking office in January and hates having to do so.

A Twitter feud that erupted this week between Trump and Corker could complicate the efforts by the influential Republican to broker a deal that would likely require both Democratic and Republican support.

“Congress and the administration need to be on the same page, and a major breakdown in the working relationship between one of the very few key Republicans on the Hill who works with Democrats and the president on Iran policy bodes very poorly,” said Elizabeth Rosenberg, a former Treasury Department official now at the Center for a New American Security.

To win over some conservative Republicans and Iran hawks, Corker and other leaders are considering proposing sanctions on Iran’s non-nuclear activities and broader inspections, particularly of Iranian military facilities.

On Thursday, the House Foreign Affairs Committee approved sanctions targeting Iran’s ballistic missiles development. It could come up for a vote in the full House well before the end of the 60 days Congress has to react to Trump’s announcement.",Iran deal's foes in U.S. Congress may be its unlikely saviors,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-congress/iran-deals-foes-in-u-s-congress-may-be-its-unlikely-saviors-idUSKBN1CH2K2?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

Une information judiciaire a été ouverte le 13 juin par le parquet de Paris contre le groupe franco-suisse dans l‘affaire de la cimenterie Lafarge de Djalabiya pour financement d‘entreprise terroriste et mise en danger de la vie d‘autrui.

Cette procédure fait suite à une plainte avec constitution de partie civile déposée le 15 novembre 2016 par Sherpa et l‘ONG European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR), ainsi que par 11 plaignants et ex-salariés syriens.

La filiale syrienne Lafarge Cement Syria (LCS) est notamment soupçonnée d‘avoir contribué à financer l‘Etat islamique en lui versant de l‘argent en 2013-2014 pour pouvoir continuer à travailler dans une région contrôlée par cette organisation.

“Il faut aussi rechercher la responsabilité de l‘Etat si jamais l‘Etat est aussi impliqué”, a expliqué à Reuters Marie-Laure Guislain, responsable de Sherpa, qui suit ce dossier.

“C‘est pourquoi il est important de demander à ces personnes si elles ont des informations intéressantes”, a-t-elle ajouté.

Sherpa souhaite notamment établir si le ministère des Affaires étrangères français était au courant de ces arrangements et a encouragé Lafarge à maintenir ses activités dans la Syrie en guerre, comme l‘ont laissé entendre plusieurs cadres du groupe interrogés dans une procédure parallèle.

Le parquet a en effet ouvert en octobre 2016 une enquête préliminaire sur la base d‘une plainte de l‘ancien ministre des Finances Michel Sapin pour infraction au code des douanes.

Selon Sherpa, un ancien cadre de Lafarge, qui a travaillé 30 ans pour le groupe, “a déclaré avoir été en contact régulier avec le Quai d‘Orsay, qui n‘a jamais dit à Lafarge d‘arrêter (ses activités en Syrie), bien au contraire”.

“Le Quai d‘Orsay n‘a eu de cesse de dire que tout allait s‘arranger et qu‘il fallait tenir. Nous demandons à vérifier”, ajoute-t-on de même source.

Dans l‘immédiat, personne dans l‘entourage de Laurent Fabius, aujourd‘hui président du Conseil constitutionnel, au Quai d‘Orsay ou à LafargeHolcim n‘était disponible pour commenter ces informations.

Quatre anciens salariés syriens de LCS ont jusqu‘ici été entendus par un des juges chargés de l‘information judiciaire.

Selon Marie-Laure Guislain, le dernier en date, entendu jeudi, a notamment raconté qu‘il avait été enlevé pendant une dizaine de jours et décrit la peur dans laquelle vivaient les salariés de l‘usine de Djalabiya.

Il a également raconté comment la trentaine de salariés encore sur le site avaient été livrés à eux-mêmes lors de l‘attaque de l‘usine par Daech en septembre 2014.

“Il n‘est pas question seulement de financement du terrorisme mais aussi potentiellement de complicité de crime de guerre et de crime contre l‘humanité”, dit Marie-Laure Guislain.

L‘ONG souhaite que les sept autres salariés plaignants soient aussi entendus.

MONROVIA (Reuters) - Former soccer star George Weah leads in partial presidential election results in 11 of Liberia’s 15 counties, the electoral commission said on Thursday, after a vote meant to bring about the country’s first democratic transfer of power in decades.

Early results from Tuesday’s poll read to reporters by the commission’s chairman left Weah’s camp confident he would win the outright majority he needs to avoid a run-off, even though most counties had reported tallies from less than a third of polling stations.

The other favorite in the 20-candidate field, Vice-President Joseph Boakai, led in just one county, although he was running in second in most others.

“I can say for sure that Ambassador George Manneh Weah is going to be the next president of the Republic of Liberia,” Weah’s adviser Mulbah Morlu told Reuters. “The people of Liberia have spoken.”

The final results must be announced by Oct. 25 and a run-off will be held next month if no one has won a majority.

Before the commission’s announcement, parties backing three other candidates alleged fraud and vowed to contest the results. But international observers said they had seen no major problems with the vote.

“The overall conduct of the voting was generally assessed as either good or very good,” the EU mission said in a statement on Thursday.

Observers from the U.S.-based Carter Center and National Democratic Institute (NDI) also said they had not identified any major issues with the voting or subsequent counting.

The allegations of irregularities centered on charges that extra ballots were printed in advance and marked with votes for Boakai from the ruling Unity Party of President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf.

However, none of the parties provided evidence of cheating. A Unity Party leader declined to respond to the accusations.

Earlier in the day, Johnson Sirleaf, who became Africa’s first elected female president when she won a surprise victory in 2005 following a post-war transition, hailed the election as historic.

“We believe that all Liberians are ready for this process. I thank them for participating in this process,” she told reporters.

Cutting the corporate rate immediately to 20 percent would reduce U.S. tax revenues by nearly $2 trillion over a decade, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center think tank.
Sources said House Republicans believed they could halve the projected revenue loss if the rate cut were phased in.

Tax writers in the House of Representatives may opt to phase in the 20 percent corporate rate over three to five years by lowering it in stages from the current 35 percent, said two sources close to the tax discussions.

A phase-in surfaced as an option among Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee as it closed in on completion of actual tax legislation, working off of a nine-page “framework” unveiled by Trump on Sept. 27.

The House was expected to be inactive on Friday and all of next week. “We’ll come back in a week and be able to put together the bill that will move through committee,” Republican Representative Kristi Noem told reporters.

One of the biggest problems confronting the Republican tax reform push is the federal budget deficit, which would be hugely expanded by Trump’s proposals, according to independent analyses.

Cutting the corporate rate immediately to 20 percent would reduce U.S. tax revenues by nearly $2 trillion over a decade, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center think tank.

Sources said House Republicans believed they could halve the projected revenue loss if the rate cut were phased in. Details of such an option were unavailable.

The administration contends the cuts would pay for themselves through stronger economic growth generating new tax revenues, although most economists say that is unlikely.

‘CORPORATE INTEGRATION’

A different approach may emerge from the Senate, where Republicans are writing their own tax legislation. Sources with knowledge of the discussions said senators might settle on a corporate tax rate above 20 percent, but use an unorthodox “corporate integration” strategy to achieve an effective rate of 20 percent or less.

Corporate integration, a brainchild of Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, would help lower corporations’ tax bill by giving them a deduction for shareholder dividends, analysts said. The idea has faced opposition in the past.

Both the House and Senate alternatives surfaced this week as top Republicans and Trump administration officials confronted skepticism that the Republican-controlled Congress could cut the corporate rate to 20 percent without ballooning the deficit.

Trump, who earlier in the year called for a 15 percent corporate tax rate and only reluctantly agreed to 20 percent, is now insisting that it go no higher.

“The president has made it clear. He wants 20 percent. That’s the one part of this bill that’s not negotiable,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC.

House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady told reporters on Thursday: “We continue to drive toward the framework ... ensuring that our businesses don’t have anything higher than 20 percent on the corporate side.”

Asked if that meant a 20 percent rate in the first year, he said: “We’re moving toward that whole design.”",Republicans eye alternatives for getting to 20 percent corporate tax rate,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax/republicans-eye-alternatives-for-getting-to-20-percent-corporate-tax-rate-idUSKBN1CH369

(Reuters) - A surge in technology stocks sent the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq to record highs on Friday, but the gains were kept in check by a drop in banks as Wells Fargo missed revenue estimates for a fourth straight quarter.

Wells Fargo (WFC.N) tumbled 3 percent, set for its biggest drop since mid-April, adding to the pressure on bank stocks after results from JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Citigroup (C.N) on Thursday stoked concerns about consumer credit.

Bank of America (BAC.N), however, bucked the trend, rising 0.5 percent after the lender’s profit topped estimates due to higher interest rates and a drop in costs.

The reports from the Wall Street banks kicked off the earnings season and investors are hoping profit growth will help justify valuations after a rally that has sent the S&P 500 up about 14 percent so far this year.

The market got a boost earlier in the day after data showed retail sales surged by the most in 2-1/2 years in September, easing doubts over an economy that has been sluggish this year.

Another report showed consumer prices recorded their biggest increase in eight months last month as gasoline prices soared in the wake of hurricane-related production disruptions.

But, year-on-year core inflation was unmoved for the fifth month, putting no new pressure on the Federal Reserve to tighten borrowing costs and hamper demand any further.

“While markets are still expecting the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in December, concerns over prolonged periods of depressed inflation may cloud the prospect of higher U.S. interest rates in 2018,” Lukman Otunuga, a research analyst at FXTM said.

La jeune entreprise – moins de vingt salariés et 1,2 millions d’euros de chiffre d’affaires en 2016, sa première année de commercialisation - annonce cinq usines clés en mains en passe d’être vendues dans autant de pays d’ici l’an prochain.

Les fonds levés devraient également permettre à Pyrum d’adapter la thermolyse à des matières plastiques dont les fibres de carbone.

La création de Pyrum, en 2007, est née de la rencontre de Pascal Klein et Julien Dossmann avec Klaus-Peter Schulz, un ingénieur process expérimenté à l’origine des brevets qui ont permis d’industrialiser le procédé.

Le marché des pneus usagés est jugé prometteur avec un volume de 3,4 millions de tonnes par an en Europe, de 13,5 millions de tonnes dans le monde. Ils sont valorisés comme combustibles à hauteur de 35% tandis que 30% sont transformés en granulés pour une réutilisation, notamment dans le BTP, selon des données fournies par l’entreprise.

Pyrum a rapidement suscité l’intérêt des acteurs institutionnels tels qu’Oséo, région Alsace, Land de Sarre, Union européenne, qui ont soutenu son développement ou sont entrés au capital, mais également des industriels avec lesquels ont été nouées des coopérations de recherche et de fabrication.

Tens of thousands of Kurdish Peshmerga soldiers were already stationed in and around Kirkuk and another 6,000 have arrived since Thursday, Kosrat Rasul said, amid mounting tensions between the northern territory and Baghdad.

Iraq’s government has taken a series of measures to isolate the region since the Kurds’ Sept. 25 referendum on independence, including banning international flights from going there and pushing for a halt to its crude oil sales.

Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has repeatedly said he has no plans to go further and actually attack the territory.

But the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG)’s Security Council expressed alarm late on Thursday at what it said was a significant Iraqi military build-up south of Kirkuk, “including tanks, artillery, Humvees and mortars”.

“These forces are approximately 3 kilometers (1.9 miles) from Peshmerga forces. Intelligence shows intentions to take over nearby oil fields, airport and military base,” it said in a statement.

An Iraqi military spokesman said military movements near Kirkuk are meant to “inspect and secure” the nearby region of Hawija recaptured from Islamic State militants a week ago.

KRG authorities have repeatedly called for negotiations since the referendum, in which an overwhelming majority voted for independence. Baghdad has ruled out talks unless the KRG renounces the referendum results.

Kirkuk lies just outside the KRG autonomous territory but Peshmerga forces moved in when the Iraqi army collapsed in the face of an Islamic State onslaught in 2014, preventing the region’s oil fields from falling under jihadist control.

Germany, which has traditionally good ties with both Baghdad and the KRG, called for steps to ease the tensions.

“We would like to ask them to meet those responsibilities and not to escalate the conflict,” German government spokesman Steffen Seibert told reporters in Berlin.

Iraq’s tough line toward the Kurds has the support of neighbors Turkey and Iran, which strongly oppose the secessionist movement given their own sizable Kurdish minorities.

President Tayyip Erdogan’s spokesman said on Thursday Turkey would gradually close border crossings with northern Iraq in coordination with the central Iraqi government and Iran.

Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim is expected to visit Baghdad on Sunday to meet with Abadi.

Iraqi forces and Shi‘ite Muslim paramilitaries, known as Popular Mobilisation, are deployed south and west of Kirkuk, after having recaptured the areas from Islamic State (IS).

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s economy shows little sign of improving on lacklustre growth and it seems “extraordinary” that the Bank of England is considering raising interest rates, the British Chambers of Commerce said on Friday.

The BCC’s Quarterly Economic Survey of businesses, the largest of its kind, said sales at services firms that make up the bulk of the economy were steady in the third quarter.

But there was little pick-up in pay pressures or investment, both of which the BoE expects to rise markedly next year.

Overall the BCC described the survey as “uninspiring”, with political uncertainty, currency fluctuations and Brexit clearly affecting British businesses.

Despite confounding forecasts that the 2016 vote to leave the European Union would lead to a sudden slowdown, Britain’s economy has struggled this year, posting its worst first-half performance since 2012.

The BCC said price pressures in companies, while high historically, looked likely to peak soon.

“Against this backdrop, it seems extraordinary that the Bank of England are considering raising interest rates,” said Suren Thiru, BCC head of economics.

In September the BoE said interest rates would probably rise “in the coming months” if the economy continued to grow and price pressures kept building.

INFLATION

The BCC survey suggested that business activity was probably strong enough to absorb slack in the economy - one of the BoE’s markers for raising rates soon, JPMorgan economist Allan Monks said in a research note.

“Another marker, however, was to see underlying inflation pressures building. But the pay settlements reading of the BCC remained close to a record low in (the third quarter),” Monks added.

Unlike the larger services sector, manufacturers enjoyed both better domestic and export sales over the past three months, the BCC said.

While gauges of confidence in turnover and profitability stood at their highest levels since 2015, the survey pointed to only a marginal improvement in manufacturers’ investment intentions.

A slightly larger proportion of manufacturers said they expected to raise prices, but this was mostly down to the cost of raw materials rather than pressure from pay settlements.

In the services sector, a net 15 percent of firms reported that pay was putting pressure on prices - up just a percentage point from the five-year low struck in the second quarter.

Other surveys, including one from the BoE’s regional advisers, have pointed to similar weakness in corporate pay intentions.","'Extraordinary' for BoE to mull rate hike as economy struggles, BCC says",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-economy/uk-economy-shows-few-signs-of-comeback-as-rate-hike-decision-nears-bcc-idUKKBN1CH37X

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Amazon Studios chief Roy Price was put on an immediate leave of absence Thursday, the company said, following allegations that he harassed a producer and ignored an actress’s claim of a sexual assault by producer Harvey Weinstein.

The Hollywood Reporter on Thursday reported an allegation by Isa Hackett, a producer on one of Amazon.com Inc’s shows, that Price had lewdly propositioned her in 2015.

Amazon said in a statement: ”Roy Price is on leave of absence effective immediately. We are reviewing our options for the projects we have with The Weinstein Co.”

Hackett did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reuters could not independently confirm the allegation. Price could not immediately be reached independently by Reuters and he declined to comment to the Hollywood Reporter.

Price’s removal creates uncertainty about the studio’s direction when Amazon is investing more on video content than ever before - some $4.5 billion this year.

The studio’s Chief Operating Officer Albert Cheng will step in as the interim chief, Amazon said.

Hackett is the daughter of famed science fiction author Philip K. Dick, whose book “The Man in the High Castle” served as the basis for Amazon’s eponymous show.

Also on Thursday, actress Rose McGowan said on Twitter that she had told Price that she had been assaulted by Weinstein, who was forced out of his company this week following reports in the New Yorker and the New York Times that he had harassed and assaulted numerous women over the years. In tweets directed at Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, she criticized the company for doing business with the Weinstein Co.

A spokeswoman for Harvey Weinstein said: “Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein.”

Price has been integral to Amazon’s movie business, helping steer it through an attempt to crowd-source television scripts and garnering Hollywood awards for shows such as “Transparent.”

Amazon hopes original movies and TV shows will draw new people to join its streaming and shopping club Prime, and in turn buy more goods from the online retailer.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) faces an antitrust fine in Taiwan, the latest in a years-long streak of regulatory setbacks to its business model that comes as it also fights U.S. regulators and iPhone maker Apple Inc (AAPL.O) in court over many of the same legal issues.

The Taiwan Fair Trade Commission said on Wednesday it would fine Qualcomm T$23.4 billion ($774.14 million) for anti-trust violations of its chip technology.

The Commission said in a Chinese-language statement that Qualcomm had a monopoly over the chip market for several so-called modem technologies, which provide wireless data connectivity for mobile phones, and refused to license its technology to other industry players.

In Taiwan, Qualcomm is required to submit a progress report on the matter every six months to the Commission on negotiations with related parties.

In a statement, Qualcomm said it disagreed with the decision. Once the final decision is issued in the coming weeks, Qualcomm said it will challenge the decision in court.

“The fine bears no rational relationship to the amount of Qualcomm’s revenues or activities in Taiwan, and Qualcomm will appeal the amount of the fine and the method used to calculate it,” Qualcomm said.

The Taiwanese decision is the latest challenge to Qualcomm’s business model, which involves selling chips and also licensing a suite of patents related to how those chips are put into a phone to provide mobile data to the device. While the regulatory and legal attacks differ in some details, a key theme is the allegation that Qualcomm uses its dominant position in the market for modem chips to charge unfair royalty rates for its patents.

Last December, Korean regulators fined Qualcomm $854 million for violating its competition laws, a ruling that followed an $975 million fine from Chinese regulators in 2015.

European regulators have also expressed antitrust concerns over Qualcomm’s $38 billion bid to buy NXP Semiconductors (NXPI.O).

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is also suing Qualcomm over its licensing practices.

Those regulatory challenges are playing out as Apple is waging a global legal battle on Qualcomm’s long-held practice of charging a percentage of the total price of iPhones and other Apple devices as a licensing fee for its patents.

After those lawsuits were filed, Qualcomm brought an action against Apple before the U.S. International Trade Commission seeking to ban imports of some iPhones. Qualcomm filed a separate civil lawsuit accusing Apple of infringing the patents at issue in that action.",Taiwan fines Qualcomm $774 million for antitrust violations,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-qualcomm-taiwan-fine/taiwan-fines-qualcomm-774-million-for-antitrust-violations-idUSKBN1CG1RF

With post-Maria Puerto Rico the latest example of that trope, it’s time for a better understanding of how disaster management works.

A disaster destroys in hours infrastructure that took decades to build. Millions of people lose the services that separate a middle-class suburb from an impoverished slum – clean water, sewers, power, hospitals, roads. And Maria was the strongest storm to strike the area in 80 years.

Meanwhile, the media tends to focus on drama and controversy. They often overplay the story via anecdotal reporting (“Here’s Mrs. Hernandez without electricity,” says the reporter [pause], “with no help in sight”) and underplay the work being done, especially at the beginning of the response where progress is hard to see. First responders on laptops methodically solving supply problems are not very mediagenic, after all.

At the moment of any disaster, needs are at 100 percent while the response is at a zero point. The response starts in deficit. It always looks grim, especially to participants and outside observers unfamiliar with the process. They want what is a marathon to play out like a sprint.

In dealing with a major disaster, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the military follow a standard playbook. I know, I worked with both on and off for two decades while with the State Department. I trained with them, and was on the ground for relief efforts after the 1995 Kobe, Japan earthquake (more than 6,000 dead) and 2004 Asian tsunami (280,000 dead.) I worked the Washington DC-end of many other disasters. I read after-action reporting from 20-30 other such events.

The critical initial step is a needs assessment, from which everything else flows. Everyone wants to jump in and do something, but responders need time to visit sites, confer with local officials, and determine what is needed and where the needs are greatest. It is a slow process in a chaotic environment, delayed by weather, roads, and communications. From the outside it can look like nothing is being done; Mrs. Hernandez still doesn’t have electricity even as helicopters are flying around, apparently ignoring her!

The needs assessment gets the right help to the right places in order of priority. As an example, I was part of a liaison team with the American Navy at Phuket, Thailand following the Asian tsunami of 2005. Without any local input, the U.S. first helicopters brought in huge fresh water bladders. It turned out most of the water was unneeded; the city had warehouses full of the bottled version.

It took a day for us to track down, but the most urgent need the Navy could address was a buildup of medical waste at local hospitals. Waste pre-disaster was trucked out daily; the tsunami wrecked the roads, and so boxes of soiled bandages and infected sharps accumulated. When American resources turned to help dispose of that, hospitals were able to run at peak capacity. Lives were saved. The water bladders lay abandoned in parking lots around town.

Other decisions that can flow from a needs assessment might include restoring power to one school to shelter 50 families before fixing 50 individual homes. It can mean blocking people from calling internationally so limited cell capacity can be directed to local emergency calls. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, for example, set as a priority reopening dialysis centers across Puerto Rico. Somebody else didn’t get helped first to make that possible.

At the early-to-intermediate stages of a disaster response people in less affected areas will wait in long lines for supplies. It looks bad on TV, but can actually mean the system is working, as help was directed to a higher priority. It takes good reporting to know if that’s the case. Instead, progress is often too quickly defined as “make everything back to the way it was before the storm.”

The military plays a key role in disaster response. The problem is Americans are conditioned to believe there are unlimited resources of all types, instantly movable across notable distances.

Military units tend to have war fighting as their primary job, and most are somewhere doing that, or training to do that. Shifting to a disaster mission can happen quickly but not instantly. It’s also essential to gather people with the right skills – electrical engineers, teams that desalinate sea water for drinking, and sewage crews (3.4 million people’s waste festering with fecal-borne disease is a dreaded secondary killer in this disaster.)

Much mockery has been directed at Trump’s statement about Puerto Rico being an island, surrounded by “big water.” His phrasing was callous, but the fact Puerto Rico is an island is significant. Unlike Texas or Florida, no one can self-evacuate, by car or even on foot. Same for incoming aid. Everything must travel by plane, or, more likely, ship.

Puerto Ricans now need some two million gallons of fresh water a day. A gallon weighs about eight pounds, so that’s 16 million pounds of water. A C-130 cargo plane can carry some 42,000 pounds. So that’s 380 flights a day, every day, just for water. There are bigger aircraft, but the bottom line is always the same: you simply have to move the epic quantities required to respond to an epic island disaster by ship to a port, then inland by truck.

That last step, moving supplies from a port (or airport) to those who need them is known as the “last mile” problem. It haunts every disaster response.

Success with the last mile depends on local infrastructure. If it was neglected before the disaster, it will never be better (and often worse) during the disaster response. Next comes the need for trucks, fuel for those trucks, drivers, security, and personnel and equipment to offload the ships and load the vehicles. If you’re missing one link in the chain, the aid does not move.

These are tough realities, not excuses for why more hasn’t been done for desperate people. It can be a complex, methodical process, addressing a single problem (get water to that village) as a cascading string of nested problems. While the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s remark that Puerto Rico relief is the “most logistically challenging event” the United States has ever faced seems exaggerated, it does underscore the size of the job at hand.

So don’t be distracted by the apocalyptic tweets between Trump and his critics; they exist independent of the ground truth. Because while no response is ever fast and robust enough, the systemic breakdowns that hit New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina have largely been fixed, well-before Trump even took office.

Responses are always imperfect; lack of drinking water remains a critical issue. The loss of life in Puerto Rico is sure to rise from 16, as rescuers reach more remote areas. For Harvey, the death toll was at least 70, Irma 72. Katrina saw 1,836 fatalities with over 700 people still missing.

But a tipping point will take place, where adequate services are restored and people will start to receive the help they need. Problems will reduce from regions without power to villages without power to an isolated home without power. The principles of disaster management should not be lost in the politics surrounding events in Puerto Rico. Everything else right now seems to be just Twitter wars.","Commentary: For hurricane-hit Puerto Rico, an insider’s guide to disaster management",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-vanburen-disaster-commentary/commentary-for-hurricane-hit-puerto-rico-an-insiders-guide-to-disaster-management-idUSKCN1C805X

Os preços ao consumidor nos Estados Unidos subiram 0,5 por cento em setembro, o maior avanço em oito meses, com os preços da gasolina subindo após as interrupções da produção relacionadas com os furacões, mas a inflação permaneceu fraca.

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks advanced for a fourth straight day on Friday on expectations of broad-based global growth, while the dollar was on course for its worst week in five as investors awaited U.S. inflation data.

MSCI’s world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up 0.1 percent after hitting record highs on Thursday.

Earlier in Asia, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan hit a 10-year high.

European shares rose to their highest level in nearly four months, helped by some well-received earnings updates. The pan-European STOXX600 rose 0.3 percent and was set for its fifth straight week of gains as were world stocks.

Germany’s DAX index was up 0.1 percent, just below an all-time high hit in the previous session, while Britain’s FTSE eased back 0.1 percent after a record close on Thursday.

Wall Street futures indicated a positive open for the S&P 500 index.

“We’re seeing positive economic news even in the midst of so called geopolitical risk, I think investors are generally more optimistic right now,” said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA, referring to strong corporate earnings.

“Earnings in the second quarter were very positive, and looking beyond the impact of hurricanes, it seems like there’s improved fundamentals in the U.S. and Europe.”

Emerging market stocks were buoyant too as another 0.2 percent rise set their latest 6-year peak.

In currencies, the dollar stayed on the defensive after minutes from the last U.S. Federal Reserve meeting showed policymakers remained divided on U.S. inflation prospects.

The index which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies was flat ahead of consumer price inflation data, due at 1230 GMT.

“Abating political risks in the U.S. and growing Fed rate hike bets have pushed the dollar higher in recent weeks,” Credit Agricole strategists said in a note.

“With a December rate hike almost fully priced in by now, however, investors are starting to focus on the Fed’s still cautious forward guidance and hence the limited scope for a further increase of the dollar’s rate advantage.”

NEW FED CHIEF

On top of the near-term inflation readings, investors are looking at whom U.S. President Donald Trump will nominate as successor to Fed Chair Janet Yellen, whose term expires next February.

White House Chief of Staff John Kelly said on Thursday that Trump was “some time away” from making a decision, while another official said Trump had met with Stanford University economist John Taylor -- of economics text book Taylor-rule fame -- to discuss the job.

Meanwhile, the euro was flat but still set for its biggest weekly rise in a month. [FRX/]

European Central Bank policymakers broadly agreed to extend asset purchases at a lower volume at their October policy meeting with views converging on a nine-month extension, sources at the central bank told Reuters.

Britain’s pound rose to a 10-day high, boosted by a report in Germany’s Handelsblatt newspaper that the European Union could offer Britain a two-year transitional Brexit deal. [GBP/]

The most eye-catching move, however, was from digital currency Bitcoin as it soared by as much as 7.4 percent after Thursday’s 13 percent gain, to hit a record high of $5,846. It is up more than 450 percent this year.

The chief financial officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co said the firm was open-minded about the future potential use of digital currencies, appearing to dial back comments last month from his boss, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, who said bitcoin was a “fraud”.

Among commodities, copper prices held firm after hitting a one-month high on Thursday as optimism over the demand outlook from major consumer China fuelled buying.

London copper futures were at $6,898.50 a tonne, up 0.2 percent on the day.

Oil prices also climbed after data showed both U.S. crude production and inventories had declined. Crude was set for its sixth weekly rise in the last seven weeks. U.S. crude jumped 2 percent to $51.59 a barrel. Brent crude rose 2.2 percent to $57.50 a barrel.

LONDON (Reuters) - Uber [UBER.UL] lodged a court appeal on Friday to overturn a decision by London’s transport regulator that stripped the taxi app of its operating license in its most important European market, the first stop on what is set to be a long legal road.

Transport for London (TfL) shocked the Silicon Valley firm last month by deeming it unfit to run a taxi service and refusing to renew its license, citing its approach to reporting serious criminal offences and background checks on drivers.

The appeal marks the beginning of months of legal wrangling in a battle that had pitched one of the world’s richest cities against a Silicon Valley giant known for forays into new markets across the globe that have stoked competition for established cab companies.

Uber, whose backers include Goldman Sachs and BlackRock, will defend its London business at a hearing most likely due on Dec. 11, a spokesman at Britain’s Judicial Office told Reuters.

Uber, criticized by London Mayor Sadiq Khan for employing an “an army of PR experts and an army of lawyers”, said that it hoped to keep talking to TfL to find a way forward.

“While we have today filed our appeal so that Londoners can continue using our app, we hope to continue having constructive discussions with Transport for London,” an Uber spokesman said.

“As our new CEO has said, we are determined to make things right.”

Only a month into the job, Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi met TfL Commissioner Mike Brown for talks earlier in October, which both sides said were constructive as the $70-billion firm tries to repair its relationship with the regulator.

Uber’s license expired on Sep. 30 but its roughly 40,000 drivers in the British capital will be able to continue operating until the appeals process is exhausted.

Friday’s appeal was submitted to Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London as part of the first stage of a legal process which could take months or years to reach a conclusion.

The filing is a short notification of Uber’s intention to appeal rather than the detailed grounds.

DISRUPTIVE YEAR

London’s decision is one of the most serious setbacks to the taxi app, which has been forced to quit several countries, including Denmark and Hungary, and faced regulatory battles in multiple U.S. states and around the world.

It comes after a tumultuous few months for the San Francisco start-up that led to former CEO and co-founder Travis Kalanick being forced out after a series of boardroom controversies.

Earlier this month, the firm’s boss in Britain Jo Bertram said she would quit the taxi hailing app according to emails seen by Reuters.

The company is also embroiled in court action against two drivers who won a tribunal case last year entitling them to workers’ rights such as the minimum wage and holiday entitlement, threatening its business model. Uber is appealing the verdict.

TfL said on Friday it would not comment before the licensing appeal hearing due later this year.

A spokesman at the Mayor of London’s office said that Khan, a politician from the opposition Labour Party who is also chairman of TfL, continued to back the license decision and that all private hire firms must play by the rules.

He said during a monthly question time session on Thursday that the transport authority would defend its decision during the legal action.

“The courts now will consider the appeal from Uber and of course TfL will defend the decision they made,” he said.",Uber embarks on legal battle to retain London license,https://www.reuters.com/article/uber-britain/uber-embarks-on-legal-battle-to-retain-london-licence-idINKBN1CI186

BRASÍLIA (Reuters) - Mercosul e Canadá irão anunciar em dezembro a abertura de negociações sobre um acordo de livre comércio, durante a reunião ministerial da Organização Mundial do Comércio (OMC) em Buenos Aires, disseram à Reuters duas fontes envolvidas nas negociações.

Do lado sul-americano, os mandatos para negociar já foram aprovados pelos quatro governos dos países membros do bloco (Brasil, Argentina, Uruguai e Paraguai). Pela parte canadense, de acordo com uma das fontes, falta apenas o passo final, que seria a consulta formal ao gabinete do primeiro-ministro Justin Trudeau.

A avaliação das fontes brasileiras é que o acordo com o Canadá tem potencial para andar rapidamente. Há interesses dos dois lados, ao mesmo tempo em que não há grandes sensibilidades, como no caso da agricultura para a União Europeia.

“Nas conversas preliminares nunca identificamos obstáculos intransponíveis”, disse a fonte.

As primeiras conversas começaram em 2010, por iniciativa do Canadá. Em 2012, o governo brasileiro aprovou na Câmara de Comércio Exterior (Camex) o mandato para iniciar as negociações, mas o processo não foi adiante.

“Naquele momento outros sócios não estavam tão interessados”, explicou a fonte. “Agora os países têm mais afinidade e mais interesse em buscar outros acordos.”

Uma reunião será marcada para novembro, em Brasília, para fechar os últimos detalhes do mandato de negociação -- uma plataforma de onde se parte para começar a negociar.

O governo canadense pediu que se atualizasse questões relativas a cláusulas ambientais e outros temas relacionados ao que chamam de “progressive trade”, o que foi aceito sem problemas pelo Mercosul.

Apesar do comércio pouco significativo do bloco com o Canadá, a possibilidade de acordo entusiasma os negociadores do Mercosul pela possibilidade de crescimento. Dados levantados do Ministério da Indústria, Comércio e Serviços (Mdic) mostram que em 2016 a corrente de comércio foi de apenas 5,88 bilhões de dólares entre o Mercosul e o Canadá. Com os Estados Unidos, por exemplo, foi de 59,8 bilhões no mesmo ano.

“É pequeno porque o Canadá é um país com população pequena. São apenas 36 milhões de pessoas. Mas é um mercado com alto poder aquisitivo, e um mercado não explorado”, disse uma das fontes.

O bloco tem superávit com os canadenses. Em 2016, foram exportados 3,6 bilhões de dólares e importados 2,3 bilhões. O grosso do comércio regional é com o Brasil, que em 2016 concentrou 4,2 bilhões de dólares da corrente de comércio e 2,37 bilhões em exportações. No caso do Brasil, a exportação de produtos manufaturados domina a pauta de comércio, representando 53 por cento das exportações.

Nas conversas com os setores produtivos, o governo brasileiro identificou oportunidades não apenas na área industrial, mas também na agricultura. “Eles têm muita produção agrícola mas, até por conta do clima, diferente da nossa”, disse a fonte.

De acordo com os negociadores, as tarifas canadenses são de um modo geral baixas, com exceção da agricultura, onde há um grande potencial para melhorar. Nas demais, há questões não tarifárias, de normas técnicas e sanitárias, que costumam ser menos complicadas de resolver.

Esta semana, durante a reunião ministerial da OMC em Marrakech, o ministro das Relações Exteriores, Aloysio Nunes, teve um encontro com ministro do Comércio Internacional do Canadá, François-Philippe Champagne, para tratar do acordo. Em nota, o Itamaraty afirmou que os ministros “reconheceram que existe um forte potencial para o desenvolvimento de uma relação comercial mais ambiciosa através do aumento dos fluxos de comércio e investimento”.

Consultado pela Reuters, o governo do Canadá afirmou, através de um porta-voz de Champagne, que o país “reafirma que existe uma oportunidade no acordo com o Mercosul e que irá continuar com as conversas exploratórias”.","Mercosul e Canadá anunciam em dezembro abertura de negociações sobre acordo de livre comércio, dizem fontes",https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idBRKBN1CI1PX-OBRBS

Britain’s largest private bank wants to update not only its technology and ways of doing business, but also its 325-year-old brand to sell more products to more customers, tackle competition from international rivals and boost revenues.

Chief Executive Peter Flavel aims to increase Coutts’ appeal to a younger generation of wealthy Britons, including vloggers, gamers and other entrepreneurs getting rich from new technologies, as well as its traditional clients.

“We don’t want to live in the history or live in the past, we need to be modern and contemporary and relevant today,” Flavel told Reuters.

”The client base we have here is of course what you would expect, the landed estates and the gentry, that traditional wealth, and that’s a big part of what we’ve had as a bank.

“But the bigger part of what we do today is banking entrepreneurs and helping them develop their businesses.”

Australian-born Flavel, previously CEO of private wealth management at JP Morgan in Asia and global head of Standard Chartered’s private bank, was brought in by parent Royal Bank of Scotland 18 months ago.

Since his arrival, he has pushed for stronger cooperation between the private bank and the universal services offered by RBS.

He has also been exploring more quirky ways to update Coutts’ image.

One of these more off-beat projects is the expansion of a roof garden at Coutts’ central London headquarters, adding fresh fruit and vegetable patches and three bee hives, which produce Coutts-branded honey soon to be given out to new customers.

“We’re having a bit of a think about how we might just be a little different,” Flavel said.

“Banks are serious and boring and risk averse. You can create that little sense of not taking yourself too seriously at - and this is the big one - the appropriate time, because you’re dealing with people’s money.”

Flavel has focused on tapping RBS’s commercial bank for client referrals, which has helped to broaden its customer base.

Entrepreneurs now make up a growing portion of its business, and outside of London account for 80 percent of the client base.

Coutts is adding 1,700-1,800 new clients annually. But RBS’s wealth management division has struggled to translate a 2.8 percent increase in customer deposits in the first half of this year into revenues, which fell by around 3 percent.

“Private banking is not a volume game,” Flavel said. “New clients are interesting but new clients with significant amounts of their relationship with us are much more interesting.”

To that aim, the bank’s specialist advisers now have to work across traditional product silos to try to tap into the whole spectrum of their clients’ financial needs, from borrowing to wealth management.

COMPETITORS

But Coutts also now faces competition from international rivals, including Deutsche Bank and Julius Baer, which are expanding private banking in Britain.

After suffering big losses at their investment banks from huge bets on the U.S. housing market and costly legal settlements, many European lenders are turning to private banking in the hope that the traditionally low-risk business can provide more stable returns.

But the business of managing the fortunes of the world’s wealthy is not without its challenges.

Many clients are still risk adverse even 10 years on from the financial crisis, while the increased competition from traditional banks as well as online platforms is putting pressure on the amount banks can charge for their services.

Private banking accounts for less than 5 percent of the profits of state-backed RBS, which chose to keep Coutts through a major restructuring over the past decade. But it sold off Coutts’ international operations in 2015, leaving it to focus solely on Britain’s wealth market, worth about 825 billion pounds.

CHANGING TIMES

Since its establishment in 1692, the core of Coutts’ business has been looking after the wealth of Britain’s aristocracy, landed gentry and celebrities.

The latter includes sports stars - a significant number of the England football team for instance.

But when it comes to attracting up-and-coming wealth, Sebastian Dovey, analyst at wealth management research firm Scorpio Partnership, said Coutts has a challenge ahead.

“They (Coutts) can play the prestige card ... but that doesn’t rub so well now as perhaps it used to,” he said.

“We’re in a much more abrasive consumer market. They’re top quartile but they have to understand that they don’t have a natural right to winning entrepreneurs.”

Helped by cost-cutting, RBS’s private banking division boosted its operating profit by about 60 percent to 82 million pounds in the first half of the year, but its cost-income ratio remains high, at 72.3 percent.

For Flavel, some small costs are worth absorbing to enhance clients’ experience, such as exchange rate fees for users of its multi-currency card.

Coutts is also spending 20 million pounds a year on digital initiatives, including a new online platform launched earlier this year that lets clients execute their own investments.

“We need that mixture of the history and the future,” Flavel said. “That’s exciting and a bit of a challenge at the same time.”",Queen's bank goes for younger clients as rivals try to steal crown,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-rbs-coutts/queens-bank-goes-for-younger-clients-as-rivals-try-to-steal-crown-idINKBN1CI0I8?il=0

BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Romania’s ruling Social Democrats replaced three ministers on Friday who resigned in what analysts said was indicative of a rift between Prime Minister Mihai Tudose and powerful party leader Liviu Dragnea.

The party also pledged to focus on passing justice laws that have worried the European Commission because of their implications for political control.

Nominally, the government reshuffle came because Tudose, who requested the resignations, said corruption allegations surrounding outgoing Deputy Prime Minister Sevil Shhaideh and European Funds Minister Rovana Plumb had created problems for his government with Brussels.

But analysts said it underscored tension between Tudose and Dragnea, who holds a tight grip over party ranks but was ruled out of being prime minister by a prior criminal conviction.

The reshuffle comes a little over three months since the cabinet was sworn in, a period in which ruling party tensions have stalled policymaking in one of the European Union’s poorest and least developed states.

The Social Democrats swept a parliamentary election in December last year on promises to cut taxes and raise public sector and wages. In February, their attempts to weaken anti-corruption legislation triggered the country’s largest street protests in decades.

In August, the justice minister proposed a judicial overhaul that could put the justice system under political control, which has raised concerns with the European Commission.

On Friday, Dragnea said the ruling coalition will meet on Monday to decide how to push forward the overhaul, as well as plans to set up a sovereign wealth fund and other measures.

“The justice legislation ... will be adopted in this parliamentary session,” he told reporters.

Shhaideh, a close ally of Dragnea and currently under investigation in a land transfer case, will be replaced by Senator Paul Stanescu. Plumb will be replaced as European funds minister by Marius Nica, who has worked with her in the past.

Transport Minister Razvan Cuc, who resigned after a poor performance will be replaced by senior party member Felix Stroe. Stanescu and Stroe are seen as power brokers within the party.

At Tudose’s urging, Shhaideh will continue working for the government as an adviser.

Lee was jailed for bribery.

The surprise resignation of Samsung’s chip and display head came as he was expected to take a bigger role following Lee’s arrest in February and the departures of other key executives in the wake of the bribery scandal.

The move came on the same day the South Korean smartphone maker forecast record third-quarter operating profit on the back of the memory chip business which Kwon was instrumental in building into the world leader.

“The timing is nonsensical. Samsung tipped record earnings, it’s going to be better in the fourth-quarter, and all that’s been driven by Kwon’s components business,” said Park Ju-gun, head of research firm CEO Score.

Kwon, 64, is seen as Samsung Group No. 2. As well as being chairman of the board and a board director, he heads the components business - including memory chips - and the display business.

In a statement, the man known as “Mr Chip” said the time had come to “start anew with new spirit and young leadership”.

“We are fortunately making record earnings right now, but this is the fruit of past decisions and investments; we are not able to even get close to finding new growth engines by reading future trends right now,” he added.

The world’s biggest maker of memory chips, smartphones and TVs is set to smash its annual profit record this year, thanks partly to soaring demand for memory chips. Semiconductors were Samsung’s top earner in the three months through June, making a record 8 trillion won ($7.20 billion).

The global chip industry is undergoing a major shift with Japan’s Toshiba Corp partnering with home rival SK Hynix, and other firms consolidating in search of new growth areas like artificial intelligence and automobiles.

A Samsung Electronics spokeswoman declined comment on the exact timing of succession and potential successors for Kwon’s roles.

路透10月11日 - “埃及遍地必来七个大丰年，随后又要来七个荒年，甚至埃及地都忘了先前的丰收。”

圣经中，约瑟这样解读法老梦到的七头肥美的牛和七头干瘦的牛，但他可能也是在说油市。(创世纪第41章29-30节)

就像尼罗河是否泛滥决定法老的王国经历丰足还是饥馑一样，油市也在供应的短缺与过剩之间反复。

“油市的问题总是(供应)不是太多就是太少，”纽约大学经济学教授Myron Watkins在80年前写道(石油：稳定还是保护？ Watkins, 1937)。

古埃及食物供应的充足或短缺交替出现，但很少有“刚好够用”的时候，因此埃及用谷仓来储存丰年的多余供应，以备歉收时使用。

油市也把供应过剩时的库存留到供应不足时使用，油价也随之有规律地从正价差转至逆价差。

油市的自然状态不是刚刚够用，正好像埃及食物供应的自然状态也不是刚好够用。

石油输出国组织(OPEC)和包括我自己在内的其他评论人士都把限产和降低过剩库存的过程看做是市场“恢复平衡”的一环。

将调节石油生产、消费及库存的一整套复杂过程，以“再平衡”简称，虽然很便利，但这并不代表整个过程的终点就是一个“平衡”的油市。

油市很少平衡，更从来没能长期维持平衡。

在以往，油市出现一些供应过剩及正价差时期后，很快就回到供应短缺和逆价差时期。

图表：reut.rs/2kFtoix

目前看来正在上演类似的情况，布兰特及其他国际原油品种原本从2014年年中以来皆维持正价差，但在过去三个月转为逆价差。

多数分析师已开始担心重新出现供应过剩、原油库存恢复上升、以及石油输出国组织(OPEC)及其盟友2018年将如何退出现行的限产协议。

但仍存在的一个可能是，当石油需求强劲成长时，油市正要进入供应短缺时期，供应步伐将落后，而石油库存将紧俏。

**正向反馈**

油价很少能够平顺地适应石油产量或消费的变动(“Essentials of petroleum: a key to oil economics”, Frankel, 1946)。

石油产量、消费、库存、及油价之间的关系，具有循环因果或反馈过程特色(“Cybernetics, or command and control in the animal and the human”, Wiener, 1948)。

其中一些过程促进油市稳定，并倾向于抑制最初干扰(“负反馈”)，但是其他过程则破坏稳定，并且倾向于放大初始冲击(“正反馈”)。

正反馈过程可能在中短期内造成市况极其不稳。2014至2016年油市下滑期间，正反馈使得跌势更加严重并延迟了再平衡。

例如在供应方面，油价下跌导致劳动力、原材料和服务合同的价格下降，抑制了生产商对价格下降的反应(tmsnrt.rs/2xxifGQ)。

在需求方面，产油国的经济衰退，以及钻井活动萧条和全球货运放缓，都大大降低了石油消耗，尤其是柴油，结果加剧了供应过剩。

但正反馈是把双刃剑，正如它可以加深和拉长跌势，同样也可能加快和放大涨势。

油市再平衡可能会推动成本上涨，产油国的消费增长加快，以及货运活动加速成长。

在原油市场，就像法老治下的埃及一样，一切往往都同时正确(或者错误)，在商品周期内造成剧烈波动。

**上涨要素**

2018和2019年油市周期性好转的所有要素都已齐备。

全球主要经济体都在经历近十年来最强劲同步扩张，世界贸易量的增长速度也创下2011年以来最快。

全球整体经济扩张加上相对较低的油价，促成了石油需求激增，令过去三年的石油消费增速快于长期均值水平。

根据国际能源署(IEA)的数据，全球石油消费量在2017年预估将增加160万桶/日，2016年和2015年的消费增幅则分别为130万桶/日和190万桶/日。

IEA的9月报告称，预计2018年全球石油消费进一步增加140万桶/日。

受强劲需求和沙特限制供应的影响，全球原油和油品库存正在迅速下降。

库存虽然仍高于五年均值，但正在向五年均值靠拢。考虑到2012年以来惊人的消费增长，五年均值的水平终究可能还是过低。

关键的问题在于，石油生产商将以多快的速度对需求增强和石油库存趋紧做出回应。

由于大多数生产方已经接近100%的全产能运营，因此未来两年的产出增长将主要来自于沙特阿拉伯(和其亲密盟友科威特)、内乱冲突迭起的非洲，或是美国页岩油生产商。

沙特拥有闲置产能，但该国在增加市场供应前，会希望先看到油价走高，特别是在沙特阿美部分资产临近上市之际。

尼日利亚和利比亚也拥有闲置产能，但国内安全形势堪忧，使得两国未来增产存在很大的不确定性。

美国页岩油生产商也可以提高产量，但他们的成本正在升高，股东也越来越要求他们侧重于提高回报而非增加产量。

**接下来会怎样？**

2018/19年油市可能出现的景象如下：

* 如果OPEC减产协议执行率下降、美国页岩油产量又迅速增加，超过了需求增长，那么油价涨势和逆价差可能会消失。

* 如果OPEC顺利退出减产协议，页岩油产量增长追平需求增长，那么油价和日历价差可能将继续区间盘整。

* 如果消费增长超过供应，而且库存持续下降，那么至少油价会进一步上涨，逆价差也会扩大。

许多分析师和交易商的预期带有追溯性质，假设未来将重演刚刚发生的景象，所以他们往往会错过转折点。

2011-2014年繁荣期后，市场预期过于乐观，因此许多分析师和交易商没有料到跌势已经迫近，之后还低估了下跌的幅度和持续时间。

但在这次大跌后市场预期或许已经变得过于悲观，交易商目前低估了油市反弹的前景。

当然，考虑到页岩油生产商和OPEC顺利进行调整以满足需求增长，油市总是有可能拥有充足供应。

LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - Britain must commit to paying what it owes to the European Union before talks can begin about a future relationship with the bloc after Brexit, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said on Friday.

“The British are discovering, as we are, day after day new problems. That’s the reason why this process will take longer than initially thought,” Juncker said in a speech to students in his native Luxembourg.

“We cannot find for the time being a real compromise as far as the remaining financial commitments of the UK are concerned. As we are not able to do this we will not be able to say in the European Council in October that now we can move to the second phase of negotiations,” Juncker said.

“They have to pay, they have to pay, not in an impossible way. I‘m not in a revenge mood. I‘m not hating the British.”

“Ask the Sexpert” follows Dr Mahinder Watsa as he potters about his Mumbai apartment, peers at his computer and reads emails that tells him, among others, about someone with a compulsive habit of adding urine to his tea.

The film, which will be screened at the Mumbai Film Festival this year, was shot over four years by film-maker Vaishali Sinha and is a wonderful peek into the life of a columnist who has increasingly become part of pop culture in India’s financial capital, where his column is published in the Mumbai Mirror newspaper.

The column, a small strip in the inside pages that is featured every day, has three or four questions, mostly revolving around size, girth and how not to get pregnant. Watsa answers even the most outlandish questions with deadpan humour and in doing so, has found fans all over the city and beyond.

In the film, Sinha captures how young girls and their mothers gush over Watsa’s column, tell him how much they appreciate what he is doing and then line up to click selfies with him.

Sinha set out to make a film on Indians talking about sex because “it is the most universally shared experience.”

“While researching a character for a film idea on urban sexuality, I first met Dr. Watsa in early 2013. I pretty much knew immediately after my first meeting with him that I had found the character for my film,” Sinha told Reuters in an email interview.

Handout picture of Dr Mahinder Watsa

The anti-thesis to Watsa in the film emerges in the form of Pratibha Naithani, a professor in a top Mumbai college who says she is on a mission to protect Indian culture. Naithani is mortified by Watsa’s matter-of-fact advice to people on all matters sexual, saying he openly encourages promiscuity.

Sinha said she didn’t start off trying to pit Naithani against Watsa, but added the college professor emerged as the “other camp” quite naturally.

Handout picture from 'Ask the Sexpert'

“I didn’t choose Pratibha, her work chose me. A lot around the story lines I was exploring had ties to her or led to her and so her name would crop up to a point I couldn’t ignore. The petition for the banning of the 2009 nationwide sex education curriculum was one example. And it felt necessary that I reach out to her,” Sinha said.

The documentary features interviews with Watsa’s friends and family, but the camera mostly follows him as he goes about his day. He peers at his computer with a magnifying glass, attends seminars on sex education and counsels patients who come to him after having read his column.

Sinha said making the film made her aware that Indians are willing to talk about sex even if it was to reveal their lack of experience and knowledge, something that is evident from the kind of questions Watsa gets on a daily basis.

“I found out that for all the paranoia around ‘too much sex’, there are many, many people in between, living within a spectrum of sexual experiences and highs and lows. With that comes questions that are necessary to be talked about and discussed to alleviate stress and anxiety in society,” she said.

REUTERS/Yuri Gripas

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is likely to take a major step against the international nuclear deal with Iran on Friday, laying out a more aggressive approach to Iranian activities in the Middle East that risks upsetting U.S. relations with European allies.

“It is time for the entire world to join us in demanding that Iran’s government end its pursuit of death and destruction,” Trump said in a White House statement that flagged key elements of the strategy.

He is to present his plan in a 12:45 p.m. EDT (1645 GMT)speech at the White House, the product of weeks of internal discussions between him and his national security team.

U.S. officials said Trump was expected to announce that he will not certify the 2015 nuclear accord between Iran and six world powers, one he has called the “worst deal ever” as it was not, in his view, in the U.S. national interest.

Trump found himself under immense pressure as he considered de-certifying the deal, a move that would ignore warnings from inside and outside his administration that to do so would risk undermining U.S. credibility abroad.

He had formally reaffirmed it twice before but aides said he was reluctant to do so a third time.

De-certification would not pull the United States out of the deal but would give the Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions on Tehran that were suspended under the pact, negotiated during the administration of President Barack Obama.

Michael McCaul, chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Homeland Security Committee, told Reuters he thinks Trump “is likely to not completely pull out of the deal, but decertify compliance.”

If Washington quits the deal, that will be the end of it and global chaos could ensue, Iran’s influential parliament speaker, Ali Larijani, was quoted by the Russian news agency TASS as saying during a visit to St Petersburg on Friday.

“FOOTPRINTS ON THE GROUND”

U.N. nuclear inspectors say Iran is in compliance with the accord, which limited the scope of Iran’s nuclear program to help ensure it could not be put to developing bombs in exchange for a lifting of international sanctions on Tehran.

Trump says Tehran is in violation of the spirit of the agreement and has done nothing to rein in its ballistic missile program or its financial and military support for the Lebanese Shi‘ite movement Hezbollah and other militant groups.

White House Chief of Staff John Kelly said on Thursday the U.S. approach toward Iran is to work with allies in the Middle East to contain Tehran’s activities.

“We have footprints on the ground, naval and Air Force is there to just demonstrate our resolve, our friendship, and try to deter anything that any country out there may do,” Kelly told reporters.

European allies warn of a split with the United States over the nuclear agreement, in part because they are benefiting economically from a relaxation of sanctions.

A variety of European allies, including the leaders of Britain and France, have personally appealed to Trump to re-certify the nuclear accord for the sake of allied unity.

Germany’s government pledged on Friday to work for continued unity if Trump de-certified the deal as Berlin remain convinced the agreement was an important tool to prevent Iran developing nuclear weapons.

Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel underlined German views in a telephone call with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson late on Thursday, his spokeswoman Maria Adebahr told reporters.

Gabriel said on Thursday U.S. behavior was driving a wedge between Europe and its close ally United States and bringing Europeans closer to Russia and China. “It’s imperative that Europe sticks together on this issue,” said Gabriel.

Russian President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said on Friday that if the United States ditched the nuclear pact, “this will damage the atmosphere of predictability, security, stability and non-proliferation in the entire world”.

U.S. MOVE AGAINST REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS

McCaul said he expected Trump also to announce some kind of action against the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IGRC), the country’s most powerful security entity. Trump is under a legal mandate to impose U.S. economic sanctions on the Revolutionary Guards as a whole by Oct. 31 or waive them.

U.S. sanctions could seriously hurt the IRGC as it controls large swaths of Iran’s economy. The Guards’ foreign paramilitary and espionage wing, the Quds Force, is under U.S. sanctions, as is the Quds Force commander, other officials and associated individuals and entities.

The deputy Quds commander, Brigadier-General Esmail Ghaani, was quoted by Iran’ Tasnim news agency on Friday as saying Trump’s threats would “damage” the United States.

“We are not a war-mongering country. But any military action against Iran will be regretted...We have buried many...like Trump and know how to fight against America,” Ghaani said.

“EMBARRASSMENT”

The 2015 nuclear agreement, signed by the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China, the European Union and Iran, has been denounced by Trump as “an embarrassment”.

European officials have categorically ruled out renegotiating the deal but have said they share Trump’s concerns about Iran’s destabilizing influence in the Middle East.

China has said it hopes the agreement will stay intact.

Israel, Iran’s arch-adversary in the Middle East, welcomed Trump’s anticipated announcement on Friday but voiced doubt that the tougher tack by Washington could turn around the Islamic Republic.

The International Atomic Energy Agency concluded that Iran secretly researched a nuclear warhead until 2009, which Tehran denies. Iran has always insisted its uranium enrichment activity is for civilian energy purposes, not for atomic bombs.

The threat of new U.S. action has prompted a public display of unity from rival factions among Iran’s rulers. Iran will react sharply to any U.S. move against the nuclear deal with global powers, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told the Iranian parliament on Wednesday.

Going into the high-profile encounter, Juergen Klopp’s side sit seventh in the table following three wins from seven league games, while United trail leaders Manchester City on goal difference after recording six wins and a draw.

A leaky defence and a failure to convert their goal-scoring opportunities have hindered the Merseyside club but Can believes Liverpool can rise to the occasion and regain some momentum with a win in their first home game since mid-September.

“It will be a very, very tough game because Manchester United have done very well this season so far. But we know we are strong too and we are really looking forward to the game,” Can told Liverpool’s official website. (www.liverpoolfc.com)

”We have to be hard in the tackles, we have to try to dominate the game and score the goals when we create chances. We will see what happens.

“It’s always special to play at Anfield and now against Man United... We are really excited and looking forward to the game and to play at Anfield again.”

Liverpool’s poor finishing has led them to one win in their last seven games across all competitions and Can is well aware that positive results will only come if the side can improve their goal-scoring record.

“The last few weeks before the international break were not the best for us because we didn’t get the results we wanted. But it was not that bad -- we played good football and in most of the games we dominated but couldn’t score,” Can added.

”But we have to all stick together and try to give our best on the pitch -- then we will come back to winning ways.

“We try, we play well and we create very good chances. We have to score the goals and if we do, we’ll be back on track.”

Asked by a reporter if he could envision maintaining free trade with Canada if NAFTA talks sour with Mexico, Trump said: “Oh sure, absolutely. It’s possible we won’t be able to reach a deal with one or the other, but in the meantime we’ll make a deal with one.”

Trump added that a “very creative” deal was still possible to benefit all three countries.

Trump’s comments came at a White House meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who was in Washington to promote NAFTA’s benefits as a new round of renegotiations began near Washington.

Asked about Trump’s comments at a news conference later, Trudeau said he was still optimistic about the chances of modernizing the 1994 trade pact.

”I continue to believe in NAFTA ... so saying, we are ready for anything, and we will continue to work diligently to protect Canadian interests,” Trudeau said.

Trudeau added that Canada was “very much aware of and very braced for” Trump’s unpredictability, but his government would work in a “thoughtful, meaningful way towards getting a good deal.”

Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo, speaking on Mexican radio, praised Trump’s comments as “very balanced” to include the possibility of a deal with either country and hold out hope for a creative solution.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Tuesday accused Trump’s administration of trying to sabotage the talks with “poison pill proposals,” including demands for more favorable treatment for the U.S. side on car production, and a “sunset clause” to force regular negotiations.

In his appearance with Trudeau, Trump said: “We’ll see what happens” when asked whether NAFTA was doomed.

“It’s possible we won’t be able to make a deal, and it’s possible that we will,” he said. “We’ll see if we can do the kind of changes that we need. We have to protect our workers, and in all fairness, the prime minister wants to protect Canada and his people also.”

U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, one of Trump’s top trade advisers, downplayed the chances that a NAFTA termination would become necessary.

“We don’t hope it will, we don’t desire that it will, we don’t believe that it will, but it is at least a conceptual possibility as we go forward,” Ross said.

But U.S. and Mexican corporate chief executives gathered in Mexico City said they would be better off with no NAFTA than be saddled with a “bad agreement.”

AGGRESSIVE PROPOSALS

Trade experts said the NAFTA talks were likely to stall in the face of aggressive U.S. attempts to sharply increase content requirements for autos and auto parts.

People briefed on U.S. proposals to be presented this week said Washington was seeking to sharply lift North American content threshold in car manufacturing.

The proposals call for North American content overall to rise to 85 percent from the current 62.5 percent. In addition, the United States wants to add a new 50 percent U.S.-specific content requirement, something that was not in the earlier agreements.

“These will be met with widespread opposition from Canada and Mexico. I think it’s just a bridge too far,” said Wendy Cutler, the Asia Society’s Washington policy director and former chief U.S. negotiator for the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal canceled by Trump.

The U.S. side sees strengthening the rules of origin for the auto industry as a way to bring back some auto parts production, including electronics, from Asia. But Mexico strongly opposes a U.S.-specific content requirement, which would limit the growth of its own car industry.

The difficult issue of rules of origin will be addressed mostly at the end of the current talks, according to a schedule obtained by Reuters. The negotiations were extended on Wednesday by two days to Oct 17.

Other U.S. proposals opposed by Canada, Mexico and U.S. business interests include the five-year sunset provision, radical changes to NAFTA’s dispute arbitration systems, changes to intellectual property provisions and new protections for U.S. seasonal produce growers.

U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said on Wednesday the three nations had completed their negotiations on company competition policy, reaching an agreement that goes beyond previous U.S. trade deals to ensure “certain rights and transparency under each nation’s competition laws.”","Trump says open to bilateral Canada, Mexico pacts if NAFTA talks fail",https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCAKBN1CG0DV-OCADN

NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Facebook could do with more Sheryl Sandberg. Mark Zuckerberg’s right-hand woman on Thursday deftly fielded questions about Russia-backed ads and the social network’s broader role in society. It was a notable contrast to the bumbling way her boss handles the limelight, especially since the $500 billion company has come under greater scrutiny.

Sandberg traveled to Washington to meet with U.S. legislators about the bombshell findings that Facebook ran more than 3,000 political ads placed by fake agencies with alleged ties to the Kremlin. The agitprop was designed to sway the U.S. presidential election last year. During an interview with news website Axios, Sandberg said the company is working with investigators to help make the trove public.

Although she parried certain sensitive questions about how much Facebook knew, Sandberg conveyed that it is troubled by the abuse on the system. She also made clear that divisive information would continue to be a part of its powerful newsfeed. If legitimate organizations had purchased many of the same ads, they would have run.

The chief operating officer’s polish was a welcome display, especially after Zuckerberg’s knee-jerk reaction – followed much later by an apology – that it was crazy to think misinformation spread on Facebook might have affected the presidential vote. More broadly, Sandberg has been less visible on important public debates roiling the increasingly influential company.

For example, Zuckerberg initially took the lead explaining how Facebook planned to be more open about political advertising and to work with legislators. Speaking on a live online stream dressed in a T-shirt gave a casual air that undercut the important message. Another botched video showed him breezily using virtual reality to visit devastated Puerto Rico. The Facebook founder’s nationwide listening tour also has been clumsy and led to growing speculation that he aspires to public office.

Either way, he’s not faring especially well with this phase of 13-year-old Facebook. The intensity only will grow as U.S. and European authorities dig into how the company uses data to target advertising. Zuckerberg was smart enough to hire Sandberg from Google in 2008, back when only 66 million people were on Facebook and the company was still privately owned and valued at just $15 billion. It may be time to give her an even bigger role.",Breakingviews - Facebook could do with more Sheryl Sandberg,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-politics-breakingviews/breakingviews-facebook-could-do-with-more-sheryl-sandberg-idUSKBN1CH2VP

The Trump administration on Friday disclosed the date of the subsidies cutoff after announcing late on Thursday the most dramatic action the president has taken to undercut Democratic former President Barack Obama’s signature 2010 healthcare law.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the administration will not make the next payment to insurers scheduled for next Wednesday. The payments cost $7 billion this year and were estimated to be $10 billion in 2018, according to congressional analysts.

Trump has made the payments, guaranteed to insurers under Obamacare to help lower out-of-pocket medical expenses for low-income consumers, each month since taking office in January. But he has repeatedly threatened to cut them off and disparaged them as a “bailout” for insurance companies.

The move drew swift condemnation from congressional Democrats, who accused Trump of sabotaging the law, and threats from Democratic state attorneys general in New York and California to take legal action.

Trump, a Republican who promise as a candidate last year to dismantle the law formally called the Affordable Care Act, urged opponents to reach out to him to make a deal.

“The Democrats ObamaCare is imploding. Massive subsidy payments to their pet insurance companies has stopped. Dems should call me to fix!” Trump said in a post on Twitter early on Friday, calling the law “a broken mess.”

Shares of hospitals and health insurers fell in premarket trading on Friday after Trump’s decision. Shares of Anthem Inc, Molina Healthcare Inc, Cigna Corp and Centene Corp, which are all offering plans on Obamacare markets for 2018, were all lower.

Trump has been frustrated by the failure of his fellow Republicans who control Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare despite seven years of promises to get rid of the law that has brought health insurance to 20 million people.

His decision is likely to please those in his hard-line conservative political base who detest the Affordable Care Act, which many Republicans have attacked as an unneeded government intrusion in Americans’ healthcare.

In a nod to that same constituency, the president signed an executive order on Thursday intended to make it easier for Americans to buy bare-bones health insurance plans exempt from Obamacare requirements.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi derided the subsidies cut-off in a joint statement, saying Trump would single-handedly push Americans’ healthcare premiums higher.

‘SPITEFUL ACT’

“It is a spiteful act of vast, pointless sabotage leveled at working families and the middle class in every corner of America,” they said. “Make no mistake about it, Trump will try to blame the Affordable Care Act, but this will fall on his back and he will pay the price for it.”

Insurers and proponents of Obamacare have implored Trump for months to commit to making the payments. Several insurers have cited uncertainty over the payments when hiking premiums for 2018 or exiting insurance markets altogether.

About 10 million people are enrolled in the plans via the law’s marketplace. Many of them receive subsidies, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.

The White House said late on Thursday that it could not lawfully pay the subsidies anymore. A White House statement said that based on guidance from the Justice Department, “the Department of Health and Human Services has concluded that there is no appropriation for cost-sharing reduction payments to insurance companies under Obamacare.”

“In light of this analysis, the Government cannot lawfully make the cost-sharing reduction payments,” it said.

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said he was prepared to lead other attorneys general in a lawsuit.

The payments were the subject of a lawsuit brought by House Republicans against the Obama administration that alleged they were unlawful because they needed to be appropriated by Congress. A judge ruled in favor of the Republicans, and the Obama administration appealed the ruling.

The Trump administration took over the lawsuit and had delayed deciding whether to continue the Obama administration’s appeal or terminate the subsidies, but in April Trump began threatening to stop the payments.

That case became more complicated in August when a U.S. appeals court allowed 16 Democratic state attorneys general to defend the payments and have a say in the legal fight.

In a court filing released on Friday, Sessions argued that while the law provided funds for tax credits it did allow cost-sharing payments for insurers. It was in that court filing that he announced next week’s cutoff date.

Meanwhile, the political turbulence has affected insurers’ decisions. Anthem, one of the largest remaining Obamacare insurers, in August scaled back its offerings in Nevada and Georgia and blamed the moves in part on uncertainty over the payments.

Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina earlier this year raised premiums by more than 20 percent, but said it would have raised premiums by only about 9 percent if Trump agreed to fund the payments.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that cutting off the payments would cause premiums to rise 20 percent in 2018, and that 5 percent of Americans would live in areas that do not have an insurer in the individual market in 2018.

Trump has taken other steps to undermine Obamacare. Last week, his administration allowed businesses and non-profit organizations to seek religious and moral exemptions from Obamacare’s mandate that employers provide coverage for women’s birth control.

The administration also slashed the Obamacare advertising and outreach budget and halved the open enrollment period.","Trump scraps key Obamacare subsidies, urges Democrats to fix 'broken mess'",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-healthcare-trump/trump-scraps-key-obamacare-subsidies-urges-democrats-to-fix-broken-mess-idUKKBN1CH2RR?il=0

(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) reported an 19 percent profit decline on Friday and weaker revenue than Wall Street had expected for the fourth consecutive quarter due to mortgage issues, sending its shares down 3.5 percent.

The third-largest U.S. lender, which has been embroiled in a prolonged scandal over its sales practices, said the dip in earnings came largely from a $1 billion accrual for a legal settlement over issues stemming from before the 2007-2009 financial crisis.

But revenue at the bank also suffered from a decline in mortgage banking revenue. Wells has been trying to bounce back from a scandal over dishonest sales practices that led to interrogations by U.S. Congress and fueled the ire of millions of consumers.

Wells Fargo’s earnings dropped to $4.6 billion during the third quarter. On an adjusted basis, its profit was $1.04 per share, scraping past estimates of $1.03, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Revenue fell 2 percent to $21.9 billion, hit by a 37 percent slump in mortgage banking. Analysts had forecast revenue of $22.4 billion.

Its shares fell 3.6 percent to $53.30 in early trading.

Wells Fargo’s operating efficiency ratio, which measures expenses as a portion of revenue, was 65.5 percent during the quarter and 63.1 percent year to date.

Expenses have been a key issue for investors, and the bank has targeted a full-year ratio of 60 percent to 61 percent in 2017, aiming to improve to 55 percent to 59 percent next year.

Wells is committed to its plan to cut costs by $4 billion by the end of 2019, half of which will be reinvested into businesses, Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said in a statement.

Net income in Wells Fargo’s community banking segment, the largest of its three major businesses and the one most directly impacted by the sales scandal, was $2.2 billion, down 31 percent from a year ago due to the legal charge.

SINGAPORE/LONDON (Reuters) - When OPEC leader Saudi Arabia pledged in May to do “whatever it takes” to defend world oil prices, it didn’t expect the market to be testing its resolve just one month later.

As the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended oil production cuts, oil prices fell 18 percent in just 20 days. OPEC members appear determined not to rush into deeper output curbs despite market pressure.

Oil traders have chosen to ignore bullish news for prices - including a long-awaited decline in U.S. oil stocks on Wednesday - and focused instead on negative factors such as a stubborn global glut.

As a result, the oil market posted its worst performance in the first six months in two decades effectively signaling its refusal to accept the effectiveness of the OPEC statement and its desire for further production cuts.

The “whatever it takes” pledge was made by Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur in early May, echoing a promise by European central banker Mario Draghi five years ago during his successful fight to defend the euro.

“You cannot fight the Federal Reserve but you can fight OPEC,” said Bob McNally, President of the Rapidan Group, a Washington-based energy market and policy consultant. “Somebody at OPEC has to cut further but no one is willing.”

The oil price decline and Saudi’s ability to defend prices also puts in the spotlight Saudi Arabia’s future king, 31-year-old Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who on Wednesday was made next in line to the throne by his father King Salman.

Prince Mohammed has been the ultimate Saudi energy decision-maker in the last two years and his strategy has shifted from orders to raise oil production to defend OPEC market share to curbing output to prop up prices.

WAITING IT OUT

Falih and other OPEC ministers and officials have said the cartel would not rush to deepen production cuts from the current four percent to arrest the price decline.

They said the group would rather wait until existing joint cuts with non-OPEC Russia finally result in a global stocks decline during the third quarter when demand for crude oil is usually strong.

OPEC and Russian sources also told Reuters there were few signs the group is preparing any extraordinary action ahead of a joint ministerial monitoring committee meeting in Russia at the end of July.

“We are in discussions with OPEC members to prepare ourselves for a new decision,” Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Wednesday. “But making decisions in this organization is very difficult because any decision will mean production cuts for the members,” he added.

An oil price surge at the end of the last decade and the start of this one spurred multiple oil production projects around the world, including from U.S. shale formations, resulting in global oversupply which sent prices tumbling from $120 per barrel in 2014 to below $30 per barrel last year.

OPEC and Russia tried to stabilize prices with cuts at around $50-$60 per barrel, but this week Brent prices fell toward $44 per barrel on persistent oversupply worries.

Traders and investors have raised their bets that the oil price will remain under pressure. The U.S. crude options market shows that the largest change since the OPEC meeting in holdings of derivatives maturing in December this year is in put, or sell, options at $45 a barrel.

Open interest, which shows the number of contracts that are open that have been traded but not yet liquidated, has risen by more than 5,000 lots in the last month to nearly 38,000 lots, equivalent to 38 million barrels of oil.

SHALE RETURNS AT FULL FORCE

""Global supply outages have fallen to a new low not seen in years. U.S. shale is returning at full force ... (and there are) high storage levels afloat and on land,"" said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for oil trading company Strong Petroleum.

The United States is not part of any supply reduction deals and is expected to increase production from shale formations by up to one million barrels per day or almost 10 percent of the country’s total crude output.

Berentsen said that unless OPEC deepened cuts or there was a large, unexpected production stoppage, prices will remain low.

“A deeper cut could arrest the price decline but OPEC needs to actually do it rather than just talk about it,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader.

OPEC sources have said that one of the options could be to include sooner rather than later OPEC members Nigeria and Libya in output cuts after their production grew steeply in recent months from levels previously depressed by unrest. At the moment Nigeria and Libya are exempt from the production cuts agreement.

MISTAKES OF THE PAST

Saudi Arabia, which has the cheapest production costs in the world, has repeatedly said it had learned from its mistakes of the past, when it drastically cut production in the 1980s to prop up prices but lost market share to rivals.

Earlier this year, Saudi officials told top independent U.S. oil firms in a closed-door meeting they should not assume OPEC would extend curbs to offset rising U.S. output.

Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA, said OPEC’s other choice would be to allow oil prices to drop to levels at which even “the newly slimline U.S. shale industry struggles to break even at”.

That may not be far off as prices approach cost levels for U.S. shale drillers, who are responsible for a rise in production that has undermined OPEC efforts.

“For the (Bakken shale), wells completed in 2016-2017, wellhead break-evens average around $38 per barrel,” said consultancy Rystad Energy, which specialises in exploration and production.

Besides closely following production patterns of its rivals, OPEC needs to keep a keen eye on global demand.

While major forecasters including the International Energy Agency sees global oil demand growing by a healthy 1.5 percent next year, there are signs growth is slowing in major Asian hubs China and India, the engines of demand growth in recent years.",Traders test OPEC 'whatever it takes' resolve to defend oil price,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-markets-slump/traders-test-opec-whatever-it-takes-resolve-to-defend-oil-price-idUSKBN19D1PX

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks advanced for a fourth straight day on Friday on expectations of broad-based global growth, while the dollar was on course for its worst week in five as investors awaited U.S. inflation data.

MSCI’s world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up 0.1 percent after hitting record highs on Thursday.

Earlier in Asia, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan hit a 10-year high.

European shares rose to their highest level in nearly four months, helped by some well-received earnings updates. The pan-European STOXX600 rose 0.3 percent and was set for its fifth straight week of gains as were world stocks.

Germany’s DAX index was up 0.1 percent, just below an all-time high hit in the previous session, while Britain’s FTSE eased back 0.1 percent after a record close on Thursday.

Wall Street futures indicated a positive open for the S&P 500 index.

“We’re seeing positive economic news even in the midst of so called geopolitical risk, I think investors are generally more optimistic right now,” said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA, referring to strong corporate earnings.

“Earnings in the second quarter were very positive, and looking beyond the impact of hurricanes, it seems like there’s improved fundamentals in the U.S. and Europe.”

Emerging market stocks were buoyant too as another 0.2 percent rise set their latest 6-year peak.

In currencies, the dollar stayed on the defensive after minutes from the last U.S. Federal Reserve meeting showed policymakers remained divided on U.S. inflation prospects.

The index which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies was flat ahead of consumer price inflation data, due at 1230 GMT.

“Abating political risks in the U.S. and growing Fed rate hike bets have pushed the dollar higher in recent weeks,” Credit Agricole strategists said in a note.

“With a December rate hike almost fully priced in by now, however, investors are starting to focus on the Fed’s still cautious forward guidance and hence the limited scope for a further increase of the dollar’s rate advantage.”

NEW FED CHIEF

On top of the near-term inflation readings, investors are looking at whom U.S. President Donald Trump will nominate as successor to Fed Chair Janet Yellen, whose term expires next February.

White House Chief of Staff John Kelly said on Thursday that Trump was “some time away” from making a decision, while another official said Trump had met with Stanford University economist John Taylor -- of economics text book Taylor-rule fame -- to discuss the job.

Meanwhile, the euro was flat but still set for its biggest weekly rise in a month. [FRX/]

European Central Bank policymakers broadly agreed to extend asset purchases at a lower volume at their October policy meeting with views converging on a nine-month extension, sources at the central bank told Reuters.

Britain’s pound rose to a 10-day high, boosted by a report in Germany’s Handelsblatt newspaper that the European Union could offer Britain a two-year transitional Brexit deal. [GBP/]

The most eye-catching move, however, was from digital currency Bitcoin as it soared by as much as 7.4 percent after Thursday’s 13 percent gain, to hit a record high of $5,846. It is up more than 450 percent this year.

The chief financial officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co said the firm was open-minded about the future potential use of digital currencies, appearing to dial back comments last month from his boss, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, who said bitcoin was a “fraud”.

Among commodities, copper prices held firm after hitting a one-month high on Thursday as optimism over the demand outlook from major consumer China fuelled buying.

London copper futures were at $6,898.50 a tonne, up 0.2 percent on the day.

Oil prices also climbed after data showed both U.S. crude production and inventories had declined. Crude was set for its sixth weekly rise in the last seven weeks. U.S. crude jumped 2 percent to $51.59 a barrel. Brent crude rose 2.2 percent to $57.50 a barrel.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices firmed on Friday as bullish news from strong Chinese oil imports to turmoil in the Middle East put Brent on track for a nearly 3 percent weekly gain.

The developments added to other signs that the market was finally rebalancing after years of excess, but analysts warned that the 2018 balance was still shaky.

Brent LCOc1 was at $57.20 at 1335 GMT, up 95 cents. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 was at $51.44 per barrel, up 84 cents from its last settlement.

The contracts were on track for weekly gains of more than 2 percent and 4 percent, respectively.

Chinese oil imports hit 9 million barrels per day (bpd) in September, data showed on Friday. Imports averaged 8.5 million bpd between January and September, solidifying China’s position as the world’s biggest oil importer.

“We woke up with the strong data from China. That’s on the supportive side,” said Olivier Jakob, managing director of oil consultancy PetroMatrix.

China’s huge imports have been strongly driven by purchases for its strategic petroleum reserves (SPR).

The nation has spent around $24 billion on building its crude reserves since 2015 and now holds around 850 million barrels of oil in inventory, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).

Unrest in Iraq, and possible U.S. action on the Iran nuclear deal, also underpinned prices.

On Friday, local television reported that tens of thousands of Kurdish fighters had deployed in the Kirkuk oil region to confront possible “threats” from Iraqi forces.

Tensions between the two, which traders fear could impinge on oil exports from the region, have been building since Iraq’s Kurds overwhelmingly backed independence in a Sept. 25 vote.

Later on Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to announce that he will not certify the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. The deal has to be re-certified every 90 days and is due for renewal on Sunday.

The step would give the U.S. Congress 60 days to decide whether to impose sanctions, but Iran’s parliament speaker told the TASS news agency that decertification would “be the end” of the deal and cause “global chaos”.

“U.S. sanctions could cut off a lot of Iranian oil trade finance,” Jeff Brown, president of energy consultancy FGE, told Reuters this week.

Despite the bullish signals, analysts warned that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries needed to extend its agreement to reduce oil output beyond its current March 2018 expiry date in order to clear stocks.

OPEC, with other producers including Russia, has agreed to production cuts of 1.8 million bpd.

“OPEC-led cuts have breathed new life into oil bulls but unless the organization digs deeper, the drawdown in global oil stockpiles will soon fizzle out,” broker PVM’s Stephen Brennock wrote.",Oil rallies on Chinese import boost and Mideast tensions,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil/oil-rallies-on-chinese-import-boost-and-mideast-tensions-idUSKBN1CI01K?il=0

REUTERS/Yuri Gripas

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is likely to take a major step against the international nuclear deal with Iran on Friday, laying out a more aggressive approach to Iranian activities in the Middle East that risks upsetting U.S. relations with European allies.

“It is time for the entire world to join us in demanding that Iran’s government end its pursuit of death and destruction,” Trump said in a White House statement that flagged key elements of the strategy.

He is to present his plan in a 12:45 p.m. EDT (1645 GMT)speech at the White House, the product of weeks of internal discussions between him and his national security team.

U.S. officials said Trump was expected to announce that he will not certify the 2015 nuclear accord between Iran and six world powers, one he has called the “worst deal ever” as it was not, in his view, in the U.S. national interest.

Trump found himself under immense pressure as he considered de-certifying the deal, a move that would ignore warnings from inside and outside his administration that to do so would risk undermining U.S. credibility abroad.

He had formally reaffirmed it twice before but aides said he was reluctant to do so a third time.

De-certification would not pull the United States out of the deal but would give the Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions on Tehran that were suspended under the pact, negotiated during the administration of President Barack Obama.

Michael McCaul, chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Homeland Security Committee, told Reuters he thinks Trump “is likely to not completely pull out of the deal, but decertify compliance.”

If Washington quits the deal, that will be the end of it and global chaos could ensue, Iran’s influential parliament speaker, Ali Larijani, was quoted by the Russian news agency TASS as saying during a visit to St Petersburg on Friday.

“FOOTPRINTS ON THE GROUND”

U.N. nuclear inspectors say Iran is in compliance with the accord, which limited the scope of Iran’s nuclear program to help ensure it could not be put to developing bombs in exchange for a lifting of international sanctions on Tehran.

Trump says Tehran is in violation of the spirit of the agreement and has done nothing to rein in its ballistic missile program or its financial and military support for the Lebanese Shi‘ite movement Hezbollah and other militant groups.

White House Chief of Staff John Kelly said on Thursday the U.S. approach toward Iran is to work with allies in the Middle East to contain Tehran’s activities.

“We have footprints on the ground, naval and Air Force is there to just demonstrate our resolve, our friendship, and try to deter anything that any country out there may do,” Kelly told reporters.

European allies warn of a split with the United States over the nuclear agreement, in part because they are benefiting economically from a relaxation of sanctions.

A variety of European allies, including the leaders of Britain and France, have personally appealed to Trump to re-certify the nuclear accord for the sake of allied unity.

Germany’s government pledged on Friday to work for continued unity if Trump de-certified the deal as Berlin remain convinced the agreement was an important tool to prevent Iran developing nuclear weapons.

Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel underlined German views in a telephone call with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson late on Thursday, his spokeswoman Maria Adebahr told reporters.

Gabriel said on Thursday U.S. behavior was driving a wedge between Europe and its close ally United States and bringing Europeans closer to Russia and China. “It’s imperative that Europe sticks together on this issue,” said Gabriel.

Russian President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said on Friday that if the United States ditched the nuclear pact, “this will damage the atmosphere of predictability, security, stability and non-proliferation in the entire world”.

U.S. MOVE AGAINST REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS

McCaul said he expected Trump also to announce some kind of action against the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IGRC), the country’s most powerful security entity. Trump is under a legal mandate to impose U.S. economic sanctions on the Revolutionary Guards as a whole by Oct. 31 or waive them.

U.S. sanctions could seriously hurt the IRGC as it controls large swaths of Iran’s economy. The Guards’ foreign paramilitary and espionage wing, the Quds Force, is under U.S. sanctions, as is the Quds Force commander, other officials and associated individuals and entities.

The deputy Quds commander, Brigadier-General Esmail Ghaani, was quoted by Iran’ Tasnim news agency on Friday as saying Trump’s threats would “damage” the United States.

“We are not a war-mongering country. But any military action against Iran will be regretted...We have buried many...like Trump and know how to fight against America,” Ghaani said.

“EMBARRASSMENT”

The 2015 nuclear agreement, signed by the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China, the European Union and Iran, has been denounced by Trump as “an embarrassment”.

European officials have categorically ruled out renegotiating the deal but have said they share Trump’s concerns about Iran’s destabilizing influence in the Middle East.

China has said it hopes the agreement will stay intact.

Israel, Iran’s arch-adversary in the Middle East, welcomed Trump’s anticipated announcement on Friday but voiced doubt that the tougher tack by Washington could turn around the Islamic Republic.

The International Atomic Energy Agency concluded that Iran secretly researched a nuclear warhead until 2009, which Tehran denies. Iran has always insisted its uranium enrichment activity is for civilian energy purposes, not for atomic bombs.

The threat of new U.S. action has prompted a public display of unity from rival factions among Iran’s rulers. Iran will react sharply to any U.S. move against the nuclear deal with global powers, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told the Iranian parliament on Wednesday.

(Reuters) - U.S. Senator Susan Collins of Maine, a moderate Republican who helped block her party’s efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act this year, said she planned to remain in her current office rather than run for governor.

The four-term incumbent attracted national attention this summer as one of three Republican senators who voted in July against a bill to repeal the law often called Obamacare, a move that angered U.S. President Donald Trump. She said on Friday that remaining in the Senate would allow her to use her powerful voice in reforming the U.S healthcare system.

Collins, who like all Republicans in the Senate in 2009 voted against the sweeping healthcare legislation, said she believed urgent action was needed to improve it but criticized the way repeal efforts had been handled over the summer.

“When we’re dealing with an issue that affects millions of Americans, we need to understand the consequences of what we are doing, not vote on bills in the middle of the night that have had no substantive hearings,” Collins, 64, told a group of business leaders in Rockland, a city on the state’s midcoast.

“We must stop allowing partisanship to be the preexisting condition that prevents meaningful healthcare reform.”

Urgent action is needed to stabilize the insurance markets, including creating high-risk pools, she said. She wants to require employers to offer healthcare coverage only to people who work 40 hours a week or more, raising the threshold from 30 hours.

For weeks, Collins had flirted publicly with the idea of launching a bid to succeed Governor Paul LePage, a fiery conservative who was first elected in 2010 on a wave of support from the populist Tea Party movement. State laws forbid LePage from seeking a third term.

Collins and LePage mark out the two poles of the state’s Republican Party, with the senator working with Democrats in Washington while the governor has regularly fought with his rivals in the state capital Augusta. He has publicly criticized Collins.

Collins’ independence makes her an increasingly powerful player in Washington, one veteran Maine political observer said.

“She is at the very center of virtually every big policy debate and big vote in the U.S. Senate,” said Mark Brewer, professor of political science at the University of Maine. “She remains an incredibly important player on any issue she wants to focus on: tax reform, you name it.”","Republican Collins will stay in U.S. Senate, focused on healthcare",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-politics-collins/republican-collins-will-stay-in-u-s-senate-focused-on-healthcare-idUSKBN1CI1DK?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian home resale prices in September staged their biggest fall in seven years, while new home prices were flat in August in the once red-hot markets of Toronto and Vancouver, adding to evidence that the country’s housing boom continued to cool, data showed on Thursday.

Prices dropped 0.8 percent in September from August, the first monthly decline since 2016 and the biggest since September 2010, according to the Teranet-National Bank Composite House Price Index, which measures changes for repeat sales of single-family homes.

National price gains also slowed on an annual basis, with prices up 11.4 percent from last year, compared to an annual increase of 13.1 percent in August.

Two recent interest rate hikes by the Bank of Canada have helped rein in demand, and analysts are divided over whether the market will manage a soft landing or see a U.S. style housing crash.

Price increases of more than 30 percent in Toronto early in the year sparked fears of a housing bubble, and the provincial government slapped a 15 percent foreign buyers tax on purchases in the city to cool speculation.

A separate report from Statistics Canada showed new home prices, excluding apartments and condominiums, nationally rose 0.1 percent in August, shy of forecasts for a 0.3 percent gain.

Prices were unchanged in 15 out of 27 markets, including Vancouver and Toronto.

It was the third month in a row showing unchanged new home prices in Toronto, Canada’s largest city.

In the home resale market, Toronto led September’s price decline with a 2.7 percent monthly drop, according to Teranet.

“Many might worry about the fact that the last time we saw a string of monthly (Toronto) declines of such magnitude was during the last economic recession. They should not ... market conditions appear to have stabilized over the last four months,” National Bank Financial economist Marc Pinsonneault said in a note to clients.

“If that is the case, a large part of the price correction to be seen in the Toronto home resale market might be behind us,” he added.

Sapphire Reserve is the credit card that shocked the industry when JPMorgan Chase & Co debuted it in August 2016. Upwards of 1 million people signed up as users wrote in Internet posts that its perks, credits and give-backs were so rich people could recoup the $450 annual fee and pickup another $1,000 or so of value.

“It is definitely working out for me,” said Low, recounting trips he made using Sapphire Reserve and other card travel rewards to Miami, Berlin, London, the Philippines and Taiwan.

It hasn’t worked out so well for JPMorgan’s card competitors. And it is not clear when, or if, it will work out for JPMorgan, analysts and bank executives said.

Entering the premium card market with the Sapphire Reserve bid, JPMorgan dramatically undercut the pricing of the Platinum Card of American Express Co and the Prestige Card of Citigroup Inc. It also lured credit card spending from customers of Bank of America Corp.

An American Express executive earlier this year called the move a “full frontal assault” on the Platinum Card. On Thursday, a Citigroup executive said that after JPMorgan’s move Citi changed course and turned its marketing toward no-fee cards that offer free borrowing for as long 21 months instead of travel rewards.

“We shifted our focus away from rewards because of the competitive heat,” Citigroup Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach said in a conference call with reporters after posting quarterly results.

JPMorgan’s invasion of the premium card business illustrates how Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon is leveraging the scale and strength of the biggest bank in the United States to undercut profit margins of competitors and take business, analysts said.

“This is another example of Dimon’s scorched earth strategy,” said one analyst who declined to be named talking so bluntly about the bank’s tactics.

JPMorgan has also muscled in since the financial crisis on European debt, fixed income trading, securities custody for institutional investors and commercial lending.

Earlier this year Dimon quoted Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com as saying “your margin is my opportunity,” noted analyst Jason Goldberg of Barclays. “JPMorgan is trying to bring some of that to the financial space,” Goldberg said.

The company has not given an exact cost for the Sapphire Reserve foray. It has said it must account for the expense of signing customers in the first year and that those costs have run as much as $200 million each quarter.

That $800 million a year is a lot of money for most companies, but not such much for JPMorgan, which this year is expected to earn about $25 billion, one analyst said.

EARNING SHARE IN CUSTOMERS’ WALLETS

The move on premium cards is also an example of how Dimon’s lieutenants throughout the bank look for thin spots in their market penetration. When JPMorgan brought out Sapphire Reserve, its no-fee, low-fee and cash-back cards had already made it a strong second to American Express in card spending, according to the Nilson Report.

But it needed a premium travel card of its own for its customers, Jennifer Piespzak, chief executive for Chase Card Services, said in an interview.

“For us to be able to earn the greatest share of the customer wallet, we don’t want them to have American Express Platinum,” she said. “We want them to have Sapphire Reserve.”

JPMorgan earlier this year cut its sign-up bonus for Sapphire Reserve in half, saying the initial offer was to attract a base of users.

Now the bank is trying to hold and consolidate the territory it has taken. It has kept the spending credits and travel perks attractive enough that Low said he is paying the annual $450 fee again to renew and tossing other cards in his sock drawer.

And, the bank is promoting Sapphire Reserve in the first television ads it has launched in 18 months for a consumer credit card. The ads show late night talk show wit James Corden asking millennials to plan his next vacation as they travel the world with the card.

Winning over millennials has been the goal from the start, said Pam Codispoti, the executive in charge of the card who was recently promoted to be in charge of the bank’s 5,000-plus branches.

“We want to build lifelong relationships as they buy their first car, invest in their first home, and build their deposits and investments,” Codispoti said in an interview.

JPMorgan declined to tell reporters or analysts on Thursday how many people have dropped the card or whether holders are borrowing as much the company has been counting on.

Codispoti said, “We feel good about what we are seeing, but it is really early” to say how the card’s story will end.","JPMorgan's card gamble lures millennial travelers, squeezes competitors",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-jpmorgan-cards/jpmorgans-card-gamble-lures-millennial-travelers-squeezes-competitors-idUSKBN1CI0EU

Le président américain a prévu de faire son allocution à 12h45 (16h45 GMT) à la Maison blanche.

“Il est temps que le monde entier se joigne à nous pour exiger que le gouvernement iranien met fin à sa quête de mort et de destruction”, dit-il dans une déclaration diffusée par la Maison blanche.

Depuis son entrée en fonction, en janvier, Trump a accepté par deux fois de certifier cet accord, une démarche par laquelle le président américain informe tous les 90 jours le Congrès du respect par l‘Iran des engagements pris sur le contrôle de son programme nucléaire.

Mais il considère que cet accord conclu entre la république islamique et le puissances du P5+1 (Etats-Unis, Russie, Chine, France, Grande-Bretagne, les cinq membres permanents du Conseil de sécurité, plus l‘Allemagne), va à l‘encontre des intérêts américains.

Une “non-certification” n‘équivaudrait pas à un retrait de l‘accord de Vienne mais constituerait un premier pas vers sa dénonciation par Washington. Le Congrès américain aurait alors 60 jours pour rétablir les sanctions prises contre Téhéran et assouplies en vertu de cette entente.

Cette décision aurait pour conséquence d‘accroître la pression sur le président des Etats-Unis alors que les autres pays signataires, dont la France et la Grande-Bretagne, ont fait connaître leur soutien à l‘accord.

Moscou et Berlin ont également averti Washington des conséquences d‘une remise en question de cet accord longuement négocié - l‘Allemagne, la France et la Grande-Bretagne se sont engagées dès 2003 - et que les Européens considèrent comme l‘un des rares succès de la diplomatie internationale au Moyen-Orient.

“C‘est bien plus dangereux” que le retrait de l‘accord de Paris sur le climat ordonné il y a quatre mois par Trump, estimait récemment l‘Allemand Elmar Brok, expert en politique étrangère au Parlement européen et allié d‘Angela Merkel.

CONTENIR L‘IRAN

La fragilisation, si ce n‘est l‘abandon du Plan d‘action conjoint commun (JCPOA), la dénomination officielle de l‘accord de Vienne, serait susceptible de relancer la course aux armements et la prolifération nucléaire, avec une Arabie saoudite qui s‘oppose à l‘expansion géopolitique de l‘Iran dans la région et un Etat d‘Israël qui considère la république islamique comme une menace pour sa propre existence.

“Incontestablement, cela nuira au climat de prévisibilité, de sécurité, de stabilité et de non-prolifération dans le monde entier”, a souligné vendredi le porte-parole du Kremlin, Dmitri Peskov.

Si les Etats-Unis sortent du JCPOA, cela marquera la fin de cet accord international et conduira sans doute à un désordre planétaire, a estimé Ali Larijani, le président du parlement iranien qui était en déplacement vendredi en Russie.

Des voix se sont même élevées au sein de l‘administration américaine ou de la majorité républicaine au Congrès. “Malgré les défauts de cet accord, je suis convaincu que nous devons aujourd‘hui l‘appliquer à la lettre”, a ainsi déclaré le président républicain de la commission des Affaires étrangères de la Chambre des représentants, Ed Royce.

Les inspecteurs onusiens de l‘Agence internationale de l‘énergie atomique (AIEA) estiment que l‘Iran est en conformité avec l‘accord.

Frankfurt (Reuters) - Nach mehreren vergeblichen Anläufen hat der Dax am Donnerstagnachmittag zwar die 13.000-Punkte-Marke geknackt.

Doch Euphorie hat er damit bei den Anlegern nicht ausgelöst. “Die politischen Krisen sind ja nicht alle auf einmal verschwunden”, sagte ein Händler. Zudem fürchten einige, die Rally sei übertrieben. Viele Experten rechneten aber damit, dass die gut laufenden Geschäfte der großen Unternehmen den deutschen Leitindex noch weiter in die Höhe hieven werden.

Mit rund 12.983 Punkten schloss der Dax unter dem zeitweise aufgestellten neuen Rekord von 13.002 Zählern. Damit lag das Plus zum Vorabend bei 0,1 Prozent. Der EuroStoxx50 kam ebenfalls kaum vom Fleck. Auch an der Wall Street traten die großen Indizes Dow Jones, S&P500 und Nasdaq zum Handelsschluss in Europa auf der Stelle - das allerdings teils ebenfalls auf höchstem Niveau. Schon seit Wochen hangeln sie sich in kleinen Mini-Schritten von Rekord zu Rekord.

Der Sprung des Dax über die 13.000-Punkte-Hürde kam am Donnerstag für die meisten Börsianer zu diesem Zeitpunkt überraschend. Denn es fehlte ihrer Ansicht nach an echten neuen Impulsen. “Von Euphorie ist hier keine Spur”, kommentierte ein Händler den Dax-Anstieg. Die enge Handelsspanne der vergangenen Tage deute aber darauf hin, dass der endgültige Ausbruch über 13.000 Punkte in den kommenden Tagen recht dynamisch verlaufen könnte, mutmaßte Jochen Stanzl, Analyst beim Broker CMC Markets.

Auslöser der Käufe am Donnerstag war laut Händlern der etwas nachgebende Euro. Die Gemeinschaftswährung verlor zeitweise nach einem unerwartet starken Anstieg der US-Produzentenpreise etwa einen viertel US-Cent auf 1,1840 Dollar. Die zuletzt rückläufigen Zinserwartungen in den USA seien womöglich verfrüht gewesen, erklärte Helaba-Analyst Ralf Umlauf.

Den Anlegern am deutschen Aktienmarkt nahm dies die Sorgen vor einem hohen Wechselkurs, der die Export-Chancen der Unternehmen auf dem Weltmarkt mindert. Noch Anfang der Woche hatte die Krise in Katalonien den Euro belastet und damit den Dax bis auf wenige Zähler an die 13.000er Marke geschoben. Doch nach dem vorläufigen Verzicht Kataloniens auf die Ausrufung der Unabhängigkeit hatte der Euro seinen Aufwärtstrend wieder aufgenommen und noch am Vormittag mit 1,1880 Dollar ein Zweieinhalb-Wochen-Hoch erreicht.

Coordinated Rohingya insurgent attacks on 30 security posts on Aug. 25 sparked a ferocious military response in the Muslim-majority northern part of Rakhine state that the United Nations has said was ethnic cleansing.

A committee led by military Lieutenant-General Aye Win has begun an investigation into the behavior of military personnel, the office of the commander in chief said on Friday, insisting the operation was justified under Buddhist-majority Myanmar’s constitution.

According to a statement posted on Senior General Min Aung Hlaing’s Facebook page, the panel will ask, “Did they follow the military code of conduct? Did they exactly follow the command during the operation? After that (the committee) will release full information.”

Myanmar is refusing entry to a U.N. panel that was tasked with investigating allegations of abuses after a smaller military counteroffensive launched in October 2016.

But domestic investigations - including a previous internal military probe - have largely dismissed refugees’ claims of abuses committed during security forces’ so-called “clearance operations”.

Thousands of refugees have continued to arrived cross the Naf river separating Myanmar’s Rakhine state and Bangladesh in recent days, even though Myanmar insists military operations ceased on Sept. 5.

Aid agencies now estimate that 536,000 people have now arrived in Cox’s Bazar district, straining scarce resources of aid groups and local communities.

For example, regulators could force energy companies to put consumers on the cheapest fixed-rate tariff by default.","LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - British Prime Theresa May’s energy plan has few political merits and even fewer economic ones. Her government said on Thursday it will cap the most commonly used energy prices until 2020 to ensure consumers pay less. The intention is laudable, but the biggest intervention since Britain privatised its energy industry three decades ago may do more harm than good.

Britons pay one of the lowest rates in western Europe per unit of energy consumed, according to Eurostat. Adjust for purchasing power differences, and they pay one of the lowest rates across the whole European Union (see graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2xBuOB2). That may be because Britain has more major energy suppliers than most other EU countries and is one of a minority where the combined market share of the three largest suppliers is below 70 percent, according to Europe’s Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (see graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2xxrTsV).

Many consumers are not benefiting from competition, though. Two-thirds of UK households pay so-called standard variable tariffs even though they could save money by moving to cheaper fixed-rate deals. Inertia, fears that changing providers is complex, and a fuzzy idea of potential savings may explain why regulator Ofgem found that less a fifth of customers switched suppliers last year. May calls the market “broken”.

Putting a limit on standard variable tariffs may not lead to a better outcome, though. Granted, an energy cap will in the short term cut most consumers’ bills. But a 2014 ACER report found that a regulated price acts as a gravitational force around which competing suppliers cluster. A cap therefore risks compressing the range of available tariffs and could push up prices if weaker competitors are squeezed out of the market.

Politics sometimes explain decisions that economics cannot. But May’s plan is politically flawed as well. The opposition Labour Party proposed a cap before the 2015 elections and has since gone further by talking of renationalising the energy industry.

There are better options. For example, regulators could force energy companies to put consumers on the cheapest fixed-rate tariff by default. Suppliers could also be required to inform clients of the cheapest tariff available in the market and savings they could make by switching. The latest intervention may force the industry to change. In the meantime, though, a price cap could hurt those it is supposed to help.",Breakingviews - UK energy cap is bad economics and poor politics,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-energy-breakingviews/breakingviews-uk-energy-cap-is-bad-economics-and-poor-politics-idUSKBN1CH22F

Talha Haroon, 19, was arrested in Pakistan in 2016 after U.S. authorities identified him as one of three men, along with a Canadian citizen and a man from the Philippines, planning attacks on Manhattan’s Times Square and the city’s subway.

His lawyer and family deny the charges.

Haroon’s lawyer termed the investigation a sting operation carried out by an investigating officer motivated by career advancement.

“The FBI projected this as a high-level story, but these people don’t have the qualifications to kill a monkey,” said the lawyer, Idrees Ashraf.

Ashraf said his client was only in contact with the investigating officer but never directly spoke with the co-accused, raising serious doubts about the nature of the investigation.

“According to the criminal complaint, the FBI agent communicated with Talha online, and has said he was active in IS, but no proof of militant links has been provided,” Ashraf added.

One of the accused men, 19-year-old Canadian citizen Abdulrahman El Bahnasawy, has been in U.S. custody since May 2016. He pleaded guilty to terrorism charges in October 2016, prosecutors said.

The third accused, 37-year old Russel Salic, was arrested in the Philippines in April, according to the office of Acting U.S. Attorney Joon Kim.

Prosecutors say Salic maintained a pro-Islamic State social media presence, told the undercover officer he had been communicating with El Bahnasawy, and sent the officer about $423 from the Philippines to help pay for the attacks.

Haroon has been in custody for more than a year without being charged. A bail plea will be filed for his release at the hearing once a date is set, his attorney said.

“He was one of the best students in his school,” Haroon’s father said, adding that Talha moved to Pakistan in 2014 after finishing high school.

“He is naive and speaks from his heart,” Ashraf added. “He is not the sort of boy who can commit such brutal acts.”

Sky shareholders have legitimate complaints.","LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Sky shareholders face a choice between principles and profit. Some investors are planning to oppose Chairman James Murdoch’s re-election because he is also chief executive of 39 percent owner Twenty-First Century Fox. But kicking up a stink might further jeopardise Fox’s offer for the European pay-TV group.

Sky investor Royal London Asset Management had a point last week when it called Murdoch’s dual role “inappropriate” and said shareholders would be better served by a truly independent chairman during the takeover. Shareholder advisory groups, meanwhile, object to Sky’s executive pay. One problem is that some long-term incentive packages could pay out with no performance conditions if Fox’s offer gets the green light, according to Glass Lewis.

Murdoch survived an investor backlash last year, winning election with around 70 percent support. Strip out Fox’s stake and abstentions, however, and just half of Sky’s independent shareholders backed the chairman.

Concerns about conflicts of interest are more pressing this time. Fox’s bid is on ice until at least March 2018 while UK authorities study its effects on the country’s media ownership and broadcasting standards. Sky investor Crispin Odey has argued that the delays are beginning to make the offer look on the low side.

That logic is questionable. When it was launched in December 2016, Fox’s offer of 10.75 pounds per share represented a 40 premium to Sky’s market value. The shares would probably fall to around 8 pounds if the bid is blocked. Notwithstanding their concerns about Murdoch’s independence, most Sky shareholders would bite Fox’s hands off if they got a chance to vote on the bid.

That is why investors might hesitate before lodging a protest vote as long as Fox and the Murdoch family are under a regulatory microscope. Campaigners have argued that past sexual harassment and phone-hacking scandals in the Murdoch empire are grounds for blocking the takeover. Drawing attention to the family’s governance shortcomings could add to the political pressure on UK Media Secretary Karen Bradley, who must rule on the deal. Sky shareholders have legitimate complaints. But those thinking with their wallets may decide to keep quiet.",Breakingviews - Sky investors choose between profit and principles,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sky-results-breakingviews/breakingviews-sky-investors-choose-between-profit-and-principles-idUSKBN1CH16I

Under his watch, Trump parted ways with chief strategist Steve Bannon and other top officials, while new restrictions were set to streamline meetings and material for the president.

But reports of both Kelly’s and the president’s frustrations have persisted, sparking continued speculation of pending shakeups.

Trump has confided to friends that he has felt constrained by some of Kelly’s moves to limit access to him and some administration officials have privately chafed at the restrictions as well, sources familiar with the internal dynamics of the White House have said.

Disarray within the executive branch has concerned officials outside the administration. Republican Senator Bob Corker has said Kelly is one of three officials including Secretary of Defense James Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson as “those people that help separate our country from chaos.”

He later told the New York Times that Trump risked setting the nation “on the path to World War Three.”

Critics of the president say his frequent use of Twitter has contributed to a sense of chaos.

The Trump administration on Friday disclosed the date of the subsidies cutoff after announcing late on Thursday the most dramatic action the president has taken to undercut Democratic former President Barack Obama’s signature 2010 healthcare law.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the administration will not make the next payment to insurers scheduled for next Wednesday. The payments cost $7 billion this year and were estimated to be $10 billion in 2018, according to congressional analysts.

Trump has made the payments, guaranteed to insurers under Obamacare to help lower out-of-pocket medical expenses for low-income consumers, each month since taking office in January. But he has repeatedly threatened to cut them off and disparaged them as a “bailout” for insurance companies.

The move drew swift condemnation from congressional Democrats, who accused Trump of sabotaging the law, and threats from Democratic state attorneys general in New York and California to take legal action.

Trump, a Republican who promise as a candidate last year to dismantle the law formally called the Affordable Care Act, urged opponents to reach out to him to make a deal.

“The Democrats ObamaCare is imploding. Massive subsidy payments to their pet insurance companies has stopped. Dems should call me to fix!” Trump said in a post on Twitter early on Friday, calling the law “a broken mess.”

Shares of hospitals and health insurers fell in premarket trading on Friday after Trump’s decision. Shares of Anthem Inc, Molina Healthcare Inc, Cigna Corp and Centene Corp, which are all offering plans on Obamacare markets for 2018, were all lower.

Trump has been frustrated by the failure of his fellow Republicans who control Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare despite seven years of promises to get rid of the law that has brought health insurance to 20 million people.

His decision is likely to please those in his hard-line conservative political base who detest the Affordable Care Act, which many Republicans have attacked as an unneeded government intrusion in Americans’ healthcare.

In a nod to that same constituency, the president signed an executive order on Thursday intended to make it easier for Americans to buy bare-bones health insurance plans exempt from Obamacare requirements.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi derided the subsidies cut-off in a joint statement, saying Trump would single-handedly push Americans’ healthcare premiums higher.

‘SPITEFUL ACT’

“It is a spiteful act of vast, pointless sabotage leveled at working families and the middle class in every corner of America,” they said. “Make no mistake about it, Trump will try to blame the Affordable Care Act, but this will fall on his back and he will pay the price for it.”

Insurers and proponents of Obamacare have implored Trump for months to commit to making the payments. Several insurers have cited uncertainty over the payments when hiking premiums for 2018 or exiting insurance markets altogether.

About 10 million people are enrolled in the plans via the law’s marketplace. Many of them receive subsidies, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.

The White House said late on Thursday that it could not lawfully pay the subsidies anymore. A White House statement said that based on guidance from the Justice Department, “the Department of Health and Human Services has concluded that there is no appropriation for cost-sharing reduction payments to insurance companies under Obamacare.”

“In light of this analysis, the Government cannot lawfully make the cost-sharing reduction payments,” it said.

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said he was prepared to lead other attorneys general in a lawsuit.

The payments were the subject of a lawsuit brought by House Republicans against the Obama administration that alleged they were unlawful because they needed to be appropriated by Congress. A judge ruled in favor of the Republicans, and the Obama administration appealed the ruling.

The Trump administration took over the lawsuit and had delayed deciding whether to continue the Obama administration’s appeal or terminate the subsidies, but in April Trump began threatening to stop the payments.

That case became more complicated in August when a U.S. appeals court allowed 16 Democratic state attorneys general to defend the payments and have a say in the legal fight.

In a court filing released on Friday, Sessions argued that while the law provided funds for tax credits it did allow cost-sharing payments for insurers. It was in that court filing that he announced next week’s cutoff date.

Meanwhile, the political turbulence has affected insurers’ decisions. Anthem, one of the largest remaining Obamacare insurers, in August scaled back its offerings in Nevada and Georgia and blamed the moves in part on uncertainty over the payments.

Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina earlier this year raised premiums by more than 20 percent, but said it would have raised premiums by only about 9 percent if Trump agreed to fund the payments.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that cutting off the payments would cause premiums to rise 20 percent in 2018, and that 5 percent of Americans would live in areas that do not have an insurer in the individual market in 2018.

Trump has taken other steps to undermine Obamacare. Last week, his administration allowed businesses and non-profit organizations to seek religious and moral exemptions from Obamacare’s mandate that employers provide coverage for women’s birth control.

The administration also slashed the Obamacare advertising and outreach budget and halved the open enrollment period.","Trump scraps key Obamacare subsidies, urges Democrats to fix 'broken mess'",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-healthcare/trump-scraps-key-obamacare-subsidies-urges-democrats-to-fix-broken-mess-idUSKBN1CI0E4

Tens of thousands of soldiers are taking part in the massive four-yearly war games that are both a drill as well as a show of strength for the West. Next time around, in 2021, those troops might be sharing their battle space with a different type of force: self-driving drones, tanks, ships and submersibles.

Drone warfare is hardly new – the first lethal attack conducted by an American unmanned aerial vehicle took place in Afghanistan in October 2001. What is now changing fast, however, is the ability of such unmanned systems to operate without a guiding human hand.

That’s a truly revolutionary shift – and one every major nation wants to be lead. Critics have long feared countries might be more willing to go to war with unmanned systems. Now, some see a very real risk control might pass beyond human beings altogether.

Tech entrepreneur Elon Musk has long warned that humanity might be on the verge of some cataclysmic errors when it comes to artificial intelligence. Last month, he ramped that up with a warning that the development of autonomous weapons platforms might provoke a potentially devastating arms race.

As if to reinforce Musk’s point, Russian President Vladimir Putin told students shortly thereafter that he believed the technology would be a game changer, making it clear Russia would plow resources into it. “The one who becomes leader in this will become ruler of the world,” Putin was quoted as saying.

China too is pushing ahead, believed by some experts to now be the global leader when it comes to developing autonomous swarms of drones.

Already, drones are able to fly themselves independently so they can stay airborne if they lose touch with human pilots. Soon they may be able to make their own tactical decisions. At Georgia Tech in the United States this summer, researchers programmed swarms of light drones to fight their own aerial dogfights. The U.S. military is trying out similar products.

That means one operator could command many, many more drones – or that they might not need direct supervision at all.

Even more important than what is happening in robotics may be the wider developments in artificial intelligence. That won’t make warfare necessarily more deadly – a bomb dropped from a drone is not in itself less lethal than one from a manned aircraft. While it’s possible that greater accuracy might reduce casualties, some analysts fear that the changes brought by new unmanned systems might themselves fuel new conflicts.

“Radical technological change begets radical government policy ideas,” concluded a July report on the topic produced for the U.S. intelligence community by Harvard University’s Belfer Center. It warned an “inevitable” AI arms race could prove as revolutionary as the invention of nuclear weapons.

Artificial intelligence could dramatically increase the efficiency of surveillance technology, allowing a single system to monitor perhaps millions of digital conversations, hacked personal devices and other sources of information. The implications could be terrifying, particularly in the hands of a state with little or no democratic oversight.

At a recent UK panel discussion, Britain’s former Special Forces director Lieutenant General Sir Graeme Lamb predicted that by 2030, technological breakthroughs – not just AI, but quantum computing and beyond – would produce entirely unpredictable changes. Special force teams, he suggested, might well have a robotic and artificial intelligence component deployed alongside them – the U.S. Army calls this “manned-unmanned teaming.”

That sounds like something out of science fiction – and it might well look like it. Last year, Russia unveiled its FEDOR humanoid military robot, which it demonstrated firing a gun.

Most countries deliberately keep their defense AI secret, ultimately fueling the arms race Musk was warning about. Some scientists already worry about a real-world version of the premise for the Arnold Schwarzenegger-starring “Terminator” film franchise in which the United States, fearing cyber attack, hands control of key military systems to the artificial intelligence Skynet. (Skynet, fearing its human creators might choose to turn it off, immediately launches a full-scale nuclear attack on humanity.)

For now, Western nations at least look keen to keep a human in the “kill chain.” Not all countries may make that choice, however. Russia has long had a reputation for trusting machines more than people, at one stage considering – and, some evidence suggests, building – an automated system to launch its nuclear arsenal should its command structure be destroyed by a first strike.

Outside of the military, there is evidence AI algorithms have already alarmed their creators. In August, Facebook shut down an AI experiment after programs involved began communicating with each other in a language the humans monitoring them could not understand.

Is this the end for ordinary human soldiering? Almost certainly not. It’s even been argued that a more complex, high-tech battlefield might require more soldiers, not fewer.

Robotic systems may be vulnerable to hacking, jamming and simply rendered inoperable through electronic warfare. Such techniques allow U.S.-led forces in Iraq to largely negate the off-the-shelf drones being used by Islamic State. Russia used similar techniques against Western-made drones in Ukraine.

That’s a worry for armed forces betting – like many industries – on automation. Britain’s new aircraft carrier has only a fraction of the sailors on its only slightly larger U.S. carrier counterparts, relying heavily on automatic systems to manage weaponry and damage control. The latest Russian tank, the T-14 Armata, has an automated turret that will usually be out of reach to most of its crew. Such techniques have clear advantages – but also mean that interfering with electronics could leave them useless.

Such technology is coming whether it is a good idea or not. Indeed, even relatively old military equipment increasingly can be retrofitted. Russian engineers have already demonstrated that they can adapt the 20-year-old T-90 tank to be controlled remotely.

Ironically, the North Korean crisis reminds us that the most dangerous technologies may well remain those invented more than 70 years ago – atomic weapons and the missiles that carry them. Even if mankind can avoid a nuclear apocalypse, however, the coming AI and robotic revolution may prove an equal existential challenge.",Commentary: The coming robot arms race,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apps-robots-commentary/commentary-the-coming-robot-arms-race-idUSKCN1BT1XN

HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Warning signs are flashing after another big quarter at Samsung Electronics. The South Korean group’s top executive, Kwon Oh-hyun, unexpectedly resigned on Friday following record-smashing forecasts for operating profit. An early lead in memory chips has fuelled blistering earnings growth at Samsung despite legal woes. But as rivals circle, a widening leadership vacuum looks worrying.

Kwon says the firm is “confronted with unprecedented crisis inside out” – an incredible admission for a departing leader. And the timing of his surprise retirement is troubling. Since the arrest and conviction of family scion and heir apparent Jay Y. Lee this year, the 64-year old Kwon has emerged as a key leader at the $325 billion tech behemoth. He serves as co-chief executive and vice chairman. Besides coordinating company-wide decisions and leading corporate-governance reform efforts as chairman of the board, the company veteran also oversees Samsung’s all-important semiconductor arm.

Thanks to that division, Samsung expects operating profit for the three months to September to top $13 billion, nearly triple the figure from a year earlier. Increasingly powerful smartphones and the rise of artificial intelligence mean electronic devices require ever-larger amounts of data storage.

That has led to a global shortage of two kinds of memory chips, in particular, known as NAND and DRAM. Samsung’s early bets in this space are paying off: full-year earnings are expected to rise 82 percent to 40.9 trillion won ($32.7 billion), according to analysts polled on Eikon.

Yet even Kwon admits the record earnings are the “fruit of past decisions” and that the company is “not even close to finding new growth engines”. To make matters worse, rivals are aggressively investing to boost supply. Global semiconductor capital spending is forecast to jump 20 percent this year, according to industry tracker IC Insights. In 3-D NAND, one of the memory industry’s hottest sectors, analysts at Bernstein reckon that supply will outstrip demand next year, weighing on prices. A vacuum at the top now bodes ill for Samsung.",Breakingviews - Warning signs flash at Samsung after big quarter,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-samsung-electronics-kwon-breakingview/breakingviews-warning-signs-flash-at-samsung-after-big-quarter-idUSKBN1CI0GI

Britain’s largest private bank wants to update not only its technology and ways of doing business, but also its 325-year-old brand to sell more products to more customers, tackle competition from international rivals and boost revenues.

Chief Executive Peter Flavel aims to increase Coutts’ appeal to a younger generation of wealthy Britons, including vloggers, gamers and other entrepreneurs getting rich from new technologies, as well as its traditional clients.

“We don’t want to live in the history or live in the past, we need to be modern and contemporary and relevant today,” Flavel told Reuters.

”The client base we have here is of course what you would expect, the landed estates and the gentry, that traditional wealth, and that’s a big part of what we’ve had as a bank.

“But the bigger part of what we do today is banking entrepreneurs and helping them develop their businesses.”

Australian-born Flavel, previously CEO of private wealth management at JP Morgan in Asia and global head of Standard Chartered’s private bank, was brought in by parent Royal Bank of Scotland 18 months ago.

Since his arrival, he has pushed for stronger cooperation between the private bank and the universal services offered by RBS.

He has also been exploring more quirky ways to update Coutts’ image.

One of these more off-beat projects is the expansion of a roof garden at Coutts’ central London headquarters, adding fresh fruit and vegetable patches and three bee hives, which produce Coutts-branded honey soon to be given out to new customers.

“We’re having a bit of a think about how we might just be a little different,” Flavel said.

“Banks are serious and boring and risk averse. You can create that little sense of not taking yourself too seriously at - and this is the big one - the appropriate time, because you’re dealing with people’s money.”

Flavel has focused on tapping RBS’s commercial bank for client referrals, which has helped to broaden its customer base.

Entrepreneurs now make up a growing portion of its business, and outside of London account for 80 percent of the client base.

Coutts is adding 1,700-1,800 new clients annually. But RBS’s wealth management division has struggled to translate a 2.8 percent increase in customer deposits in the first half of this year into revenues, which fell by around 3 percent.

“Private banking is not a volume game,” Flavel said. “New clients are interesting but new clients with significant amounts of their relationship with us are much more interesting.”

To that aim, the bank’s specialist advisers now have to work across traditional product silos to try to tap into the whole spectrum of their clients’ financial needs, from borrowing to wealth management.

COMPETITORS

But Coutts also now faces competition from international rivals, including Deutsche Bank and Julius Baer, which are expanding private banking in Britain.

After suffering big losses at their investment banks from huge bets on the U.S. housing market and costly legal settlements, many European lenders are turning to private banking in the hope that the traditionally low-risk business can provide more stable returns.

But the business of managing the fortunes of the world’s wealthy is not without its challenges.

Many clients are still risk adverse even 10 years on from the financial crisis, while the increased competition from traditional banks as well as online platforms is putting pressure on the amount banks can charge for their services.

Private banking accounts for less than 5 percent of the profits of state-backed RBS, which chose to keep Coutts through a major restructuring over the past decade. But it sold off Coutts’ international operations in 2015, leaving it to focus solely on Britain’s wealth market, worth about 825 billion pounds.

CHANGING TIMES

Since its establishment in 1692, the core of Coutts’ business has been looking after the wealth of Britain’s aristocracy, landed gentry and celebrities.

The latter includes sports stars - a significant number of the England football team for instance.

But when it comes to attracting up-and-coming wealth, Sebastian Dovey, analyst at wealth management research firm Scorpio Partnership, said Coutts has a challenge ahead.

“They (Coutts) can play the prestige card ... but that doesn’t rub so well now as perhaps it used to,” he said.

“We’re in a much more abrasive consumer market. They’re top quartile but they have to understand that they don’t have a natural right to winning entrepreneurs.”

Helped by cost-cutting, RBS’s private banking division boosted its operating profit by about 60 percent to 82 million pounds in the first half of the year, but its cost-income ratio remains high, at 72.3 percent.

For Flavel, some small costs are worth absorbing to enhance clients’ experience, such as exchange rate fees for users of its multi-currency card.

Coutts is also spending 20 million pounds a year on digital initiatives, including a new online platform launched earlier this year that lets clients execute their own investments.

“We need that mixture of the history and the future,” Flavel said. “That’s exciting and a bit of a challenge at the same time.”",Queen's bank goes for younger clients as rivals try to steal crown,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-rbs-coutts/queens-bank-goes-for-younger-clients-as-rivals-try-to-steal-crown-idUSKBN1CI0I8?il=0

NEW YORK (Reuters) - When reporters descended on upstate New York to ask about a stunning prison break in 2015, state police spokesman Major Charles Guess took their questions.

A dog named Trigger stepped on his owner’s 12-gauge shotgun during an Indiana waterfowl hunt just months later and shot her in the foot.

Sometimes the name fits the news story. Correspondent Julie Weed writes about legal marijuana for Forbes. This month, a front-page New York Times story on obesity was edited by Hilary Stout.

And former U.S. Representative Anthony Weiner on Monday was sentenced to prison for sending explicitly sexual pictures of a certain body part to an underage girl.

This phenomenon has secured its own line of scientific research, called nominative determinism. It even has a name of its own: aptronym.

In some cases, it may be rooted in the tradition of a profession determining a family name, such as Baker, Smith or Taylor.

Other times, it is a coincidence. But it nearly always raises an eyebrow or even a smile from those realizing the unusual pairing.

Recent news stories have mentioned Jack Dagger, the U.S. director of the International Knifethrowers Hall of Fame. Then there is Detective Martin Speechley, the ever-quotable spokesman for the New York Police Department.

Sometimes the odd connections can be horrifying. When a gunman at a community college in Roseburg, Oregon, killed nine people, including a woman in a wheelchair, her service dog named Bullet survived.

But strange synergies also can signal hope. Josh Outman now pitches for Mexico’s Triple-A Minor League Pericos de Puebla but was once with the New York Yankees, Oakland Athletics and other U.S. Major League Baseball teams. Perhaps a streak of no-hitters by Outman could get him back to the big leagues.","Having the right name at the right, or sometimes wrong, time",https://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idAFKCN1C425Q

That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ annual ranking of the World’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science, invent new technologies and power new markets and industries.

REUTERS TOP 100

The most innovative university in the world, for the third consecutive year, is Stanford University. Located in the heart of California's Silicon Valley, Stanford has long played a key role in the development of our modern networked world: A Stanford professor designed the basic communication standard for the Internet, and university alumni founded some of the biggest tech companies in the world, including Google, Intel, Hewlett-Packard and Netflix. Today the university continues to consistently produce original research and technology. Innovations that originate at Stanford are frequently cited by researchers elsewhere in academia and in private industry. Those are key criteria in the ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of numerous indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

MORE FROM REUTERS TOP 100 Compare Institutions | Methodology

Overall, the top ranks of The World's Most Innovative Universities remain largely unchanged, with nine of last year’s 10 highest-ranked universities remaining in the top 10. And the most elite institutions are almost all large, well-established universities based in the United States and Western Europe. Rounding out the top three are MIT and Harvard, which have held onto their respective 2nd and 3rd place rankings for the past three years. In fourth place is the University of Pennsylvania, which climbed four spots from #8 last year. The highest ranked university outside the U.S., Belgium’s KU Leuven (#5), is a nearly 600-year-old institution that maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet.

In contrast, there are only two Asian universities in the top 20, both of which are based in South Korea, and one of them actually teaches the majority of its classes in English: South Korea’s KAIST, formerly the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, ranked #6. Established in 1971 by the Korean government, KAIST was modeled after engineering schools in the United States, and initially funded with a multimillion-dollar loan from the United States Agency for International Development.

Overall, the top 100 consists of 51 universities based in North America, 26 in Europe, 20 in Asia and 3 in the Middle East. Why does Asia underperform? One reason is because Japanese universities – traditionally the research powerhouses of the region – depend heavily on government R&D spending, and the nation has been undergoing deflation and economic stagnation for more than 20 years. That means less money for research and fewer innovations.

According to data from Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science, which tracks articles published in scientific journals, Japanese researchers accounted for 8.4% of all papers published in 2005, but only 5.2% in 2015. Key research areas such as computer science showed even larger decreases, with the number of published papers falling by more than 37%. As a result, the Reuters ranking shows significant declines in rank for leading Japanese universities, including the University of Tokyo (down five spots to #21), Osaka University (down 13 to #24), and Keio University (down 25 to #78). Japan had nine universities on the list in 2016, but only has eight this year; six of those eight universities saw their rank fall from 2016, and one was unchanged. Only Kyushu University saw its ranking improve, moving from #79 to #68.

Of course, while Japan struggles, other Asian nations are growing fast. China has gone from one university on the list in 2015 to two in 2016, and now three in 2017. The two Chinese universities returning to the list this year both made significant gains (Tsinghua University climbed 15 spots to #51, and Peking University climbed 10 spots to #60); the third, Zhejiang University, appears on the list for the first time at #100. But given China’s massive population and economy, just three universities out of 100 still represents significant underperformance.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations – including educational institutions, nonprofit charities and government-funded labs – that publish the most academic research. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries), and ranked them based on their performance.

Slideshow (8 Images)

Careful observers might note a few differences between how non-U.S. institutions rank on Reuters’ regional innovation lists, Asia’s Most Innovative Universities and Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and how they rank on the global innovators list. An institution’s relative ranking may change from list to list, since each ranking is dependent on summarizing 10 indicators and comparing that with others in a specific population; when that population changes, individual rankings might change as well. Furthermore, the global list is restricted to institutions that filed 70 or more patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization during the five-year period examined by Thomson Reuters. The cutoff for regional lists is just 50 patents, allowing a more in-depth view of the most active institutions within a limited geographic area.

Due to changes in the methodology of this year’s list, three university systems that were ranked in the top 100 last year (University of London, State University System of Florida and University of Arizona and Board of Regents) were broken up so that each of their member institutions were ranked individually: As a result, four of those constituent universities – the University of Florida (#66), University College London (#67), Florida State University (#76) and Arizona State University (#85) – made the top 100 for the first time.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university – or whether it appears on the list at all – does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s best theoretical physics departments, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the planet. All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenyan police shot dead two people and wounded a third when a crowd tried to storm a police station during an opposition protest against a looming presidential vote re-run, a senior official said.

Around 20 youths attempted to take over the station during an otherwise peaceful rally in the town of Bondo in the southwest county of Siaya, forcing officers to open fire, County Commissioner Josephine Onunga said by phone.

Police also used teargas to break up small demonstrations in Kenya’s three main cities - Kisumu, the capital and the port of Mombasa - defying a government ban on rallies in city centers.

Kenya’s supreme court nullified the presidential election in August, citing procedural irregularities and voiding the victory of President Uhuru Kenyatta, opening the way to a repeat vote on Oct. 26.

But opposition leader Raila Odinga has refused to take part, saying the re-run should not happen until wide-ranging reforms were brought in to prevent a repeated failure.

The election board has said the polls will go ahead anyway, pitting Kenyatta against six other candidates, none of whom polled more than 1 percent in the August election.

Odinga told Reuters that he might consider returning to the Supreme Court for clarification on whether the Oct. 26 poll was legal.

PROVOCATIONS

“As far as we are concerned, that (original Supreme court) ruling is still valid,” Odinga said during a visit to London.

“What we are demanding is that the electoral commission should respect the Supreme Court and carry out elections in accordance with the ruling.”

He supported protesters’ right to demonstrate, he said, but he has so far stopped short of calling people onto the streets himself.

Martin Kimani, the Director of the National Counter Terrorism Centre, said the opposition was trying to manufacture a crisis.

“A lot of those provocations or demonstrations taking place is an attempt to create the appearance of a crisis,” he said. “There is a clear process on how to hold an assembly – it is about maintaining law and order.”

In Nairobi, opposition legislators were repeatedly teargassed as they tried to drive into the city center.

“We are asking Uhuru’s government to ... let us protest in peace and truth and we are saying we want change and we do not want Uhuru and his people,” said protester Mellen Kirumbo.

In Kisumu, a stronghold of Odinga support, protesters reacted angrily when police turned water cannon on them to prevent them from entering the city center.

“Our demonstrations have a (valid) basis and are peaceful,” said Odinga supporter Hezron Tirus Aloyo. “We condemn the directive ... on the limitation of our rights to demonstrate.”",Kenya police shoot dead two during opposition protest: commissioner,https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1CI102

Le osservazioni di Roberto Gualtieri a Reuters ricalcano le preoccupazioni espresse dal presidente del parlamento Ue Antonio Tajani nei giorni scorsi in quello che sta diventando la più grande sfida alla Bce nella sua funzione di Vigilanza.

Al centro della disputa le modalità con cui le banche possano affrontare al meglio la questione dei deteriorati che ammontano a circa mille miliardi di dollari, un problema spinoso che ha diviso i paesi della zona euro e che ora sta provocando una frattura tra Bce e parlamento Ue.

A scatenare il dibattito è il recente annuncio della Bce sulle linee guida, rese note per consultazione, relative alla gestione dei nuovi crediti deteriorati e che ha provocato la reazione dei legislatori Ue che stanno cercando di elaborare delle proprie regole sui crediti problematici.

“Condivido le preoccupazioni espresse dal presidente Tajani”, ha detto Gualtieri a Reuters.

Il presidente dell‘Europarlamento si è detto preoccupato per il modo in cui è stata intrapresa l‘iniziativa della vigilanza in merito alle nuove linee guida sugli Npl, sottolineando come il parlamento non sia stato coinvolto in modo appropriato.

“Spero che ... il processo di consultazione aiuterà l‘Ssm a ... correggere la guidance in modo da renderla più equilibrata”, aggiunge Gualtieri.

Le opinioni di Tajani e Gualtieri, entrambi italiani, sono condivise da alcuni rappresentanti tedeschi in un contesto di generale contrapposizione tra Italia e Germania sulla questione della gestione delle crisi bancarie, con Berlino che spinge per un più aspro trattamento dei creditori delle banche in crisi.

Markus Ferber, vicepresidente della commissione economica e monetaria e un membro influente del partito Cdu di Angela Merkel, ha accusato la Bce di eccedere nelle proprie prerogative.

“Penso che la Bce sia andata al di là del suo mandato e, a mio parere, indebolisce la fiducia nel lavoro della Bce come supervisore”, ha detto Ferber a Reuters.

“La Bce ha cercato di indicare nuovi requisiti patrimoniali universali. Queste regole universali, tuttavia, dovrebbero essere una prerogativa del legislatore europeo”.

Lee was jailed for bribery.

The surprise resignation of Samsung’s chip and display head came as he was expected to take a bigger role following Lee’s arrest in February and the departures of other key executives in the wake of the bribery scandal.

The move came on the same day the South Korean smartphone maker forecast record third-quarter operating profit on the back of the memory chip business which Kwon was instrumental in building into the world leader.

“The timing is nonsensical. Samsung tipped record earnings, it’s going to be better in the fourth-quarter, and all that’s been driven by Kwon’s components business,” said Park Ju-gun, head of research firm CEO Score.

Kwon, 64, is seen as Samsung Group No. 2. As well as being chairman of the board and a board director, he heads the components business - including memory chips - and the display business.

In a statement, the man known as “Mr Chip” said the time had come to “start anew with new spirit and young leadership”.

“We are fortunately making record earnings right now, but this is the fruit of past decisions and investments; we are not able to even get close to finding new growth engines by reading future trends right now,” he added.

The world’s biggest maker of memory chips, smartphones and TVs is set to smash its annual profit record this year, thanks partly to soaring demand for memory chips. Semiconductors were Samsung’s top earner in the three months through June, making a record 8 trillion won ($7.20 billion).

The global chip industry is undergoing a major shift with Japan’s Toshiba Corp partnering with home rival SK Hynix, and other firms consolidating in search of new growth areas like artificial intelligence and automobiles.

Shares in Samsung, worth about $310 billion, fell 1.5 percent on Friday after hitting an all-time high earlier in the day.

CHANGING THE OLD GUARD

The departure of 32-year Samsung veteran Kwon after five years in the top job comes at a time of leadership uncertainty at the company.

Slideshow (2 Images)

Choi Gee-sung, Jay Lee’s mentor, quit earlier this year for his alleged role in the bribery scandal, and Samsung Electronics now needs to fill several more key roles with Kwon’s exit.

Kwon would serve out his term as chairman of the board and board director until March 2018, the company said. He is also not stepping down immediately from his two other roles.

A Samsung Electronics spokeswoman declined comment on the exact timing of succession and potential successors for Kwon’s roles.

While Samsung Group is South Korea’s top conglomerate with businesses ranging from smartphones to hotels - it has had no ‘Plan B’ for taking big decisions following Lee’s arrest, people familiar with the matter have said.

“I‘m worried about a leadership vacuum at a time when Lee is absent from management,” Chung Sun-sup, chief executive of research firm Chaebul.com, said following Kwon’s announcement.

The leadership changes also could be an opportunity for a new generation to emerge, he added.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Klippies and coke. Ricky Louw. Karate Water.

These are the orders ringing out in bars across South Africa as thrifty consumers switch from imported, big-brand whisky to various types of locally produced brandy to quench their thirst.

The trend, fueled by a stagnant economy that is strangling spending, has led to the first increase in brandy sales for more than a decade, and falling sales of pricier whisky.

This is an unexpected reversal in a country that multinationals Pernod Ricard and Diageo targeted as a lucrative growth market for their whisky brands, and where they had enjoyed years of surging sales among an emerging middle class. Pernod Ricard sells more Jameson in South Africa than anywhere else apart from the United States.

Brandy still lags its rival in the contest to be the number one spirit by some distance - about 32 million liters is sunk a year versus nearly 39 million of whisky - but the gap has almost halved since 2014, when the economic slump set in.

Most brandies retail for around $8 (110 rand) for a 750 ml bottle, compared with around $13 for Diageo’s Johnnie Walker Red Label and $20 for Pernod Ricard’s Jameson, the two most popular whiskies. A significant price difference in a country where the minimum wage is less than $2 an hour.

“At my local a double brandy is the same price as a single Jameson,” says Fred Bester, 36, a sales consultant for technology startups in Johannesburg. “That’s why I now drink brandy.”

The international companies, however, are fighting back. They are shifting focus to more affordable whisky brands and dipping into their war chests to step up marketing drives.

Pernod Ricard does not break down results by country, but acknowledged brandy was taking market share in South Africa because of lower pricing.

The company’s national sales director Werner Vosloo told Reuters it was trying to avoid a “knee-jerk” reaction that could damage the long-term potential and image of its brands and so was steering clear of price cuts.

He said it was also increasing advertising and promotional spending. He declined to provide figures, but the drive is evident on billboards, TVs and social media across the country.

Hollywood actor Don Cheadle can be seen sipping Chivas Regal on a huge billboard overlooking one of the country’s busiest routes, on the way to the Johannesburg business hub of Sandton - known as the richest square mile in Africa.

Pernod Ricard has also had a marketing push for its more affordable premium brand, Ballantine‘s, which costs about $15. It is trying to woo customers with “gift packs”, said Vosloo, typically a free whisky glass or two when you buy a bottle.

Britain’s Diageo, the number one player, has seen a 6 percent drop in whisky sales volumes over the past year. But it said this year that it was benefiting from the launch in the country of Johnnie Walker Green Label - a more affordable gift option to its high-end Blue Label. A bottle costs $47 versus $160.

The two companies dominate the market for whisky, which accounts for a third of the South African spirits market. They are, however, somewhat insulated from falling sales by solid demand for vodka, which they also sell. It is the nation’s No.3 spirit, with about 27 million liters consumed last year.

WINE THAT BURNS

At the turn of the century, brandy - first distilled in South Africa on a Dutch ship in Cape Town harbor in 1672 - was the number one spirit by a stretch, with around 40 million liters consumed a year, almost twice the amount of whisky.

Over the following years, however, robust economic growth averaging nearly 5 percent gave rise to a burgeoning middle class with more disposable income. Sales of more imported whisky rocketed while brandy demand shrunk.

Slowing economic growth over the past three years has hammered household incomes. After a recession in the first two quarters of 2017, growth is forecast by the central bank to reach 0.6 percent this year, not nearly enough to make a dent in the unemployment rate of 27.7 percent.

Whisky consumption has dropped, falling from a high of 43.2 million liters in 2014 to 38.7 million in 2016, data from industry monitor SAWIS shows.

Slideshow (8 Images)

The consumption of brandy, or brandewyn - an Afrikaans word that means “the wine that burns” - meanwhile increased for the first time since 2005 last year, to 32.1 million liters, from 31.6 million in 2015.

The recovery is driven by locally produced products - French Cognac and other imported brandies account for only 1 percent of the market and are aimed at the wealthiest consumers.

The surge in local brandy sales is also supporting the local wine industry because South African regulations require brandy producers to use wine as their base product. With every 1 percent rise in brandy sales volumes, the price of distilling wine is lifted by 0.9 percent, according to industry players.

“Wine producers earmark grapes specifically for wine that goes to brandy producers and they usually get paid quite quickly, which is good for cashflow and supports thousands of jobs,” said Christo Conradie of industry group Vinpro which represents 3,500 wine producers.

‘RENAISSANCE’

The chief executives of two of the largest three brandy producers - Distell and KWV - told Reuters that the rising sales trend had continued since the latest SAWIS figures were released, and that they had both seen a 5 percent increase in volumes in the past year.

“Brandy sales have recovered and it has definitely been the weaker economy playing a role,” Distell’s CEO Richard Rushton told Reuters. “Consumers are cutting back and have been choosing brandy as good value for money.”

Distell makes Klipdrift and Richelieu, nicknamed klippies and Ricky Louw (a common name) by drinkers. But it’s the cheaper Viceroy label - about $7 a bottle - that has shown the strongest sales growth, Rushton said.

Boyce Lloyd, CEO of KWV, which makes brandy of various cask ages under the KWV label, said the economic slump had fueled a “renaissance” for the spirit - widely dubbed karate water because of its alcoholic kick.

A test championship has long been mooted as a means to make the longest form of the game more relevant for fans who have increasingly turned towards limited-overs matches.

ICC Chief Executive Dave Richardson told reporters in Auckland on Friday that while details still needed to be worked out, the test championship would commence after the 50-overs World Cup in 2019 and culminate with a final in mid-2021.

Nine of the 12 test-approved countries -- Zimbabwe, Afghanistan and Ireland will initially be excluded -- will play three home and three away series over the two years that count towards the championship.

The series can be a minimum of two matches and maximum of five, with all tests to be five days in length. The top-two teams in April 2021 will meet in the final two months later.

Richardson added that a 13-team ODI league would be introduced from 2021 and determine which teams qualify for the World Cup in India two years later.

“The approval of both leagues is the conclusion of two years of work from the members who have explored a whole range of options to bring context to every game,” he said.

“The ICC Board decision means we can now go and finalise a playing schedule ... as well as the points system, hosting arrangements and competition terms.”

Richardson said countries were welcome to experiment with four-day test matches but they would not count towards the championship.

South Africa will play Zimbabwe in cricket’s first four-day test on Dec. 26 and Richardson said that while the concept was still in the trial phase it should help Afghanistan and Ireland, who were granted test status in June, get up to speed faster.

“Throughout the discussions about the future of test cricket it became clear that whilst context is crucial we must also consider alternatives and trial initiatives that may support the future viability of test cricket,” Richardson said.

”The trial is exactly that, a trial, just in the same way day-night tests and technology have been trialled.

“Four-day tests will also provide the new test-playing countries with more opportunities to play the longer version of the game against more experienced opponents, which, in turn, will help them to hone their skills and close the gap with the top nine ranked teams.”","ICC gives green light to test championship, ODI league",https://www.reuters.com/article/cricket-icc/icc-gives-green-light-to-test-championship-odi-league-idINKBN1CI0D9

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Investors are increasingly excited about the prospects for much faster growth in the solar power industry in Southeast Asia, which has until now been a backwater for renewable energy.

They say that the region is in a perfect position to benefit from rapidly declining prices in solar panels. It has strong economic growth, relatively high costs of electricity and a shortage from traditional sources, undeveloped infrastructure in more remote areas, plenty of sunshine, and backing for more renewable energy from many of Southeast Asia’s governments.

“Dramatically falling costs for solar energy technologies means businesses and governments are choosing renewable energy not for environmental reasons but for economic ones,” said Roberto De Vido, spokesman for Singapore-based Equis, one of Asia’s biggest green energy-focused investment firms with $2.7 billion in committed capital. “It simply makes good business sense. And that’s a trend that’s not going to change,”

By the end of last year, Southeast Asia had installed solar capacity of only just over 3 gigawatts (GW), a mere 1 percent of global capacity, according to data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena).

Steve O’Neil, the chief executive of Singapore-based solar panel maker REC, said he expects that to grow by 5 GW of new installations every year between 2017-2020. That’s the equivalent of building five standard fossil-fuel power stations annually.

""People don't realize what is about to happen, when you're in the middle of exponential growth,"" said REC's O'Neil. ""It's transformational.

Some European funds are among those looking at the region.

“The projects on offer in Europe are stagnating, so European investors are looking in that direction with great interest,” said Armin Sandhoevel, chief investment officer for Infrastructure Equity at Allianz Global Investors, whose team manages 1.6 billion euros ($1.76 billion) worth of renewable investments.

“In Asia, you’d expect double-digit returns. That’s hard to achieve in Europe,” he said.

Southeast Asia has a population of more than 600 million and annual power demand growth of 6 percent, which most countries struggle to meet.

Solar power potential is measured by Global Horizontal Irradiation (GHI), a measurement of the intensity of the sun. Thailand has a GHI that can produce 1,600 to 2,000 kilowatt-hours of solar power per square meter (kWh/m2), well above the 1,000 to 1,200 kWh/m2 in Europe’s solar leader Germany, according to solar weather and data provider Solargis.

The region is ripe for a boom because solar panel prices have crashed to under 50 cents per watt of electricity today from $70 per watt in 1980 as technology and manufacturing efficiency have improved consistently.

At the same time, Southeast Asian countries have all set ambitious renewable energy targets, ranging from 18 percent of overall energy generation mix in Thailand and Malaysia to 35 percent in the Philippines, up from negligible levels today.

There are, of course, still risks for investors - including currency volatility, the difficulties of making land acquisitions, and usually the lack of any government guarantees, said Sharad Somani, head of Asia/Pacific Power & Utilities at KPMG.

Storing solar power through the night remains a hurdle too, though battery technology is improving rapidly.

VENTURE CAPITAL

Bringing together international investors, panel makers, and potential users is a small but growing group of venture capital firms, mostly based in Singapore.

GA Power is one such firm. Led by German solar business veterans, it focuses entirely on financing and developing solar projects across Southeast Asia.

“There is more money than there are projects. If you can offer professional developed projects, you’ll have no issue organizing funding,” said Roland Quast, GA Power’s managing director, adding that “a solar boom in Southeast Asia is unavoidable” given it is now a competitive power source.

Slideshow (14 Images)

He said an investor can expect around a 12 percent economic internal rate of return on average in the region. The measurement reflects returns after costs for the construction, installation, and operation of a project.

Mid-sized solar projects that can be turned on without having to tap into a larger grid are in favor in the region as governments seek to bring power to an area without having to add expensive infrastructure, Quast said.

KPMG’s Somani, who is an adviser in the renewables sector, said that Equis and other funds are raising capital with U.S. and European institutional investors, including pension funds. Equis declined to provide detail on the sources of its money.

“Today we have unique confluence of all three factors necessary for success of such projects – demand for projects from government/utility side supported by conducive regulatory framework, strong developer and supplier interest and abundance of domestic and international financing availability,” Somani said.

KILLER ARGUMENT

At the REC solar panel factory in Singapore, one of Singapore’s biggest manufacturing sites, a thousand workers and more than a hundred robots work around the clock, churning out 20 containers full of panels every day, which are immediately sent to overseas customers, increasingly to Southeast Asia.

“We produce 14,000 panels per day, which go into 20 containers, 24/7. We never stop,” REC’s O‘Neil told Reuters during a recent visit to the factory.

Founded in Norway, headquartered in Singapore, and owned by Chinese industrial giant ChemChina, O‘Neil says that REC sells globally, but that he expects “Southeast Asia to become a game-changer.”

In 2016, REC grew by just 3 percent in Southeast Asia - excluding the huge solar markets of India, China and Australia. This year, it expects 5 percent growth in the region, and then 9 to 10 percent growth annually between 2018 and 2020.

The business is cut-throat. Cheap Chinese production of solar panels has left a trail of collapsed companies in its wake - the bankruptcies of Germany’s SolarWorld, once Europe’s biggest panel maker, and major U.S. panel maker Suniva are among them.

To survive, REC says it needs to be in a relentless drive to improve productivity, including employing low-wage Malaysian workers and automating as much as possible.

“Our panels are now cheaper than a same-sized window,” said O‘Neil.",Here comes the sun: investors increasingly hot on solar projects in S.E. Asia,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asia-renewables-analysis/here-comes-the-sun-investors-increasingly-hot-on-solar-projects-in-s-e-asia-idUSKBN18Y0DU

As Reuters recently reported, the White House is preparing to shift oversight of the sale of American-manufactured small arms from the diligent State Department review process to the business-friendly Commerce Department. By loosening the inter-agency guidelines in an attempt to boost America’s share in the global marketplace, the Trump administration runs the risk of fueling the civil wars currently bringing misery to millions worldwide.

The aim of this policy is to enable U.S. weapons manufactures to sell their products overseas quickly by trimming the bureaucratic red tape now governing the export of non-military grade weapons and ammunition. According to the Reuters report, the new plan would mean that commercial gun exports would no longer be given the same scrutiny as missile and fighter jet sales, which often require congressional approval. The shift would also move weapons like assault rifles and handguns from the State Department’s tightly-restricted Munitions list to the Commerce Control Lists, which allows for more streamlined licensing for international sales. While the administration has explained these new procedures as a logical extension of a U.S. president who is solidly pro-business, the transfer of authority from Foggy Bottom will have unintended and damaging foreign policy repercussions.

In contrast to the significant decline in major conventional conflicts over the last 50 years, unconventional conflicts within a sovereign state’s territory, such as the current war in Syria, have become the new normal. Small weapons like AK-47’s assault rifles, Kalashnikovs, sniper rifles, and low-grade explosives are used in most of these confrontations. Indeed, the ease with which a combatant with little military training can use semi-automatic weapons on the battlefield is part of the weapons’ appeal.

As Senators Ben Cardin, Patrick Leahy, and Dianne Feinstein wrote in a letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in opposing the new rules, the civil wars and rebellions currently taking place are being fueled by the illegal sales of what many Americans would categorize as sports rifles or hunting equipment.

Relaxing the rules on small arms exports is counterproductive to the U.S. objective of de-escalating these conflicts. The new administration policy has the potential to squander the inclusive diplomatic processes Washington has encouraged in order to promote peaceful approaches to conflict resolution in states as varied as South Sudan, Ukraine, and Colombia. Multiple agencies and departments within the U.S. government would in effect be working against one another, with the State Department hoping to end the very hostilities that are sustained by American-manufactured weapons.

Washington would not be deliberately arming combatants in a civil war, but the handguns and assault rifles American firearms manufacturers sell on the open market could find their way to a conflict zone through smuggling and diversion. In one highly-publicized case last year, corrupt Jordanian intelligence officers sold a cache of rocket-propelled grenades and Kalashnikov rifles that were destined for the moderate Syrian opposition to arms merchants on the underground market. The FBI later determined that one of those weapons was likely to have been responsible for the shooting deaths of two American contractors in Jordan that same year.

The civil war in Libya illustrates the insecurity that can result when governments send weapons into a conflict zone without crafting the necessary oversight and security measures that help prevent them from being sold off elsewhere. During the 2011 armed rebellion against Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, Washington's Arab partners – with the secret blessing of the Obama administration – delivered military assistance to the rebels trying to oust the regime. While the military aid helped to drive Gaddafi from power after eight months of combat, that same equipment eventually helped fuel the civil war still ravaging Libya. Libyan militias previously concerned with overthrowing Qaddafi began stockpiling arms to increase their political leverage for later internal battles. The availability of weapons in Libya remains so overwhelming that U.N. experts have categorized the North African country as a regional weapons bazaar. Weapons that were sent into the country to aid the Libyan rebellion have been diverted to other regional conflicts, either through arms smuggling across lightly defended borders or through illicit arms deals. African officials claim that some of these arms likely assisted the jihadist Boko Haram group to recover after serious territorial losses against the Nigerian army.

According to the Small Arms Survey, the United States is already the world’s top exporter of small arms, having reached a total of $1.1 billion in 2014. While this figure is small compared to the far larger conventional weapons contracts U.S. defense manufacturers sign every year, the possibility that even a fraction of these commercial weapons could leak into a conflict zone would have a deeply negative impact.

The question is whether the monetary benefits that are likely to result from the administration’s new rules are enough to compensate for the instability and violence that are likely to increase with more small arms available for sale around the world. The ease with which U.S. arms companies will now be able to export their products may be terrific from a business perspective. But from the standpoint of international peace and security, this policy is a dangerous gamble for the White House to take.

YOKKAICHI, Japan (Reuters) - Toshiba Corp said it is discussing joint investment in a new chip production line with Western Digital Corp - its estranged business partner after the Japanese firm chose a different suitor to buy its $18 billion semiconductor business.

After a long and highly contentious auction, Toshiba agreed last month to sell the prized chip unit to a consortium led by Bain Capital LP, overcoming a key hurdle as it scrambles for funds to cover billions of dollars in liabilities arising from its now bankrupt U.S. nuclear unit Westinghouse.

Western Digital, which became Toshiba’s chip venture partner with its acquisition of SanDisk last year, argues that any deal will need its consent and has sought an injunction with the International Court of Arbitration.

Given competition with Samsung Electronics Co, it is best to have amicable ties with Sandisk, Yasuo Naruke, the head of the flash memory chip unit told a news conference.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s economy shows little sign of improving on lacklustre growth and it seems “extraordinary” that the Bank of England is considering raising interest rates, the British Chambers of Commerce said on Friday.

The BCC’s Quarterly Economic Survey of businesses, the largest of its kind, said sales at services firms that make up the bulk of the economy were steady in the third quarter.

But there was little pick-up in pay pressures or investment, both of which the BoE expects to rise markedly next year.

Overall the BCC described the survey as “uninspiring”, with political uncertainty, currency fluctuations and Brexit clearly affecting British businesses.

Despite confounding forecasts that the 2016 vote to leave the European Union would lead to a sudden slowdown, Britain’s economy has struggled this year, posting its worst first-half performance since 2012.

The BCC said price pressures in companies, while high historically, looked likely to peak soon.

“Against this backdrop, it seems extraordinary that the Bank of England are considering raising interest rates,” said Suren Thiru, BCC head of economics.

In September the BoE said interest rates would probably rise “in the coming months” if the economy continued to grow and price pressures kept building.

INFLATION

The BCC survey suggested that business activity was probably strong enough to absorb slack in the economy - one of the BoE’s markers for raising rates soon, JPMorgan economist Allan Monks said in a research note.

“Another marker, however, was to see underlying inflation pressures building. But the pay settlements reading of the BCC remained close to a record low in (the third quarter),” Monks added.

Unlike the larger services sector, manufacturers enjoyed both better domestic and export sales over the past three months, the BCC said.

While gauges of confidence in turnover and profitability stood at their highest levels since 2015, the survey pointed to only a marginal improvement in manufacturers’ investment intentions.

A slightly larger proportion of manufacturers said they expected to raise prices, but this was mostly down to the cost of raw materials rather than pressure from pay settlements.

In the services sector, a net 15 percent of firms reported that pay was putting pressure on prices - up just a percentage point from the five-year low struck in the second quarter.

Other surveys, including one from the BoE’s regional advisers, have pointed to similar weakness in corporate pay intentions.","'Extraordinary' for BoE to mull rate hike as economy struggles, BCC says",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-economy/extraordinary-for-boe-to-mull-rate-hike-as-economy-struggles-bcc-says-idUKKBN1CH37X

NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Thursday prescribed a quick fix to undo Obamacare through executive order after Republicans in the U.S. Congress failed to repeal and replace the healthcare law as promised, but industry experts said there are many steps involved that will slow it down.

Trump’s plan rests on one main pillar, the creation of associations in which multiple employers can band together to buy health plans under the same law that large employers do. That law rests outside of many of the mandates of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, dubbed Obamacare.

Here are some questions and answers about these plans.

WHO CAN BUY THESE PLANS?

Potentially, small business employees and maybe even more people would be able to buy such plans. The executive order envisions that associations will form to offer these new health plans for small businesses that want to join together. It is not clear from the order whether freelance workers or other individuals interested in buying health insurance outside of Obamacare would be able to access these association plans through other routes. That may be decided in the federal rule-making process, which takes months.

WHO WILL FORM THESE NEW ASSOCIATIONS?

There currently are some associations that have united to buy health insurance, but the order imagines the creation of many new associations around the country. By allowing small businesses to join forces to create a larger pool of employees when buying insurance, these associations can decrease the risk of having a higher proportion of members with costly illnesses that can drive up coverage costs for small employers.

It is not clear who would create these groups, but there are some employer trade groups, like the National Restaurant Association, that have advocated this year to allow restaurants to band together to buy healthcare.

WHAT‘S THE NEXT STEP?

Groups first need to create an association, register it with the U.S. Labor Department, design the benefit plans, sign up medical providers or hire a third-party company that establishes networks of doctors, and then advertise and sell those plans to employees, insurance experts said.

Signing up providers such as doctors and hospitals could be challenging, especially across state lines, said Dave Dillon, a fellow and actuary at the Society of Actuaries. Doctors and hospitals charge higher prices when they are uncertain about how many patients they might have, even when they are dealing with known entities like the large health insurers.

In addition, Americans next month are due to start buying their plans for next year during open enrollment, whether that is through an employer or on their own.

That means 2018 would be off the table for the executive order’s provisions.

2019 AT THE EARLIEST?

“To get ready for 2019, you would have to be fairly up and running by the spring or early summer, and you would have to have things in place for the employers who would want to sell coverage for a 1/1 date,” Dillon said, referring to Jan. 1, 2019.

By the time April rolls around, health insurers like Aetna Inc and UnitedHealth Group Inc and benefit design brokers like Aon PLC and Mercer, part of Marsh & McLennan Cos., are shopping around plans for 2019 with the goal to sign contracts by the summer. That gives them time to create the advertisements and documents that go to employees in time for sign-up.

The 2019 plans would go on sale in November 2018.

WHAT ELSE COULD MESS THIS UP?

LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - Border controls inside what should normally be Europe’s cherished zone of free travel are here to stay for now, EU ministers said on Friday, citing continued terrorist threats and the need to control migration.

Germany, France, Austria, Sweden, Denmark and Norway told their Schengen zone peers they will extend until mid-May internal frontier checks first put in place in 2015 to counter unprecedented levels of migration and Islamist attacks.

At a meeting of European Union interior ministers in Luxembourg, Germany’s Thomas de Maiziere said Berlin was still committed to freedom of movement, “but at the moment we cannot do without checks.”

“The reason is the tense security situation in Europe with regards to international terrorism and the still inadequate protection of our external borders,” he said.

France, which imposed emergency border controls after Islamist attackers killed 130 people in Paris in November, 2015, also wants to keep them in place.

“The issues around terrorism are still extremely important for us,” French Interior Minister Gerard Colomb said. “France wants to extend border controls by six months.”

The other four countries announced the same move, citing “serious threat to public policy or internal security” before the authorization to impose the border checks expires next month.

Nearly all EU states consider the free-travel Schengen area as a major benefit of decades of European integration, and are keen to avoid disruptions to travel and trade.

But border checks have become the new reality over the last two years and the bloc is working on changing its laws to allow for the introduction of such measures more easily and for longer periods.","Border checks to stay in Europe weary of attacks, migration",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-security-borders/border-checks-to-stay-in-europe-weary-of-attacks-migration-idUSKBN1CI1FN?il=0

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is likely to take a major step against the international nuclear deal with Iran on Friday, laying out a more aggressive approach to Iranian activities in the Middle East that risks upsetting U.S. relations with European allies.

“It is time for the entire world to join us in demanding that Iran’s government end its pursuit of death and destruction,” Trump said in a White House statement that flagged key elements of the strategy.

He is to present his plan in a 12:45 p.m. EDT (1645 GMT)speech at the White House, the product of weeks of internal discussions between him and his national security team.

U.S. officials said Trump was expected to announce that he will not certify the 2015 nuclear accord between Iran and six world powers, one he has called the “worst deal ever” as it was not, in his view, in the U.S. national interest.

Trump found himself under immense pressure as he considered de-certifying the deal, a move that would ignore warnings from inside and outside his administration that to do so would risk undermining U.S. credibility abroad.

He had formally reaffirmed it twice before but aides said he was reluctant to do so a third time.

De-certification would not pull the United States out of the deal but would give the Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions on Tehran that were suspended under the pact, negotiated during the administration of President Barack Obama.

Michael McCaul, chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Homeland Security Committee, told Reuters he thinks Trump “is likely to not completely pull out of the deal, but decertify compliance.”

If Washington quits the deal, that will be the end of it and global chaos could ensue, Iran’s influential parliament speaker, Ali Larijani, was quoted by the Russian news agency TASS as saying during a visit to St Petersburg on Friday.

“FOOTPRINTS ON THE GROUND”

U.N. nuclear inspectors say Iran is in compliance with the accord, which limited the scope of Iran’s nuclear program to help ensure it could not be put to developing bombs in exchange for a lifting of international sanctions on Tehran.

Trump says Tehran is in violation of the spirit of the agreement and has done nothing to rein in its ballistic missile program or its financial and military support for the Lebanese Shi‘ite movement Hezbollah and other militant groups.

White House Chief of Staff John Kelly said on Thursday the U.S. approach toward Iran is to work with allies in the Middle East to contain Tehran’s activities.

“We have footprints on the ground, naval and Air Force is there to just demonstrate our resolve, our friendship, and try to deter anything that any country out there may do,” Kelly told reporters.

European allies warn of a split with the United States over the nuclear agreement, in part because they are benefiting economically from a relaxation of sanctions.

A variety of European allies, including the leaders of Britain and France, have personally appealed to Trump to re-certify the nuclear accord for the sake of allied unity.

Germany’s government pledged on Friday to work for continued unity if Trump de-certified the deal as Berlin remain convinced the agreement was an important tool to prevent Iran developing nuclear weapons.

Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel underlined German views in a telephone call with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson late on Thursday, his spokeswoman Maria Adebahr told reporters.

Gabriel said on Thursday U.S. behavior was driving a wedge between Europe and its close ally United States and bringing Europeans closer to Russia and China. “It’s imperative that Europe sticks together on this issue,” said Gabriel.

Russian President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said on Friday that if the United States ditched the nuclear pact, “this will damage the atmosphere of predictability, security, stability and non-proliferation in the entire world”.

U.S. MOVE AGAINST REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS

McCaul said he expected Trump also to announce some kind of action against the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IGRC), the country’s most powerful security entity. Trump is under a legal mandate to impose U.S. economic sanctions on the Revolutionary Guards as a whole by Oct. 31 or waive them.

U.S. sanctions could seriously hurt the IRGC as it controls large swaths of Iran’s economy. The Guards’ foreign paramilitary and espionage wing, the Quds Force, is under U.S. sanctions, as is the Quds Force commander, other officials and associated individuals and entities.

The deputy Quds commander, Brigadier-General Esmail Ghaani, was quoted by Iran’ Tasnim news agency on Friday as saying Trump’s threats would “damage” the United States.

“We are not a war-mongering country. But any military action against Iran will be regretted...We have buried many...like Trump and know how to fight against America,” Ghaani said.

“EMBARRASSMENT”

The 2015 nuclear agreement, signed by the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China, the European Union and Iran, has been denounced by Trump as “an embarrassment”.

European officials have categorically ruled out renegotiating the deal but have said they share Trump’s concerns about Iran’s destabilizing influence in the Middle East.

China has said it hopes the agreement will stay intact.

Israel, Iran’s arch-adversary in the Middle East, welcomed Trump’s anticipated announcement on Friday but voiced doubt that the tougher tack by Washington could turn around the Islamic Republic.

The International Atomic Energy Agency concluded that Iran secretly researched a nuclear warhead until 2009, which Tehran denies. Iran has always insisted its uranium enrichment activity is for civilian energy purposes, not for atomic bombs.

The threat of new U.S. action has prompted a public display of unity from rival factions among Iran’s rulers. Iran will react sharply to any U.S. move against the nuclear deal with global powers, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told the Iranian parliament on Wednesday.

BARCELONA (Reuters) - Atletico Madrid president Enrique Cerezo wants the club’s fans to avoid turning Saturday’s game with Barcelona into a political demonstration following weeks of rising tensions between the Spanish government and Catalonia.

Catalan club Barca visit the Spanish capital for the first time since a banned vote on independence from Spain took place in Catalonia on Oct. 1.

Barca decided that day to play their game with Las Palmas at the Nou Camp behind closed doors to show opposition to police violence against voters, Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu said at the time.

The Frente Atletico (Atletico Front) supporters’ group have called for a mass display of Spain flags in the Wanda Metropolitano stadium for the visit of Barca.

Yet the game has not been classified as a high-risk event by the Spanish football federation as no Barcelona fans will be present due to a disagreement between the two clubs over a ticket allocation.

“I want the game to be played with the same sporting spirit as always against Barcelona, Saturday’s game is not a political demonstration, it’s a game of football,” Cerezo said in an interview with radio station Onda Cero on Friday.

“Atletico won the league in the Nou Camp (in 2014) and the whole stadium applauded us, we can’t forget that.”

Barcelona are the only team that Diego Simeone has been unable to beat in La Liga since he took over Atletico in 2011 and transformed the club’s fortunes.

He has failed to win in 11 league encounters between the teams, although his side have twice eliminated the Catalans in the Champions League.

“They’ve always scored one goal more than us, they’ve been decisive in the key moments and they are a very good team,” Simeone told a news conference ahead of the game.

“We have been stronger in the Champions League and I hope tomorrow we can overcome this obstacle.”

Barca have a 100 percent record in the league and in Europe this season and lead the standings by five points over nearest challengers Sevilla. They are six points clear of Atletico in fourth.

“They are one of the best teams in the world, right now I’d say Real Madrid are slightly better, but they have reinvented themselves very quickly after the departure of Neymar and their players never tire of winning,” added the Argentine coach.

Simeone, however, was unapologetic about the state of the pitch at the Wanda Metropolitano stadium, with Spanish media questioning the length of the grass.

The pitch has been a topic of debate in the month since the ground opened and in the lead up to Saturday’s match, with Barca’s passing game thriving off a slick playing surface.

“I‘m not a groundsman, I‘m a coach, but if you invite me to your house I use your plates and if you come to my place you use my things,” Simeone said.","Soccer: Barca game not a political protest, says Atletico president",https://www.reuters.com/article/soccer-spain-atm-fcb-cerezo/soccer-barca-game-not-a-political-protest-says-atletico-president-idINKBN1CI1RY

The industry group said actual sales, not seasonally adjusted, were down 11.0 percent from September 2016, while home prices were up 10.7 percent from a year earlier, according to the group’s home price index.

“National sales appear to be stabilizing,” CREA President Andrew Peck said in a statement. “While encouraging, it’s too early to tell if this is the beginning of a longer-term trend.”

Canada’s once-sizzling housing market has cooled dramatically in recent months, particularly in Toronto, the largest city, after a foreign buyers tax was announced in April, and analysts are divided over whether the market is in the midst of a full-scale correction or will bounce back quickly.

In addition to the implementation of a foreign buyers tax in Vancouver in 2016 and Toronto in 2017, two recent interest rate hikes by the Bank of Canada has helped rein in demand.

The report showed activity was up on the month in about half of all local markets, including Vancouver and Toronto. Cities around Toronto had mixed results, with activity remaining near record lows or falling further in some markets.

Sales were down from year-ago levels in nearly three-quarters of all local markets, led by Toronto and nearby housing markets.

The 10.7 percent year-over-year increase in CREA’s Home Price Index was a continued deceleration in annual price gains earlier in the year. The actual national average price for homes sold in September was up almost 3 percent from a year ago at C$487,000 ($390,537), CREA said.

Home resale prices dropped 0.8 percent in September from August, their biggest fall in seven years, while new home prices rose 0.1 percent in August, separate reports showed on Thursday. [L2N1MN0KT]

The report showed the number of newly listed homes rebounded almost 5 percent in September from August, breaking a string of three straight declines.

The national sales-to-new listings ratio declined to 55.7 percent from 57.2 percent in August. A ratio between 40 and 60 percent is generally consistent with a balanced market.

MANILA (Reuters) - U.S. actor Steven Seagal, famous for playing action roles like a vice squad detective in “Above the Law”, met Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte while on a location scouting trip in Manila.

Video footage released by government channel RTVM showed Seagal animatedly talking to Duterte.

Seagal, 65, was in the Philippines to look for a location for his upcoming movie which will be “about illegal drugs and other crimes”, a presidential palace statement said.

The statement said that Duterte told Seagal that “movies are a reflection of life” and “reiterated his strong stance against illegal drugs because it enslaves people to a form of synthetic chemical.”

Duterte has been involved in a deadly drug war since taking office last June, and on Wednesday ordered all drug operations be left to the drug enforcement agency, amid unprecedented scrutiny of police conduct in the brutal crackdown that has left thousands of Filipinos dead.

Earlier this week, Seagal said at a news conference in Manila that he didn’t think the Philippines was “a dangerous place”.

“It’s a place that’s up and coming with the new leadership,” the Philippine Star reported him as saying.

Duterte was nicknamed “The Punisher” due to his zero-tolerance of crime and drugs during the 22 years he was mayor of southern Davao City.

A former martial arts instructor, Seagal is famous for action hero roles in blockbuster movies in the 1990s, such as “Under Siege” and “Hard To Kill”.

He has also starred in a reality television series called “Steven Seagal: Lawman”, in which he carries out duties as a reserve deputy sheriff in Louisiana.","Steven Seagal meets 'The Punisher' Duterte, talks drug war",https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idCAKBN1CI0CG-OCAEN

(Reuters) - Cash-strapped U.S. shale firms scaled back their hedging programs in the first quarter, leaving them more vulnerable to tumbling spot market prices just after OPEC reached a landmark deal to curb global supply.

The pullback in hedging was driven by rising service costs and expectations that prices would continue to rally after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended those cuts in May, analysts said.

However, rising U.S. production has stymied OPEC’s efforts to rebalance markets. Crude oil futures LCOc1 have lost 15 percent of their value since February, raising the risk that unhedged companies are more exposed to market weakness.

The market peaked at $55 a barrel in January as cuts got under way, but has struggled since, and closed Monday at $48.29 a barrel [O/R], barely changed from the end of November, when OPEC agreed with nonmembers to cut 1.8 million barrels a day in supply.

For oil traders, hedging data serves as a leading indicator of future supplies. With so little hedged, dealers say producers are now looking to hedge at the next chance possible, a move that will pressure prices in coming months.

Producers hedge by buying a variety of financial options to secure a minimum price for crude and safeguard future production.

According to a Reuters analysis of hedging disclosures by the 30 largest U.S. shale firms, most stayed on the sidelines in the first three months of 2017, a stark contrast from a year ago when firms rushed to lock in prices, even though oil was trading $15 a barrel lower.

In total, 18 companies reduced outstanding oil options, swaps or other derivatives positions by a total of 49 million barrels from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, the data shows. Another 10 companies increased their hedging positions by 91 million barrels; two others did not hedge at all.

Infographic ID: '2rolpok'

Compared with a year ago, the group is more exposed to falling oil prices, with one-fifth fewer barrels hedged, or the equivalent of 28 million barrels, and three times more barrels rolling off, or the equivalent of 38 million barrels.

“A lot of producers held back on locking in hedges in the first quarter because OPEC cut their historic deal and they thought there would be a linear shift higher in prices. But then, we saw several pullbacks,” said Michael Tran, director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets.

Prices are too low now for producers to lock in large volumes of future production, Tran said. In addition, pent-up demand for hedging will pressure any moves higher in the oil market, he said.

UNDERHEDGED ANXIETIES

Morgan Stanley said in a recent note that producers are hedged at around 12 percent of their 2018 output and 40 percent for their current 2017 output.

The increases were driven by Hess Corp (HES.N) and Apache Corp (APA.N), which had previously remained unhedged. They added a combined 54 million barrels.

Analysts expect U.S. oil drilling to taper off as old hedge positions wind down, leaving smaller producers exposed to market prices at below break-even levels.

“I think companies are a little bit nervous that they are underhedged right now and they will try to take advantage of any hedging opportunity they get at about $50 per barrel,” said Bill Costello, a portfolio manager at Westwood Holdings Group.

SOME NEW PLAYERS

In total, the 30 companies held hedged positions equivalent to about 483 million barrels at the end of March, compared with 441 million at the end of 2016. Excluding Hess and Apache, the two highest hedgers, the group held only 428 million barrels.

Some large players refrained from building a larger buffer. Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) - which held 33.2 million barrels hedged for 2017 in the fourth quarter - had 8 million barrels roll off through the first quarter. EOG Resources (EOG.N) had nearly 6 million barrels unwind after terminating its hedges.

Analysts said much of the hesitation has to do with rising service costs. Firms that supply rigs and crews are clamoring to take back discounts extended during the height of the slump early last year, in some cases boosting prices by 10 to 15 percent.

“Producers are working in an environment where they see service cost increases on the horizon. They see their expenses going up, but their revenues are not going up correspondingly, which is why they do not want to hedge and compress their margins,” said Rob Thummel, a portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors LLC.

(The Sports Xchange) - Dallas Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott suffered a blow on Thursday when a federal appeals court lifted the injunction that prevented him from serving a six-game suspension over an alleged domestic violence incident.

The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans voted 2-1 in favor of the NFL, which requested an emergency hearing after a district court in Texas blocked the suspension last month.

The appeals court ordered the Texas court to dismiss Elliott’s case.

Pratik Shah, a lawyer representing the NFL, insisted the NFL Players Association filed its case in the wrong jurisdiction per last month’s hearing in Sherman, Texas.

The Circuit Court agreed and said in its majority decision that the Players Association filed its lawsuit to have Elliott’s suspension dissolved before an arbitrator could make his decision.

“At the time the NFLPA filed the complaint, it was possible the arbitrator could have issued a final decision that was favorable to Elliott,” the three-judge panel wrote. “Elliott cannot show it was futile to wait for a final decision simply because he believed the arbitrator would issue an unfavorable ruling. As there was no final decision, Elliott had not yet exhausted the contracted-for remedies.”

Elliott’s representatives are expected to appeal Thursday’s developments.

The Cowboys have a bye this week.

The 22-year-old Elliott was found to be in violation of the personal conduct policy by the NFL and the suspension was handed down on Aug. 11.

Elliott, who was not arrested nor charged in the case, maintains his innocence after being accused of assaulting his former girlfriend, Tiffany Thompson. The original punishment was issued by NFL commissioner Roger Goodell after a 13-month league investigation.

Elliott has rushed for 393 yards and two touchdowns in five games this season. He is averaging just 3.7 yards per carry, well below the 5.1-yard mark of last season when he led the NFL with 1,631 rushing yards as a rookie.","Court lifts injunction against Cowboys' Elliott, clears way for ban",https://www.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idCAKBN1CH34W-OCASP

Lee was jailed for bribery.

The surprise resignation of Samsung’s chip and display head came as he was expected to take a bigger role following Lee’s arrest in February and the departures of other key executives in the wake of the bribery scandal.

The move came on the same day the South Korean smartphone maker forecast record third-quarter operating profit on the back of the memory chip business which Kwon was instrumental in building into the world leader.

“The timing is nonsensical. Samsung tipped record earnings, it’s going to be better in the fourth-quarter, and all that’s been driven by Kwon’s components business,” said Park Ju-gun, head of research firm CEO Score.

Kwon, 64, is seen as Samsung Group No. 2. As well as being chairman of the board and a board director, he heads the components business - including memory chips - and the display business.

In a statement, the man known as “Mr Chip” said the time had come to “start anew with new spirit and young leadership”.

“We are fortunately making record earnings right now, but this is the fruit of past decisions and investments; we are not able to even get close to finding new growth engines by reading future trends right now,” he added.

The world’s biggest maker of memory chips, smartphones and TVs is set to smash its annual profit record this year, thanks partly to soaring demand for memory chips. Semiconductors were Samsung’s top earner in the three months through June, making a record 8 trillion won ($7.20 billion).

The global chip industry is undergoing a major shift with Japan’s Toshiba Corp partnering with home rival SK Hynix, and other firms consolidating in search of new growth areas like artificial intelligence and automobiles.

Shares in Samsung, worth about $310 billion, fell 1.5 percent on Friday after hitting an all-time high earlier in the day.

Choi Gee-sung, Jay Lee’s mentor, quit earlier this year for his alleged role in the bribery scandal, and Samsung Electronics now needs to fill several more key roles with Kwon’s exit.

Kwon would serve out his term as chairman of the board and board director until March 2018, the company said. He is also not stepping down immediately from his two other roles.

A Samsung Electronics spokeswoman declined comment on the exact timing of succession and potential successors for Kwon’s roles.

While Samsung Group is South Korea’s top conglomerate with businesses ranging from smartphones to hotels - it has had no ‘Plan B’ for taking big decisions following Lee’s arrest, people familiar with the matter have said.

“I‘m worried about a leadership vacuum at a time when Lee is absent from management,” Chung Sun-sup, chief executive of research firm Chaebul.com, said following Kwon’s announcement.

In its place is a Shiite state dominated by Iran, the de facto new nation of Kurdistan, and a shrinking population of Sunnis tottering between annihilation or reservation-like existence, depending on whether the United States uses the last of its influence to sketch out red lines or abandons the people to fate.

The waste comes in that a better version of a de facto tri-state Iraq was available in 2006. Every life lost (out of a million some, including 4,424 Americans), every dollar spent (in the trillions), and every unanticipated outcome suffered (rise of Islamic State, conflict in Syria, de-democratization of Turkey) since then has been unnecessary.

Tania Karas: At the UN, Trump’s silences spoke volumes

The post-World War One failure to create a Kurdish state resulted in 30 million Kurds scattered across modern Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Syria. The 2003 American invasion of Iraq destroyed civil order in much of the area populated by those Kurds, and opened the door to Iranian influence. Iran and its Iraqi Shiite allies directed political violence against Iraqi Sunnis, paving the way for a Sunni protector, Islamic State, to move in.

When the American-trained (cost: $25 billion) Iraqi national army dropped its weapons and ran in 2014, and Shiite militias proved too weak to fill the breach, Obama reinserted the American military into Iraq, saving the Kurds, by then also under threat from Islamic State. The United States subsequently turned those Kurdish fighters loose in Iraq and later Syria against Islamic State. It was expediency over strategy; there was no force otherwise available in bulk.

And it kind of worked. In the short run.

The Kurds, with American help, blunted Islamic State’s progress. The problem was that while American diplomacy, the carrot-and-stick of aid, and the difficulty of maintaining long-distance logistics saw the Kurdish forces replaced by Shiite militias in some locations, the Kurds held on to their gains in the north, having in most instances displaced Iraqi Sunnis. Victorious and bloodied, the Kurds were not about to renounce their hard-earned gains.

The need for American arms did force Kurdish leaders to postpone an independence referendum, opposed by Washington, in 2014. Three years later, with Islamic State mortally weakened, Washington no longer holds sway over Kurdish ambitions. And although the Sept. 25 referendum has no legal force, Kurdish leaders will use the vote to push Baghdad for full autonomy. Donald Trump, the fifth consecutive American president to make war on Iraq, may be the last simply for lack of an Iraq to fight over.

The ground truth of autumn 2017 -- a Kurdistan in the north, a Shiite state in the south, a marginalized Sunni population out west -- is pretty much the deal that could have been had in 2006 when then-Senator Joe Biden proposed dividing Iraq into statelets. Biden wanted the United States to leave a ""residual force to combat terrorists and keep the [three] neighbors honest.” The Senate actually passed a resolution supporting Biden's idea.

It probably would have stabilized the region. The Middle East in 2006 was a very different place.

In 2006 Iran faced an American military as yet undamaged by an additional decade of grinding war. That military sat on both Iran's western border with Iraq and its eastern border with Afghanistan. The Iranian nuclear program was years behind where it is today. Syria was a relatively stable place under not-then-yet-enemy of the free world Bashar al-Assad; indeed, the British-educated Assad was initially seen as a minor reformer. Turkey was stable. Russia was not a major player in the Middle East.

With many of 2017's regional Pandoras still in the box, by Middle Eastern standards security in a divided Iraq would have been manageable via a modest American military presence.

Instead, events of the last decade mean the chance of Kurdish independence adding to regional stability is near zero. Iran, fearing that an independent Kurdish state could threaten its own sectarian balance, is already conducting maneuvers on the border, has canceled flights to and from Kurdistan, and will push its proxies in Baghdad to take action. Will Turkey, now politically distant from NATO, move to open war over disputed borderlands with Kurdistan? The Turkish parliament just extended its authorization for cross-border incursions for another year. Will Kurdish minorities in Turkey and Iran see this all as their moment to rise? Will Israel, which backs Kurdish independence in its search for regional allies, supply weapons?

In a best-case scenario, where everyone tacitly acknowledges Kurdistan while maintaining the status quo (as with Taiwan, which officially exists as a part of China even as it acts like an independent nation) there may be a measure of stability in the near term. Baghdad will talk tough even as it allows the Kurds a surprising amount of free reign -- for example, Baghdad has withdrawn its police from contested Kirkuk, leaving Kurdish forces fully in charge of the oil-rich city. Kurdistan already has full control over its own education, security, military, taxes, and diplomatic representation. Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdistan regional government, has experimented with diplomatically vague language, saying “self-determination wouldn't mean a direct separation from Iraq.”

Darker predictions involve Syrian-Russian forces contesting Kurdish occupiers inside Syria. Iranian-backed Shiite militias have signaled plans to re-enter Kirkuk, and Turkey already has a running war with Kurdish fighters; tank maneuvers are ongoing with new threats gushing out of Ankara.

American policy has been a blurry gray for some time, calling for the referendum to be postponed without actually supporting or opposing independence. Traditionally the State Department favored a united Iraq somehow, while the Pentagon, with its history of in-the-dirt cooperation with Kurdish fighters stretching back to the 1991 no-fly zone and Operation Provide Comfort that essentially established the preliminary borders of Kurdistan, has been more sympathetic towards independence. The wording of America’s reaction (there has been no post-election statement issued as this is written) to the referendum could signal which part of government is making foreign policy in Iraq these days.

What seems clear is the American role going forward will be mostly limited to diplomacy, and that, regardless of who is carrying out the task, is not the country’s strong suit these days. There seems no appetite in Washington for large-scale troop redeployments, the kind of boots-on-the-ground necessary to decisively shape events.

The American military, which once could have played a role similar to its help in bringing peace to former Yugoslavia, instead will exist as a crumple zone among its own warring semi-allies.

Such a scenario exposes what might have been in 2006 when the United States could have managed events, and 2017, when America can do little more than witness them.",Commentary: Why the Kurdish referendum means the end of Iraq,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-vanburen-kurds-commentary/commentary-why-the-kurdish-referendum-means-the-end-of-iraq-idUSKCN1C125Q

“We are using crayfish like a living chemical laboratory – like a bio indicator and bio sensor together,” said Pavel Kozak, Director of the university’s Research Institute of Fish Culture and Hydrobiology.

Researchers aim to upgrade the technology used in the scheme, and plan to use special cameras to monitor the animals’ hearts.

Draft conclusions submitted by summit chair Donald Tusk to the 27 other EU governments made final Brussels’ rejection of opening free trade talks now. But they also but gave the beleaguered British prime minister hope that they would do so in December -- and that, if she ups her offers on divorce terms, the EU will be ready to start talking almost right away.

With nerves fraying and threats flying about walking out without a deal come the March 2019 deadline for departure, the pound took a knock when EU negotiator Michel Barnier said a new round of talks this week had ended in continued deadlock over a British refusal to clarify how much it will pay on leaving.

But it rallied on word that, despite tough demands from EU governments on what they want from London, the Union is ready to talk about how to avoid a “hard Brexit” and to ease Britain out with less disruption -- probably by agreeing to keep it in the single market for a couple of years, diplomats say.

The draft of conclusions which would be issued by leaders of the 27 next Friday, a day after meeting May in a full EU summit, still have to be agreed. Envoys, including from heavyweights Germany and France, objected last week to a suggestion from Barnier that the EU should start working on transition plans.

But EU officials noted that Tusk, the European Council president, has sounded out most national leaders in recent days -- he briefed May by on his preparations on Thursday.

A senior EU official closely involved in the negotiations said Brussels did not expect major changes to the summit text.

A diplomat from one big country said only that the text would be discussed by national envoys in Brussels on Friday.

“INTERNAL PREPARATORY DISCUSSIONS”

The first version, seen by Reuters, confirms what Barnier and others have said this month: that there is not “sufficient progress” on agreeing three key elements of a withdrawal treaty for leaders to agree now to open the trade talks May wants.

But in an effort to defuse accusations in Britain about EU intransigence, the leaders would welcome progress to date on their three key issues: the rights of 3 million EU citizens in Britain; protecting peace in Northern Ireland from the effect of a new border on the island; and Britain’s outstanding payments.

They would pledge to reassess things at their next summit in mid-December -- Barnier on Thursday spoke of making progress in the next two months. And in order not to waste time once they do decide to launch talks on a post-Brexit future, they would ask Barnier and their envoys to start preparing now for a transition -- albeit without actually starting talking to Britain about it.

“The European Council invites the Council (Article 50) together with the Union negotiator to start internal preparatory discussions,” the draft read. Another EU official said that would avoid weeks of delay in launching a new phase by the new year -- which business leaders say is vital if they are to make informed investment decisions in 2018 for the time after Brexit.

Without a good idea by early next year of what a transition period will look like, international businesses in Britain would start to “vote with their feet” and move operations to the continent for fear of a “hard Brexit”, some have warned.

The uncertain grip May, who campaigned last year against Brexit, has over her party and hardliners demanding she resist EU demands and be ready to walk out with no deal, has left Europeans unsure of where negotiations may lead. The gesture to May reflects some willingness to help reinforce her in office.

“DEADLOCK” OVER MONEY

Barnier and his British counterpart, Brexit Secretary David Davis, told reporters there had been some progress this week on citizens’ rights and the Irish border question. Davis renewed his call for EU leaders to give a green light to trade talks next week but that has long been a forlorn hope.

Barnier made clear that despite new momentum from May’s concessions in a speech at Florence last month, British proposals still failed the “sufficient progress” test, notably on tens of billions of euros the EU says London owes.

May said Britain would ensure the other 27 countries did not lose out financially from Brexit in the current EU budget period to 2020 and would honor commitments -- but Barnier said London was failing to spell out just what it was ready to pay.

“There was no negotiation on this, but we did have technical discussions which were useful,” he said. “We are, therefore, at a deadlock on this question. This is extremely worrying for European taxpayers and those who benefit from EU policies.”

Nonetheless, he offered hope: “I am still convinced that, with political will, decisive progress is within reach in the coming two months. With David Davis, we will organize several negotiating meetings between now and the end of the year.”

May herself said there had been “good progress” and welcomed Barnier’s talk of further progress “over the coming weeks”.",EU to offer May hope of post-Brexit talks at summit: draft text,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu/eu-to-offer-may-hope-of-post-brexit-talks-at-summit-draft-text-idUKKBN1CH317

LONDON (Reuters) - A top U.S. government legal official has given strong backing to Britain’s campaign to force Silicon Valley to compromise on encrypted communications, rebuking tech firms for failing to balance crime-fighting demands with privacy needs.

U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein met with senior British government officials including interior minister Amber Rudd and the chief of MI5 intelligence agency on Thursday to discuss encryption. He plans to see the head of Britain’s GCHQ service on Friday, he told Reuters.

“At this point we are coordinating with our foreign partners as to what the challenges are,” Rosenstein said in response to a question from a reporter at the Global Cyber Security Summit, organized by Skytop Strategies.

Top officials in Prime Minister Theresa May’s government, including Rudd, have been trying to rein in encryption but have been met quiet resistance from tech leaders like Facebook (FB.O), Google (GOOGL.O) and Twitter (TWTR.N). Critics see the demands as a back door for government snooping.

In his speech, Rosenstein decried what he called “warrant-proof encryption that puts zero value on law enforcement”.

British and U.S. officials argue that default encryption settings on free messaging apps, such as Facebook’s WhatsApp, hinder authorities’ ability to collect evidence needed to pursue criminals, even with clear, court-ordered mandates.

“Increasingly, the tools we use to collect evidence run up against encryption tools which are designed to defeat them,” Rosenstein said.

Britain is trying to step up attempts to counter criminal activity online after a series of Islamist militant attacks this year but must ensure it balances the demands of state security with the freedoms of democratic societies.

Tech companies and many cyber security experts say that requiring law enforcement access be given access to encrypted products will broadly weaken security for everything from online banking to shopping to casual conversations among friends.

The U.S. deputy attorney general said he was not seeking to criticize technology firms but rather to lay out the trade-offs.

”In many ways the economic interests of technology companies align with law enforcement,“ Rosenstein said. ”But in one particular area - encryption - competitive forces drive technology companies to resist cooperating with governments.

“I wouldn’t describe my goal is to put pressure on the tech industry,” he said, adding “regulation is a potential option”.

But in a speech earlier this week Rosenstein accused Silicon Valley of being more willing to comply with foreign government demands for data than those made by their home country.

The pull-out over the past two weeks could weaken a region-wide struggle against the militants who have killed tens of thousands of people, forced many more to flee and triggered a humanitarian crisis.

There was no immediate explanation or comment from defense officials in Chad.

But the move came a month after the vast central African country complained about an unexpected U.S. travel ban imposed on its nationals. Chad warned at the time the order could affect its security commitments - which include its involvement in the U.S.-backed fight against Boko Haram.

Residents said the withdrawal had already had an impact on Niger’s Diffa region, which has seen a string of attacks by Boko Haram militants crossing over from their base in neighboring Nigeria.

Ibrahim Arimi from the border village of Bosso said banditry had increased since the Chadian troops started leaving and he had been temporarily moved to another village for safety.

Diffa parliamentarian Lamido Moumouni said residents had started complaining. “They have come to rely on the forces so there is a perception that security will be lacking,” he said by telephone.

At its peak in 2016 after an attack in Bosso, Chad had 2,000 troops in Niger to help counter Boko Haram although security sources said this has fallen since.

Boko Haram has attacked Chad, Niger and Cameroon from its base in northeast Nigeria. Its eight-year bid to carve out an Islamist caliphate has driven millions from their homes - more than 200,000 of them are now based in Diffa, with little prospect of returning home.

Thousands of them are camped alongside an unfinished highway in the middle of a barren savannah with few resources.

Chad’s soldiers also occupy front-line positions in a peacekeeping force in northern Mali.

U.S. drones were hovering near the northwestern Pakistani area where American Caitlan Campbell, her Canadian husband Joshua Boyle and their three children, all born in captivity, were freed, another security official said.

Campbell and Boyle were held by the Taliban-linked Haqqani network after being kidnapped while backpacking in Afghanistan, and their rescue marked a rare positive note in often-fraught U.S.-Pakistan relations.

The family flew out of Pakistan on Friday, according to a Pakistani airport official who saw them. It was not clear whether they were bound for Canada or the United States.

A senior Pakistani security source on Friday detailed how the family were freed following a car chase in the northwestern tribal region bordering Afghanistan.

He said Pakistani troops and intelligence agents, acting on a U.S. intelligence tip, zeroed in on a vehicle holding the family as they were being moved into Kurram tribal agency near the town of Kohat, some 60 km (37 miles) inside Pakistan.

Agents from Pakistan’s Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) spy agency and soldiers attempted to intercept the vehicle, but it sped away, according to the security source.

“Our troops fired at the vehicle and burst its tires,” he said, declining to be identified because he is not authorized to speak openly to the media.

The kidnappers managed to escape, the security official added, saying the troops wouldn’t fire at the fleeing captors for fear of harming the hostages. The army recovered the hostages safely from the car.

Army spokesman Major General Asif Ghafoor told NBC News that the vehicle’s driver and another militant had escaped to a nearby refugee camp.

DRONES REPORTED NEARBY

The family’s rescue has been hailed by U.S. President Donald Trump as a “positive moment” for U.S.-Pakistan relations, which have frayed in recent years amid Washington’s assertions that Islamabad has not been doing enough to tackle Haqqani militants who are believed to be on Pakistani soil.

Trump, in a statement, said the release of the hostages showed Pakistan was acquiescing to “America’s wishes for it to do more to provide security in the region”.

A second Pakistani security official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said U.S. drones on Wednesday had been seen circling Kohat, suggesting U.S. co-operation included sophisticated surveillance inside Pakistan.

Kohat is deep inside Pakistani territory, next to the eastern edge of Kurram agency in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province - outside the Afghan frontier zone where U.S. drones have in the past been tolerated by Pakistan.

The U.S. embassy and the Pakistani military did not comment on the drone report.

However, a Taliban commander in Pakistan with knowledge of the hostage family said U.S. drones flying in the area prompted their captors to move them.

“We took care of this family like our own family members and special guests, but after frequent flying of U.S. drones on Kurram tribal region and its adjoining areas, it was decided to move them to a safer place,” said the Taliban official on condition of anonymity.

“They were being shifted to a safer place when captured by the Pakistani forces.”

HOSTAGES’ LOCATION

Pakistani officials bristle at U.S. claims Islamabad is not doing enough to tackle Islamist militants, particularly the Haqqanis. After the release of the family, they emphasized the importance of co-operation and intelligence sharing by Washington, which has threatened to cut military aid and other punitive measures against Pakistan.

Pakistan’s military indicated the family were rescued shortly after entering Pakistan from Afghanistan, and a government official repeated that assertion on Friday.

“We have been taking on the terrorists... So we have taken action based on the intelligence that was provided by the U.S. side,” said Foreign Ministry spokesman Nafees Zakaria.

He added that he had no other details on the operation “maybe because they were abducted in Afghanistan, they were there in Afghanistan, and that could be the reason why you have not heard much about it”.

However, two Taliban sources with knowledge of the family’s captivity said they had been kept in Pakistan in recent years.

A U.S. government source in Washington also said there was no indication the family had been in Afghanistan.

The Haqqani network operates on both sides of the porous Afghan-Pakistani border but senior militants have acknowledged they moved a major base of operations to Kurram agency in the tribal areas.

The United States and Afghanistan say that safe havens inside Pakistan allow the Taliban, including the Haqqani network, to plan and launch attacks against the Western-backed Afghan government and U.S. and other foreign troops that support them.

The Taliban have been fighting for 16 years to re-establish their ultra-Islamist regime that was toppled in a U.S.-backed military operation over sheltering the al Qaeda terrorist network that planned the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on U.S. cities.",Pakistan official details car chase that freed kidnapped U.S.-Canadian family,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-pakistan-afghanistan-kidnapping-chase/pakistan-official-details-car-chase-that-freed-kidnapped-u-s-canadian-family-idUSKBN1CI1D2

BRASÍLIA (Reuters) - Mercosul e Canadá irão anunciar em dezembro a abertura de negociações sobre um acordo de livre comércio, durante a reunião ministerial da Organização Mundial do Comércio (OMC) em Buenos Aires, disseram à Reuters duas fontes envolvidas nas negociações.

Do lado sul-americano, os mandatos para negociar já foram aprovados pelos quatro governos dos países membros do bloco (Brasil, Argentina, Uruguai e Paraguai). Pela parte canadense, de acordo com uma das fontes, falta apenas o passo final, que seria a consulta formal ao gabinete do primeiro-ministro Justin Trudeau.

A avaliação das fontes brasileiras é que o acordo com o Canadá tem potencial para andar rapidamente. Há interesses dos dois lados, ao mesmo tempo em que não há grandes sensibilidades, como no caso da agricultura para a União Europeia.

“Nas conversas preliminares nunca identificamos obstáculos intransponíveis”, disse a fonte.

As primeiras conversas começaram em 2010, por iniciativa do Canadá. Em 2012, o governo brasileiro aprovou na Câmara de Comércio Exterior (Camex) o mandato para iniciar as negociações, mas o processo não foi adiante.

“Naquele momento outros sócios não estavam tão interessados”, explicou a fonte. “Agora os países têm mais afinidade e mais interesse em buscar outros acordos.”

Uma reunião será marcada para novembro, em Brasília, para fechar os últimos detalhes do mandato de negociação -- uma plataforma de onde se parte para começar a negociar.

O governo canadense pediu que se atualizasse questões relativas a cláusulas ambientais e outros temas relacionados ao que chamam de “progressive trade”, o que foi aceito sem problemas pelo Mercosul.

Apesar do comércio pouco significativo do bloco com o Canadá, a possibilidade de acordo entusiasma os negociadores do Mercosul pela possibilidade de crescimento. Dados levantados do Ministério da Indústria, Comércio e Serviços (Mdic) mostram que em 2016 a corrente de comércio foi de apenas 5,88 bilhões de dólares entre o Mercosul e o Canadá. Com os Estados Unidos, por exemplo, foi de 59,8 bilhões no mesmo ano.

“É pequeno porque o Canadá é um país com população pequena. São apenas 36 milhões de pessoas. Mas é um mercado com alto poder aquisitivo, e um mercado não explorado”, disse uma das fontes.

O bloco tem superávit com os canadenses. Em 2016, foram exportados 3,6 bilhões de dólares e importados 2,3 bilhões. O grosso do comércio regional é com o Brasil, que em 2016 concentrou 4,2 bilhões de dólares da corrente de comércio e 2,37 bilhões em exportações. No caso do Brasil, a exportação de produtos manufaturados domina a pauta de comércio, representando 53 por cento das exportações.

Nas conversas com os setores produtivos, o governo brasileiro identificou oportunidades não apenas na área industrial, mas também na agricultura. “Eles têm muita produção agrícola mas, até por conta do clima, diferente da nossa”, disse a fonte.

De acordo com os negociadores, as tarifas canadenses são de um modo geral baixas, com exceção da agricultura, onde há um grande potencial para melhorar. Nas demais, há questões não tarifárias, de normas técnicas e sanitárias, que costumam ser menos complicadas de resolver.

Esta semana, durante a reunião ministerial da OMC em Marrakech, o ministro das Relações Exteriores, Aloysio Nunes, teve um encontro com ministro do Comércio Internacional do Canadá, François-Philippe Champagne, para tratar do acordo. Em nota, o Itamaraty afirmou que os ministros “reconheceram que existe um forte potencial para o desenvolvimento de uma relação comercial mais ambiciosa através do aumento dos fluxos de comércio e investimento”.

Consultado pela Reuters, o governo do Canadá afirmou, através de um porta-voz de Champagne, que o país “reafirma que existe uma oportunidade no acordo com o Mercosul e que irá continuar com as conversas exploratórias”.","Mercosul e Canadá anunciam em dezembro abertura de negociações sobre acordo de livre comércio, dizem fontes",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idBRKBN1CI1PX-OBRTP

LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - Border controls inside what should normally be Europe’s cherished zone of free travel are here to stay for now, EU ministers said on Friday, citing continued terrorist threats and the need to control migration.

Germany, France, Austria, Sweden, Denmark and Norway told their Schengen zone peers they will extend until mid-May internal frontier checks first put in place in 2015 to counter unprecedented levels of migration and Islamist attacks.

At a meeting of European Union interior ministers in Luxembourg, Germany’s Thomas de Maiziere said Berlin was still committed to freedom of movement, “but at the moment we cannot do without checks.”

“The reason is the tense security situation in Europe with regards to international terrorism and the still inadequate protection of our external borders,” he said.

France, which imposed emergency border controls after Islamist attackers killed 130 people in Paris in November, 2015, also wants to keep them in place.

“The issues around terrorism are still extremely important for us,” French Interior Minister Gerard Colomb said. “France wants to extend border controls by six months.”

The other four countries announced the same move, citing “serious threat to public policy or internal security” before the authorization to impose the border checks expires next month.

Nearly all EU states consider the free-travel Schengen area as a major benefit of decades of European integration, and are keen to avoid disruptions to travel and trade.

LONDON (Reuters) - A top U.S. government legal official has given strong backing to Britain’s campaign to force Silicon Valley to compromise on encrypted communications, rebuking tech firms for failing to balance crime-fighting demands with privacy needs.

U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein met with senior British government officials including interior minister Amber Rudd and the chief of MI5 intelligence agency on Thursday to discuss encryption. He plans to see the head of Britain’s GCHQ service on Friday, he told Reuters.

“At this point we are coordinating with our foreign partners as to what the challenges are,” Rosenstein said in response to a question from a reporter at the Global Cyber Security Summit, organized by Skytop Strategies.

Top officials in Prime Minister Theresa May’s government, including Rudd, have been trying to rein in encryption but have been met quiet resistance from tech leaders like Facebook (FB.O), Google (GOOGL.O) and Twitter (TWTR.N). Critics see the demands as a back door for government snooping.

In his speech, Rosenstein decried what he called “warrant-proof encryption that puts zero value on law enforcement”.

British and U.S. officials argue that default encryption settings on free messaging apps, such as Facebook’s WhatsApp, hinder authorities’ ability to collect evidence needed to pursue criminals, even with clear, court-ordered mandates.

“Increasingly, the tools we use to collect evidence run up against encryption tools which are designed to defeat them,” Rosenstein said.

Britain is trying to step up attempts to counter criminal activity online after a series of Islamist militant attacks this year but must ensure it balances the demands of state security with the freedoms of democratic societies.

Tech companies and many cyber security experts say that requiring law enforcement access be given access to encrypted products will broadly weaken security for everything from online banking to shopping to casual conversations among friends.

The U.S. deputy attorney general said he was not seeking to criticize technology firms but rather to lay out the trade-offs.

”In many ways the economic interests of technology companies align with law enforcement,“ Rosenstein said. ”But in one particular area - encryption - competitive forces drive technology companies to resist cooperating with governments.

LONDON (Reuters) - The Financial Conduct Authority said its proposals for listing state-controlled companies such as Saudi Aramco were in line with Britain’s aim of London remaining a leading financial centre, raising concerns about whether they were robust enough.

The FCA in July proposed the new listing category in a move seen as helping London to court the initial public offering of Aramco, which is likely to be the largest ever IPO. The oil giant is also looking at rival financial centre New York.

The watchdog has not issued any final rules, but lawmakers and Britain’s leading trade body for the investment industry worry the proposed changes would not give investors enough protection.

In a letter to parliament’s Treasury and Business Committees, FCA Chief Executive Andrew Bailey said the proposals were consistent with the finance ministry’s recommendations to the watchdog in March.

“The recommendations include the point that London retaining its position as the leading international financial centre supports the aim of sustainable economic growth,” Bailey said.

“Those recommendations had been discussed with Treasury.”

Bailey said he has had no conversations with ministers about plans to reform the listing rules.

“However, given the public discussion of these events, we can confirm that we held conversations with Saudi Aramco and their advisors in light of their interest in a possible UK listing in the early part of this year,” Bailey said.

“We emphasised during those conversations that we were reviewing the Listing Regime.”

TSC Chair Nicky Morgan said on Friday that questions remain about the level of political involvement in the consultation.

“The UK’s world-class reputation for upholding strong corporate governance mustn’t be watered down,” Morgan said in a statement.

Separately on Friday, Royal London Asset Management, with over 20 billion pounds invested in Britain’s stock market, said the new listing category is problematic and unnecessary.

“While we fully support the case that the UK must stay competitive in a growing global marketplace, we do not think re-writing the rules is the correct way to go about it,” its corporate governance manager Ashley Hamilton Claxton said.

Bailey said in his letter that protections for investors will not be weakened under the proposals.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s import and export growth accelerated in September, suggesting the world’s second-biggest economy is still expanding at a healthy pace despite widespread forecasts of an eventual slowdown.

The data also suggested further improvement in the global economy, with business activity and demand having picked up markedly this year in Europe and the United States.

The upbeat readings will be welcome new for Beijing ahead of a twice-a-decade Communist Party Congress next week, at which President Xi Jinping is expected to tighten his grip on power and set out the government’s top political and economic priorities for the next five years.

Imports grew 18.7 percent in September from a year earlier, beating analysts’ forecasts for a 13.5 percent expansion and accelerating from 13.3 percent in August, customs data showed on Friday. The gain was stronger than the most optimistic forecast in a Reuters analysts poll.

Exports rose 8.1 percent, below forecasts of 8.8 percent but the most in three months and handily beating August’s 5.5 percent.

“Growth momentum is still quite strong and better than our previous expectations,” ANZ senior China economist Betty Wang said.

Once again, China’s imports were led by industrial resources as a year-long construction boom shows no signs of flagging and factories kept humming, boosting demand for materials from steel to copper.

Higher commodity prices greatly magnified the strength of the bounce, but volumes surged, too, pointing to still-solid underlying demand.

Iron ore imports rose to a record 103 million tonnes, from 88.7 million tonnes in August, according to Reuters calculations. Copper imports were the highest since March.

That left the country with a trade surplus of $28.47 billion, less than the near $40 billion expected and down from around $42 billion in August.

China’s foreign trade will likely grow at a double-digit pace this year if current conditions continue, the General Administration of Customs said.

In addition to pointing to buoyant demand, some of the surge in September imports may have been due to companies “front loading” supplies ahead of a week-long national holiday in early October, analysts said.

Capital Economics’ China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard said the timing of the mid-Autumn festival this year also meant there were more working days last month than in September 2016, suggesting October figures should show a partial reversal.

“Nonetheless, today’s figures suggest that not only has strong foreign demand continued to prop up manufacturing activity in China but domestic demand remains resilient, too,” Evans-Pritchard said.

RECORD TRADE SURPLUS WITH U.S.

China’s politically sensitive trade surplus with the United States rose to a record for a single month, according to Reuters calculations using official data going back to 2008. The surplus grew to $28.08 billion from $26.23 billion in August.

Exports to the United States grew 13.8 percent on-year from 8.4 percent in August and hit a record $40.9 billion. Import growth slowed to 15.5 percent, from 18.1 percent.

That could aggravate President Donald Trump’s frequent complaints that the trade balance between the two nations hurts the U.S. economy.

Trump in August authorized an inquiry into China’s alleged theft of intellectual property in the first direct trade measure by his administration against Beijing, but the move is not expected to prompt any near-term change.

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross recently pressed China on the “need to rebalance bilateral trade and investment relations” and urged it to take “meaningful action” on trade issues.

China-U.S. ties have also been strained by demands that Beijing do more to pressure North Korea over Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programs.

China’s imports from North Korea fell 37.9 percent in September from a year earlier, marking the 7th consecutive month of decline, while exports dropped 6.7 percent.

With the European Union, China’s exports rose 10.4 percent and imports 30.9 percent.

SURPRISING RESILIENCE

China’s economy has surprised analysts with its resilience so far in 2017, expanding by 6.9 percent in the first half, though most market watchers have stuck to predictions that it would lose some momentum in coming months.

Authorities are in the midst of a campaign to reduce the risks from a rapid build-up in debt produced by years of credit-fueled stimulus, and sustained trade growth could give policymakers confidence to step up the campaign next year once the leadership reshuffle is out of the way.

That could see a further rise in borrowing costs for companies and consumers.

Government measures to cool hot housing prices are also expected to start weighing on property investment and construction.

China is also in the midst of its toughest environmental crackdown ever, ordering many mills, chemical plants and coal companies in northern parts of the country to sharply reduce output or close in coming months to reduce its notoriously thick winter smog.

The cuts are expected to last through March and around 30‑35 million tonnes of Chinese crude steel production could be taken offline, Commonwealth Bank of Australia analyst Vivek Dhar said in a note.

That translates to 42-49 million tonnes of iron ore consumption, equivalent to about 3 percent of the global seaborne iron ore market, he said.

Still, while the pollution crackdown may slow China’s economy and its contribution to global trade, growth in other sectors may mitigate the impact. At this point, most analysts continue to see a gradual loss of momentum, not a hard landing.

“There are still some infrastructure investments ongoing and some stabilization in property investment, so I would not worry too much about the impact of environmental efforts on the growth momentum,” ANZ’s Wang said.",China September imports blow past expectations as economy remains in high gear,https://www.reuters.com/article/china-economy-trade/china-sept-imports-blow-past-expectations-as-economy-remains-in-high-gear-idINKBN1CI0FO

BASF, the world’s third-largest maker of crop chemicals, has so far avoided seed assets and instead pursued research into plant characteristics such as drought tolerance, which it sells or licenses out to seed developers.

But Bayer’s $66 billion deal to buy U.S. seeds group Monsanto, announced in September 2016, has created opportunities for rivals to snatch up assets that need to be sold to satisfy competition authorities.

Bayer said it would use the proceeds to partly refinance the Monsanto acquisition. It plans to raise $19 billion toward the deal by issuing convertible bonds and new shares, and has lined up as much as $57 billion of bridge financing from banks.

Baader Helvea analyst Markus Mayer said a higher-than-expected valuation of the assets up for sale could mean Bayer now needs to raise less than $10 billion from the sale of new shares, which would be a positive surprise.

Bayer had offered to sell assets worth around $2.5 billion. The European Commission said in August that the divestments offered by Bayer so far did not go far enough and started an in-depth investigation of the deal.

Bayer has to sell the LibertyLink-branded seeds and Liberty herbicide businesses, which generated 2016 sales of 1.3 billion euros, because they compete with Monsanto’s Roundup weed killer and Roundup Ready seeds.

Related Coverage BASF CEO says to look at more seed M&A after Bayer deal

LibertyLink seeds, used by soy, cotton and canola growers, are one alternative to Roundup Ready seeds for farmers suffering from weeds that have developed resistance to the Roundup herbicide, also known as glyphosate.

The spread of Roundup-resistant weeds in North America has been a major driver behind Liberty sales.

“BASF’s decision to acquire seeds assets represents something of a change to its prior view on its needs to respond to recent industry consolidation in agriculture,” Morgan Stanley analysts said.

“Nonetheless, the proposed assets for acquisition are high margin and high growth and represent a sensible bolt-on addition,” they added.

BASF Chief Executive Kurt Bock told a conference call he would look at further acquisition opportunities in the seeds sector as well but said it would take “two to tango”.

The group is also expected to look at other assets – such as vegetable seeds – that Bayer may be forced to divest, a person close to the matter said.

Shares in Bayer rose 1.2 percent to the top of Germany's blue-chip DAX index .GDAXI by 1230 GMT, while BASF was up 0.2 percent.

POSITIVE SURPRISE

The sale to BASF values Bayer’s assets at around 15 times 2016 operating profit (EBITDA) of 385 million euros, which analysts said was reasonable compared with multiples of 19.3 for ChemChina’s [CNNCC.UL] takeover of Syngenta (SYNN.S) and more than 20 for Dow’s DOW.N tie-up with DuPont DD.N.

BASF will finance the acquisition through a combination of cash on hand, commercial paper and bonds.

It is expected to reap sales synergies in the hundreds of millions of euros. On the cost side, however, savings will be slim at first as there is little overlap with BASF’s existing business and the group has promised to keep all permanent staff at the businesses it is buying for at least three years.

The acquisition will add to its earnings by 2020, it said.

The deal is conditional upon Bayer’s acquisition of Monsanto going through. While the European Commission could block that transaction, it has approved others, such as the Dow-DuPont deal and ChemChina’s takeover of Syngenta - although only after securing big concessions.

Bayer said it continued to work with the authorities to close the Monsanto purchase by early 2018.

As part of the asset sale to BASF, more than 1,800 staff, primarily in the United States, Germany, Brazil, Canada and Belgium, will transfer to BASF. It is also acquiring manufacturing sites for glufosinate-ammonium production and formulation, seed breeding facilities and research facilities.

LONDON (Reuters) - Amazon (AMZN.O) said on Friday it would open a new distribution center in Bolton, northwest England, in 2018, stepping up its expansion drive in its third-largest market outside North America.

Amazon has 16 distribution centers in Britain and the new center will be supported by advanced robotics technology to help lift and move products around the plant. It will also employ 1,200 new, full-time permanent people, the company said.

The new jobs mean the online retailer will have created 3,500 jobs in the region, including Bolton and two other centers, one in Manchester set up in 2016 and another in Warrington, which opened this year.

It said that, including operating costs, it had invested 6.4 billion pounds ($8.3 billion) in Britain since 2010 in logistics, order filling, research and development and head office functions.

Following criticism from politicians about weak worker protection, the company has been increasingly employing its warehouse staff directly, rather than indirectly via contract firms which offer little employment security.

On Friday it set out the levels of pay, stock options, pensions and training that would be available for any new employee. Salaries start at 7.65 pounds per hour, but also include a variety of management, engineering and support roles.

Northwest England received a blow on Tuesday when major employer BAE Systems announced the cut of 750 highly skilled jobs at two aircraft manufacturing plants in Lancashire.

The Bolton center will ship easily sortable items to customers that lend themselves to current robotics technology, including books, toys and kitchenware.

The online retailer has expanded rapidly in Britain in recent years, and is looking for the new distribution plants to expand its product selection and enable more small and medium enterprises to sell their own wares through Amazon Marketplace. Half of all units stocked in British centers are from outside firms.

LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker said on Friday he did not want Catalonia to become independent, because that would encourage other regions to do the same, making the European Union ungovernable.

“If we allow Catalonia -- and it is not our business -- to separate, others will do the same. I do not want that,” Jean Claude Juncker said in a speech at Luxembourg University.

“I wouldn’t like a European Union in 15 years that consists of some 98 states,” he continued. “It’s already relatively difficult with 28 and with 27 not easier, but with 98 it would simply be impossible.”

The EU’s statistics agency Eurostat lists the bloc as consisting of 98 major regions.

Juncker said he was “very worried” about separatist tendencies in Europe and had encouraged Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy to ensure the situation did not get out of control.

Referring to Catalan calls for EU mediation, he said the Commission could not mediate if only one side asked it to do so. The EU has said it has confidence in Rajoy to resolve what it sees as an internal issue.

Chief Executive Hiroya Kawasaki on Friday revealed that about 500 companies had received its falsely certified products, more than double its earlier count, confirming widespread wrongdoing at the steelmaker that has sent a chill along global supply chains.

The scale of the misconduct at Japan’s third-largest steelmaker pummeled its shares as investors, worried about the financial impact and legal fallout, wiped about $1.8 billion off its market value this week.

As the company revealed tampering of more products, the crisis has rippled through supply chains across the world in a body blow to Japan’s reputation as a high-quality manufacturing destination.

A contrite Kawasaki told a briefing the firm plans to pay customers’ costs for any affected products.

“There has been no specific requests, but we are prepared to shoulder such costs after consultations,” he said, adding the products with tampered documentation account for about 4 percent of the sales in the affected businesses.

Yoshihiko Katsukawa, a managing executive officer, told reporters that 500 companies were now known to be affected by the tampering.

Kobe Steel initially said 200 firms were affected when it admitted at the weekend it had falsified data about the quality of aluminum and copper products used in cars, aircraft, space rockets and defense equipment.

Asked if he plans to step down, Kawasaki said: “My biggest task right now is to help our customers make safety checks and to craft prevention measures.”

PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES

Boeing Co (BA.N), has some of the falsely certified products, a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters, while stressing that the world’s biggest maker of passenger jets does not consider the issue a safety problem.

More than 30 non-Japanese customers had been affected by the firm’s data fabrication, the Nikkei newspaper reported on Friday.

A Kobe Steel spokesman said the companies received its products but would not confirm they had any of the falsely certified components.

Nuclear power plant parts are the latest to join the list of affected equipment as Fukushima nuclear operator Tokyo Electric Power (9501.T) (Tepco) said on Friday it had taken delivery of pipes from Kobe Steel that were not checked properly.

The pipes were delivered to its Fukushima Daini station, located near the destroyed Fukushima Daiichi plant, but have not been used, Tepco said, adding it was checking all its facilities.

Faulty parts have also been found in Japan’s famous bullet trains that run at speeds as high as around 300 kilometers (180 miles) per hour and a space rocket that was launched in Japan earlier this week. One bullet train operator has already said it will seek compensation from Kobe Steel.

The government has ordered Kobe Steel to address safety concerns within about two weeks and report on how the misconduct occurred in a month.

CREDIBILITY ‘ZERO’

No safety issues have yet been identified in the unfolding imbroglio.

Kobe Steel shares fell nearly 9 percent on Friday and have fallen more than 40 percent since the scandal broke.

The steelmaker faces a range of legal risks, including compensation sought by clients or their customers, penalties for violating unfair competition laws for false representation, shareholder lawsuits for the fall in the company’s stock price and class lawsuits from overseas customers seeking punitive damages, a lawyer, specializing in corporate laws and risk management, said.

“It is hard to predict the extent of legal costs,” said Motokazu Endo, a lawyer at Tokyo Kasumigaseki law office.

“We cannot rule out the possibility that this will shake Kobe Steel to its foundation.”

The company has forecast a profit for the year through March 2018 after two successive annual losses.

Kobe Steel was founded in 1905 and has been a pillar of Japan’s manufacturing sector. Such are its establishment bona fides that Shinzo Abe, the prime minister and scion of a political dynasty, worked at the company decades ago, before entering politics.

But those credentials have been shattered, a point amplified by CEO Kawasaki who earlier said the credibility of the firm “has plunged to zero.”

Kobe Steel said it was examining possible data falsification going back 10 years - a familiar echo of a string of other cheating scandals involving Japan inc.

The corrosive business practices have raised broader questions over corporate governance in Japan, and cast doubt on the integrity of a manufacturing industry once the envy of the world.

Previous cases in Japan involving falsified data included Nissan Motor (7201.T), Mitsubishi Motors (7211.T) and Takata Corp., which filed for bankruptcy this year over faulty airbags that were blamed for 17 deaths and scores of injuries.

In 2015, it was revealed that Toyo Tire & Rubber (5105.T) fabricated data to secure government approval for materials to absorb shocks from earthquakes. Conglomerate Toshiba Corp (6502.T) is still battling the fallout of a scandal over reporting inflated profits.

SMBC Nikko Securities said in a note to clients that investors in Kobe Steel face a prolonged period of uncertainty.

“It will likely continue to be extremely difficult to make judgments on creditworthiness and investment until the safety of the products and the extent of damages are clarified.”","As crisis at Kobe Steel deepens, CEO says cheating engulfs 500 firms",https://www.reuters.com/article/kobe-steel-scandal/kobe-steels-cheating-engulfs-more-divisions-shares-resume-slide-idINKBN1CI01R

Chief Executive Brian Moynihan’s years-long effort to streamline the United States’ second-largest bank and keep its costs in check are finally bearing fruit as the Federal Reserve raises borrowing costs.

The lender’s large stock of deposits and rate-sensitive mortgage securities make it especially well placed to benefit from rate rises. Its third-quarter earnings performance beat rivals JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Citigroup (C.N), which reported gains of 7.1 percent and 7.6 percent respectively on Wednesday.

“Loans were up about 6 percent, that’s not quite as high as JPMorgan who reported yesterday. But again margins improved and credit quality improved,” Stephen Biggar, Argus Research director of financial institutions research, said. “And 6 percent growth is quite good in a deteriorating environment.”

The Federal Reserve’s three rate increases since December boosted Bank of America’s net interest income 9.4 percent to $11.16 billion and the central bank is widely expected to raise rates again in December.

Provisions for credit losses rose 15 percent from the second quarter, driven by credit cards and loan growth but Bank of America Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio said that did not signal maxed out consumers.

“We are optimistic about the general economy. There are just a lot of positive signs out there,” he told reporters.

Similar to rivals, trading revenue at the Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender fell 15 percent, with revenue from fixed income trading down 22 percent.

For most of the past seven years, Wall Street banks have been grappling with low bond market volatility and new regulations that have restricted certain activities and made trading more expensive.

Bank of America’s large consumer banking business and wealth management arm mean it is less dependent on trading than rivals such as Goldman Sachs (GS.N), which reports third-quarter results, along with Morgan Stanley (MS.N), on Tuesday.

Hopes that U.S. President Donald Trump will be able to stimulate bond trading activity and boost demand for loans have yet to be fulfilled as his tax overhaul and plans to loosen financial regulations have yet to be realized.

“Tax reform is going to be great for the economy ... but I don’t think people are waiting around,” Donofrio said.

In the meantime, banks are sticking to their cost-cutting playbook. Bank of America’s non-interest expenses fell 3 percent in the third quarter from a year ago. Total revenue rose about 1 percent to $22.08 billion.

The bank’s efficiency ratio of 60, which measures expenses as a percentage of revenues, was in line with management’s long-term target.

Overall, the bank's net income attributable to common shareholders rose to $5.12 billion for the quarter from $4.45 billion in the year-ago period. Earnings per share rose to 48 cents from 41 cents. (bit.ly/2hDYUZK)

BEIJING/SINGAPORE/LONDON (Reuters) - Some of China’s top oil refineries are having to take the highly unusual step of cutting operations during what is typically the peak demand summer season when hot weather drives up power usage and families take to the road during school holidays.

Almost 10 percent of China’s refining capacity is set to be shut down during the third quarter, signaling that demand growth from the world’s top crude importer is stuttering further.

West African and European suppliers are already feeling the chill from China’s reduced demand, and a global glut has dragged spot prices for crude this week to their lowest since November, 2016.

Major Chinese oil refineries, including PetroChina’s Jinzhou will set their run rates around 6,500 barrels per day (bpd) lower than the second quarter, sources at the affected refineries said.

Petrochina’s Fushun refinery, with an annual capacity of 233,200 bpd, began a 45-day full shutdown at the start of June, the sources said on condition of anonymity as they are not authorized to speak to media.

Rival Sinopec is considering slashing as much as 230,000 bpd, equivalent to about 5 percent of its average daily production last year, in what would be only the second time in 16 years that the firm has cut runs.

Stocks of surplus products like gasoline and diesel have been building since mid-2015, when Beijing started giving out crude import licenses to independent refiners, sometimes called teapots. This has forced state-owned Sinopec and PetroChina to cut back operations, and reduced their crude buying.

“Refiners probably realized that the domestic market cannot take so much gasoline and diesel, and the only way is to cut runs,” said Gao Jian, crude oil analyst with China Sublime Information Group.

Adding to these cuts, around 1.3 million bpd of refining capacity is going to shut in the third quarter as four state-run refineries and six independents begin planned maintenance, data provided by China Sublime Information Group showed.

Those closures mean almost 10 percent of China’s 15.1 million bpd total refining capacity will go offstream in the third quarter.

To whittle down the surplus weighing on the domestic market, analysts expect China to export refined product, putting more pressure on a well supplied global markets.

“China will have to export product... onto Asian markets, which given demand conditions regionally does not appear particularly constructive,” said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity strategy at French bank BNP Paribas.

The lower refinery throughput should reduce China’s demand for crude until around September. Some suppliers are already feeling the chill. Shipments by Angola, which sends most its oil to China, were running at the lowest level in at least a year during the first few weeks of June.

From the North Sea, just 2 million barrels of Forties crude has been shipped to Asia so far this month, compared with around 6 million barrels in June last year, and 10 million barrels in May.

BUT DON‘T WRITE CHINA OFF

The imminent cuts in China’s refining sector are likely to further weigh on oil prices, which have more than halved since 2014 due to oversupply.

However, traders say that China’s voracious thirst for oil will likely return once the immediate glut is cleared.

Nineteen Chinese independent refiners this week received fresh licenses to import crude for 2017.

“I’d expect improved buying now that teapot quotas have been released. If prices drop, China tends to buy more,” said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for Strong Petroleum, a trading firm supplying Chinese refiners.

Taken together with the licenses awarded earlier, independent refiners now have import quotas for about 1.42 million bpd this year, and it is possible that eight companies will receive allocations for another 340,000 bpd.

As refiners start chartering tankers to import crude, the impact of the new import allowances is expected to show from the end of the third quarter.

Traders said they will meet much of this demand by re-selling crude stored in South Korea and China, particularly from Shandong province where most of the independent refiners are, and from tankers off Malaysia.

Some traders even expect demand to spike in the fourth quarter, as seen late last year as teapots rushed to use up quotas to build their case for maintaining or increasing future quota allocations.

“China is a bit unpredictable – suddenly they buy a lot out of the blue, so you can never underestimate China’s buying,” said Berentsen.",Looming Chinese refinery cuts to hit oil demand,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-oil-demand-analysis/looming-chinese-refinery-cuts-to-hit-oil-demand-idUSKBN19C168

LONDON (Reuters) - Maersk (MAERSKb.CO) can no longer transport goods in or out of Qatar after Arab countries imposed restrictions on trade with the tiny Gulf state and the company is looking at alternative shipping routes.

Shipping lines normally transship cargoes from the United Arab Emirates port of Jebel Ali to Qatar, which relies heavily on imports by sea and land.

A Maersk Line spokesman said on Tuesday: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

“We expect disruptions to our Qatar services. The situation is very fluid,” the spokesman said, adding that Maersk would notify customers about alternative options as soon as possible.

The spokesman said the company, which is the world’s biggest container shipping line, was looking at other routes such as Oman.

Larger container ships are unable to dock at ports in Qatar due in part to shallow waters so shipping lines use feeder services, which transport container boxes from the larger port of Jebel Ali in the United Arab Emirates.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

Ports have also been directly affected, which has disrupted trade in commodities from crude oil to metals and food.

The ban has meant that any ship sailing to and from Qatar will be prevented from calling at major ports in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, which include Jebel Ali, as well as Bahrain.

Food imports have been affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies.

Trade sources said the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already cut exports of white sugar to Qatar.

President Obama, by comparison, frequently argued for international climate cooperation in his UN speeches.
American commitment to helping the UN advance human rights has long been a staple in UN addresses by presidents, no matter their political party.
Trump’s only explicit mention of human rights was to condemn — without naming names — the “governments with egregious human rights records” that sit on the UN Human Rights Council.
What Trump did not say, therefore, is just as much of a threat to human rights as what he did.","President Donald Trump’s opening speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday is drawing widespread criticism for his aggressive statements about North Korea and Iran, but it is just as significant for what he didn’t mention at all.

In a 42-minute address that stunned many listeners, Trump called the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un “Rocket Man on a suicide mission” and vowed to “totally destroy” the country if it attacks the United States. He promised to crush “loser terrorists.” He called the Iran nuclear deal an “embarrassment” and said portions of the world are “going to hell.”

The overarching theme of Trump’s speech was sovereignty – a word he used 21 times. It was a strange emphasis in an increasingly interconnected, globalized world. Though in line with his ""America first"" platform, it was highly unusual for a U.S. leader speaking in a global forum that stands for peace through cooperation. What Trump left out was just as important: he did not offset his emphasis on sovereignty — with its implication that what a nation does within its borders is of no concern to the international community — with an assertion of the primacy of universal human rights or Washington’s commitment to promoting democracy.

Indeed, Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, their vast ideological differences notwithstanding, sounded far more similar to each other when addressing the UN than Trump did to either of them or his other predecessors.

The three most glaring omissions were climate change, human rights and Russia’s efforts to destabilize Western democracies. Trump’s ignoring climate change was no surprise, given his rejection of climate science and planned withdrawal from the UN-sponsored Paris climate agreement. President Obama, by comparison, frequently argued for international climate cooperation in his UN speeches.

But the other subjects Trump avoided were less expected. American commitment to helping the UN advance human rights has long been a staple in UN addresses by presidents, no matter their political party. Although Trump said that he intends to work hard on an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal at a Wednesday meeting with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, the fact that a settlement wasn’t mentioned during the UN address suggests the issue is no longer a White House priority.

In his UN speech Trump also offered no direct condemnation of China or Russia, despite their recent actions that have undermined — and antagonized — the United States on the world stage.

These omissions were a stark departure from past U.S. presidents. Though Trump’s condemnation of North Korea, Iran and Venezuela echoed Bush’s “axis of evil,” Bush’s annual UN addresses promoted the spread of democracy and nation-building abroad. Obama, meanwhile, emphasized diplomacy and international institutions to resolve conflict, achieve peace and protect human rights.

Any call for the respect of rights in Trump’s speech was reserved for nations, not people. “Our success depends on a coalition of strong and independent nations that embrace their sovereignty, to promote security, prosperity, and peace, for themselves and for the world,” he said, adding that he expects nations to “uphold these two core sovereign duties: to respect the interests of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation.”

For all the president’s focus on sovereignty, he ignored threats to from Russia, such as its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, and what U.S. intelligence agencies say was Moscow’s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and hacking of French election infrastructure.

As for China, Trump made only a vague reference to its threat in the South China Sea, where Beijing has built up islands and military outposts in an area the United States regards as international waters. Trump did, however, thank both Russia and China by name for their recent UN Security Council votes for more sanctions on North Korea. His choice of words could perhaps be interpreted as recognition of how much he will need their support facing down the Kim regime.

Trump’s only explicit mention of human rights was to condemn — without naming names — the “governments with egregious human rights records” that sit on the UN Human Rights Council. China and American allies such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar are the obvious suspects. (Trump did say, “We call for the full restoration of democracy and political freedoms in Venezuela,” but his overwhelming focus regarding Venezuela was on attacking its socialist economy.)

He did not raise the humanitarian crisis in Myanmar, where more than 420,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled to Bangladesh in what the United Nations called “a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.” Calling out Myanmar would have carried little political risk for Trump and would have gone a long way toward pressuring the country to drop its brutal campaign.

The focus on sovereignty conjured a picture of a world where every nation only looks out for itself. It is also a world where the United States abandons its role as a leader.

What Trump did not say, therefore, is just as much of a threat to human rights as what he did. He repeatedly extolled the virtues of strong nations over strong international institutions and held up the nation-state as “the best vehicle for elevating the human condition.” What’s unclear just how this is supposed to work. His rhetoric of sovereignty gives oppressive regimes permission to violate their citizens’ rights, and tells the rest of the world it’s okay to turn a blind eye.","Commentary: At the UN, Trump’s silences spoke volumes",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-karas-trump-commentary/commentary-at-the-un-trumps-silences-spoke-volumes-idUSKCN1BW2AC

LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - Border controls inside what should normally be Europe’s cherished zone of free travel are here to stay for now, EU ministers said on Friday, citing continued terrorist threats and the need to control migration.

Germany, France, Austria, Sweden, Denmark and Norway told their Schengen zone peers they will extend until mid-May internal frontier checks first put in place in 2015 to counter unprecedented levels of migration and Islamist attacks.

At a meeting of European Union interior ministers in Luxembourg, Germany’s Thomas de Maiziere said Berlin was still committed to freedom of movement, “but at the moment we cannot do without checks.”

“The reason is the tense security situation in Europe with regards to international terrorism and the still inadequate protection of our external borders,” he said.

France, which imposed emergency border controls after Islamist attackers killed 130 people in Paris in November, 2015, also wants to keep them in place.

“The issues around terrorism are still extremely important for us,” French Interior Minister Gerard Colomb said. “France wants to extend border controls by six months.”

The other four countries announced the same move, citing “serious threat to public policy or internal security” before the authorization to impose the border checks expires next month.

Nearly all EU states consider the free-travel Schengen area as a major benefit of decades of European integration, and are keen to avoid disruptions to travel and trade.

(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) reported an 19 percent profit decline on Friday and weaker revenue than Wall Street had expected for the fourth consecutive quarter due to mortgage issues, sending its shares down 3.5 percent.

The third-largest U.S. lender, which has been embroiled in a prolonged scandal over its sales practices, said the dip in earnings came largely from a $1 billion accrual for a legal settlement over issues stemming from before the 2007-2009 financial crisis.

But revenue at the bank also suffered from a decline in mortgage banking revenue. Wells has been trying to bounce back from a scandal over dishonest sales practices that led to interrogations by U.S. Congress and fueled the ire of millions of consumers.

Wells Fargo’s earnings dropped to $4.6 billion during the third quarter. On an adjusted basis, its profit was $1.04 per share, scraping past estimates of $1.03, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Revenue fell 2 percent to $21.9 billion, hit by a 37 percent slump in mortgage banking. Analysts had forecast revenue of $22.4 billion.

Its shares fell 3.6 percent to $53.30 in early trading.

Wells Fargo’s operating efficiency ratio, which measures expenses as a portion of revenue, was 65.5 percent during the quarter and 63.1 percent year to date.

Expenses have been a key issue for investors, and the bank has targeted a full-year ratio of 60 percent to 61 percent in 2017, aiming to improve to 55 percent to 59 percent next year.

Wells is committed to its plan to cut costs by $4 billion by the end of 2019, half of which will be reinvested into businesses, Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said in a statement.

Net income in Wells Fargo’s community banking segment, the largest of its three major businesses and the one most directly impacted by the sales scandal, was $2.2 billion, down 31 percent from a year ago due to the legal charge.

Wells Fargo is the largest U.S. residential mortgage lender, making more than $98 billion worth of loans in the first half of the year, according to trade publication Inside Mortgage Finance.

The United States is meant to provide a fifth of UNESCO’s funding, but had already been withholding that since 2011 when the body admitted Palestine as a full member. It announced its departure on Thursday accusing UNESCO of anti-Israeli bias. Israel itself followed.

LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - Britain must commit to paying what it owes to the European Union before talks can begin about a future relationship with the bloc after Brexit, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said on Friday.

“The British are discovering, as we are, day after day new problems. That’s the reason why this process will take longer than initially thought,” Juncker said in a speech to students in his native Luxembourg.

“We cannot find for the time being a real compromise as far as the remaining financial commitments of the UK are concerned. As we are not able to do this we will not be able to say in the European Council in October that now we can move to the second phase of negotiations,” Juncker said.

“They have to pay, they have to pay, not in an impossible way. I‘m not in a revenge mood. I‘m not hating the British.”

The EU has told Britain that a summit next week will conclude that insufficient progress has been made in talks for Brussels to open negotiations on a future trade deal. London has been hoping and pressing for this to happen at the summit.","'They have to pay', EU's Juncker says of Britain",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-juncker/they-have-to-pay-eus-juncker-says-of-britain-idUSKBN1CI12L

The Commerce Department said on Friday that business inventories increased 0.7 percent after rising 0.3 percent in July. Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product.

Retail inventories gained 0.7 percent in August as estimated last month. Retail inventories were unchanged in July.

Motor vehicle inventories rose 1.3 percent instead of the previously reported 1.2 percent jump. Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, increased 0.4 percent as reported last month.

They slipped 0.1 percent in July. August’s gain suggests inventory investment could contribute to GDP in the third quarter after adding just over one-tenth of a percentage point to the 3.1 percent annualized pace of growth in the April-June period.

Inventory investment, business spending on equipment and trade are seen cushioning the impact of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria on third-quarter GDP. The storms are expected to chop off at least six-tenths of a percentage point from economic growth in the July-September period.

(Reuters) - Washington has dramatically increased tensions in talks to renew the North American Free Trade Agreement by proposing that the lifespan of any new deal be limited to five years, people familiar with the negotiations said on Thursday.

The proposal for a so-called sunset clause - just one of a series of U.S. initiatives that are opposed by NAFTA partners Canada and Mexico - only served to increase uncertainty about the future of the deal.

Two sources with direct knowledge of the talks described the atmosphere as “horrible” and highly charged.

The U.S. side proposed the sunset clause late on Wednesday during the fourth of seven scheduled rounds to update the rules governing one of the world’s biggest trade blocs, said two officials, who asked not to be identified because the talks are confidential.

The Trump administration says the clause, causing NAFTA to expire every five years unless all three countries agree it should continue, is to ensure the pact stays up to date.

But Mexico and Canada insist there is no point updating the pact with such a threat hanging over it, arguing the clause would stunt investment by sowing too much uncertainty about the future of the agreement.

“It’s a source of total uncertainty,” said one of the NAFTA government officials.

Speaking in Mexico City, Finance Minister Jose Antonio Meade said the government was working on plans to alter tariffs and identify substitute markets in case the NAFTA talks failed.

His remarks and the tension around NAFTA helped push the peso down 1 percent against the U.S. dollar to a five-month low.

U.S. President Donald Trump says NAFTA, originally signed in 1994, has been a disaster for the United States and has frequently threatened to scrap it unless major changes are made.

Business and farm groups say abandoning the 23-year-old pact would wreak economic havoc, disrupting cross-border manufacturing supply chains and slapping high tariffs on agricultural products.

In addition to the sunset clause, the United States wants to boost how much North American content autos must contain to qualify for tax-free status and eliminate a dispute settlement mechanisms that Canada insists must stay.

Some trade observers said it is difficult to see how negotiators could reach an agreement given U.S. demands that many see as non-starters.

The head of Unifor, Canada’s largest private sector labor union, said it was clear the United States did not want a deal.

“NAFTA is not going anywhere. This thing is going into the toilet,” Jerry Dias told reporters on Thursday.

Despite clear signs of impatience from Canada in particular, U.S. negotiators have yet to submit their proposal on rules of origin for the auto sector. That looked unlikely to come before Friday, another official familiar with the talks said.

Trump on Wednesday repeated his warnings that he might terminate the pact and said he was open to doing a bilateral deal with either Canada or Mexico.

He was speaking alongside Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who later said Canada was “braced” for Trump’s unpredictability.

Negotiators were also set to cover the difficult issue of government procurement on Thursday.

Canada and Mexico want their companies to be able to bid on more U.S. federal and state government contracts, but this is at odds with Trump’s “Buy American” agenda. U.S. negotiators have countered with a proposal that would effectively grant the other countries less access, people familiar with the talks say.

On automotive rules of origin, NAFTA negotiators face tough new U.S. demands to increase regional vehicle content to 85 percent from 62.5 percent, with 50 percent required from the United States, according to people briefed on the plan.

The rules of origin demands are among several conditions that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has labeled “poison pill proposals” that threaten to torpedo the talks.",U.S. hikes tensions in NAFTA talks with call for 'sunset clause',https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trade-nafta/u-s-hikes-tensions-in-nafta-talks-with-call-for-sunset-clause-idUSKBN1CH2EO

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenyan police shot dead two people and wounded a third when a crowd tried to storm a police station during an opposition protest against a looming presidential vote re-run, a senior official said.

Around 20 youths attempted to take over the station during an otherwise peaceful rally in the town of Bondo in the southwest county of Siaya, forcing officers to open fire, County Commissioner Josephine Onunga said by phone.

Police also used teargas to break up small demonstrations in Kenya’s three main cities - Kisumu, the capital and the port of Mombasa - defying a government ban on rallies in city centers.

Kenya’s supreme court nullified the presidential election in August, citing procedural irregularities and voiding the victory of President Uhuru Kenyatta, opening the way to a repeat vote on Oct. 26.

But opposition leader Raila Odinga has refused to take part, saying the re-run should not happen until wide-ranging reforms were brought in to prevent a repeated failure.

The election board has said the polls will go ahead anyway, pitting Kenyatta against six other candidates, none of whom polled more than 1 percent in the August election.

Odinga told Reuters that he might consider returning to the Supreme Court for clarification on whether the Oct. 26 poll was legal.

PROVOCATIONS

“As far as we are concerned, that (original Supreme court) ruling is still valid,” Odinga said during a visit to London.

“What we are demanding is that the electoral commission should respect the Supreme Court and carry out elections in accordance with the ruling.”

He supported protesters’ right to demonstrate, he said, but he has so far stopped short of calling people onto the streets himself.

Martin Kimani, the Director of the National Counter Terrorism Centre, said the opposition was trying to manufacture a crisis.

“A lot of those provocations or demonstrations taking place is an attempt to create the appearance of a crisis,” he said. “There is a clear process on how to hold an assembly – it is about maintaining law and order.”

In Nairobi, opposition legislators were repeatedly teargassed as they tried to drive into the city center.

“We are asking Uhuru’s government to ... let us protest in peace and truth and we are saying we want change and we do not want Uhuru and his people,” said protester Mellen Kirumbo.

In Kisumu, a stronghold of Odinga support, protesters reacted angrily when police turned water cannon on them to prevent them from entering the city center.

“Our demonstrations have a (valid) basis and are peaceful,” said Odinga supporter Hezron Tirus Aloyo. “We condemn the directive ... on the limitation of our rights to demonstrate.”",Kenya police shoot dead two during opposition protest: commissioner,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-kenya-election/kenya-police-shoot-dead-two-during-opposition-protest-commissioner-idUKKBN1CI102
