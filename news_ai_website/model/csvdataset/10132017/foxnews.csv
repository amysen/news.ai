The two were also expecting their first child together when Austin suffered the severe medical complication that his doctors blamed on energy drinks, wrote Brianna in a post that has since been removed from Facebook.

“Being pregnant is supposed to be one of the most amazing journeys you will ever embark on,” Brianna wrote. “You're creating a new life. You are experiencing unconditional love for someone you have not even met.”

Austin's accident happened when Brianna was nine months pregnant, she wrote. She said she went to bed, then woke up to a life-changing scene.

“I still remember my mother in law waking me up that morning. ‘Austin had an accident,’"" she said. ""All I knew was that my husband was in the hospital. The worst part? I didn't know why.""

Brianna wrote that her husband had suffered a brain hemorrhage, and says doctors blamed it on “excessive energy drink consumption” after running a toxicology screen and ruling out drugs.

Austin was already in surgery by the time Brianna and family arrived at the hospital. It wasn’t until nearly five hours later that she got to see her husband, Brianna wrote.

“The next day was round two of brain surgery. Following this were strokes, seizures, swelling, and more things we weren't prepared for. There was a moment, sitting by his hospital bed, just praying he would be okay, that I knew I would never give up on him. No matter how messy our life would become. I was going to be by his side through all of it.""

Judging by photos shared of Austin and Brianna shared on Endres Photography's Facebook page — which, too, appear to have been removed from the site — doctors had removed part of Austin's skull during his surgeries.

Brianna, meanwhile, was still unsure of her husband's fate. ""After two weeks of living in a hospital, wondering if he would survive or be taken from us, [the family] made our way back home. The time had come for me to deliver our baby.”

Austin was still in the hospital when Brianna delivered their baby, but she said that “a beautiful miracle happened as I delivered our son. Austin woke up.”

“I went about a week without seeing him. I thought about him every day. I cried as I looked at my child who looked just like his daddy. When the baby was only a week old, I left him with my in-laws. I knew I needed to see Austin. I needed to tell him that our baby was here,” she said.

In her final paragraph on Facebook, Brianna wrote:

“Our life isn't normal. There are doctors visits and hospital trips- so many that I loose[sic] count. But we are here. Fighting. I wake up every day to take care of our beautiful little boy and my husband. I prepare the meals, do physical therapy, speech therapy, and occupational therapy. I help him with personal hygiene. I help him walk. I help him with every aspect of his life. And in between these tasks I take care of our very busy eight month old. It is hard, and I am tired, but we make the most of it. He isn't the same man I fell in love with, but I still fall further everyday, We are fighting to help him recover. To make his life better.”

“We need to stand up,” Janney said. “Women should be heard and out of this they will be more powerful.”

Janney attended the Paley Center event and introduced White to the stage along with Pamela Adlon.

The defeat ends a streak of seven consecutive appearances for the U.S. at soccer's quadrennial showcase, dating back to 1990.

The U.S. entered its final qualifier with a berth uncertain for the first time since 1989. Home losses to Mexico last November and Costa Rica last month left the Americans little margin for error.

The 28th-ranked Americans needed merely a tie against 99th-ranked Trinidad, which lost its sixth straight qualifier last week. But the defeat -- coupled with Honduras' come-from-behind 3-2 win over Mexico and Panama's 2-1 victory over Costa Rica on Ramon Torres' 88th-minute goal -- dropped the Americans from third place into fifth in the six-nation final round of the North and Central American and Caribbean region.

Mexico and Costa Rica already had clinched berths, and Panama claimed the third and final automatic spot and will go the World Cup for the first time. Honduras will meet Australia in a two-game playoff next month for another spot at next year's 32-nation tournament.



Shocked American players slumped on the bench, and Matt Besler sat on the field after the final whistle as Panama's game ended and then Costa Rica's. At the end, dejected U.S. players filed into their locker rooms with blank looks.



Missing the World Cup is a devastating blow to the U.S. Soccer Federation, which has steadily built the sport in the last quarter-century with the help of sponsors and television partners. It also is a trauma for Fox, which broadcasts the next three World Cups after taking the U.S. rights from ESPN. The USSF hopes to co-host the 2026 tournament with Mexico and Canada, and Morocco is the only other bidder.



After an 0-2 start in the hexagonal last fall under Jurgen Klinsmann, the USSF replaced him last November with Bruce Arena, the American coach from 1998-2006. The team revived with home wins over Honduras and Trinidad last spring and draws at Panama and Mexico. But the 2-0 defeat to Costa Rica in New Jersey at the start of Labor Day weekend proved one hurdle too many to overcome.



""No excuses for us not getting the second goal and at least a point,"" Arena said. ""It's a blemish for us.""



The Americans fell behind in the 17th minute when defender Omar Gonzalez made a casual attempt with his left foot to clear Alvin Jones' cross and sent the ball looping over the outstretched right arm of goalkeeper Tim Howard from 18 yards.



Jones doubled the lead in the 37th with a 35-yard strike, again to Howard's upper right corner, and nearly scored another in the 44th when his swerving shot bounced off Howard's chest and spilled into the penalty area.



Christian Pulisic, the Americans' 19-year-old star midfielder, scored in the 47th minute from the arc with a right-footed shot. He played a role in 12 of the 17 Americans goals in the hexagonal.



One minute later, Howard made a kick save on Shahdon Winchester's short-range shot, and DeAndre Yedlin blocked Levi Garcia's follow-up attempt.



The U.S. bench was tense, as Honduras scored twice early in the second half to take the lead over visiting Mexico in the 60th minute and Panama tied the score against visiting Costa Rica in the 52nd.



Clint Dempsey, who entered at the start of the second half, was denied by goalkeeper Adrian Foncette's leaping save in the 69th and hit a post from 22 yards in the 77th. Pulisic's shot in the 87th was saved by Foncette.



All American reserves were standing for much of the final minutes, and Arena had repeated exasperated looks.



Just a few hundred fans were in the stands at 10,000-capacity Ato Boldon Stadium, located 24 miles south of the capital, Port-of-Spain. Paul Caligiuri's famous goal at the National Stadium in 1989 put the U.S. in the World Cup for the first time since 1950.



Among the spectators were a few dozen American Outlaws, the U.S. supporters group.

It can be dropped into any warzone and withstand barrages in the harshest conditions.

Circular holes around the exterior let you bolt on armour plating - and there's even an option to strap on V-shape armour under the chassis to deflect roadside bombs.

""Designers"" claim the SUV is meant to stand out against its pretty rivals with right angles replacing rooflines.

Because it lacks any style or complicated panels, it can be produced quickly and cheaply.

Plus you can stick in whatever engine you want - including electric power - although a 2.8-litre Fiat diesel is standard.

Incumbent Republicans in Congress need something to run on and I would recommend tax reform.","The American people are frustrated and rightly so. Tens of millions of Americans came together and elected the ultimate political outsider Donald Trump president of the United States in 2016. This was a continuation of the message sent by voters in 2010 and again in 2014 that Washington, D.C., is broken.

Now nine months into the reform-minded Trump administration, that feeling of frustration is palpable and growing with each day. It’s growing because Republican leaders in Congress can’t seem to get their act together to keep their promises to the American people and pass the president’s conservative reform agenda. The Republican majority is Congress is not enormous but it’s large enough to pass the big ticket items that virtually every member of the House and Senate caucuses has supported and campaigned on over the years.

Republicans across the board have been in agreement on the need to repeal and replace the disaster that is ObamaCare for seven years. Now it appears that senators like John McCain would rather stab their constituents in the back than make good on a campaign promise. John McCain doesn’t like President Trump and everyone knows it, but he let his spite get in the way of doing what is right for America. Senator McCain’s decision to oppose Graham-Cassidy and kill Republican health care efforts smacks of a typical career Washington politician who has become a poster boy for congressional term limits. The American people are sick and tired of politicians who say one thing and do another.

I sincerely hope that history does not repeat itself with tax reform. Republican Senator Bob Corker has long supported tax reform for his overtaxed constituents in Tennessee. His constituents sent him to Washington to now deliver on the conservative agenda that eluded them during the Obama years. Tennesseans delivered their electoral votes to Donald Trump with an overwhelming 61 percent of the vote.

Tennesseans want Senator Corker and the Republican majority in Congress to pass tax reform this year. Presidents and Senators of the same party can have public spats, but at the end of the day, the agenda and promises made to the people must carry the day. There is a direct correlation between how much of President Trump’s agenda Congress can pass with how many incumbents will face conservative primary challenges around the country in 2018. The American people have had enough; get something done that you promised us or we’re going to find someone to take your place. It’s common sense.

The president says he still wants Congress repeal and replace the Obama health care law.","President Trump plans to halt payments to insurers under the Affordable Care Act ""immediately,"" in a major blow to ObamaCare that is likely to draw a legal challenge.

The president, though, used the overnight decision to up pressure on Democrats to negotiate a ""fix"" to the ""imploding"" health care law.

""The Democrats ObamaCare is imploding. Massive subsidy payments to their pet insurance companies has stopped. Dems should call me to fix!"" he said in a pre-dawn tweet on Friday.

He added, ""ObamaCare is a broken mess. Piece by piece we will now begin the process of giving America the great HealthCare it deserves!""

The Justice Department took swift action, notifying a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., in connection with a related lawsuit that an upcoming Oct. 18 payment “will not occur.”

The decision is the latest effort in the president’s bid to ultimately “repeal and replace” what’s considered the signature legislation of his White House predecessor.

The White House said in a statement that the Department of Health and Human Services has determined there is no appropriation for so-called cost-sharing reduction payments to insurers under the ObamaCare law.

""We will discontinue these payments immediately,"" said acting HHS Secretary Eric Hargan and Medicare administrator Seema Verma.

Trump's decision was expected to rattle already-unsteady insurance marketplaces. The president has previously threatened to end the payments, which help reduce health insurance copays and deductibles for people with modest incomes, but remain under a legal cloud.

Trump has privately told at least one lawmaker that the payments may continue if a bipartisan deal is reached on heath care, The Wall Street Journal reported.

Pushback expected

The president's action will likely to trigger a lawsuit from state attorneys general, who contend the subsidies to insurers are fully authorized by federal law, and the president's position is reckless. Xavier Becerra, California’s attorney general, called the decision “sabotage,” and promised a lawsuit.

After the president’s intentions were disclosed, leading Democrats in Congress were quick to criticize the plan.

In a statement, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., predicted that Trump’s expected action would increase Americans’ health premiums by 20 percent or more.

""If these reports are true,” the Democrats said in the joint statement, referring to the president’s plans, “the president is walking away from the good-faith, bipartisan Alexander-Murray negotiations and risking the health care of millions of Americans.”

The Democrats were referring to bipartisan talks being led by Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., to seek a bipartisan agreement for funding ObamaCare subsidies and stabilizing health insurance markets.

Order to lower premiums

Earlier Thursday, Trump predicted that “millions and millions of people” would benefit from an executive order he signed Thursday to make lower-premium health insurance plans more widely available.

But the changes Trump hopes to bring about could take months or even longer. That's according to administration officials who outlined the order for reporters. The proposals may not be finalized in time to affect coverage for 2019, let alone next year.

White House domestic policy director Andrew Bremberg said that Trump still believes Congress needs to repeal and replace the Obama-era Affordable Care Act. The White House described the order as first steps.

Trump signed the order in the White House's Roosevelt Room surrounded by Vice President Mike Pence, members of his Cabinet and Congress.

Trump employed the executive order because the Republican-controlled Congress has been unable to pass a plan to repeal and replace ObamaCare.

Trump says the health care system ""will get better"" with his action, and the action will cost the federal government nothing.

The president says he still wants Congress repeal and replace the Obama health care law. But he says his order will give people more competition, more choices and lower premiums.

Canadian Joshua Boyle reportedly balked at boarding a U.S. plane out of Pakistan on Thursday, worrying his background could land him in hot water with American officials, specifically believing he could be imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay.

Boyle was previously married to the sister of Omar Khadr, a Canadian man who spent 10 years at Guantanamo Bay after being captured in 2002 in a firefight at an Al Qaeda compound in Afghanistan.

The Canadian-born Khadr was 15 in 2002 when he tossed a grenade in a firefight that killed U.S. Army Sgt. 1st Class Christopher Speer, a special forces medic.

The flying museum, better known as the “Madras Maiden” touched down in Columbia, S.C. Sunday, where volunteers give 30-minute tours to veterans, visitors or families of those who served in the military.

“They do fine…I’m proud of them. [They’re] down in that plane like they were born in it,” WWII Army veteran William Pate said about the volunteers.

From 1944 to 1947, Pate jumped out of C-47’s and C-82’s as an 82nd Airborne paratrooper.

“I enjoyed what I was doing. If I could, I would do it again. But I have a lot of age on me now. I ain’t no spring chicken,” he told Fox News.

Pate and other veterans in attendance swapped war stories with each other and the crew after taking one of the flights over the city.

“It’s just an honor to be able to hear their stories, talk to their families and just keep their memories alive for generations,” Rodney Schneider said.

An aircraft maintainer by trade, Schneider explained his love for planes stretched back to his childhood. This motivated him to reach out to the Liberty Foundation, which organizes the event.

“I’ve been with the airplane now seven-days straight. Sometimes its weeks between when I’m needed,"" Schneider said.

Robert “Max” Maiden, 21, is a co-pilot for the bomber. He flies to different cities every weekend for six months.

“I’ve always loved flying old airplanes…They have a cool story to tell and they are an important part of history,” Maiden said. “You really see people get really emotional and they sit there and they go, 'Aww man this is what my dad did,' or ‘my dad built them’ or 'my dad flew them or is a gunner.' It’s really cool to share that with people.”

Erin Creed traveled to Columbia from Virginia with her father and husband to honor her grandfather, who fought the Nazis in Europe.

“I just could not believe I was on a World War Two plane,” she said. “I had his picture and his favorite hat and I just couldn’t believe [I] was flying in memory of him.”

One of only 12 B-17’s still flying the “Madras Maiden” was built toward the end of the war but never saw combat. In 2016, The Liberty Foundation began operating the aircraft and spends over a million dollars every year for upkeep. The money that is generated from ticket sales or donations helps to cover the costs.

“If that goes away, it goes back into a museum and starts collecting dust and you don’t get to hear it or smell it,” Schneider explained.

The crew’s age and skills may vary, but one thing remains the same -- the love for planes and veterans.

“We get to ride on a WWII airplane that not everybody can do and just the satisfaction of just doing it,” Schneider said.

Some may argue players could have found a better venue to highlight the true challenges within the justice system without seeming to disrespect the flag, yet owners backed their right under the first amendment.

The owners and Roger Goodell did not expect the fiery fan blowback. Outraged conservatives perceived kneeling as an encroachment on the principles near and dear to not only them but a majority of Americans. Respecting country, respecting America’s lineage, the military and their families are collectively exemplified by the flag. But, owners are proving to be hypocrites by not being true to the value of social justice nor patriotism and instead have one focus: the dollar.

The NFL must have had some foresight into the importance of the national anthem and the related conduct displayed on the field before kickoff. NFL national anthem policy is on pages A62-63 of the league’s rulebook. It states: 'The National Anthem must be played prior to every NFL game, and all players must be on the sideline for the National Anthem. During the National Anthem, players on the field and bench area should stand at attention, face the flag, hold helmets in their left hand and refrain from talking.'

Because the NFL was bleeding cash on the field, the owners and Roger Goodell had to call an audible and scramble away from their players.

Ignoring their own league rules caused conservative organizations, pundits, media, and activists to call for an NFL boycott. Football fans and businesses rallied, burning jerseys and season tickets, canceling their Direct TV Football packages, not buying tickets, merchandise, and playing smash mouth themselves by turning the channel.

Due to the costly backlash, according to the Wall Street Journal, the National Football League’s owners will discuss next week whether to unilaterally change league policy and require players to stand during the national anthem. If players refuse to rise up, they could face disciplinary action by the league or by the team. The NFL may change the rules of conduct in direct response to their fans who are rejecting politics on the field and hitting them where it hurts them most—their Gucci wallets.

Because the NFL was bleeding cash on the field, the owners and Roger Goodell had to call an audible and scramble away from their players. Initially, they believed the politics of social justice was ""the right thing to do” on behalf of their players and to support the broader ideas the protests were about.

But, kneeling players proved to kill ticket and jersey sales and viewership -- and their positions are viewed by many fans as divisive and disrespectful -- negatively impacting the NFL brand and profits. So social justice and the fear of losing support of the players had to take a back seat.

It’s also clear this ""juke"" move by the NFL is not one based on patriotism, because the original position of the NFL, as written in their rulebook, was to respect America's anthem -- a principle they happily discarded until faced with lost money and ratings.

Conservative fans and media are claiming victory. Patriotism seems to sell and ultimately forced owners and Roger Goodell to expose the hypocrisy of their real motives and priorities -- which had nothing to do with the importance of supporting social justice, or even patriotism, but everything to do with profit.",The NFL and its owners salute one flag: The dollar,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/12/nfl-and-its-owners-salute-one-flag-dollar.html

Human remains along with Anne Cameron's clothes and walking stick were found near a creek bank on Thursday two days after the 79-year-old woman wandered from a nursing home at Port Douglas in Queensland state, Police Inspector Ed Lukin said.

Police suspect she wandered into tropical forest and became disoriented, triggering an extensive search.

The remains were found about a mile from the nursing home. Pathologists in Cairns confirmed Friday that the remains were human, Lukin said.

""We strongly suspect now that there has been involvement of a crocodile attack given the location of those items and the human remains ... close to a watercourse,"" Lukin said. While police were waiting for the results of further forensic tests, Lukin said it was ""highly likely"" the remains were Cameron's since no one else had been reported missing in the area.

The woman's granddaughter Isabella Eggins posted on social media that the family ""have the firm belief that my nan Anne Cameron has passed away in tragic circumstances.""

Crocodiles have been a protected species in Australia since the 1970s, which has led to an explosion in their population across the country's tropical north. Because saltwater crocodiles can live up 70 years and grow throughout their lives -- reaching up to 23 feet in length -- the proportion of large crocodiles is also rising.

He called the NBC nuclear meeting ""pure fiction"" and said he believes the sources are made up.
I don't think Trump really wants to go down that road.","A Washington Post story yesterday described President Trump as really, really mad. In fact, he was said to be ""livid.""

That, the story said, was at a July meeting when he asked Rex Tillerson, Jim Mattis and others why he should prop up the Obama nuclear agreement with Iran when he considered it a disaster.

""'He threw a fit,’ said one person familiar with the meeting. ""... He was furious. Really furious. It’s clear he felt jammed.""

So H.R. McMaster came up with a plan to get Trump to ""compromise,"" the Post says.

The key thing here—beyond the geopolitical implications of decertifying the Iran deal—is that unnamed sources are portraying the president as a hothead who has to be schooled by his top aides.

The same theme was struck in the NBC report that Trump ""said he wanted what amounted to a nearly tenfold increase in the U.S. nuclear arsenal during a gathering this past summer of the nation’s highest-ranking national security leaders, according to three officials who were in the room."" The president had to be told that the stockpile has been dramatically reduced since the 1960s because of arms-control agreements.

And that July meeting led to what NBC reported last week was Tillerson telling colleagues that his boss is a ""moron."" (His spokeswoman denied this after the secretary of State declined to address it at a news conference.)

This is the emerging media narrative about Trump: that he's constantly getting mad, that he doesn't know much about foreign policy, and that his generals and advisers have to save him from himself.

Think for a moment about the motivation of the sources who whisper these details to reporters: Are they trying to make the boss look bad, or build themselves up? And if they were engaged in a conscious strategy, wouldn't it be better to do it quietly?

Trump has denied the stories, sometimes with backing from top officials, and turned his ire on the media. He called the NBC nuclear meeting ""pure fiction"" and said he believes the sources are made up. NBC anchor Lester Holt says the network had three sources in the room.

In escalating his attacks on ""fake news,"" the president is now suggesting that the government take action, tweeting:

""Network news has become so partisan, distorted and fake that licenses must be challenged and, if appropriate, revoked. Not fair to public!""

In fact, the FCC doesn't license national networks, only local stations. And those decisions are supposed to be based on community service, not news content. So that's a non-starter.

The president has every right to complain about negative or distorted coverage, but talking about lifting licenses, in a country with a First Amendment, is troubling.

I don't think Trump really wants to go down that road. He is known for venting his displeasure with the press in very strong terms. He may or may not be mad in White House meetings, but he's clearly quite angry with the media.","Trump rips NBC, eyes TV licenses, but is he serious?",http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/13/trump-rips-nbc-eyes-tv-licenses-but-is-serious.html

The U.S. Army launched a revolutionary SMET initiative that aims to integrate robots into brigades.

While top brass walked the floors of AUSA exploring innovation for future combat in Washington D.C., in Georgia at Fort Benning, robot selection to join the troops is in an intense final week.

AUSA 2017: THIS NET MAKES US SPECIAL OPERATIONS VEHICLES 'DISAPPEAR'

Many companies had thrown their robots in the ring for selection to serve and the Army narrowed down those invited to the Benning phase that began back on Sept. 11 and is expected to conclude Oct. 14. The final four robots will be chosen and the Army will ask the companies to begin production.

The jungle drums at AUSA have it that the selected robots may be integrating and working alongside soldiers in brigade combat teams (BCTs) as soon as early next year.

Why enlist robots to join the infantry?

What will these robot “soldiers” be able to bring to the fight?

American soldiers are required to carry a great deal of weight on missions, as much as over 100 pounds of gear. The SMET robot will play a key role in lightening the load for soldiers.

The aim is for a SMET robot to be able to carry 1,000 pounds across more than 60 miles in 72 hours.

The robot needs to operate autonomously, but also be compatible with a human manning it. It needs to be smart enough to follow the soldiers as they move.

In doing so, it also needs to be able to manage the wide range of terrains – and often tough terrains – that U.S. soldiers travel through. Wherever a soldier goes, a SMET will ideally be able to go too.

The robot will therefore need to have the right balance of being big enough to carry at least 1,000 pounds, while small enough to navigate through narrow areas in between trees in a forest or jungle, for example.

Soldiers don’t always walk to their missions, they often fly. So the SMET should be able to join them and fit inside a helicopter or the slung load.

If soldiers are under attack, they can defend themselves, so perhaps the robot will be equipped with advanced sensors to process and understand the threat and armed with weaponry to defend itself and fellow human soldiers too.

PODCAST: LEARN HOW THIS SPECIAL FORCES GUY BUILT A FORMIDABLE BUSINESS FROM NOTHING

What else could it be used for?

SMET is not just about the strength in terms of weight it can carry, ideally SMET will also enhance power for soldiers. The Army has set the goal that while on the move, the robots need to be able to generate 11kW of power and 3 kW while stationary.

This requirement could produce promising new battery technology, new methods of power generation and new ways to use alternative fuels.

SMET may also have potential to perform other roles like patrolling. At a base, it could be deployed for perimeter security or running re-supply missions through dangerous areas to reduce the risk to soldiers.

Early SMETs have even established they could tow soldiers on skis and follow soldiers in jungles, neither of which are easy tasks.

Adding brains to extreme off-roading ATVs

Autonomy is extremely difficult. Autonomy on a platform that can go where a soldier can go and can tackle off road and tough terrain is even more difficult.

Polaris makes popular ATVs that are driven throughout the states America for fun. But they also make vehicles for the Armed Forces and the ultra-light MRZRs have long been a US military favorite for their outstanding off-road mobility.

In fact, U.S. special operations forces and the wider military regularly rely on the advanced capabilities MRZR 2 and MRZR 4 for their work downrange.

The company teamed up with robot experts Applied Research Associates and Neya Systems to turn their wildly popular MRZR into the MRZR X – a smart MRZR that integrates advanced robotics so it can drive without a human at the wheel.

At AUSA, there was a steady stream of Army personnel looking to examine the MRZR-X – the company’s submission for SMET selection. Still under close wraps, only the MRZR that provides the basis of X was available.

AUSA 2017 IN PICTURES

The mysterious MRZR-X

So what can we expect the under-wraps MRZR-X can do? We can expect the smarts laid out in the Army requirements combined with the MRZR’s capabilities.

This SMET robot would have the SOF-grade MRZR feature of on-demand, advanced all-wheel drive. When more traction is needed, the vehicle already has the smarts to automatically engage all four wheels and return to two-wheels when appropriate.

Both variants also reach a max speed of around 60 miles per hour and sport engines that have 88 horsepower, designed for extreme performance in the toughest terrains. For ensure maximum agility, the ATVs are built with a low center of gravity. In part, this is achieved by cunning placement of key components like the engine. These capabilities will provide an advantage in the MRZR-X being able to travel wherever a Soldier goes.

The MRZR 2 already meets the SMET weight requirement. It can carry 1,000 pounds, while the MRZR 4 can carry an additional 500 pounds.

For the versatility of SMET manned or unmanned, the MRZR vehicles are already designed with keyless ignition, which makes it easy for a human to jump in and instantly go. The vehicles can also be endlessly adapted for different mission configurations and requirements.

One very important option the MRZR-X could bring to a war zone is the litter configuration. Theoretically, the MRZR-X could drive a team out of harm’s way by itself while carrying wounded soldiers and freeing up the driver to also help treat the wounded.

Important for keeping a low profile, avoiding detection and not compromising the humans it would travel alongside, the vehicle can black out instantaneously.

This week, numerous women came forward claiming they were sexually harassed by Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein, a Democratic mega-donor. Many Hollywood celebrities have condemned Weinstein’s alleged actions in recent days. Angelina Jolie, Cara Delevingne, Rose McGowan, Ashley Judd, Gwyneth Paltrow...all actresses being hailed by the Hollywood Left as courageous and brave.



It's true, strength comes in numbers. But it's arguable that the ""strength"" they exhibit now as a crowd was nonexistent when they were on their own, clawing their way up the ladder of celebrity status, suppressing their integrity to excuse the inexcusable. To these ladies, let me say this as clearly as I can: You are complicit. Your silence over the last three decades enabled and propagated a culture in Hollywood that breeds men like Harvey Weinstein. You are not brave. You are stepping on the spoke of a wheel to elevate yourself, again clawing your way up, this time onto the bandwagon.

The women who are truly brave in this scandal are the women whose names you won't hear: the personal assistants in year one of trying to make it as a future director, the actresses who were preyed upon by Weinstein who, as a result of seeking justice, had their careers destroyed. These women whose integrity prevented them from staying silent, they are the brave ones.

Even some Democrats are speaking out. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and wife to one of the most notorious sexual predators in modern times, released a statement saying, ""I was shocked and appalled by the revelations about Harvey Weinstein. The behavior described by women coming forward cannot be tolerated. Their courage and the support of others is critical in helping to stop this kind of behavior.""



Mrs. Clinton, were you shocked and appalled with your husband when, time after time, you were faced with the fact that he too had preyed upon women? Have you also extended this badge of courage to Juanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey, Paula Jones and Leslie Milwee?



Part of this is our fault: America has a love affair with redemption stories. True stories of people falling into the depths of emotional and moral despair, rising from their regrets with an abundance of self-righteousness...it's a story we all love to read, watch, and hear. But maybe we need to tweak our interests a little.



Robert Downey, Jr., Mary Tyler Moore, David Duchovny, Drew Barrymore, Kiefer Sutherland, Elizabeth Taylor, Ozzy Osborne, Tiger Woods and countless others...all repeatedly succumbed to various addictions, destroying their families and working relationships time after time. But who among them lost their job, their fame, and their relevance? At what point do we stop celebrating celebrities when they bounce back from a place they never should have been? I recognize that everyone makes mistakes. None of us are innocent.

Hollywood loves to stay on trend. But for future reference, as William Makepiece Thackeray said, ""Bravery never goes out of fashion."" Bravery was just as cool twenty years ago when these actresses could've spoken out and possibly altered the events of the future. But their silence allowed many more young women to be victims of serial, predatory behavior by Harvey Weinstein.

And Hanson doesn’t use GPS or any technology for the work, which he says “works out pretty good in a harvested bean field.”

Then he flies his two-seater plane, and if his design passes the test, he snaps a pic with a Cannon camera and posts it on Facebook. He said he's only been unsuccessful twice.

Hanson said he initially wanted to add an addendum -- “We kneel at the cross” -- but the plan was foiled by the first frost of the season.

Hanson said, weather permitting, he plans to add that phrase soon.

Hanson and his wife, Darlene, are Lutherans and attend church regularly. He also describes himself as a Republican and Trump supporter, and he had the chance to get a picture of the president when Trump came to North Dakota for a tax reform speech in September.

“I was 20 feet away from him,” Hanson said. “It was a good meeting and the president stayed on script.”

Hanson said he believes Trump is trying to do well, but faces a “continuous battle” in Washington, D.C. And Hanson said he's doing all he can to send his support from his Edgeley farm.

Some of his previous messages include “Drain the Swamp,” “Blue Lives Matter,” “Feel the Bern,” “GOP, get your act together,” and “Vote Trump.”

Justin Rosenstein, an early Facebook engineer, now considers his invention as a contributor to “time poorly spent,” as he wrote in Thrive Global earlier this year.

SHERYL SANDBERG: CONGRESS SHOULD RELEASE FACEBOOK ADS TO THE PUBLIC

While he noted that the Like button succeeds at some things like drawing attention to a friend’s interests or acting as a catalyst for “positive sentiment,” it also results in gobs of “time wasted” when looking at videos that “don’t nourish your life” or are just constant distractions that are unproductive and disruptive.

This topic was recently highlighted in The Guardian, which said that smartphone use (and technology in general) is not just addictive, but it contributes to “continuous partial attention,” wreaking havoc on people’s ability to focus and potentially making them dumber.

“One recent study showed that the mere presence of smartphones damages cognitive capacity – even when the device is turned off,” the article noted.

Many of these early technologists are now “weaning themselves off their own products” and teaching their children to put down iPhones, iPads, and laptops, the Guardian added. However, the problem is large technology companies often define success as “time spent on site,” Rosenstein wrote.

Rosenstein is now co-founder of a workplace software startup, known as Asana, and is currently working on an app that seeks to address some these issues.

Use versus abuse

""You need to define addiction. A lot of people just like to use the technology a lot"" but aren't necessarily addicted, Nir Eyal, author of ""Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products,"" who has taught at Stanford Graduate School of Business and Design School, told Fox News.

""If you throw around this word 'addiction,' it really hurts people. It disempowers people to take control of it. 'It's not my fault, it's the technology's fault.'"" Eyal said, adding if you shirk personal responsibility, you're more likely to relapse.

But companies do have a ""moral imperative"" to at least try to help real addicts. ""We have personally identifiable information who is using and who is abusing,"" he said.

For example, a company could have a policy where ""if you use our product more than X number of hours per week, we're going to reach out to and ask if we can help you,"" he said. And if they are receptive and accept the offer for help, then the company can step in, he said.

""Whining about this to a company is not going to stop anything. To whine to a company like Facabook or Google to make their product less good is a fool's errand,"" he added.

The document was used by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police at a U.S. border crossing in Quebec, according to reports. The queries appeared to specifically target Muslim asylum seekers, as they did not mention any other religions or non-Muslim terrorist groups.

The questionnaire, first published by the Toronto Star, also had more standard fare: country of origin, basic health questions and whether the respondent has friends or family in the U.S. or Canada.

REFUGEES CONTINUE TO CROSS FROM US TO CANADA IN UNPRECEDENTED NUMBERS

But it then asked the asylum seeker's opinion on ISIS, the Taliban and how they feel about women who do not wear religious garbs, such as the hijab and niqab.

Question 31 on the form reads: “Canada is a very liberal country that believes in freedom of religious practice and equality between men and women. What is your opinion on this subject? How would you feel if your boss was a woman?”

A spokesperson for the RCMP told the Toronto Star on Wednesday the questions were part of an “interview guide” used by officers in Quebec.

“Due to the high volume of irregular migrants in Quebec, an interview guide was developed as an operation tool to streamline processing and provide consistency in the RCMP’s preliminary risk assessments,” Annie Delisle told the Star.

It's unclear how long it had been used.

The RCMP didn't immediately return Fox News' request for comment.

According to the Star, the answers from the questionnaire were entered into RCMP databases and could be shared with the Canada Border Services Agency.

Scott Bradsley, spokesperson for Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale, told the Star on Wednesday the use of “the version” of the guide has been suspended by the RCMP.

“The minute we became aware of the interview guide, we were immediately concerned and contacted the RCMP,” he said. “Some of the questions were inappropriate and inconsistent with government policy.”

Immigration lawyer Clifford McCarten, who obtained a copy of the document from a client seeking refugee status told the Canadian Press that he was “shocked” by the questions.

""If, in fact, this was a local detachment making this decision -- which I find a bit hard to believe -- then it's deeply concerning that one of the most, if not the most problematic crisis spot in Canadian immigration and refugee policy right now...doesn't have a federal strategy for how screening is happening,"" he said.

McCarten told the Toronto Star while he was thankful for the quick reaction by Goodale’s office, other questions need to be answered.

“I’m heartened to hear from the leadership that they take this as seriously as we do,” McCarten said. “But what possible purpose could someone’s opinion about female employment or religious head coverings have to bear on an assessment risk?”

He added: “If someone’s religious opinion is sufficient to place them in an RCMP database for potential future monitoring, we need to be concerned about that. If they recognize those questions are inappropriate, then they need to destroy all the information that was gathered.”

Canada has seen a recent influx of refugees crossing into the country from the U.S. in unprecedented numbers.

More than 13,000 people have crossed illegally into Canada this year, according to Canadian government data. That's more than five times the number intercepted by the RCMP in 2016.

The gorgeous 31-year-old started her career in healthcare at age 16 and has been a cardiac registered nurse for more than eight years.

She has worked in various different roles during her accomplished career, including intensive care units as well acting as a charge nurse in operating theatres.

After years of helping patients in hospitals, Lauren realized it was having a detrimental effect on her on well-being.

She felt overworked, overstressed, overweight, fatigued and extremely unhappy, so she decided to take control of her life and get her priorities straight.

She said: ""I wanted to be a healthy, fit, strong, confident woman, actively preventing disease instead of treating everything with pills and medication.

""I wanted to change my life for the better and I wanted to help others before they lost control of their health too.""

The ultra-fit beauty never set out to become a ""fitness model.""

""I let the winter and holiday seasons get the best of me. I was unhappy with what I saw in the mirror and I felt even worse, so I decided to make a change for the better.""

She embarked on a paleo challenge, which involves eating a caveman-style diet and produced motivating results leading her to research entering competition shows.

After YouTubing to find out about the scene, she bit the bullet and signed up for her first bikini show where she placed 9th out of 30 competitors.

This spiked her interest and gave her the thirst to go for her professional card.

She hired a coach, entered more and more shows, and finally got the top spot in an amateur show, giving the opportunity to compete for money in professional body building, fitness and aesthetic shows.

She has since opened up her private Instagram account and now has over 3.6 million followers to whom she shares inspirational images of her stunning figure and workout routines, as well as the odd sexy picture of her self in tiny lingerie and bikinis.

Escudero, a 53-year-old woman from Alcala de Guadaira, a town outside of Seville in southern Spain, has been unable to renew her driver’s license or go to the doctor since 2010 because various government officers believe she’s dead -- the result of a seven-year-old clerical error.

“[I have] suffered for more than six years,” she told EFE, according to El Diario de Sevilla.

Escudero said she first learned of the error when she visited the emergency room and her primary care physician checked her out.

“He looked at her, not knowing how to break it to her, and told her that according to Social Security records she was deceased,” her daughter, Marta, told the newspaper, adding “the family has not found the funny side of this story for a long time now.”

The doctor still treated Escudero “because she knew me and knew my situation was urgent,” but that the error needed to be fixed sooner rather than later.

At first, Escudero thought it was just a computer error that could be fixed quickly at the Social Security offices. That wasn’t the case.

“They explained to me that someone probably made a typo or maybe it was a computer error. But we went to the treasury, to the courts…and everywhere I appeared as deceased,” she told the newspaper.

When her husband passed away in 2011, she needed a certification of life to receive widow benefits, but instead was told she could be charged with identify fraud.

“On top of killing me, they find me, without hearing my story,” Escudero said, joking that she is dead to everyone but the banks, to whom she pays loans and mortgage on a regular basis. “On the government’s computers I am dead, but for the banks I am alive and kicking.”

In April 2016, she found out that a woman with her name and data had been buried six years prior in Malaga – about 127 miles away.

She said her daughter called the cemetery and confirmed the burial date and that the remains has been transferred to an ossuary because maintenance fees had not been paid. She also confirmed her mother’s social security and date of birth.

“'Look,' my daughter told them, 'that person is my mother and she is here right next to me,'” Escudero said. “Imagine the woman’s face at the cemetery.”

Earlier this month she filed a petition with Malaga courts to have the grave opened and has offered to do a DNA test – anything – to prove that the woman buried is not her.

Escudero says no one has explained to her how the woman has died, but believes that she has been confused with a sister with whom she has no contact and whose whereabouts are unknown.

In its news release about Collins, the ethics panel declared that “pursuant to House Rule XI, clause 3(b)(8)(A) and Committee Rules 17 A(b)(1)(A) and 17(A)(c)(I)” that “the Committee will review the matter pursuant to Committee Rule 18(a).” However, the Ethics Committee said it will “comply with Committee Rule 7.” Moreover, the committee will publish a “Report and Findings” – which of course is “pursuant to Committee Rule 17A.”

The House Ethics Committee uses parentheses like the Cubs and Nationals use relief pitchers.

Perry Mason may be better suited to untangle the legal bromides spouted by the Ethics Committee. But Collins himself is pretty clear about his plight.

“Nothing of substance is there at all,” the New York Republican said about allegations he broke House policies and may have violated federal law.

But the House’s quasi-official Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) -- which, to make matters more confusing, is different from the actual Ethics Committee -- doesn’t think so. The OCE charges Collins used his position in Congress to inappropriately help Innate Immunotherapeutics.

Collins sits on the board of the firm. The congressman also holds between $25 and $50 million in Innate stock. That makes Collins the company’s largest shareholder.

So is the House Ethics Committee actually investigating Collins?

Hard to tell.

Amid all of the “pursuants” and triplicate parentheticals, the Ethics Committee says it’s still evaluating things. Yet there is no official probe.

There’s a labyrinthine lexicon worth unpacking here.

The House Ethics Committee wasn’t actually called the “Ethics Committee” until a few years ago. Back then, it was the “Committee on Standards of Official Conduct.” Regardless of the name today, the Ethics Committee is the bona fide panel which sits in judgment of House members. In 2008, the House developed the independent watchdog known as the “Office of Congressional Ethics.” The House permits the OCE to entertain accusations of ethical breaches from practically anyone off the street. The OCE can then refer potential cases to the actual Ethics Committee and render findings. The Ethics Committee itself can consider or dismiss cases flagged by the OCE. The best signal denoting an official “ethics investigation” comes when the Ethics Committee launches an “investigative subcommittee” to probe an issue. It’s up to the full House to mete out major forms of punishment like reprimand, censure or even expulsion.

The House Ethics Committee didn’t commission an “investigative subcommittee” in the case of Collins. It just said it would conduct “further review.” By the way, that additional look-see “does not itself indicate that any violation has occurred.”

So, Collins finds himself in congressional limbo. He’s not officially under investigation. Yet Collins isn’t in the clear, either.

“I am disappointed in the Ethics Committee,” fumed Collins after the announcement Thursday. “Sometimes they leave these [investigations] open for years.”

An ethics review into the conduct of former Rep. Charlie Rangel, D-N.Y., started in 2008 – culminating in censure for the New York Democrat in late 2010. The House Ethics Committee also began an investigation into Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., in 2010. But it took until 2012 to clear Waters. The committee had to first navigate the Rangel issue. Then, when studying Waters’ conduct, the Ethics Committee had to dump two staffers who leaked information about the case to House Republicans.

No member likes any prodding by the Ethics Committee. But what lawmakers really hate is an inquest by the OCE.

Collins is no exception.

“They are a waste of taxpayer money and they accomplish nothing,” said Collins of the OCE. “I was exonerated on the original charges. They found two small nothings.”

The OCE noted that former Health and Human Services Secretary and former Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., refused to cooperate in its investigation. Collins says he doesn’t blame Price.

“A lot of folks ignore them,” said Collins of the OCE. “The OCE was what we tried to get rid of.”

What Collins refers to is an effort by House Republicans to ditch the OCE in January. The night before the launch of the 115th Congress, House GOPers voted to defang the outside watchdog. But within hours, Republicans faced a political maelstrom. The backlash forced the Republican brass to frantically intervene and deep-six the proposal to neuter the OCE.

“They have no authority,” ranted Collins about the OCE. “They instructed my attorney to break attorney-client privilege. That’s how bad these guys are.”

But after the January fiasco, the OCE isn’t going anywhere.

Collins may harbor contempt for the OCE. But that’s nothing compared to the enmity he reserves for Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y. Slaughter authored the STOCK Act which bars lawmakers from using their position for financial gain on the markets. Slaughter lodged the original complaint about Collins with the OCE.

“She’s a despicable human being,” seethed Collins when asked about Slaughter. “You don’t go after another member with fabricated allegations like she did.”

It’s rare for lawmakers to speak on background or off the record with such vehement hostility about a colleague. But rancor like this on the record is practically unheard of.

In a statement to Fox News, Slaughter called Collins’s actions “a disgrace,” adding that the congresswoman “doesn’t need to defend herself.”

Congressional ethics cases are frequently convoluted and challenging to explain. The most complex part may be deciphering Byzantine House ethics rules and parsing parenthetical profusions in committee news releases. Collins’ fate hangs in the balance. Little is clear about what’s next. The only things that aren’t in question are what Collins thinks about the Office of Congressional Ethics, the Ethics Committee and Louise Slaughter.

CLINTON BOOK ADDS VOTER ID LAWS TO LIST OF REASONS WHY SHE LOST

Klein, a former New York Times Magazine editor, has long been decried by liberal media watchdogs as a “conspiracy theorist,” while the Clintons and other Democrats have in the past denied some of his more sensational charges about the Clintons’ personal life and political feuds.

The Daily Mail first reported on Klein’s latest allegations.

According to Klein, tensions for the power couple mounted a month before the election, when he said Bill warned Hillary that she was “losing” and not “polling,” blaming her lack of visits to rust-belt states. But Hillary allegedly accused him of “not understanding modern data collection techniques,” and called him “out of touch.”

“Basically, she called him an old fool,” Klein said.

Klein said there has been “tension” between the two for years, including stretches where they haven’t talked – referencing the Monica Lewinsky scandal – but said this time may be different.

“They haven’t lived together for a long time. Once in a while, they get together for photo-ops,” Klein said. “… But they’ve been on the phone together for years and years talking about politics.”

Klein added: “But now that she lost, it looks to me that the Clinton dynasty is over, and they don’t have much to talk about anymore.”

The president, though, used the overnight decision to up pressure on Democrats to negotiate a ""fix"" to the ""imploding"" health care law.

""The Democrats ObamaCare is imploding. Massive subsidy payments to their pet insurance companies has stopped. Dems should call me to fix!"" he said in a pre-dawn tweet on Friday.

He added, ""ObamaCare is a broken mess. Piece by piece we will now begin the process of giving America the great HealthCare it deserves!""

The Justice Department took swift action, notifying a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., in connection with a related lawsuit that an upcoming Oct. 18 payment “will not occur.”

The decision is the latest effort in the president’s bid to ultimately “repeal and replace” what’s considered the signature legislation of his White House predecessor.

The White House said in a statement that the Department of Health and Human Services has determined there is no appropriation for so-called cost-sharing reduction payments to insurers under the ObamaCare law.

""We will discontinue these payments immediately,"" said acting HHS Secretary Eric Hargan and Medicare administrator Seema Verma.

Trump's decision was expected to rattle already-unsteady insurance marketplaces. The president has previously threatened to end the payments, which help reduce health insurance copays and deductibles for people with modest incomes, but remain under a legal cloud.

Trump has privately told at least one lawmaker that the payments may continue if a bipartisan deal is reached on heath care, The Wall Street Journal reported.

Pushback expected

The president's action will likely to trigger a lawsuit from state attorneys general, who contend the subsidies to insurers are fully authorized by federal law, and the president's position is reckless. Xavier Becerra, California’s attorney general, called the decision “sabotage,” and promised a lawsuit.

After the president’s intentions were disclosed, leading Democrats in Congress were quick to criticize the plan.

In a statement, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., predicted that Trump’s expected action would increase Americans’ health premiums by 20 percent or more.

""If these reports are true,” the Democrats said in the joint statement, referring to the president’s plans, “the president is walking away from the good-faith, bipartisan Alexander-Murray negotiations and risking the health care of millions of Americans.”

The Democrats were referring to bipartisan talks being led by Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., to seek a bipartisan agreement for funding ObamaCare subsidies and stabilizing health insurance markets.

Order to lower premiums

Earlier Thursday, Trump predicted that “millions and millions of people” would benefit from an executive order he signed Thursday to make lower-premium health insurance plans more widely available.

But the changes Trump hopes to bring about could take months or even longer. That's according to administration officials who outlined the order for reporters. The proposals may not be finalized in time to affect coverage for 2019, let alone next year.

White House domestic policy director Andrew Bremberg said that Trump still believes Congress needs to repeal and replace the Obama-era Affordable Care Act. The White House described the order as first steps.

Trump signed the order in the White House's Roosevelt Room surrounded by Vice President Mike Pence, members of his Cabinet and Congress.

Trump employed the executive order because the Republican-controlled Congress has been unable to pass a plan to repeal and replace ObamaCare.

Trump says the health care system ""will get better"" with his action, and the action will cost the federal government nothing.

The president says he still wants Congress repeal and replace the Obama health care law. But he says his order will give people more competition, more choices and lower premiums.

""There will be a debate,"" added McVay, EVP of content and Programming for Cumulus Media and Westwood One. ""We'll know more in a couple of weeks how it's going to change.""

The debate has already started; Caleb Keefer, the guitarist for the Josh Abbott Band, who performed at the Route 91 Harvest Festival hours before the shooting occurred, spoke out in favor of gun control on Monday.

""I've been a proponent of the 2nd amendment my entire life,"" Keefer wrote on Twitter. ""Until the events of last night. I cannot express how wrong I was...We need gun control RIGHT. NOW.""

Echoing Keefer's statements is the daughter of country music legend Johnny Cash, Rosanne Cash, a longtime advocate for gun control, who penned an op-ed urging her fellow musicians to take action.

Cash said the National Rifle Association (NRA) ""funds domestic terrorism"" and country music artists associated with its group ""NRA Country"" must speak up against it.

""For the past few decades, the National Rifle Association has increasingly nurtured an alliance with country music artists and their fans. You can see it in 'N.R.A.

About 57 percent of people enrolled in the marketplace receive cost-sharing reduction subsidies.

The Department of Health and Human Services determined that there is not appropriation for so-called cost-sharing reduction payments to insurers, the White House said.

“The bailout of insurance companies through these unlawful payments is yet another example of how the previous administration abused taxpayer dollars and skirted the law to prop up a broken system,” the White House said in a statement.

What are cost-sharing reduction payments?

As part of ObamaCare, cost-sharing reduction plans are special subsidies paid by the federal government that, in part, alleviate copays and deductibles for people with lower incomes who purchase insurance through the marketplace.

The savings could reduce a deductible of $3,500 to a few hundred dollars.

Healthcare.gov called these subsidies “extra savings.”

In order to qualify, people would have to be enrolled in the marketplace’s Silver plan – where a consumer pays “moderate” monthly premiums and “moderate” costs.

About 57 percent of people enrolled in the marketplace receive cost-sharing reduction subsidies.

What happens if these payments are stopped?

Halting the payments is expected to result in an increase in premiums next year as insurers will have to continue to provide the subsides to consumers, experts warned.

The nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that insurers would have to raise premiums by approximately 19 percent to make up for the loss of the government’s payments. Consumers who already receive tax credits that cover the cost of their premiums shouldn’t be affected by any expected rise in premiums.

TRUMP CLEARS THE WAY FOR OBAMACARE ALTERNATIVES IN NEW EXECUTIVE ORDER

The foundation also said that the premium increases for Silver plans would be lower in states with an expanded Medicaid program but higher in states without.

The Congressional Budget Office estimated that these payments cost about $7 billion in 2017 and will cost $16 billion by 2027.

In an early morning tweet, Trump urged congressional Democrats to work with his administration to fix the “imploding” ObamaCare.

“Massive subsidy payments to their pet insurance companies has stopped,” he said.

As part of her “Magic Mich” comedy show on Wednesday, Michelle Collins read aloud from emails she said Parker sent to a friend of hers who works for the “Divorce” star and her husband, Matthew Broderick.

In the emails that Collins, 36, claimed were written by Parker herself, the actress, 52, instructs staffers to refill a tiny 1.75-ounce container of Vaseline with a small spoon or knife for her children’s use. She stresses that the refill jar not be too big (so as to not clutter the house), and that the cutlery used to handle the Vaseline must be hand-washed using a paper towel followed by a cycle in the dishwasher.

She also requests that a bottle of face wash and Neutrogena body wash be continually replenished for her 14-year-old son, James Wilkie, in his personal shower.

FOX NEWS - President Donald Trump plans to halt payments to insurers under the Affordable Care Act, the 2010 health care law also known as ObamaCare.

It’s the latest effort in the president’s bid to ultimately “repeal and replace” what’s considered the signature legislation of his White House predecessor.

Word of Trump’s latest plan came from two people familiar with the decision, who spoke to the Associated Press. They requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

The White House said in a statement that the Department of Health and Human Services has determined there is no appropriation for cost-sharing reduction payments to insurers under the Obamacare law.

Trump's decision was expected to rattle already-unsteady insurance marketplaces. The president has previously threatened to end the payments, which help reduce health insurance copays and deductibles for people with modest incomes, but remain under a legal cloud.

Trump has privately told at least one lawmaker that the payments may continue if a bipartisan deal is reached on heath care, The Wall Street Journal reported.

Pushback expected

The president's action will likely to trigger a lawsuit from state attorneys general, who contend the subsidies to insurers are fully authorized by federal law, and the president's position is reckless. Xavier Becerra, California’s attorney general, called the decision “sabotage,” and promised a lawsuit.","Trump to Halt ObamaCare Subsidies, Legal Fight Likely",http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/10/13/trump-halt-obamacare-subsidies-legal-fight-likely#commenting

The two were also expecting their first child together when Austin suffered the severe medical complication that his doctors blamed on energy drinks, wrote Brianna in a post that has since been removed from Facebook.

“Being pregnant is supposed to be one of the most amazing journeys you will ever embark on,” Brianna wrote. “You're creating a new life. You are experiencing unconditional love for someone you have not even met.”

Austin's accident happened when Brianna was nine months pregnant, she wrote. She said she went to bed, then woke up to a life-changing scene.

“I still remember my mother in law waking me up that morning. ‘Austin had an accident,’"" she said. ""All I knew was that my husband was in the hospital. The worst part? I didn't know why.""

Brianna wrote that her husband had suffered a brain hemorrhage, and says doctors blamed it on “excessive energy drink consumption” after running a toxicology screen and ruling out drugs.

Austin was already in surgery by the time Brianna and family arrived at the hospital. It wasn’t until nearly five hours later that she got to see her husband, Brianna wrote.

“The next day was round two of brain surgery. Following this were strokes, seizures, swelling, and more things we weren't prepared for. There was a moment, sitting by his hospital bed, just praying he would be okay, that I knew I would never give up on him. No matter how messy our life would become. I was going to be by his side through all of it.""

Judging by photos shared of Austin and Brianna shared on Endres Photography's Facebook page — which, too, appear to have been removed from the site — doctors had removed part of Austin's skull during his surgeries.

Brianna, meanwhile, was still unsure of her husband's fate. ""After two weeks of living in a hospital, wondering if he would survive or be taken from us, [the family] made our way back home. The time had come for me to deliver our baby.”

Austin was still in the hospital when Brianna delivered their baby, but she said that “a beautiful miracle happened as I delivered our son. Austin woke up.”

“I went about a week without seeing him. I thought about him every day. I cried as I looked at my child who looked just like his daddy. When the baby was only a week old, I left him with my in-laws. I knew I needed to see Austin. I needed to tell him that our baby was here,” she said.

Some may argue players could have found a better venue to highlight the true challenges within the justice system without seeming to disrespect the flag, yet owners backed their right under the first amendment.

The owners and Roger Goodell did not expect the fiery fan blowback. Outraged conservatives perceived kneeling as an encroachment on the principles near and dear to not only them but a majority of Americans. Respecting country, respecting America’s lineage, the military and their families are collectively exemplified by the flag. But, owners are proving to be hypocrites by not being true to the value of social justice nor patriotism and instead have one focus: the dollar.

The NFL must have had some foresight into the importance of the national anthem and the related conduct displayed on the field before kickoff. NFL national anthem policy is on pages A62-63 of the league’s rulebook. It states: 'The National Anthem must be played prior to every NFL game, and all players must be on the sideline for the National Anthem. During the National Anthem, players on the field and bench area should stand at attention, face the flag, hold helmets in their left hand and refrain from talking.'

Because the NFL was bleeding cash on the field, the owners and Roger Goodell had to call an audible and scramble away from their players.

Ignoring their own league rules caused conservative organizations, pundits, media, and activists to call for an NFL boycott. Football fans and businesses rallied, burning jerseys and season tickets, canceling their Direct TV Football packages, not buying tickets, merchandise, and playing smash mouth themselves by turning the channel.

Due to the costly backlash, according to the Wall Street Journal, the National Football League’s owners will discuss next week whether to unilaterally change league policy and require players to stand during the national anthem. If players refuse to rise up, they could face disciplinary action by the league or by the team. The NFL may change the rules of conduct in direct response to their fans who are rejecting politics on the field and hitting them where it hurts them most—their Gucci wallets.

Because the NFL was bleeding cash on the field, the owners and Roger Goodell had to call an audible and scramble away from their players. Initially, they believed the politics of social justice was ""the right thing to do” on behalf of their players and to support the broader ideas the protests were about.

But, kneeling players proved to kill ticket and jersey sales and viewership -- and their positions are viewed by many fans as divisive and disrespectful -- negatively impacting the NFL brand and profits. So social justice and the fear of losing support of the players had to take a back seat.

It’s also clear this ""juke"" move by the NFL is not one based on patriotism, because the original position of the NFL, as written in their rulebook, was to respect America's anthem -- a principle they happily discarded until faced with lost money and ratings.

Conservative fans and media are claiming victory. Patriotism seems to sell and ultimately forced owners and Roger Goodell to expose the hypocrisy of their real motives and priorities -- which had nothing to do with the importance of supporting social justice, or even patriotism, but everything to do with profit.",The NFL and its owners salute one flag: The dollar,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/12/nfl-and-its-owners-salute-one-flag-dollar.html

Along with a bizarre Energizing Comfort feature that uses lights, scents, massaging seats and electronic music in an attempt to chill you out or revitalize you (seriously), the full-size sedan debuts the newest version of Mercedes-Benz’s Intelligent Drive collection of semi-autonomous driver aids.

Where to begin?

Intelligent Drive has pedestrian and bicyclist detection system and can autonomously brake for either that gets in front of the car if you don’t. It also monitors the lines on the road and steers itself between them, even when your hands are off the steering wheel. It will do that at both highway and around town speeds for up to a minute at a time before it asks you to check in by touching the wheel.

Tapping into both of those abilities, it can anticipate that you might want to swerve around a person you’re heading toward and helps you turn the steering wheel if you do. Mercedes actually developed the system to make an evasive maneuver like this all by itself, but tests showed that drivers caught off guard were instinctively grabbing the wheel and messing up the move. Humans have trust issues, apparently.

It can change lanes on the highway, however, but only if you ask it to. Just hit the turn signal stalk and it uses sensors to check the blind spot and 80 meters beyond for approaching traffic, then sidles over if the coast is clear. If it’s not, it will give the other cars 10 seconds to move out of the way before it gives up trying.

Regardless of what lane it’s in, the S-Class doesn’t wander around too much as it cruises along, but doesn’t stay locked in the center as well as Cadillac’s similar Super Cruise does. It also disengages too often for you to get completely comfortable relying on it, and that’s partially intentional. It’s marketed as a comfort feature that makes driving easier and safer, but isn’t supposed to do all the work. Especially since obeying stop signs and red lights is still up to you.

Speed limits are a different story. Using mapping data, Intelligent Drive knows if the cruise control is set too high for the road ahead and will automatically slow you down to an appropriate speed. When engaged, this works on off ramps, twisty country roads and traffic circles, even if you’re manually steering. You can go for miles at a variety of speeds without ever touching the gas or brake if you don’t need to stop for intersections, or any surprise obstacles in the road.

The S-Class (which runs from $90,895 to well over $200,000) will actually make it less likely that you’ll encounter any of the latter. It has a car-to-car communication system that networks all of the Mercedes vehicles in an area that are equipped with the feature so they can send each other warning messages about road conditions.

If you hit a patch of ice and the stability control engages, for instance, it will mark that spot and alert any other cars with the feature as they approach the location. You can even drop your own thumbtack on the map if you pass an accident, a tree blocking the road, or some other danger. It works similar to Waze, and there’s nothing stopping you from using it to note the position of certain black and white cars parked on the side of the road, too.

The communications are sent over a cellular network, not directly, so cars can’t give each other their precise location to help keep from running into each other, but that’s the long-term plan behind this concept and pretty much a necessity to fill the roads with fully-autonomous cars one day.

The S-Class isn’t one of those, but it’s getting closer.",The 2018 Mercedes-Benz S-Class is a very smart car,https://www.foxnews.com/auto/2017/10/12/2018-mercedes-benz-s-class-is-very-smart-car.html

In a string of fiery tweets, McGowan said she repeatedly warned Amazon about “HW” and “begged” the company not to work with the movie mogul but was told by an unnamed studio executive that “it hadn’t been proven.”

The actress also alleged Amazon Studios killed a show she planned to write and direct after she heard “a Weinstein bailout was in the works.”

“I forcefully begged studio head to do the right thing,” McGowan tweeted. “I was ignored. Deal was done. Amazon won a dirty Oscar.”

Amazon said the company is ""reviewing our options for our projects we have with the Weinstein Company.""

Meanwhile, an Amazon rep told Variety and TheWrap Thursday night that Amazon Studios head Roy Price was a ""on leave of absence effective immediately.""

Price's reported suspension came after Isa Hackett, a producer for Amazon’s “The Man in the High Castle,” told The Hollywood Reporter that he repeatedly propositioned her at a company party in July 2015.

Hackett said that Price started making lewd comments during a cab ride to the party -- and continued even after she told him she's a lesbian with a wife and children, the magazine reported. At one point, Hackett claimed that Price told her: ""You will love my d--k.""

Hackett claimed Price did not stop once they arrived at the party and even approached her and loudly said “Anal sex!” in her ear.

Hackett reported the incidents to studio executives who brought in investigators to look further into the allegations, The Hollywood Reporter added. Hackett said she was never made aware of the outcome but also said she never saw Price at any more events.

Many celebrities have come forward in recent days to share their stories about inappropriate behavior in the industry.

Last week, The New York Times reported Weinstein had been paying off women who accused him of sexual harassment for decades. On Tuesday, the New Yorker released an expose revealing Weinstein allegedly raped three women. Many actresses, including Gwyneth Paltrow, Ashley Judd, Kate Beckinsale and Angelina Jolie have spoken out about their experiences with Weinstein’s alleged inappropriate behavior.

Our Cooke Scholars prove every day that this is nonsense.","In many parts of the world, if you are born poor you will almost certainly stay poor for your entire life. You don’t get the chance to get a good education or go on to a well-paid career. You struggle – picking crops, mopping floors, mowing lawns, waiting on tables, or in other low-paying jobs, barely making ends meet.

But in America – known the world over as the Land of Opportunity – upward mobility is the national ideal. It doesn’t always happen, of course. But just the possibility draws immigrants from the world over to our shores – my own parents included. For most, education is the key that enables them or their children to break out of poverty and enter the middle class or go higher, as I and millions of others have been able to do.

For this reason, providing equal educational opportunity for all is vitally important – not just for students who can get college degrees that transform their lives, but for America. We need an educated workforce to keep our economy and our nation strong. We need to keep the American Dream alive.

A stereotype persists that – to put it crudely – poor kids are dumb. Cooke Scholars prove every day that this is nonsense. They are some of the smartest and most capable people on our planet. All they needed was a helping hand and financial aid to succeed.

One immigrant who achieved the American Dream and helped thousands more young people do so as well was Jack Kent Cooke. Born in Canada in 1912, he never had the chance to go to college, leaving high school during the Great Depression to help support his struggling family. He went from selling encyclopedias door to door, to leading a band, to being a runner on the floor of the Toronto Stock Exchange, to working as a salesman, to managing radio stations.

Cooke kept working his way up, becoming a part-owner of radio stations, newspapers and a magazine, and then buying a minor league baseball team in Toronto and other businesses. He immigrated to the United States in 1960 and became an even more successful businessman and owner of sports teams, including the Los Angeles Lakers, the Los Angeles Kings and the Washington Redskins.

The Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, which I now head as executive director, has awarded $175 million in scholarships to more than 2,300 high-achieving, low-income students from 8th grade through graduate school, along with comprehensive counseling and other support services. The foundation has also provided over $97 million in grants to organizations that serve such students.

Every year, the Cooke Foundation finds absolutely brilliant students who have overcome incredible obstacles and gives them scholarships. Some of our Cooke Scholars have been homeless, have gone hungry, have been undocumented, have suffered from serious illnesses, have been kicked out of their homes after announcing they were LGBT, have been teenage parents, and have faced other big challenges.

Yet Cooke Scholars have graduated with distinction from some of the top colleges and universities in the world. Some have become physicians, created nonprofit organizations to help others in need, become medical researchers working to prevent and cure diseases, launched successful businesses, become professors, started charter schools, written books, and taken on many other important rules. How sad it would have been if they never had the chance to get a college education and instead spent their lives in dead-end jobs.

Yet a stereotype persists that – to put it crudely – poor kids are dumb. Our Cooke Scholars prove every day that this is nonsense. They are some of the smartest and most capable people on our planet. All they needed was a helping hand and financial aid to succeed.

What’s lacking isn’t brainpower among those with low incomes. What’s lacking is the opportunity to get a higher education and the money to pay for it.

But we should be embarrassed that millions of low-income young people who do these things and are enormously talented hit a cash ceiling when they try to better themselves with a college degree. They should not be denied equal educational opportunity simply because they were born into families of modest means. If given the chance, they can make our nation proud.","America is the land of opportunity, and should be proud of it",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/08/america-is-land-opportunity-and-should-be-proud-it.html

Under New York law, making someone engage in oral sex by physical force or the threat of it is a first-degree criminal sexual act.","Carrie Stevens, who was Playboy’s Playmate of the Month in June 1997, said in an interview that famed filmmaker Oliver Stone once grabbed one of her breasts at a party.

The New York Daily News reported Thursday that Stevens was at a party honoring Stone more than 20 years ago. She said Stone walked up to her, “reached out and … honked it like a horn.”

“He was really cocky, had this big grin on his face like he was going to get away with something,” she told the paper. She was 22 at the time.

Stevens told the paper that others saw the incident, but nobody said anything because “that’s what’s going on in Hollywood. That’s why things have to change.”

The report said her accusations come after Stone was asked about allegations leveled against Harvey Weinstein.

“I’m a believer that you wait until this thing gets to trial,” Stone told the Hollywood Reporter.

Some 30 women — including actresses Angelina Jolie, Ashley Judd and Gwyneth Paltrow — have spoken out recently to say Weinstein had sexually harassed or sexually assaulted them. Rose McGowan, who has long suggested that Weinstein sexually assaulted her, tweeted Thursday that ""HW raped me.""

The initials were an apparent reference to Weinstein, and the Hollywood Reporter said the actress confirmed to them that she was referring to the disgraced film mogul. The New York Times earlier reported that Weinstein paid a financial settlement of $100,000 to McGowan in 1997 over an incident in a hotel room at the Sundance Film Festival in Utah.

""Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein,"" Weinstein's representative Sallie Hofmeister said Thursday.

In an expose in the New Yorker magazine, a former actress, Lucia Evans, said Weinstein forced her to perform oral sex in 2004 when she was a college student.

At least one other unnamed woman said she was raped by Weinstein, but the article did not disclose when or where it happened. A third woman, actress Asia Argento, told the magazine that Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her in 1997 at a hotel in France.

Under New York law, making someone engage in oral sex by physical force or the threat of it is a first-degree criminal sexual act. There's no legal time limit for bringing charges.

In his speech, Trump will ask Congress to amend or replace legislation that currently requires him to certify Iranian compliance every 90 days.
Officials have said that Trump hates the requirement more than the nuclear deal itself because it forces him to take a position every three months on what he has repeatedly denounced as the worst deal in American history.
American allies, who have pressed the White House to remain in the nuclear accord, will be closely watching the president's address.
The Europeans, along with the other parties, Iran, Russia and China, have ruled out reopening the deal.","President Donald Trump will say Friday the Iran nuclear deal is no longer in U.S. national security interests, but he won't withdraw from the landmark 2015 accord or immediately re-impose sanctions against Tehran, according to U.S. officials and outside advisers to the administration.

Trump's speech from the White House will outline specific faults he finds in the pact but will also focus on an array of Iran's troubling non-nuclear activities, four officials and advisers said. Those include Tehran's ballistic missile program, support for Syrian President Bashar Assad, Lebanon's Hezbollah movement and other groups that destabilize the region, including in Yemen, human rights abuses and cyber warfare.

In his speech, Trump will notify Congress that he is ""decertifying"" the deal, arguing that while Iran may be complying with the letter of the agreement, the accord itself is not sufficient to be in U.S. interests.

The decertification will not pull the U.S. out of the agreement or re-impose sanctions, but it will kick those matters to Congress. U.S. lawmakers will then have 60 days to decide whether to snap the sanctions back into place or modify the legislation that governs U.S. participation in the deal.

Under current U.S. law, Trump faces a Sunday deadline to notify Congress whether Iran is complying with the accord that was negotiated over 18 months by the Obama administration and determine if it remains a national security priority. Although Trump will allow that Iran is living up to the letter of the agreement, he will make the case that the deal is fatally flawed and that its non-nuclear behavior violates the spirit of the regional stability it was intended to encourage, the officials and advisers said.

The officials and advisers, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly preview the speech, said Trump will not call for a re-imposition of nuclear sanctions on Tehran. He will instead urge lawmakers to codify tough new requirements for Tehran to continue to benefit from the sanctions relief that it won in exchange for curbing its atomic program, they said. And he'll announce his long-anticipated intent to impose sanctions on portions of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps by designating them terrorist organization under an existing executive order, according to the officials and advisers.

""The reckless behavior of the Iranian regime, and the IRGC in particular, poses one of the most dangerous threats to the interests of the United States and to regional stability,"" the White House said in a statement released ahead of the speech. The statement, which did not reveal Trump's decision, denounced the Obama administration for its ""myopic focus on Iran's nuclear program to the exclusion of the regime's many other malign activities"" and said the same ""mistakes"" would not be repeated.

""The Trump administration's Iran policy will address the totality of these threats from and malign activities by the Government of Iran and will seek to bring about a change in the Iranian's regime's behavior,"" it said.

Ali Larijani, Iran's parliament speaker, said Friday that any U.S. move against a nuclear deal with Iran would be an ""insult"" to the United Nations because the U.N. had given the deal its blessing.

He added that any revision of the deal would allow Iran to take its own actions, and warned that the U.S. move could destabilize the international situation.

""We will continue to adhere to our obligations ... for as long as other parties observe the agreement,"" he said on a visit to Russia.

In his speech, Trump will ask Congress to amend or replace legislation that currently requires him to certify Iranian compliance every 90 days. Officials have said that Trump hates the requirement more than the nuclear deal itself because it forces him to take a position every three months on what he has repeatedly denounced as the worst deal in American history. That frequency has also irritated aides who have complained that they are spending inordinate amounts of time on certification at the expense of other issues.

White House aides had initially sought a venue for Trump's address that would project American power and determination. The shuttered former Iranian embassy in Washington was briefly considered before being deemed inappropriate. Officials also considered the Iwo Jima Marine Corps Memorial, which was ruled out because it is currently being renovated. The Diplomatic Reception Room at the White House was eventually agreed.

American allies, who have pressed the White House to remain in the nuclear accord, will be closely watching the president's address. Trump wants to impress on the European parties to the accord — Germany, France and Britain — the importance of fixing what he sees as flaws in the nuclear accord and addressing malign behavior not covered in the agreement.

The Europeans, along with the other parties, Iran, Russia and China, have ruled out reopening the deal. But some, notably France, have signaled a willingness to tackle unresolved issues in supplementary negotiations. Among those issues are the expiration of several restrictions on advanced nuclear activity under so-called ""sunset clauses"" that will allow Iran to begin ramping up its enrichment capabilities after 10 years, the end of an arms embargo and the eventual easing of demands for a halt to its missile program.

In the speech, Trump hopes to ""recruit"" the Europeans into joining his broad strategy, particularly by punishing the Revolutionary Guard, which he and his national security team believe is fomenting instability, violence and extremism throughout the Middle East and beyond, according to one official.

In anticipation of Trump's announcements, Republican legislators have drawn up a new version of the law replacing the current 90-day timetable with ""semi-annual"" certifications, according to drafts seen by the Associated Press this week.

Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Bob Corker said in a statement on Friday that his panel had agreed to fresh certification criteria to include items that are also the province of the U.N. nuclear watchdog and require the U.S. intelligence community to determine if Iran is carrying out illicit activity in facilities to which the International Atomic Energy Agency has not had access.

The certification would also demand that the intelligence community produce judgments on Iranian behavior not covered by the nuclear deal, including missile testing and development, backing for Hezbollah and Assad and threats to Israel and the Mideast more broadly, according to the drafts.

Then my thoughts shifted and I began reflecting on the chaos, both natural and man-made, that has affected our nation in recent days.
I affirm the greatness of God and yet, at the same time wonder as the condition of the world.","The term “scorched earth” is usually one we associate with a military policy that targets anything that may be useful to the enemy. As a resident of Southern California, more specifically, Anaheim Hills, the term has recently taken on a different meaning.

Earlier this week, my wife and I were given 30 minutes to evacuate our home of 12 years. To make matters more complicated, I was en route to the airport when I received the text from my wife asking, ""What do you want me to pack in the car? I have to leave in minutes.""

My mind raced trying to determine what was important and irreplaceable. All I could think of was family photos and the flag that draped my dad's coffin at Arlington National Cemetery. In the midst of the chaos and disbelief, our friends and neighbors rallied to assist us in our time of need.

My thoughts shifted and I began reflecting on the chaos, both natural and man-made, that has affected our nation in recent days. I began to wonder if I had become numb to all the tragedy. I don't even have time to mourn the fact that we had to evacuate our home.

The next day, I found myself sitting in another airport trying to process everything that had happened in the past 24 hours. At first I reflected on our kind neighbors and how even in the worst of times we can see the good in humanity and love of God. Then my thoughts shifted and I began reflecting on the chaos, both natural and man-made, that has affected our nation in recent days. I began to wonder if I had become numb to all the tragedy. I don't even have time to mourn the fact that we had to evacuate our home.

Thinking about all of this, I found myself asking, “Where is God?” As a nation, we are facing an increase in lawlessness and what appears to me, an unusual number of natural disasters.

It’s a natural human response to ask questions for things we can’t understand or process. I get it; moral evil can be explained by the free will of man but much of the things we face (cancer, death, hurricanes and fires) are not a result of our free will. So where do I go from here? Either God or nature (which He created) must cause these physical evils. But these things seem incompatible with an all-loving, all-powerful God.

I'm left with what I call a ""divine tension."" I affirm the greatness of God and yet, at the same time wonder as the condition of the world.

Indeed, the Seoul virus is less severe than another form of the hantavirus, called the Sin Nombre virus, according to the CDC.","A mother and her daughter in Tennessee were infected with a virus rarely seen in the United States, and the culprit seems to be pet rats.

The two women tested positive for the Seoul virus, according to a new report, published today (Oct. 12) by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The Seoul virus is part of the Hantavirus family, a group of viruses that typically infect rodents.

The CDC reported in January that there was an outbreak of the virus among rat breeders and owners in Illinois and Wisconsin; that same month, the Tennessee Department of Health was notified of an individual with pet rats from one of the Illinois breeders with infected rats, according to the new report.

In fact, the owner of the pet rats, an 18-year-old, had gotten sick in December 2016 with an ""unspecified viral illness,"" the researchers said. She recovered fully from the virus without treatment. A test on a preserved sample of her blood that had been drawn when she was sick revealed that she had been infected with the Seoul virus.

The teenager didn't let health officials test her pet rats for the virus, but the officials presumed that the rodents also had the virus. As such, the officials recommended that the rats be euthanized. Once again, the teen refused. In response, the Tennessee Department of Health prohibited the teen from removing the rats from her home, essentially quarantining the pets. In addition, they educated the teen and her family about the best ways to avoid infection, which include avoiding contact with rodent urine, droppings, saliva and nesting material, according to the report.

But in April, the teen's 38-year-old mother got sick, too. She went to the emergency room with symptoms including a very high fever of 104.5 degrees Fahrenheit (40.3 degrees Celsius), shortness of breath, fatigue and lack of appetite, the report said. A blood test revealed that she had the Seoul virus. The mother told doctors that she had cleaned up rodent droppings from a bathtub about three weeks before she got sick.

The Seoul virus

The Seoul virus infects brown Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus), which are found worldwide, according to the report. The virus can spread easily between rats, and can also be passed from rats to humans, according to the CDC. As of January, 17 confirmed cases of the Seoul virus in people in the U.S. have been linked to rats from breeders in Illinois, the report said.

However, the virus cannot spread from human to human, according to the CDC.

Severe infections with the Seoul virus can cause a disease called hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, which includes symptoms such as internal bleeding and kidney problems, the CDC says. Most people who are infected with the Seoul virus, however, experience mild or even no symptoms, and the death rate for the disease is approximately 1 or 2 percent, the CDC says.

Indeed, the Seoul virus is less severe than another form of the hantavirus, called the Sin Nombre virus, according to the CDC. The Sin Nombre virus is spread by the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), and it causes a condition called hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. These infections can cause severe breathing difficulties that require hospitalization, and the death rate for the disease is about 38 percent, the CDC says.

I would have missed out on so much if I had been given – and had accepted – the option of assisted suicide.
On top of that, the legalization of assisted suicide injects government and profit-driven insurance companies into everyone’s end-of-life decisions.
Legislators across the nation of all political persuasions are recognizing that assisted suicide is bad policy and puts people like me at risk.
But the truth is, assisted suicide affects everyone.","I’m thankful I don’t live in a state like Oregon, where assisted suicide is legal. When I was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer and told I would probably be dead in four months, I went in an instant from living the American Dream with my wife and son to living a nightmare. In that moment of depression, I might have chosen to end my life.

After a seizure sent me to the hospital, the neurosurgeon told me I had a brain tumor known as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and that the tumor was inoperable. In fact, three different doctors told me there was nothing that they could do.

The news was overwhelmingly depressing. As a United States Marine Corps veteran of the Iraq War, I could have lost my life on a faraway battlefield serving my country. Thankfully I survived, but I had now received a death sentence at home.

With the support of my family, I chose to fight the cancer. I have had some great success with an experimental, cutting-edge treatment and am still alive three years after I was told I had only a few months to live.

Not everyone is so lucky to have the support I do. Since my diagnosis of terminal brain cancer my wife and I welcomed our second son into the world. I would have missed out on so much if I had been given – and had accepted – the option of assisted suicide.

Assisted suicide laws require a prognosis of six months or less to live, but how can we let our life-and-death decisions rest on these prognoses, when even the most experienced doctors are often wrong? My own experience reveals how tragic that could turn out to be.

We also know from the 2016 Oregon Health Report that in Oregon, which 20 years ago became the first state to make assisted suicide legal, only 4 percent of patients considering ending their lives were referred for psychological evaluation.

Yet a 2008 study, published in the peer-reviewed medical journal The BMJ, revealed that 25 percent of patients requesting assisted suicide suffered from major depressive disorder. These numbers suggest that people with mental illness could well be prescribed a death-too-soon, instead of the treatment they deserve.

On top of that, the legalization of assisted suicide injects government and profit-driven insurance companies into everyone’s end-of-life decisions. Just in the last year, more cases have surfaced of patients being denied coverage for care, showing how legalizing assisted suicide results in more abuse and less choice.

Take, for example, Stephanie Packer, a California mother of four suffering from a serious case of scleroderma, a chronic connective tissue disease. She reported that her insurance company denied her coverage for chemotherapy treatment but would pay for her to kill herself.

Then there is Dr. Brian Callister, a Nevada physician who asked insurance medical directors to approve lifesaving, curative treatments for a patient in California and another in Oregon – two states that have legalized assisted suicide. Callister’s requests were denied, and the patients were offered coverage for suicide drugs instead.

People are starting to realize the threat that assisted suicide poses. Though an onslaught of new bills has been introduced, 23 states have rejected laws designed to legalize assisted suicide this year.

And states like Alabama and Ohio recently enacted laws to strengthen the prohibition of assisted suicide. Legislators across the nation of all political persuasions are recognizing that assisted suicide is bad policy and puts people like me at risk.

Some vulnerable populations, like people with disabilities and terminal illness, are at more immediate risk to be adversely affected by the legalization of assisted suicide. But the truth is, assisted suicide affects everyone.

It could blow much faster than previously expected, potentially wiping out life as we know it.

According to National Geographic, the researchers, Hannah Shamloo and Christy Till, analyzed minerals in fossilized ash from the most recent eruption. What they discovered surprised them – the changes in temperature and composition only took a few decades, much faster than the centuries previously thought.

“We expected that there might be processes happening over thousands of years preceding the eruption,” said Till said in an interview with the New York Times.

NASA WANTS TO PREVENT THE YELLOWSTONE SUPERVOLCANO FROM DESTROYING THE US

The supervolcano last erupted about 630,000 years ago, according to National Geographic. Prior to that, it was 1.3 million years ago, per a report from ZME Science.

If another eruption were to take place, the researchers found that the supervolcano would spare almost nothing in its wrath. It would shoot 2,500 times more material than Mount St. Helen did in 1980 and could cover most of the continguous U.S. in ash, possibly putting the planet into a volcanic winter.

The new discovery, which was presented in August after a previous version of the study, comes after another study in 2011 which found the magma reservoir in Yellowstone has moved considerably, gaining about 10 inches in seven years.

""It's an extraordinary uplift, because it covers such a large area and the rates are so high,"" the University of Utah's Bob Smith, an expert in Yellowstone volcanism, told National Geographic six years ago.

'UFO' SPOTTED OVER YELLOWSTONE VOLCANO?

Despite the concerns about an eruption happening relatively soon, Shamloo told The Times that more research needed to be done before a definite conclusion could be drawn.

In June, the supervolcano was hit with more than 400 earthquakes in one week, though researchers cautioned it was nothing nothing to be alarmed about.

For its part, NASA is working on a way to prevent the supervolcano from destroying mankind, including trying to cool the magma before it spills over.","Yellowstone supervolcano could blow faster than thought, destroy all of mankind",http://www.foxnews.com/science/2017/10/12/yellowstone-supervolcano-could-blow-faster-than-thought-destroy-all-mankind.html

Except when the cameras were about to roll, and media gathered in the building to talk to him, Campos reportedly bolted, and, as of early Friday morning, it wasn't immediately clear where he was.

Little is known about Campos, with few pictures to emerge of the security guard and no apparent online footprint surfacing to provide details about one of the central figures in the mass shooting.

SPFPA President David L.

MGM Resorts issued a statement Thursday to “correct some of the misinformation that has been reported.""

The agent, Dustin Blount, testified Thursday in the trial of Quinton Tellis in Batesville, Mississippi. Tellis has pleaded not guilty to killing 19-year-old Jessica Chambers in December 2014.

Prosecutors say Tellis thought he suffocated Chambers during sex in her car, and then used gasoline to set her and the vehicle ablaze along a road in Courtland.

Blount said Tellis told him during an interview that he was returning to his Courtland home from buying the card in Batesville when he saw vehicles with emergency lights. He also said Tellis acknowledged having sex with Chambers once, but he didn't mention an exact date.

Tellis, who was friends with Chambers, could receive life in prison without parole if convicted of capital murder at trial in Batesville, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) south of Memphis, Tennessee. A firefighter has testified a severely-burned Chambers looked like a zombie as she walked down the road near her burning car the evening of Dec. 6, 2014. She died hours later at a Memphis hospital.

His lawyer says he's falsely accused. Firefighters who treated Chambers testified they heard her say someone named Eric or Derek set her on fire. Prosecutors say she could have been trying to say Tellis, but damage to her mouth and throat didn't allow her to speak clearly.

Agent Blount said a photo taken from a surveillance video from a Fred's pharmacy shows Tellis, who had a dirt bike, buying a pre-paid debit card in Batesville, about 5 miles (8 kilometers) from the tree-lined road embankment in Courtland where her car was found. The photo had a time stamp of 8:26 p.m.

Authorities say Chambers was found on the road by a passing motorist shortly after 8 p.m. Prosecutors contend Tellis, 29, has lied about his whereabouts that night. Blount said Tellis told him he found out about Chambers' situation from someone at a convenience store located just steps from his house.

But during questioning by defense attorney Alton Peterson, Blount acknowledged he did not try to confirm the time stamp was accurate.

Blount also said Tellis told him 11 days after she was found burned that he erased all communications with Chambers from his cellphone.

Also Thursday, prosecutors used witness testimony from a burn doctor and an investigator to help discredit the defense's theory that someone named Eric or Derek may have burned Chambers. Dr. William Hickerson oversaw Chambers' treatment at the hospital. He said she suffered so much damage to her mouth, throat and chest that she would have had trouble clearly saying words.

Chambers had third-degree burns on most of her body, Hickerson said. Soot was found on her tongue and in the back of her throat, and her lips did not work properly, the doctor said.

Pointing at graphic photos of a burned Chambers displayed for the jury, Hickerson said the scorched skin on her chest became tight like leather and she could not speak correctly because of lack of air.

""You cannot enunciate any of those words that you want to say"" with such serious burns, Hickerson said.

Defense attorney Darla Palmer challenged Hickerson, who acknowledged that Chambers' injuries could have worsened from the time she spoke with firefighters to when she arrived at the hospital two hours after she was found. Hickerson also acknowledged he was not at the scene and did not hear Chambers speak there.

Maj. Barry Thompson of the Panola County Sheriff's Department testified investigators interviewed about 15 people named Eric or Derek and none were identified as suspects.

WARNING: THIS VIDEO CONTAINS EXPLICIT LANGUAGE

Gainesville Police spokesman Ben Tobias confirmed to the media outlet that an investigation was pending.

Jessica Stipe, 38, posted the video of the incident on Facebook and wrote that she asked Gallogly how much longer she had to wait to be seen. Stipe said she made an appointment at 6:30 p.m. and by 7:45 p.m., she was still waiting.

“By 7:45 was not seen still in severe pain and throwing up in the trash can. All they had me do was pee in a cup to see if I'm pregnant,” Stipe wrote.

The woman said she asked for her co-pay money back so she could rest at home but Gallogly became furious that she asked to be reimbursed. Her daughter caught the interaction on video.

The video showed Stipe asking for her money back and Gallogly telling her that she would be waiting longer if she had gone to an emergency room.

“Are you kidding me?” the doctor said. “We’ve already been working on you. We’ve done a urine test on you. I’ve seen you.”

Stipe said she was “miserable” and wanted to go home before the doctor replied: “Then fine. Get your money and get the hell out.”

Stipe’s daughter, who was filming, was heard saying: “Mom, I got it on video, it doesn’t matter. What’s your name (doctor)?”

Gallogly appeared to grab the girl’s phone after she asked him the question. Stipe claimed the doctor also shoved her daughter.

However, Gallogly appeared to have a different story, the Miami Herald reported. The clinic posted a statement from Gallogly who apologized and told his side of the story.

“Ms. Stipe had been increasingly belligerent and abusive to the office staff, cursing them and threatening them with violence, because she was unwell and had been waiting to be seen by me for more than an hour,” Gallogly wrote.

“I went to the front desk only because after Ms. Stipe received her refund, she refused to leave the office, and continued her abusive behavior towards staff.”

“At the end of the events, I most regrettably lost my temper, and spoke to the women in a most unprofessional manner,” Gallogly continued. “I make no excuses for my unacceptable behavior.

Tens of millions of Americans came together and elected the ultimate political outsider Donald Trump president of the United States in 2016. This was a continuation of the message sent by voters in 2010 and again in 2014 that Washington, D.C., is broken.

Now nine months into the reform-minded Trump administration, that feeling of frustration is palpable and growing with each day. It’s growing because Republican leaders in Congress can’t seem to get their act together to keep their promises to the American people and pass the president’s conservative reform agenda. The Republican majority is Congress is not enormous but it’s large enough to pass the big ticket items that virtually every member of the House and Senate caucuses has supported and campaigned on over the years.

Republicans across the board have been in agreement on the need to repeal and replace the disaster that is ObamaCare for seven years. Now it appears that senators like John McCain would rather stab their constituents in the back than make good on a campaign promise. John McCain doesn’t like President Trump and everyone knows it, but he let his spite get in the way of doing what is right for America. Senator McCain’s decision to oppose Graham-Cassidy and kill Republican health care efforts smacks of a typical career Washington politician who has become a poster boy for congressional term limits. The American people are sick and tired of politicians who say one thing and do another.

I sincerely hope that history does not repeat itself with tax reform. Republican Senator Bob Corker has long supported tax reform for his overtaxed constituents in Tennessee. His constituents sent him to Washington to now deliver on the conservative agenda that eluded them during the Obama years. Tennesseans delivered their electoral votes to Donald Trump with an overwhelming 61 percent of the vote.

Tennesseans want Senator Corker and the Republican majority in Congress to pass tax reform this year. Presidents and Senators of the same party can have public spats, but at the end of the day, the agenda and promises made to the people must carry the day. There is a direct correlation between how much of President Trump’s agenda Congress can pass with how many incumbents will face conservative primary challenges around the country in 2018.

On Opioid abuse, he enlisted pop rapper Macklemore and MTV to film a video at the White House.
Christina Hendricks was invited by the White House to speak at a family values summit.
Alison Janney of West Wing fame cameoed to a twitterpated White House press corps.
Obama and his administration wanted to be as much a part of Hollywood as Hollywood wanted to be a part of him.","Last year at the 89th Annual Academy Awards, then-Vice President Joe Biden walked on stage to a standing ovation to introduce Lady Gaga. He gave a passionate speech on the topic of campus sexual assault, about the need to speak up and “intervene in situations when consent has not or cannot be given.”

In 2013, Michelle Obama appeared at the Oscars via satellite from the White House decked in full evening gown and flanked by U.S. military service members to announce the winner of the best picture Oscar, which just so happened to go to director Ben Affleck’s “Argo.”

These are just two of the most prominent examples of how closely the Obama administration – and with it, the Democratic Party – has been tied to Hollywood, using them as messengers to push their agenda out to the mass public.

The late night hosts who only last week were happy to help Chuck Schumer push the Democrats’ gun control message are suddenly mute when it comes to Weinstein. And this is exactly where the Democrats find themselves in a bind. The party has depended on celebrity messaging for eight years.

It’s also the reason why Democrats can’t easily undo their connections to the sexual assault scandal involving super mogul Harvey Weinstein that is currently rocking the foundations of the industry.

Weinstein once stated that Hollywood “has the best moral compass, because it has compassion” – and for the past eight or so years, the Democratic Party has embraced Weinstein and his philosophy on Hollywood.

The flirtations between the party and Hollywood were not simply brief cameos at awards shows. President Obama used Hollywood to push almost every social action program his administration rolled out.

On ObamaCare, he enrolled the likes of Lebron James in a promotional video, Bill Murray in an Oval Office visit, and his famous “Between Two Ferns” appearance with Zach Galifianakis. Several celebrities, including Amy Pohler, Connie Britton, Olivia Wilde and Lady Gaga, Mark Ruffalo, Alyssa Milano and Mia Farrow participated in hashtag campaigns to “#GetCovered”. Liberal news outlet Mother Jones was kind enough to cull most of them into one piece.

When Obama wanted to give the impression he was tackling prison reform, he went to HBO and Vice. On Opioid abuse, he enlisted pop rapper Macklemore and MTV to film a video at the White House. Tom Hanks wrote about the virtues of free community college for the New York Times. Christina Hendricks was invited by the White House to speak at a family values summit. Alison Janney of West Wing fame cameoed to a twitterpated White House press corps.

On the Iran Deal, Obama enlisted Morgan Freeman as well as comedian and nuclear physicist Jack Black. Saturday Night Live, which refused to address the Weinstein scandal altogether last weekend, sang “To Sir With Love” to send Obama off into the sunset after eight years of Hollywood doting. By the end of his term, Obama had gone full Hollywood, appearing with Jerry Seinfeld simply for the fun of it.

This was why, despite very few actual legislative accomplishments, Obama’s presidency always felt more relevant in the moment than perhaps it actually was. It was so intertwined with the same faces in our culture that we see on magazine stands, album covers, movie screens and sitcoms. Obama always felt fresh and cool among the Hollywood elite, despite his party being decimated out from underneath him in consecutive congressional wave elections.

Obama and his administration wanted to be as much a part of Hollywood as Hollywood wanted to be a part of him. This was his chosen path to push his agenda -- through the people in culture with the loudest microphones whom he felt could influence the largest number of people to fall in line with his ideas.

Hillary Clinton tried to mimic this same strategy with her campaign, enlisting athletes, TV stars and pop stars to help drag her over the finish line. Clinton chose high-priced Hollywood fundraisers at the homes of stars like Gwenyth Paltrow over campaign stops in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Names such as George Clooney (also a personal friend of the Obamas), Ben Affleck and Matt Damon offered public support. Clooney alone raised $1.5 million for Clinton at a fundraiser in April of last year, with such names as Spielberg and Katzenberg in attendance.

Clinton regularly appeared on the campaign trail next to celebs such as Jay Z (a personal friend of Weinstein’s) and Beyoncé. Lena Dunham appeared with her in Ohio (a state she lost), as did the cast of the long defunct “West Wing.” Katy Perry was a Clinton campaign staple, even outfitting herself in dresses with Hillary’s slogan and logos. Actress Elizabeth Banks appeared at the Democratic Convention this past year, expertly mocking Donald Trump’s strobe light spaceship entrance onto the stage.

None of this, it seems, worked against Trump – who was able to tap into the forgotten voters of the rural rustbelt. These are the voters who don’t much care what Jimmy Kimmel or Sean Penn or Leonardo DiCaprio are preaching to them about the Earth’s climate or gun control – maybe because they’re more worried about the fact that they can’t afford their health care premium and have to use money to pay for their ObamaCare tax penalty that they could have used to fix their house, or car, or take their family on a vacation instead.

In fact, it seems the more Democrats have depended on Hollywood stars to sell their message, the more that most of the middle class in the middle of the country have tuned them out as their legislative and electoral majorities shrink.

Actress Alyssa Milano and other entertainment types campaigned actively for Democrat John Ossoff, who lost a money-soaked election in Georgia’s 6th District in June. Hollywood was also vocal in Montana’s May congressional election, where Republican Greg Gianforte coasted to victory, even after being charged for assaulting a reporter only days before.

The question now, heading into 2018 and 2020, is where does the party go without its celebrity base – which they have almost no choice but to shun in the fallout surrounding Harvey Weinstein and Hollywood’s pathetically lame (and delayed) response to the “open secret” (according to many) of his decades-long sexual exploitation of women.

Weinstein’s connections run deeper than simple campaign donations. Weinstein sold influence. He was so “in” among the Democratic Power Base that President Obama felt comfortable enough allowing his teenage daughter to intern for his film company. For the Democrats and their party, hoping to catch the coattails of the Obama cool they’ve been severely lacking since his exit, severing their connections to an industry facing a crisis of character will be easier said than done.

The late night hosts who only last week were happy to help Chuck Schumer push the Democrats’ gun control message are suddenly mute when it comes to Weinstein. And this is exactly where the Democrats find themselves in a bind. The party has depended on celebrity messaging for the better part of eight years, and were clearly planning to depend on it heading into the 2018 and 2020 elections (remember Maxine Waters appearing to raucous applause as a voice of The Resistance™ at the MTV Movie Awards?).

But the days of happy backslapping with Ben Affleck and George Clooney are coming to an end for a party that now has to distance itself from celebrity-spokespeople who were content to lecture the rest of the country about their religion, their guns or their politics – but who couldn’t seem to bring themselves to clean up their own house by calling out one of their closest friends and business colleagues for preying upon vulnerable young women – for years.



If the Democrats were a smart party – and they’ve done nothing of late to suggest that they are – they would be huddling in offices around the parts of the country they lost, devising a plan of action on how to move on without Hollywood spokespeople who will do nothing but remind voters of their association with Weinstein.

Distancing themselves from Hollywood and Weinstein could, in fact, ultimately be a gift to a decimated party flailing for a message beyond symbolic resistance. It could force Democrats to get back to the dirty work of organizing at a grassroots level and focusing on a message that appeals to that big useless chunk of land between Los Angeles and New York.

But just as it was apparently evident with Harvey Weinstein, the rest of Hollywood isn’t particularly good at taking “no” for answer.",Weinstein scandal -- Can Democrats afford to cut Hollywood loose?,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/13/weinstein-scandal-has-democrats-in-bind-can-afford-to-cut-their-celebrity-messengers-loose.html

In a string of fiery tweets, McGowan said she repeatedly warned Amazon about “HW” and “begged” the company not to work with the movie mogul but was told by an unnamed studio executive that “it hadn’t been proven.”

The actress also alleged Amazon Studios killed a show she planned to write and direct after she heard “a Weinstein bailout was in the works.”

“I forcefully begged studio head to do the right thing,” McGowan tweeted. “I was ignored. Deal was done. Amazon won a dirty Oscar.”

Amazon said the company is ""reviewing our options for our projects we have with the Weinstein Company.""

Meanwhile, an Amazon rep told Variety and TheWrap Thursday night that Amazon Studios head Roy Price was a ""on leave of absence effective immediately.""

Price's reported suspension came after Isa Hackett, a producer for Amazon’s “The Man in the High Castle,” told The Hollywood Reporter that he repeatedly propositioned her at a company party in July 2015.

Hackett said that Price started making lewd comments during a cab ride to the party -- and continued even after she told him she's a lesbian with a wife and children, the magazine reported. At one point, Hackett claimed that Price told her: ""You will love my d--k.""

Hackett claimed Price did not stop once they arrived at the party and even approached her and loudly said “Anal sex!” in her ear.

Hackett reported the incidents to studio executives who brought in investigators to look further into the allegations, The Hollywood Reporter added. Hackett said she was never made aware of the outcome but also said she never saw Price at any more events.

Many celebrities have come forward in recent days to share their stories about inappropriate behavior in the industry.

Last week, The New York Times reported Weinstein had been paying off women who accused him of sexual harassment for decades. On Tuesday, the New Yorker released an expose revealing Weinstein allegedly raped three women. Many actresses, including Gwyneth Paltrow, Ashley Judd, Kate Beckinsale and Angelina Jolie have spoken out about their experiences with Weinstein’s alleged inappropriate behavior.

The two music stars hail from the same area outside Detroit that has been a hot political battleground in recent years, yet their views seem to vary widely on many issues.

Eminem, also known as Marshall Mathers, made an appearance at the BET Hip-Hop Awards and performed a profanity-laden freestyle rap attacking the president. He rapped how Trump could cause “nuclear holocaust,” called him “orange,” and said racism was the “only good thing he’s good for.”

“We better give Obama props, because what we got in [office] now is a kamikaze that will probably cause a nuclear holocaust,” Eminem rapped. “He’s going to lower our taxes. Then who’s going to pay for his extravagant trips back and forth with his family to his golf resorts and his mansions? Same s--- that he tormented Hillary for and he slandered then does it more.”

Hip hop fans quickly drew a contrast between Eminem and Kid Rock, the diehard Trump backer who has floated the idea of running for the U.S. Senate.

In September, Kid Rock delivered a profane speech reportedly attacking former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick for refusing to stand during the national anthem. Rock also published a Facebook post slamming “the extreme left” for accusing him of bigotry despite his history of philanthropy in Detroit.

And just last week, Rock made another political speech during a concert at the Fish Fry festival in Nashville, talking about the Las Vegas massacre and honoring U.S. service members and the American flag.

""It's just a show of true testimony that – everybody being here and all the love in this place tonight – that nobody's scared to come out,"" Rock said, Rolling Stone magazine reported.

The outspokenness of the two stars, and their common connection to Michigan, has many fans calling for a politically charged rap battle or, less seriously, a showdown in a U.S. Senate race.

Their home turf -- Detroit’s suburban Macomb County – is a source of constant fascination for pollsters and pundits trying to take the pulse of white Middle America, Politico reported.

The county is heavily working class and its voters comfortably backed the Democratic Party in the 1960s. But with increasing cultural alienation, the county flipped to being Republicans, giving birth to the “Reagan Democrats” -- those who favor the social values of the GOP but prefer Democratic economic policies.

A prototype for the U.S. Postal Service’s next-generation delivery vehicle has been spotted making the rounds in the city of Leesburg.

A Trucks.com reader snapped a photo of the van, which is one of five proposals contending for the multi-billion dollar contract to replace the iconic Grumman LLVs that have been in service since 1987.

Workhorse didn’t reveal any details about the truck, but has previously said that it would be a hybrid. The company sells several hybrid commercial trucks and recently unveiled a plug-in hybrid pickup that’s scheduled to go on sale next year.

Requirements for the mail truck call for a 1,500-pound payload rating, 155 cubic-feet of cargo space, right-hand-drive, a sliding curbside door or doors, a maximum length of 230 inches and a six-foot four-inch cabin height. Workhorse’s snub-nosed creation appears to check all of those boxes.

Sean Copeland, 51, and his 11-year-old son Brodie were among the more than 80 people killed when a truck, whose driver was linked to Islamic State (ISIS), smashed through a crowd of people gathered last July for the Bastille Day fireworks along a popular promenade. The father and son were in Europe on vacation with Sean’s wife, Kim, and his two other children from a previous marriage.

“Kim Copeland is filing this lawsuit hoping that there will be no more funerals where ISIS and others continue to conduct terrorist operations using social media as a tool,” Keith Altman, one of the lawyer’s representing Kim Copeland, told Fox News in an email. “She also wants to see Google, Facebook, and Twitter change their behaviors and act reasonably and responsibly by taking active steps to disrupt ISIS and other nefarious groups’ ability to use their sites to cause death and destruction.”

The complaint, filed Thursday in the northern district of California, argues that the three Silicon Valley-based companies “have knowingly and recklessly provided the terrorist group ISIS with accounts to use its social networks as a tool for spreading extremist propaganda, raising funds, and attracting new recruits.”

“Without Defendants Twitter, Facebook, and Google (YouTube), the explosive growth of ISIS over the last few years into the most feared terrorist group in the world would not have been possible,” the complaint states.

To date, Altman has leveled seven lawsuits against the three tech giants – alleging that Google, Facebook and Twitter have allowed their social media platforms to be used as a tool to recruit jihadists and that these companies have even profited from advertisements on terrorist propaganda.

Altman and others have begun to argue that social media sites may be violating the provision with their heavily guarded algorithms and that these companies have the resources to monitor any terror activity on their platforms.

I now see I was lucky to have been a Boy Scout at that time instead of today.
Rest in Peace Boy Scouts.","Editor's note: The following column originally appeared on The Resurgent.

We all knew this was coming. The Boy Scouts of America stood for over a century on its strong foundation of Judeo-Christian values, growing boys into young men, and young men into leaders. However, in recent years the BSA has allowed cracks to form in that foundation.

From the lifting of the ban on openly gay boys from joining the organization, to the sanctioning of openly gay adult leaders, to the encouragement of so-called “transgendered” boys to join, the BSA’s moral foundation has been rapidly and steadily eroding into dust.

As soon as the BSA changed the definition of the phrase “morally straight” in the generations-old Scout Oath back in 2013, allowing for homosexual membership, we all knew that this first compromise would not be the last. We all knew that it was only a matter of time before the BSA compromised itself into oblivion.

That day has now arrived.

From the BSA’s website:

""Today, the Boy Scouts of America Board of Directors unanimously approved to welcome girls into its iconic Cub Scout program and to deliver a Scouting program for older girls that will enable them to advance and earn the highest rank of Eagle Scout.""

This is incredibly disappointing news, but in light of the BSA’s changes over the last few years, it isn’t at all surprising. It does, however, mark a complete transformation for the organization. The Boy Scouts has always been exclusively for boys. As Ben Shapiro famously noted, it’s in the name.

There are plenty of organizations out there for all different varieties of youth. The Boy Scouts even have several co-ed programs for both boys and girls. The girls already have the Girl Scouts. If the Girl Scouts isn’t working, why not work to fix that organization instead? There is absolutely no need for the Boy Scouts to change who they are to be “inclusive.”

What now separates the Boy Scouts from any other youth organization? The BSA has now effectively rendered obsolete both the Boy Scouts and the Girl Scouts. If the Boy Scouts is a better youth organization for girls, why would any girl ever want to join the Girl Scouts?

More incredibly, I have to wonder why any parent would want their young teenage girls camping in the woods with young teenage boys? Who exactly is okay with this?

As an Eagle Scout myself, this is an incredibly difficult piece for me to write. My fondest memories from my youth come from my time in Boy Scouts. I learned a great deal about myself, about leadership, and about manhood in those years. The friendships I made with both adult leaders and fellow Scouts can never be replaced. Earning the rank of Eagle Scout in 2002 was the greatest achievement of my life at the time. Another honor was when my beloved Scout troop invited me back to town to participate in its centennial celebration earlier this year. My scouting experiences have guided me throughout my adulthood and will continue to do so.

I now see I was lucky to have been a Boy Scout at that time instead of today. Those experiences would not have been the same had the BSA not been so strict on its membership policies. It is important for boys and young men to grow together free from the distraction of girls.

I suspect the Almighty Dollar now motivates BSA more than the Almighty. Membership (and revenue) has been declining steadily for years. Suddenly membership eligibility is now opened to a whole new demographic. Draw your own conclusions there.

This is what the Left does best: target and destroy everything good in America. They cannot compete with us on ideas, so they have to eliminate everything that makes us who we are. If they were truly motivated to provide girls, homosexuals, and “transgenders,” with the same experiences Boy Scouts provides, then they would form their own youth organization. But it isn’t really about that, is it?

By Felicia Schwartz, The Wall Street Journal



WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump is expected to announce on Friday that he won’t certify Iran is complying with the 2015 multinational nuclear agreement and will take Tehran to task more broadly for practices ranging from missile tests to support of violent groups, U.S. officials said.

The refusal to certify Iran’s compliance doesn’t mean the U.S. will pull out of the deal, the officials added, and Mr. Trump isn’t expected to ask Congress to re-impose economic sanctions that had been lifted as part of the agreement. But it could send the White House down a road of trying to change a deal that U.S. allies still support.

Mr. Trump, a longtime opponent of the accord negotiated under his predecessor’s administration, is expected to announce his decision in a speech in which he will also lay out plans to crack down on Iran’s missile program and its support for Hezbollah and other militant groups in the Middle East, the officials said.

Mr. Trump is also likely to designate the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Iran’s elite military branch, as a terrorist organization, a step that has been the subject of internal administration debates, according to people familiar with the deliberations.

Iran vowed a “crushing” response if the U.S. takes that step.

The venue for Mr. Trump’s remarks was the subject of debate as well. Officials said they had discussed the possibility of the speech taking place in front of the unoccupied Iranian Embassy in Washington, although that plan was set aside.

Mr. Trump’s speech will mark the end of a months-long Iran policy review by the administration and begin an uncertain process under which Congress has 60 days to consider on an expedited basis reinstating sanctions that had been lifted under the terms of the nuclear accord.

With the win, the Yankees completed their comeback from a 2-0 deficit in the Division Series to dethrone the AL champions.

These bend-but-don't-break Yankees staved off elimination for the fourth time in this postseason and advanced to play the Houston Astros in the AL Championship Series starting Friday at Minute Maid Park.

The AL West champion Astros, led by 5-foot-6 second-base dynamo and MVP candidate Jose Altuve, went 5-2 against the wild-card winners this season.

After winning twice in New York, the Yankees -- with little offensive help from rookie star Aaron Judge -- came into Progressive Field and finished off the Indians, who won 102 games during the regular season, ripped off a historic 22-game streak and were favored to get back to the World Series after losing in seven games a year ago to the Chicago Cubs.

Cleveland's Series drought turns 70 next year -- baseball's longest dry spell.

The Indians closed to 3-2 in the fifth against starter CC Sabathia before David Robertson pitched 2 2/3 hitless innings for the win. Yankees closer Aroldis Chapman, who faced Cleveland in last year's spine-tingling World Series and signed an $86 million free agent contract in December, worked two innings for the save.

Chapman went to the mound with a three-run lead in the ninth after Brett Gardner battled Cody Allen for 12 pitches before hitting an RBI single, with New York's fifth run scoring when Todd Frazier raced home on right fielder Jay Bruce's throwing error.

Gardner's gritty at-bat was symbolic of these Yankees. They wouldn't give in.

When Austin Jackson was called out on strikes to end it, the Yankees rushed to the mound to celebrate with a wide-eyed Chapman.

These baby Bronx Bombers became the 10th team to overcome a 2-0 deficit to win a best-of-five playoff series. New York also did it in 2001, rallying to beat Oakland -- a series remembered for Jeter's backhand flip to home plate.

Gregorius, who took over at shortstop following Jeter's retirement after the 2014 season, hit a solo homer in the first off Kluber and added a two-run shot in the third off Cleveland's ace, who didn't look like himself during either start in this series.

One win shy of a Series title last year, the Indians had only one goal in mind in 2017.

They came up short again, and have now lost six consecutive games with a chance to clinch a postseason series dating to last year's World Series, when they squandered a 3-1 lead to the Chicago Cubs.

Cleveland is the first team in history to blow a two-game series lead in consecutive postseasons.

Everything was set up for the Indians: Kluber on the mound, Game 5 at home, sensational setup man Andrew Miller rested.

The Yankees, though, wouldn't be denied. They battled back from a 3-0 deficit in the first inning of their wild-card game against Minnesota and then had to overcome a crushing loss in Game 2, when manager Joe Girardi's decision not to challenge a hit batter, drew heavy criticism and possibly cost New York during in a 9-8 loss in 13 innings.

But these young Yankees, who are ahead of schedule to be contenders, displayed pinstriped pride.

""This team has never stopped fighting and never stopped believing,"" Girardi said before Game 5. ""That's the mark of a very good team. They know how to persevere and continue to grind out everything, whether it's an at-bat or it's on the other side, you're facing a batter, how you grind it out.""

The Yankees did it without much help from Judge, who struck out four times in Game 5, and went 1 for 20 (.050) in the series with 16 strikeouts.

But the 6-foot-7 rookie might have saved New York's season in Game 3, when he reached above the right-field wall to rob Francisco Lindor of a two-run homer in a 1-0 win.

Kluber was one of baseball's most consistent pitchers all season, winning 18 games and leading the AL with a 2.25 ERA. He's a favorite to win his second Cy Young Award.

However, October has been cruel to the right-hander. He allowed nine runs, including four homers, over 6 1/3 innings in two postseason starts, hardly what he or the Indians expected.

Gregorius came in batting just .077 (1 for 13) in the series and only .133 (2 of 15) in his career against Kluber before tagging the right-hander for two homers in the first three innings.

The 27-year-old with the easy smile and sweet swing gave the Yankees a 3-0 lead in the third, pulling an 0-1 pitch into the lower deck in right. Gregorius set a franchise record for home runs in a season by a shortstop with 25, one more than Jeter hit in 1999 when No. 2 led the Yankees to a second straight World Series title.



Just as in Game 2, Kluber didn't get out of the first unscathed.



Gregorius got New York off to an ideal start, homering with two outs in the first when Kluber grooved a fastball. The shot deep into the seats in right raised the anxiety level to an already jittery Cleveland crowd fearing the worst.

A few hours later, those fears were realized.","Yanks beat Indians, will face Astros for AL title",https://www.foxnews.com/sports/2017/10/12/yanks-beat-indians-will-face-astros-for-al-title.html

A cold and a sinus infection can look quite similar with their sore throats and post-nasal drip.

If you do discover that you have a sinus infection, you may be able to get targeted treatment that your body needs.

What Causes Sinusitis?

At the core, a sinus infection is an inflammation of the sinus cavities. You have four of these in specific areas, including on your forehead, behind your cheeks, between your eyes and near the bridge of your nose (ethmoids). Because they’re in such distinct locations, you can pinpoint a sinus infection with high accuracy if you have symptoms around these areas.

So why do sinus infections happen? They occur for a number of reasons, and the cause isn’t always obvious. First of all, the tissue lining of the nasal cavities might be inflamed or blocked due to allergies, a common cold, bacteria or irritants like nasal sprays or cigarette smoke.

Also, chronic dryness of mucous membranes can lead to an infection. You might experience this dryness because of dehydration, medications or a lack of humidity in the surrounding air.

In rare cases, the infection may be the result of fungus. These cases require immediate medical attention because the fungus can grow and cut off blood circulation.

10 Signs of a Sinus Infection

Although a sinus infection may have some similar symptoms to the common cold, a few signs will give away the true culprit.

1. Facial tenderness

The blockage or inflammation may cause a general aching in your face.

2. Pressure in any of the sinus locations mentioned above

Though not always, you may feel pain in the sinus cavities since they are directly affected.

3. Congestion

Most cases of sinusitis will have some blockage, altering your smell, taste or voice.

4. Earache

Fluid may get trapped in your ear with a sinus infection, resulting in an ear infection as well.

5. Sinus headache

Similar to the facial tenderness, congestion and inflammation may cause an overall ache in the sinus cavities of your forehead.

6. No response to over-the-counter nasal medications

Here, you may have a bacterial sinus infection.

7. Puffy eyes

Inflamed sinuses in this area may cause the blood vessels surrounding your eyes to swell.

8. Thick, discolored mucus

Discolored mucus suggests that the body is trying to fight off infection.

9. Bad breath

When foul-smelling infected mucus starts dripping down the back of the throat (post-nasal drip), you may notice a smell to your breath too.

10. Sore Throat

Post-nasal drip and coughing may cause irritation to the back of the throat.

Treating Sinusitis

Most of the time, acute sinus infections can be effectively treated at home.

Home treatment includes

using a steam vaporizer or inhaler

clearing out passages with a nasal rinse

taking OTC decongestants

applying a warm compress

getting plenty of fluids

getting rest

If the symptoms last for longer than 1-1 ½ weeks, you should seek out treatment from a doctor. At that point, your treatment will vary based on the type of infection you have.

10 SYMPTOMS OF GALLBLADDER PROBLEMS

Antibiotics

For instance, a bacterial sinus infection will need an antibiotic to help your body fight it off. Again, your doctor may suspect a bacterial infection if you have bad breath or if the infection doesn’t respond to other treatments.

Steroids

Sometimes, a doctor may prescribe nasal or oral steroids. These help to reduce the swelling in the sinuses.

Allergy medications

If allergies are irritating your sinuses, you may simply need the proper allergy medications to get rid of the problem. In chronic cases where you don’t know the cause, you might consider undergoing allergy testing.

Surgery

A less common treatment method is surgery. Your doctor will usually recommend it if you have severe, chronic sinusitis that won’t go away or if you get sinusitis multiple times per year. During surgery, the doctor will actually enlarge your sinus cavities to encourage proper drainage.

Because of many similar signs to each other, sinus infections can sometimes mask themselves as a common cold. In some cases, the infection may have even started as a cold and worsened. To tell the two apart, try comparing what you’re experiencing with the 10 common symptoms listed above. Then, if your symptoms are persistent, you can better hone in on and describe your infection’s symptoms to your doctor.

In its news release about Collins, the ethics panel declared that “pursuant to House Rule XI, clause 3(b)(8)(A) and Committee Rules 17 A(b)(1)(A) and 17(A)(c)(I)” that “the Committee will review the matter pursuant to Committee Rule 18(a).” However, the Ethics Committee said it will “comply with Committee Rule 7.” Moreover, the committee will publish a “Report and Findings” – which of course is “pursuant to Committee Rule 17A.”

The House Ethics Committee uses parentheses like the Cubs and Nationals use relief pitchers.

Perry Mason may be better suited to untangle the legal bromides spouted by the Ethics Committee. But Collins himself is pretty clear about his plight.

“Nothing of substance is there at all,” the New York Republican said about allegations he broke House policies and may have violated federal law.

But the House’s quasi-official Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) -- which, to make matters more confusing, is different from the actual Ethics Committee -- doesn’t think so. The OCE charges Collins used his position in Congress to inappropriately help Innate Immunotherapeutics.

Collins sits on the board of the firm. The congressman also holds between $25 and $50 million in Innate stock. That makes Collins the company’s largest shareholder.

So is the House Ethics Committee actually investigating Collins?

Hard to tell.

Amid all of the “pursuants” and triplicate parentheticals, the Ethics Committee says it’s still evaluating things. Yet there is no official probe.

There’s a labyrinthine lexicon worth unpacking here.

The House Ethics Committee wasn’t actually called the “Ethics Committee” until a few years ago. Back then, it was the “Committee on Standards of Official Conduct.” Regardless of the name today, the Ethics Committee is the bona fide panel which sits in judgment of House members. In 2008, the House developed the independent watchdog known as the “Office of Congressional Ethics.” The House permits the OCE to entertain accusations of ethical breaches from practically anyone off the street. The OCE can then refer potential cases to the actual Ethics Committee and render findings. The Ethics Committee itself can consider or dismiss cases flagged by the OCE. The best signal denoting an official “ethics investigation” comes when the Ethics Committee launches an “investigative subcommittee” to probe an issue. It’s up to the full House to mete out major forms of punishment like reprimand, censure or even expulsion.

The House Ethics Committee didn’t commission an “investigative subcommittee” in the case of Collins. It just said it would conduct “further review.” By the way, that additional look-see “does not itself indicate that any violation has occurred.”

So, Collins finds himself in congressional limbo. He’s not officially under investigation. Yet Collins isn’t in the clear, either.

“I am disappointed in the Ethics Committee,” fumed Collins after the announcement Thursday. “Sometimes they leave these [investigations] open for years.”

An ethics review into the conduct of former Rep. Charlie Rangel, D-N.Y., started in 2008 – culminating in censure for the New York Democrat in late 2010. The House Ethics Committee also began an investigation into Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., in 2010. But it took until 2012 to clear Waters. The committee had to first navigate the Rangel issue. Then, when studying Waters’ conduct, the Ethics Committee had to dump two staffers who leaked information about the case to House Republicans.

No member likes any prodding by the Ethics Committee. But what lawmakers really hate is an inquest by the OCE.

Collins is no exception.

“They are a waste of taxpayer money and they accomplish nothing,” said Collins of the OCE. “I was exonerated on the original charges. They found two small nothings.”

The OCE noted that former Health and Human Services Secretary and former Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., refused to cooperate in its investigation. Collins says he doesn’t blame Price.

“A lot of folks ignore them,” said Collins of the OCE. “The OCE was what we tried to get rid of.”

What Collins refers to is an effort by House Republicans to ditch the OCE in January. The night before the launch of the 115th Congress, House GOPers voted to defang the outside watchdog. But within hours, Republicans faced a political maelstrom. The backlash forced the Republican brass to frantically intervene and deep-six the proposal to neuter the OCE.

“They have no authority,” ranted Collins about the OCE. “They instructed my attorney to break attorney-client privilege. That’s how bad these guys are.”

But after the January fiasco, the OCE isn’t going anywhere.

Collins may harbor contempt for the OCE. But that’s nothing compared to the enmity he reserves for Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y. Slaughter authored the STOCK Act which bars lawmakers from using their position for financial gain on the markets. Slaughter lodged the original complaint about Collins with the OCE.

“She’s a despicable human being,” seethed Collins when asked about Slaughter. “You don’t go after another member with fabricated allegations like she did.”

It’s rare for lawmakers to speak on background or off the record with such vehement hostility about a colleague. But rancor like this on the record is practically unheard of.

In a statement to Fox News, Slaughter called Collins’s actions “a disgrace,” adding that the congresswoman “doesn’t need to defend herself.”

Congressional ethics cases are frequently convoluted and challenging to explain. The most complex part may be deciphering Byzantine House ethics rules and parsing parenthetical profusions in committee news releases. Collins’ fate hangs in the balance. Little is clear about what’s next. The only things that aren’t in question are what Collins thinks about the Office of Congressional Ethics, the Ethics Committee and Louise Slaughter.

The document was used by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police at a U.S. border crossing in Quebec, according to reports. The queries appeared to specifically target Muslim asylum seekers, as they did not mention any other religions or non-Muslim terrorist groups.

The questionnaire, first published by the Toronto Star, also had more standard fare: country of origin, basic health questions and whether the respondent has friends or family in the U.S. or Canada.

REFUGEES CONTINUE TO CROSS FROM US TO CANADA IN UNPRECEDENTED NUMBERS

But it then asked the asylum seeker's opinion on ISIS, the Taliban and how they feel about women who do not wear religious garbs, such as the hijab and niqab.

Question 31 on the form reads: “Canada is a very liberal country that believes in freedom of religious practice and equality between men and women. What is your opinion on this subject? How would you feel if your boss was a woman?”

A spokesperson for the RCMP told the Toronto Star on Wednesday the questions were part of an “interview guide” used by officers in Quebec.

“Due to the high volume of irregular migrants in Quebec, an interview guide was developed as an operation tool to streamline processing and provide consistency in the RCMP’s preliminary risk assessments,” Annie Delisle told the Star.

It's unclear how long it had been used.

The RCMP didn't immediately return Fox News' request for comment.

According to the Star, the answers from the questionnaire were entered into RCMP databases and could be shared with the Canada Border Services Agency.

Scott Bradsley, spokesperson for Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale, told the Star on Wednesday the use of “the version” of the guide has been suspended by the RCMP.

“The minute we became aware of the interview guide, we were immediately concerned and contacted the RCMP,” he said. “Some of the questions were inappropriate and inconsistent with government policy.”

Immigration lawyer Clifford McCarten, who obtained a copy of the document from a client seeking refugee status told the Canadian Press that he was “shocked” by the questions.

""If, in fact, this was a local detachment making this decision -- which I find a bit hard to believe -- then it's deeply concerning that one of the most, if not the most problematic crisis spot in Canadian immigration and refugee policy right now...doesn't have a federal strategy for how screening is happening,"" he said.

McCarten told the Toronto Star while he was thankful for the quick reaction by Goodale’s office, other questions need to be answered.

“I’m heartened to hear from the leadership that they take this as seriously as we do,” McCarten said. “But what possible purpose could someone’s opinion about female employment or religious head coverings have to bear on an assessment risk?”

He added: “If someone’s religious opinion is sufficient to place them in an RCMP database for potential future monitoring, we need to be concerned about that. If they recognize those questions are inappropriate, then they need to destroy all the information that was gathered.”

Canada has seen a recent influx of refugees crossing into the country from the U.S. in unprecedented numbers.

More than 13,000 people have crossed illegally into Canada this year, according to Canadian government data. That's more than five times the number intercepted by the RCMP in 2016.

Some Asian-Americans claim they’re discriminated against at schools such as Harvard, which have admissions policies that judge different racial and ethnic groups by different standards. And now the Trump administration is getting involved. It’s recently been confirmed that the Justice Department, under Attorney General Jeff Sessions, is looking into Harvard’s policies.

This seems to be a reversal of the previous administration’s stance, but it’s all part of a wider, long-running debate on just how far affirmative action programs should go.

Already President Trump is being attacked for threatening “equal protection” for all Americans. But it’s a sign of how the civil rights establishment thinks that, to many in its ranks, equal protection means treating people unequally.

Their argument is that there are certain groups, most notably African-Americans, who are historically disadvantaged, and who face discrimination, and so need a hand up to create a “level playing field.”

This is nothing new. Decades ago, top colleges would limit how many Jews they’d accept. Since many Jewish applicants had stellar qualification, the universities couldn’t argue the numbers, so they’d say it was about character.

Those on the other side believe that you don’t help anyone by lowering standards (and, in fact, placing minorities in schools where they’re far less qualified ends up with them finishing at the bottom of the class and more likely flunking out).

Though this is where the real dispute lies, there’s an awful lot of talk about “diversity.” That’s because the Supreme Court has declared diversity a compelling state interest, and thus an acceptable reason to factor race and ethnicity into admission policies.

What it’s led to in practice, critics claim, is a huge advantage for some groups based on race. (Colleges tend to deny this, but then, they almost have to, in the same way that tobacco companies had to deny their products caused cancer—to admit it is to give away the game before it starts.)

What this also means is the groups not getting special treatment have it tougher. And groups that perform exceptionally well, such as Asian-Americans, have it toughest of all.

This is nothing new. Decades ago, top colleges would limit how many Jews they’d accept. Since many Jewish applicants had stellar qualification, the universities couldn’t argue the numbers, so they’d say it was about character (of both the Jews and the campus). While the statements aren’t as blatant today, the same thing seems to be happening to Asian-Americans.

If the Department of Justice decides to take action, that won’t be the end of it. No doubt they’ll be challenged under Fisher v. University of Texas (2016), where Justice Kennedy wrote that using race in the admissions process is acceptable if the program is narrowly tailored for the goal of greater diversity. The decision also notes that courts will use “strict scrutiny” in judging admissions policies, though critics of the opinion state that strict scrutiny isn’t nearly as strict as it used to be.

Many Americans of all types have serious moral problems with programs that judge people by their race. It’s not only an undesirable way to go about things, it also creates perverse incentives. When groups that underperform are, in essence, rewarded, while groups that outperform are punished, how will things change for the better?

The people who administer these policies don’t seem prepared to change without the government requiring them to live up to the true promise of equal protection. So let the investigation begin.","Is Harvard racist?

The first sight of a daffodil, whether in your garden or in a store, is proof that spring is here. Even better, they’re practically foolproof to grow. They’re perennial bulbs, coming back year after year. They’re cold hardy and don’t need summer water to thrive. They’re also not a target for deer or gophers. If you want to enjoy these bulbs come spring, though, fall is the time to plant.

Caution: Keep daffodil bulbs away from pets, as they are toxic.

Botanical name: Narcissus spp.

Common names: Daffodil, jonquil, narcissus

Origin: Native to Europe and North Africa

Bloom season: Late winter and spring; rebloom every year

Where they grow: Hardy to minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 40 degrees Celsius (USDA zones 3 to 9)

Light requirements: Full sun

Water requirements: Regular water when growing and blooming

Benefits and tolerances: Easy to grow; tolerate most soils and prefer dry conditions in summer; deer, rabbits, gophers, squirrels and chipmunks all avoid them.

When to plant: Begin planting bulbs when the soil begins to cool, approximately two to four weeks before you expect the ground to freeze in colder climates. That might be as early as September in the coldest climates but is more likely October in most locations.

If you live in a warm-winter climate where freezes are late or unlikely, buy the bulbs early when you have the best selection; then store them in a cool, dry spot out of sunlight until your soil temperature has reached about 60 degrees Fahrenheit, or 15.6 degrees Celsius, usually around mid-November.

Daffodil basics. Daffodil lovers and experts categorize the Narcissus genus into 13 divisions. If that is overwhelming, take the easier approach and use familiar common names. Daffodil is used for those with larger blooms, while narcissus refers to those with smaller flowers, which usually bloom early. The paperwhite narcissus, a favorite for forcing, falls into this latter category. Jonquil denotes the N. jonquilla species and its hybrids.

Choosing bulbs. Look for bulbs that feel firm and heavy and don’t show any signs of injury. Store in a cool, dry, airy spot out of direct sunlight before planting.

You might also find other daffodil species and hybrids. ‘Tête-à-Tête’ and fragrant ‘Tiny Bubbles’ are only about 6 inches tall and work well in rock gardens.

If your local selection is limited or you want something unusual, order bulbs online. They will be shipped to you when it’s the right time to plant in your climate zone. Some good sources for bulbs include Brent and Becky’s Bulbs, John Scheepers and White Flower Farm.

Where to plant. Choose a spot in full sun, although in the hottest climates they will prefer partial shade once they finish blooming. Daffodils will tolerate most soils as long as they drain well, though they prefer acidic to neutral soil. Amend your soil before planting if it doesn’t drain well.

How to use it. Plant en masse or set them among other plants in a garden bed or border. Daffodils also are good choices for containers.

Daffodils can be used to create a woodland or meadow effect. Simply toss a handful of bulbs into a prepared planting area in order to create a more naturalistic design. Adjust the bulbs as needed so the center and one end of the bed are more densely planted, giving the effect that the bulbs have gradually spread from a single spot.

Daffodils are popular cut flowers as well. They’re fine when used alone in an arrangement, but they emit a fluid that will cause other flowers to wilt. If you’re using them in a mixed arrangement, soak them overnight in a separate vase or container before adding them in with the other flowers.

How to plant. Set bulbs, pointed ends up, into the soil two to three times as deep as they are tall, between 3 and 5 inches deep for smaller bulbs and up to 6 inches deep for larger ones. Be sure there will be at least 3 inches of soil over the bulbs in colder climates. Space smaller bulbs about three times their width when planting and larger ones at least 6 to 8 inches apart. If you want, you can add a small amount of bulb fertilizer around the bulbs at this time. Cover with soil, and water thoroughly.

Growing notes. Daffodils are easy to care for once they’re in the ground. Provide additional water in fall if it is dry and through the winter in drought-prone areas. Provide regular water if Mother Nature doesn’t while they are growing and when they’re in bloom. Keep watering until the leaves start to turn yellow; then stop.

Daffodils don’t need summer water. If they get much rain, be sure the soil drains well to prevent bulb rot and other problems.

You don’t need to fertilize bulbs. If you do want to give the blooms some extra help, top-dress the area around the bulbs with a 5-10-10 granular fertilizer when the leaves begin to emerge.

Deadhead the blooms once they’ve faded if you want, but keep the leaves in place. Remove the leaves once they’re completely yellow, lightly work the soil around the plants and then add mulch. You can also add a small amount of 5-10-10 fertilizer around the bulbs at this time if flower production is fading.

Divide only when flower production begins to falter. The best time to do this is right before the foliage completely yellows. Simply dig up the clumps and divide into smaller sections. Replant immediately, or store them in paper bags or ventilated sacks (nylons work well) in a cool, dry, airy spot out of the sun.

Pests are rare, but the narcissus bulb fly can be a problem. Don’t plant any bulbs that are soft or damaged, and cultivate and mulch after foliage dies down to prevent them from finding their way to the bulbs.

Container culture. Daffodils are standouts in containers. You can plant a single daffodil in a 1-gallon container, three to four in a 2-gallon container or masses of them in larger containers. Add potting soil to your container so the bulbs will sit at the same depth as they would in the garden. Rather than spacing them out, crowd the bulbs together to get a massed effect when they’re in bloom. Water thoroughly, and provide water throughout the fall and winter and into the growing season if you don’t get regular rain or snow cover.

In warmer-winter climates, keep the container outdoors and provide additional water if you don’t have enough rainfall. In cold-winter climates where containers are vulnerable, bring into a greenhouse or unheated garage or shed. Water regularly if they won’t receive regular moisture. Bring the containers to the foreground of your garden when they’re in bloom. (You can even sink them into the ground.)

For larger bulbs, one season in a container is all you can expect. Smaller ones, however, can last several years. If you want to keep them going, move containers to an out-of-the-way, sunny spot after the blooms fade. Once the leaves are yellowed, cut them off and add a 5-10-10 fertilizer around the bulbs. Cover with mulch. Begin watering again in fall as needed.",Your planting guide for beautiful yellow daffodils,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/04/your-planting-guide-for-beautiful-yellow-daffodils.html

It's the largest increase since 2012 but comes to only $25 a month for the average beneficiary.

The Social Security Administration announced the cost--of-living increase Friday.

The COLA affects benefits for more than 70 million U.S. residents, including Social Security recipients, disabled veterans and federal retirees. That's about one in five Americans.

By law, the COLA is based on a broad measure of consumer prices generated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Advocates for seniors claim the inflation index doesn't accurately capture rising prices faced by seniors, especially for health care.

""It's squeezing them. It's causing them to dip into savings more quickly,"" said Mary Johnson of The Senior Citizens League. ""The lifetime income that they were counting on just isn't there.""

Some conservatives argue that the inflation index is too generous because when prices go up, people change their buying habits and buy cheaper alternatives.

Consumer prices went up only slightly in the past year despite a recent spike in gasoline prices after a series of hurricanes slowed oil production in the Gulf Coast, said Max Gulker, senior research fellow at the American Institute for Economic Research.

""For the most part, there was a decline in energy prices for a lot of the year,"" Gulker said. ""But at the end of the year we saw that uptick in gas from the hurricanes.""

The average monthly Social Security payment is $1,258, or about $15,000 a year.

Congress enacted automatic annual increases for Social Security in 1975. Presidents often get blamed when increases are small or zero. But President Donald Trump has no power to boost the increase, unless he persuades Congress to change the law.

In 2009, President Barack Obama persuaded Congress to approve one-time payments of $250 to Social Security recipients as part an economic stimulus package.

Over the past eight years, the annual COLA has averaged just above 1 percent. In the previous decade, it averaged 3 percent.

Johnson noted that multiple years of small or no COLA's reduces the income of retirees for the rest of their lives.

""Think about the length of a retirement period. Eight years is about a third of a (healthy) retirement,"" Johnson said.

The COLA is based on the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, or CPI-W, a broad measure of consumer prices. It measures price changes for food, housing, clothing, transportation, energy, medical care, recreation and education.

The August report says energy prices are up 6.5 percent from the previous year, while the cost of medical care is up just 1.7 percent. The cost of food is up 1.1 percent.

The COLA is calculated using the average CPI-W for July, August and September, and comparing it to the same three months from the previous year.",Social Security benefits to rise by 2 percent in 2018,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/13/social-security-benefits-to-rise-by-2-percent-in-2018.html

The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans ruled 2-1 to vacate a preliminary injunction issued to the NFL Players' Association by a federal judge last month.

The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans ruled 2-1 to vacate a preliminary injunction issued to the NFL Players' Association by a federal judge last month.

Elliott was originally suspended by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell in August after the league concluded he had several physical confrontations last summer with his former girlfriend, Tiffany Thompson. Prosecutors in Ohio didn't pursue the case, citing conflicting evidence.

In issuing the injunction, U.S. District Judge Amos Mazzant agreed with NFL players' union attorneys who argued that the investigation of the allegations in Ohio and a subsequent appeal were unfair to Elliott, one of the league's standout running backs.

The NFL countered that it followed procedures under the league's labor deal and that the union improperly filed a lawsuit before the appeals process was complete.

But the appeals court ruled Thursday that Mazzant had no jurisdiction over the matter and ordered the Eastern District of Texas to dismiss the case.

The most likely destination for further legal challenges from players' union attorneys representing Elliott is with the Southern District of New York. The NFL filed in that federal court after Elliott's NFL appeal was denied by arbitrator Harold Henderson last month.

Last year's NFL rushing leader as a rookie, Elliott's legal team filed the lawsuit on his behalf in the Eastern District of Texas before Henderson had rejected the appeal.

The NFL had already agreed to let Elliott play in the opener before Elliott's request for an injunction was granted by Mazzant in Sherman, north of Dallas. Henderson ruled against Elliott the same day Mazzant heard arguments over the injunction.

The NFL filed in the New York court because it is the home of league headquarters and was the site of Elliott's appeal hearing with Henderson.

The league won the ""Deflategate"" decision in the New York court, leading to New England quarterback Tom Brady serving his four-game suspension a year after it was originally imposed. A federal judge had put Brady's suspension on hold.

In the Elliott case, league attorneys wrote to the 5th Circuit that the union's lawsuit had resulted in ""hopelessly doomed proceedings"" that shouldn't continue.

According to the letter Elliott received informing him of the suspension, the NFL believed he used ""physical force"" three times over five days in a Columbus, Ohio, apartment last July resulting in injuries to Thompson's face, neck, shoulders, arms, hands, wrists, hips and knees.

Elliott, 22, has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.

If Elliott's legal team can't put the suspension on hold again, it will begin Oct. 22 at San Francisco. Elliott played the first five games while the case was in the courts.

The second-year running back out of Ohio State has recorded 424 all-purpose yards and scored three touchdowns.

Take, for example, the dwarf planet Haumea, a large egg-shaped body that hangs out beyond Neptune in the far reaches of our little planetary neighborhood, which researchers just discovered also happens to have a ring around it. Man, space is weird.

The research, which was published in the journal Nature, reveals that the oddly-shaped object is a real oddity, even among dwarf planets. Haumea's oblong shape isn't the only weird thing about it, as it also has an extremely fast rotational speed, leading to a full revolution once every 3.9 hours.

Rings around planets like Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are well-studied and, for the most part, understood. But a dwarf planet boasting a ring of its own is definitely pretty weird, if only because it's the first with a confirmed ring.

Interestingly, the many oddities that make Haumea such a strange dwarf planet might be related. Past research suggested that the dwarf planet experienced a collision with another object in the Kuiper Belt -- the thick circle of debris that lies past Neptune -- and it's entirely possible that the impact not only caused the dwarf to spin wildly, sending debris into its orbit.

SEE THE NYC TOWNHOUSE WHERE OBAMA LIVED AFTER COLLEGE

The building has been the site of two very high-profile suicides in the last 30 years, which is enough to make even a New York City real-estate agent think twice about living there.

“I don’t know of any buildings with two suicides,” said Dolly Lenz, CEO of Dolly Lenz Real Estate, in a statement to the New York Post. “It almost says that there is a cloud on the building.”

The first victim of these tragedies was Carter Cooper, the 23-year-old son of Gloria Vanderbilt and the older brother of CNN anchor Anderson Cooper. According to reports, Carter was acting strangely in the months leading up to his suicide, but had been in therapy. Then, on July 22, 1988, during a visit to his mother’s home, he abruptly ran out onto the terrace of his Vanderbilt’s two-story penthouse apartment, hopped over the ledge, and dangled there before letting himself drop from the 14th floor — all while Vanderbilt watched from feet away.

""He let go, and there was a moment when I thought I was going to jump over after him,” Vanderbilt remembered during a 2011 appearance of Anderson Cooper’s talk series.

In Vanderbilt’s 1997 book, “A Mother’s Story,” she also alleged that Carter’s suicide may have triggered by an allergy to medication.

The second, much more recent suicide at 10 Grace Square took place in April 2017, and claimed the life of author, heiress and socialite Jean Stein. Stein, whose works include “Edie: An American Girl” and “West of Eden,” had reportedly been suffering from depression, according to her daughter Katrina vanden Heuvel, and jumped from the 15th floor of the building on April 30, the New York Times reported in its obituary.

A fellow resident who witnessed the suicide has said it was a messy one, as Stein “miscalculated” the jump and landed an eighth-floor terrace. She had also severed her leg in the fall, according to reports.

10 Gracie Square, however, is also infamous for more than these two suicides: In 1982, it was also where sixth-floor resident Frances Schreuder was arrested for conspiring with her son Marco to kill Schreuder’s father, wealthy Utah businessman Franklin Bradshaw.

Schreuder had reportedly been unhappy with the amount of money Bradshaw was allotting her, and persuaded her then-17-year-old son to shoot his grandfather dead in 1978. He was eventually caught, and Schreuder was nabbed while trying to escape out the window of her 10 Gracie Square abode.

For President Trump’s so-called travel ban, October 10 was a big day after all. That did not seem a likely outcome when the Supreme Court removed the case from its docket, scrapping the oral arguments originally scheduled for Tuesday morning. That evening, though, the Court issued a brief order that gave the president an important victory — one that is clearer than the Court’s June 26 ruling, which the White House dubiously celebrated as a big win.

To most women, Michelle Obama seems to have enjoyed a dream life.
Michelle Obama was perfectly positioned to manage this nexus of politics and business, helped by her husband’s status as a rising star in Chicago’s minority firmament.
And they don’t need to be lectured by Michelle Obama.","Isn’t Michelle Obama adorable? She actually thinks she is a typical woman in the United States, and that she can speak for all of us.

Michelle says she has no interest in running for president, trying to shatter what Hillary Clinton called the “highest and hardest glass ceiling,” but she might consider bursting out of that elitist, condescending Beltway Bubble.

Speaking recently at the Pennsylvania Conference for Women, Obama pushed women to speak up for themselves in the workplace. “Don’t waste your seat at the table,” she said. “If you are scared to use your voice, then you’ve got to get up and give it to someone who isn’t afraid to use the spot.”

Such good advice, coming from someone whose idea of hardship was graduating from Princeton University and Harvard Law School, and whose husband has always been there to provide for her.

To most women, Michelle Obama seems to have enjoyed a dream life. Married to a political supernova, spending eight years in the White House (which she once described as having “prisonlike elements”), moving on to a life of luxury and power; she has no idea how the real world functions. Her advice could get a lot of women fired.

In other words, she thinks women who voted for Trump did as they were told. And yet, isn’t that what Michelle is doing? Telling women what to think and what to say?

In 2014 she told the White House Working Families Summit how she once applied for a job at the University of Chicago Medical Center with her newborn baby in tow, and on the spot demanded flexible hours so that she could care for her growing family. She told her prospective employer, ""If you want me to do the job, you've got to pay me to do the job and you've got to give me flexibility.""

Doesn’t that sound like a terrific negotiating premise? I can’t do the job unless you bend the rules for me, possibly alienating my co-workers? Come on. Most women (or men) insisting on such special treatment would be shown the door.

“That was one of the first times I demanded flexibility,” Michelle says proudly about that early interview, as she exhorts others to follow her lead. For many of us who have juggled the demands of motherhood and work, the advice doesn’t ring true. It is the rare young job applicant, male or female, who can lay down demands, and women embarking on motherhood are typically more anxious than most to appear committed to their job. They need to be, as employers are understandably anxious about the competing demands on their time.

As a result, many of us put off having families until we were far enough along in our careers to negotiate some flexibility and consideration.

At the time that Michelle made that bold demand, her husband was a state senator in Illinois, and preparing to run for the U.S. Senate. He had earlier been a high-profile community organizer in Chicago, earning significant visibility within the city’s black community. Michelle initially worked at a top Chicago law firm; at the time she references she was being recruited to build the medical group’s community relations with Chicago’s South Side, where her husband had paved the way for her.

As the Washington Post revealed in 2008, Michelle Obama worked to redirect health care in the impoverished neighborhoods surrounding the hospital to local clinics, freeing up the Medical Center to care for patients with insurance who could pay more for the hospital’s care. The initiative was controversial; critics claimed the undertaking boosted the non-profit’s hospital’s bottom line at the expense of its commitment to the surrounding neighborhoods. To boost her efforts, she hired David Axlerod’s PR firm. Michelle Obama was perfectly positioned to manage this nexus of politics and business, helped by her husband’s status as a rising star in Chicago’s minority firmament. Hence, she had an excellent platform from which to demand special consideration.

She was paid well over $100,000 early on, which jumped to more than $300,000 when she became a Vice President, the year after her husband became a U.S. Senator. One of the earmarks the freshman senator petitioned for was a million dollar request for the UC Medical Center, which was never granted. Michelle had a strong wind at her back, named Barack.

Michelle has other advice these days – indeed, she is becoming the Edgar Bergen of our times, throwing her “voice” into the mouths of American women. Like the famed puppet master speaking for Charlie McCarthy, Michelle is spewing dictates, including recently telling women at an event in Boston “As far as I’m concerned, any woman who voted against Hillary Clinton voted against their own voice in a way. . . . We look at those two candidates, as women, and many of us said, ‘That guy. He’s better for me. His voice is more true to me.’ Well, to me that just says you don’t like your voice. You like the thing we’re told to like.”

In other words, she thinks women who voted for Trump did as they were told. And yet, isn’t that what Michelle is doing? Telling women what to think and what to say?

Case in point: the eternally-dirty sheet pan that always seems to have brown, burnt-on residue coating the sides.

But we don't have to resign ourselves to this fate — there's a simple two-ingredient solution that is probably already in your cupboard.

Mix ½ cup baking soda and ½ cup white vinegar with hot water in the sink. (We prefer Heinz white vinegar and Arm & Hammer baking soda, but this will work with any brands, really.) It will bubble up like a school science project, but that reaction is what helps loosen the residue. Make sure your sink is plugged so your pans stay submerged, and let it soak for 30 minutes to an hour before scrubbing away with a scouring pad, steel wool, or the scrubby side of your sponge. Although steel wool is most likely to scratch your pans, it's OK — you want them to look well-worn and used, but scrub in even circular motions to make the lines less noticeable. That elbow grease your parents always like to go on and on about? Yeah, time to use it.

After the scrub-down, wash with regular soap and water to finishing cleaning, and then dry immediately to prevent rust. This process is also a twofer: It helps clean out your drain — which you definitely don't clean enough — with the combo of baking soda and vinegar. It's all very easy, but remember to rock dishwashing gloves during this process to save your hands from getting all scratched up by the rough scrubber.

I had a sheet pan that I tried cleaning vigorously with my tried-and-true Scrub Daddy sponge at least half a dozen times, but the corners still had mysterious residue lingering around. So I made a soft of bath bomb for my pan, let it soak overnight — because I fell asleep and forgot about it, honestly; an hour probably would have probably been fine — and went to town on it with steel wool. I was hoping for an arm workout, but it was surprisingly easy. The brown stuff came off in a few seconds per scrub, and it wasn't noticeably scratched because most my cleaning was in the corners. I believe in miracles.

Vinegar isn't only for cleaning sheet pans. If there's a similar coating around the edge of a stainless steel sauté pan, boil a few cups of water with ½ cup vinegar for a few minutes, pour out, and wash as usual. We all know not to use steel wool on a Dutch Oven, so this is also a great way to clean it without scratching the precious enameled surface. If this doesn't work, Bar Keepers Friend powder is a good bet. It's powerful, yet gentle on your precious Le Creuset. You can sprinkle some powder directly on a scouring pad or sponge, wet it, and wash in circles.

Once you get 'em clean and looking (almost) as good as new, you'll want to maintain that shiny surface.

Sheriff Joseph Lombardo, head of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, expressed his own frustrations with the investigation, but said he remained determined to keeping the public informed.

“It’s important for people to know what I know, when I know it. Just to calm the public,” Lombardo told the Las Vegas Review-Journal.

Perhaps the biggest question of all: What motivated gunman Stephen Paddock, 64, to open fire on 22,000 concertgoers, ultimately killing 58 and wounding hundreds more.

Lombardo touched on the lack of information regarding Paddock’s motive.

“You immediately think you’re gonna know the reasons why in the short term,"" he said. ""Now, here we are a week after the fact, and we still don’t know.”

Varying accounts of the timeline from that Oct. 1 evening have left the public even further in the dark.

On Monday, Lombardo issued a revised timeline of events, stating that Paddock shot and wounded a Mandalay Bay hotel security guard, firing around 200 bullets outside his hotel room door, only six minutes before he opened fire on the crowd below.

This account was much different from the version offered last week. According to that initial timeline, Paddock shot the security guard, Jesus Campos, after he finished firing at the crowd.

However, a Thursday statement by MGM Resorts international, owner of the Mandalay Bay hotel, disputes even the most recent police timeline.

The casino company said that shots were fired into the festival crowd “at the same time as, or within 40 seconds after” Campos was fired upon.

Based on when the shots were first reported over hotel dispatch radio, MGM claims that the police account of gunfire breaking out 6 minutes later is inaccurate.

Despite there being so many discrepancies over when the gunman opened fire, it is inevitable that details will change again.

Dan Oates, who was chief of police in Aurora, Colo., when the infamous movie theater shooting happened there in 2012, told the Review-Journal that such changes are expected.

“Given the scale and complexity, as a police professional, I’m not particularly troubled if some early facts shift.”

Investigators were working hard to pin down an exact timeline of events and figure out what drove Paddock over the edge.

The people who administer these policies don’t seem prepared to change without the government requiring them to live up to the true promise of equal protection.","The trouble with helping one group, is it can mean you’re harming another.

Some Asian-Americans claim they’re discriminated against at schools such as Harvard, which have admissions policies that judge different racial and ethnic groups by different standards. And now the Trump administration is getting involved. It’s recently been confirmed that the Justice Department, under Attorney General Jeff Sessions, is looking into Harvard’s policies.

This seems to be a reversal of the previous administration’s stance, but it’s all part of a wider, long-running debate on just how far affirmative action programs should go.

Already President Trump is being attacked for threatening “equal protection” for all Americans. But it’s a sign of how the civil rights establishment thinks that, to many in its ranks, equal protection means treating people unequally.

Their argument is that there are certain groups, most notably African-Americans, who are historically disadvantaged, and who face discrimination, and so need a hand up to create a “level playing field.”

This is nothing new. Decades ago, top colleges would limit how many Jews they’d accept. Since many Jewish applicants had stellar qualification, the universities couldn’t argue the numbers, so they’d say it was about character.

Those on the other side believe that you don’t help anyone by lowering standards (and, in fact, placing minorities in schools where they’re far less qualified ends up with them finishing at the bottom of the class and more likely flunking out).

Though this is where the real dispute lies, there’s an awful lot of talk about “diversity.” That’s because the Supreme Court has declared diversity a compelling state interest, and thus an acceptable reason to factor race and ethnicity into admission policies.

What it’s led to in practice, critics claim, is a huge advantage for some groups based on race. (Colleges tend to deny this, but then, they almost have to, in the same way that tobacco companies had to deny their products caused cancer—to admit it is to give away the game before it starts.)

What this also means is the groups not getting special treatment have it tougher. And groups that perform exceptionally well, such as Asian-Americans, have it toughest of all.

This is nothing new. Decades ago, top colleges would limit how many Jews they’d accept. Since many Jewish applicants had stellar qualification, the universities couldn’t argue the numbers, so they’d say it was about character (of both the Jews and the campus). While the statements aren’t as blatant today, the same thing seems to be happening to Asian-Americans.

If the Department of Justice decides to take action, that won’t be the end of it. No doubt they’ll be challenged under Fisher v. University of Texas (2016), where Justice Kennedy wrote that using race in the admissions process is acceptable if the program is narrowly tailored for the goal of greater diversity. The decision also notes that courts will use “strict scrutiny” in judging admissions policies, though critics of the opinion state that strict scrutiny isn’t nearly as strict as it used to be.

Many Americans of all types have serious moral problems with programs that judge people by their race. It’s not only an undesirable way to go about things, it also creates perverse incentives. When groups that underperform are, in essence, rewarded, while groups that outperform are punished, how will things change for the better?

The people who administer these policies don’t seem prepared to change without the government requiring them to live up to the true promise of equal protection. So let the investigation begin.","Is Harvard racist?

Vines at shoots less than 10 centimeters to full bloom will generate low smoke taint levels, she said.
The smoke taint interferes with that.
How much will California wine be impacted?
""No treatment will fully remove smoke taint.”How big is the California wine industry?","As the California wildfires continue, experts and winemakers are already preparing for changes in their livelihoods.

The wildfires have left 31 people dead and have destroyed thousands of homes and businesses. But for the wineries and vineyards spared, the fires could have a greater impact on the wine produced – including its taste.

How can the wildfires impact wine’s flavor?

The amount of damage grapes sustain from smoke depends on the age of the plant, according to experts.

Grapes that are the most susceptible to smoke taint are those between post-veraison (the onset of ripening) to harvest, Dr. Anita Oberholster, a cooperative extension specialist in enology at the University of California, Davis, told Fox News.

Enology is the study of wine.

Vines at shoots less than 10 centimeters to full bloom will generate low smoke taint levels, she said.

Dr. Christian Butzke, a professor of enology at Purdue University, added that when the smoke attaches to sugar molecules in grapes, it can be impossible for winemakers to smell it anymore. But during fermentation, some of that smoke flavor can come back out.

BOILING RIVER OF WINE FLOWS THROUGH BURNED DOWN CALIFORNIA VINEYARD

Butzke described the flavor as “more like a smoke flavor that you can buy in a bottle to put on your steak.” He also said that winemakers place a premium on the “sense of place” – so people are able to identify the character of a grape and where it originated. The smoke taint interferes with that.

How much will California wine be impacted?

As most of the grapes in Sonoma and Napa had already been harvested – as much as 90 percent of it – there is a decreased risk of California wines becoming contaminated with smoke taint, said Butzke.

“There’s not that much left out there in regards to grapes that could be tainted by the smoke that’s in the air,” Butzke, who spent much of his career working in California, said. “Most of the wine is in tanks and barrels, and with that, it’s safe [from smoke taint].”

Butzke noted that given the amount of time it takes to age wine, it could be several years before the full impact of the fires' impact on the wine is realized.

What can winemakers do about smoke taint?

Oberholster said the chances of getting rid of smoke taint is pretty dismal and unpredictable as it “evolves during the aging of wine.”

WILDFIRES RAVAGE CALIFORNIA WINE COUNTRY

“If your grapes were exposed to 30 [minutes] of heavy smoke at a period of high sensitivity, then you have a chance of having smoke taint in your wines,” she said. ""No treatment will fully remove smoke taint.”

How big is the California wine industry?

While Sonoma and Napa produce only a small percentage of the grapes in California (less than 12 percent), the grapes from those regions are the most valuable, Oberholster said. Of the approximately 650 wineries in those two areas, at least five have burned down and an additional six are damaged, she said.

The California wine industry generates $57.6 billion in annual economic activity in the state and $114 billion in the country, according to statistics from the Wine Institute, a California-based public policy organization.

It employs about 325,000 Californians and contributes $17.2 billion in wages annually in the state. It also generates $7.2 billion in tourism expenditures in California.

California is the world’s fourth leading wine producer, according to the institute. It trails only France, Italy and Spain.",How smoke can affect wine crops,https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/2017/10/12/how-smoke-can-affect-wine-crops.html

That's why scientists have turned to nature in an attempt to create truly amazing robotic camo, and it's already looking really, really amazing.

The new skin-like material mimics that of the cephalopods, which allow the aquatic creatures to raise or lower parts of their skin to create bumps and other shapes. In nature, the animals use this ability to mimic rocks and other features of the sea floor so that they can blend in for hunting or predator evasion purposes. Scientists believe this ability could be extremely useful for robots, and have set about making programmable skin that can take any shape that is needed.

The synthetic skin works a lot like the one nature has bestowed upon octopuses and cuttlefish, with a stiff membrane restricting the expansion of certain portions of the skin, but allowing other sections to balloon. When air is pumped in, the skin appears to morph into new shapes. This creates a 3D disguise that is incredible effective in nature, and would presumably also be quite powerful when applied to a robot.

Research robots could potentially use this kind of camo to observe animals without detection, but the other very obvious application is related to the military.

In their years on HGTV’s show, ""Fixer Upper,"" hosts Chip and Joanna Gaines achieved far more than merely getting Americans to embrace open floor plans and shiplap; they made marriage look fun again.

The Texas couple’s decision to end the show after soon-to-be-aired Season Five ensures it won’t devolve into them simply playing certain roles, trying to recapture the magic of earlier seasons.

Along the way, thanks to the pairing of Joanna’s gift for interior design and Chip’s skilled construction craftsmanship, they made a lot of beautiful homes—showing concretely how the teamwork of marriage could create something bigger.

“This is just us recognizing that we need to catch our breath for a moment,” the Gaineses wrote on their blog. “Our plan is to take this time to shore up and strengthen the spots that are weak, rest the places that are tired and give lots of love and attention to both our family and our businesses.” In a video accompanying their blog post, Joanna spoke specifically about how quickly the couple’s four children were growing, noting that their eldest was almost a teenager and expressing how they were ready to “hunker down with our kiddos” for a time.

This is exactly what made the Gaineses so appealing. They do care about time with their family—and they’re not the kind of reality TV professionals who want to turn their family into a permanent fixture on the screen by being “on” all the time. Part of the couple’s appeal has always been their family-friendliness, their down-to-earth qualities, and the clear priority they give to living in accordance with their values.

But their decision to end the show is also appealing because the Gaineses themselves have changed: in the years since ""Fixer Upper"" began, they’ve become involved in multiple home goods lines, launched a magazine, written a book, and even opened a bakery in their hometown of Waco, Texas. While I’m happy for the Gaines’ success, the fact is they’re not the same couple facing regular problems that they were when the show launched—and frankly, yes, a reality show true to their own current reality (exploring questions like what mega chain is worth trusting for a home goods line partnership, for example) would simply not be as relatable or enjoyable to watch.

But I’m grateful for the years they gave us on ""Fixer Upper.""

There’s a real dearth of shows or, frankly, any entertainment that depicts marriage as fun. And while no doubt the Gaineses amped it up a little for the camera, the dynamics under-girding the show—the push and pull between the goofy Chip and the more serious Joanna—certainly seemed authentic, as did the joy they had in just hanging out with each other, occasionally trying to get a rise out of one another.

Along the way, thanks to the pairing of Joanna’s gift for interior design and Chip’s skilled construction craftsmanship, they made a lot of beautiful homes—showing concretely how the teamwork of marriage could create something bigger.

In her 2011 book, ""Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?"" TV writer and actress Mindy Kaling included a section, “C’mon, Married People,” in which she wrote:

""I don’t want to hear about the endless struggles to keep sex exciting, or the work it takes to plan a date night. I want to hear that you guys watch every episode of The Bachelorettetogether in secret shame, or that one got the other hooked on Breaking Bad and if either watches it without the other, they’re dead meat. I want to see you guys high-five each other like teammates on a recreational softball team you both do for fun. I’m not saying that marriage should always be easy. But we seem to get so gloomily worked up about it these days.""

Kaling, whose own show ""The Mindy Project"" unfortunately devolved into a gloomy look at the hardships of relationships these days, concluded with the following plea:

“Married people, it’s up to you. It’s entirely on your shoulders to keep this sinking institution afloat. It’s a stately old ship, and a lot of people, like me, want to get on board. Please be psyched, and convey that psychedness to us.”

And that’s exactly what the Gaineses have done on ""Fixer Upper."" In an era when marriage rates are down, people flirt with notions of open marriages and polygamy, and singles scour Tinder for one-night-stands, a show about home renovation unexpectedly became a celebration of how a husband and wife could be friends and partners, could complement each other and have a genuinely good time just hanging out with each other. In their interactions with each other and their four children, the Gaineses proved happiness isn’t impossible for an old-fashioned family in our modern era.",What Chip and Joanna Gaines teach us about marriage,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/05/what-chip-and-joanna-gaines-teach-us-about-marriage.html

Hillary Clinton: Woods walker, Chardonnay drinker, screamer-into-pillows, sore loser. And now? The recycled claim of Feminist Icon Supporter of All Women.

The feminist bar is very low these days. We’ve now heard from a number of very successful, famous actresses (and the aforementioned politician) who are being lauded for coming out against producer Harvey Weinstein. After he was fired from his film company.

“It took Hillary about 5 minutes to blame NRA for madman’s rampage, but 5 days to sorta-kinda blame Harvey Weinstein for his sexually [sic] assaults,” tweeted Kellyanne Conway. But even that was giving Hillary too much credit.

Hillary’s silence, and that of the Obamas, was so absurd even their own blogs (also known as the mainstream media) hectored them about it for days. Five days into the media firestorm, she finally issued a statement quintessentially Clintonian:

“I was shocked and appalled by the revelations about Harvey Weinstein. The behavior described by women coming forward cannot be tolerated. Their courage and the support of others is critical in helping to stop this kind of behavior.”

A rather rich statement about not tolerating sexual harassment and assault, coming from a “feminist” who made a career tolerating it, and modeling that acquiescence to a generation of young women. Shocked and appalled? No she wasn’t.

Hillary’s example for women is, if anything, consistent. She has shown them how to put up with, and defend, the most egregious treatment, if it will get you something.

Ian Tuttle at the National Review reminded us last year of Hillary’s role in attacking her wandering husband’s victims and accusers:

“[The New York Times and The Washington Post both cite] ABC anchor George Stephanopoulos’s memoir of his years as Clinton’s chief adviser, ‘All Too Human.’ When the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke, ‘[Hillary] had to do what she had always done before,’ wrote Stephanopoulos: ‘swallow her doubts, stand by her man, and savage his enemies.’ To an allegation from Little Rock music groupie Connie Hamzy that Bill Clinton propositioned her, Hillary responded: ‘We have to destroy her story.’ “

The Daily Wire reports, “In an ABC News interview in 1992, Hillary smears Gennifer Flowers, a woman Bill would later admit to having an affair with, as ‘some failed cabaret singer who doesn’t even have much of a resume to fall back on.’ Hillary also referred to Flowers as ‘trailer trash.’ “

No wonder Mr. Weinstein’s Hollywood and Hillary’s Washington so frantically turned to deflection by painting Donald Trump as the singular menace for women. Because, you know, locker-room talk.

Through various reports and confessions, we know everyone in Hollywood knew about Harvey Weinstein. But he’s not the end of it, he’s just the beginning. Like the iceberg that nailed the Titanic, the problem is the part still hidden.

Those at most risk in the cesspool of Hollywood are the young and inexperienced. Mr. Weinstein targeted ingenues, and young staffers. But there were some women who escaped Mr. Weinstein’s grip, and developed successful careers.

Many of those successful women, some who claim to have had no idea and others admit they knew, also finally came out and condemned Mr. Weinstein, after he was fired.

Meryl Streep called his actions “disgraceful” and an “abuse of power.” She also says she had no idea it was happening. An odd ignorance, considering her friend was a leading supporter of allowing Roman Polanski back into the U.S. She then appropriately lauded the women speaking out against him (before it was safe), as heroes.

Rosanna Arquette and Oscar-winner Mira Sorvino both rebuffed Mr. Weinstein’s advances, and both women feel that it contributed to a stall in their careers.

Actress Rose McGowan is the hero of this story, and was calling attention to this over a year ago on social media. Her complaints, widely believed to be about Mr. Weinstein, were made before it was fashionable. She also has not had Angelina Jolie’s or Jennifer Lawrence’s career.

Ms. Lawrence says she had no idea of Mr. Weinstein’s behavior, while Ms. Jolie says she was sexually harassed by the mogul and did try to warn others who were working with him.

Yet Ms. Jolie has been among Hollywood’s most successful and powerful women for years. As her power and independence grew, still nothing was said publicly that may have helped end the predator’s decades-long career of sexual harassment, alleged sexual assault, and now some alleged rapes.

Is it acceptable for rich, powerful and successful women (and men!) who know what’s happening, to say nothing for years, because it allows their work to proceed unencumbered? Are these people, who know what’s happening, abandoning untold numbers of other women to the monster, brave and heroic and feminist to come out once the charade is exposed?

Gwyneth Paltrow was lauded by Jake Tapper on Twitter as “courageous” for admitting she was harassed by Mr. Weinstein. Tweeter Lola Ramona was concise: “It’s not courageous to jump off a bridge when your landing will be cushioned by the people who jumped first. She’s not brave.”

Yes, the maniac is Mr. Weinstein, but even monsters like him are stopped when women speak up. Asking powerful women to use their power isn’t an insult, it’s a necessity.

The elite in Hollywood are super-upset about all of this, so will George Clooney, Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Meryl Streep, Jennifer Lawrence and Angelina Jolie refuse to work until Rose McGowan, Mira Sorvino and Rosanna Arquette are offered roles and paydays worthy of them?

Cooper in Santa Rosa and Brian Skoloff in Calistoga contributed to this report.","They are trying to find lost loved ones, to sift through the ashes of their homes, to count, identify and mourn the dozens of dead — all while the wildfires rage on.

Communities in Northern California prepared for another day under siege Friday, despite being driven to exhaustion by evacuations, destruction and danger in the deadliest week of wildfires the state has ever seen.

""It wears you out,"" said winemaker Kristin Belair, who was driving back from Lake Tahoe to her as-yet-unburned home in Napa. ""Anybody who's been in a natural disaster can tell you that it goes on and on. I think you just kind of do hour by hour almost.""

The death toll had climbed to an unprecedented 31 and was expected to keep rising. Individual fires including the Oakland Hills blaze of 1991 had killed more people than any one of the current blazes, but no collection of simultaneous fires in California had ever led to so many deaths, authorities said.

""We had series of statewide fires in 2003, 2007, 2008 that didn't have anything close to this death count,"" said Daniel Berlant, a deputy director of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.

Hundreds more were injured or missing.

Real recovery would have to wait for firefighters to bring under control the 21 wildfires spanning more than 300 square miles (777 square kilometers). Most were less than 10 percent contained. New evacuations were still being ordered for fires that broke out Sunday night.

""We are not even close to being out of this emergency,"" said Mark Ghilarducci, director of the state's Office of Emergency Services.

Choking smoke hung thick and then drifted over the San Francisco Bay Area, where masks to filter the fumes were becoming a regular uniform and the sunsets were blood-red from the haze.

""It's acrid now,"" said Wayne Petersen in Sonoma. ""I'm wearing the mask because I've been here two or three days now, I live here. It's starting to really affect my breathing and lungs so I'm wearing the mask. It's helping.""

Even some members of the Oakland Raiders were wearing masks during workouts Thursday.

The fires drove hundreds of evacuees north to beaches, some sleeping on the sand on the first night of the blazes.

Since then, authorities have brought tents and sleeping bags and opened public buildings and restaurants to house people seeking refuge in the safety and clean air of the coastal community of Bodega Bay, where temperatures drop dramatically at night.

""The kids were scared,"" said Patricia Ginochio, who opened her seaside restaurant for some 300 people to sleep. ""They were shivering and freezing.""

California Highway Patrol Officer Quintin Shawk took relatives and other evacuees into his home and office, as did many others.

""It's like a refugee camp,"" Shawk said.

Meanwhile, teams with cadaver dogs began a grim search for more dead, resorting in some cases to serial numbers stamped on medical implants to identify remains in charred ruins.

Sonoma County Sheriff Robert Giordano said officials were still investigating hundreds of reports of missing people and that recovery teams would begin conducting ""targeted searches"" for specific residents at their last known addresses.

""We have found bodies almost completely intact, and we have found bodies that were nothing more than ash and bones,"" said the sheriff, whose office released Thursday the names of 10 of the dead, all age 57 or older.

Some remains have been identified using medical devices uncovered in the scorched heaps that were once homes. Metal implants, such as artificial hips, have ID numbers that helped put names to victims, he said. Distinctive tattoos have helped identify some.

Since igniting Sunday in spots across eight counties, the fires have transformed many neighborhoods into wastelands. At least 3,500 homes and businesses have been destroyed and an estimated 25,000 people forced to flee.

Fire officials were investigating whether downed power lines or other utility failures could have sparked the fires.

Some lucky evacuees returned to find what they least expected.

Anna Brooner was prepared to find rubble and ashes after fleeing Santa Rosa's devastated Coffey Park neighborhood.

Then she got a call from a friend: ""You're not going to believe this."" Her home was one of only a handful still standing.

""I swore when I left I was never coming back to this place,"" Brooner said. ""I feel so bad for all the other people. All of us came back thinking we had nothing left.""

What I know is healing, in the face of violence and senseless acts, will always find a way.","The news of Las Vegas came in as fast and as devastating as Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria and as violent as the raging fires tearing through California. I could imagine the sudden horror of the thousands of men, women, and children dancing and singing one minute, and then scrambling for their lives before the next downbeat. It must have felt like a roof ripping off and leaving thousands of people traumatized in its wake. My husband and son, Marcus and Levi Hummon, are both in the music industry and have lots of friends who were in Las Vegas, so our communities have felt this mass shooting rip apart our own sense of security.

I have felt both grief and anger on behalf of the victims and their families. I can understand how people might wonder why God would allow such a horrific thing to happen to innocent people but God didn't do this, God is grieving with us. This is a time to question a lot of things, but I believe that this is not a time to question our faith. This is a time to lean into our faith, as our faith is what carries us through. This is a time for remembering all we have lost through violence and injustice and to be a community. Community is the common thread, woven by the fiber of love, that binds us together. And I know something about love: Love heals. It heals people, and it will heal our nation, too.

At Thistle Farms, a community of survivors of prostitution, addiction, and trafficking, where I have worked for the past 20 years, one sentiment remains constant; hearts expand as they heal. For women recovering from childhood trauma and sexual violence, the painful edges of their hearts discover new depths of compassion along the path of healing. America, too, can grow both stronger in the pain and more radically passionate for loving one another. Once we all allow healing to smooth over rough edges in our own hearts, it will push the boundaries of love a little further for all of us.

We can transform brokenness into compassion, anger into advocacy, and fear into courage. On a daily basis, I see the survivors in our community being transformed by love. Healing is beautifully simple and surprisingly accessible.

If you are wondering what you can do to find some peace and healing in your own life, I encourage you to:

Make time for quiet reflection: Find a green pasture, sit on a pew, stretch out on an exercise mat, soak in a bathtub—go anywhere that is your quiet space so that you can get still. Sip tea, light a candle, go silent.

Pray: Everyone defines this differently. You can pray out loud, on paper, or before bed. If we desire healing, we journey inward, reflect, face the pain, and find new spaces in our hearts to love each other.

Give generously: This can be your time, money or talents. We refuel our spirits by helping another person or contributing to the greater good. Volunteer.

Take a break from social media: Social media contains negative stories, unkind words, judgment, comparison, and unrealistic standards in the news feed. Use the time you would have spent on social media to help create good news. Nurture the relationships in your life that don’t rely on a screen.

With every action, we can become more peaceful, more loving, and more compassionate towards ourselves and others. This is what makes healing a journey; In the small steps we make daily, we find, looking back, that we have made a big difference along the way.

While I don’t know why we have faced a relentless amount of tragedy across our country this past year, what I do know is that love will be stronger and will last longer. In grieving, hearts can grow stronger, and in pain, there is comfort. What I know is healing, in the face of violence and senseless acts, will always find a way. Peace and love to you.","Deadly fires, a mass shooting, hurricanes and more -- I still believe love can heal our nation",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/12/deadly-fires-mass-shooting-hurricanes-and-more-still-believe-love-can-heal-our-nation.html

However, no such planet has yet been discovered in our solar system, meaning that Planet Nine could be our missing ""super Earth,"" the researchers said.","Planet Nine is out there, and astronomers are determined to find it, according to a new statement from NASA. In fact, mounting evidence suggests it's hard to imagine our solar system without the unseen world.

The hypothetical planet is believed to be about 10 times more massive than Earth and located in the dark, outer reaches of the solar system, approximately 20 times farther from the sun than Neptune is. While the mysterious world still has yet to be found, astronomers have discovered a number of strange features of our solar system that are best explained by the presence of a ninth planet, according to the NASA statement.

""There are now five different lines of observational evidence pointing to the existence of Planet Nine,"" Konstantin Batygin, a planetary astrophysicist at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena, said in the statement. ""If you were to remove this explanation and imagine Planet Nine does not exist, then you generate more problems than you solve. All of a sudden, you have five different puzzles, and you must come up with five different theories to explain them."" [The Evidence for 'Planet Nine' in Our Solar System (Gallery)]

In 2016, Batygin and co-author Mike Brown, an astronomer at Caltech, published a study that examined the elliptical orbits of six known objects in the Kuiper Belt, a distant region of icy bodies stretching from Neptune outward toward interstellar space. Their findings revealed that all of those Kuiper Belt objects have elliptical orbits that point in the same direction and are tilted about 30 degrees ""downward"" compared to the plane in which the eight official planets circle the sun, according to the statement.

Using computer simulations of the solar system with a Planet Nine, Batygin and Brown also showed that there should be even more objects tilted a whopping 90 degrees with respect to the solar plane. Further investigation revealed that five such objects were already known to fit these parameters, the researchers said.

Since then, the astronomers have found new evidence that further supports the existence of Planet Nine. With help from Elizabeth Bailey, an astrophysicist and planetary scientist at Caltech, the team showed that Planet Nine's influence might have tilted the planets of our solar system, which would explain why the zone in which the eight major planets orbit the sun is tilted by about 6 degrees compared to the sun's equator.

""Over long periods of time, Planet Nine will make the entire solar-system plane precess, or wobble, just like a top on a table,"" Batygin said in the statement.

Finally, the researchers demonstrate how Planet Nine's presence could explain why Kuiper Belt objects orbit in the opposite direction from everything else in the solar system.

""No other model can explain the weirdness of these high-inclination orbits,"" Batygin said in the statement. ""It turns out that Planet Nine provides a natural avenue for their generation. These things have been twisted out of the solar system plane with help from Planet Nine and then scattered inward by Neptune.""

Going forward, the researchers plan to use the Subaru Telescope at Mauna Kea Observatory in Hawaii to find Planet Nine, and then deduce where the mysterious world came from.

The most common type of planets discovered around other stars in our galaxy has been what astronomers call "" super Earths "" — rocky worlds that are larger than Earth but smaller than Neptune. However, no such planet has yet been discovered in our solar system, meaning that Planet Nine could be our missing ""super Earth,"" the researchers said.

A sniper in a ghillie suit might be able to blend into a bush, but when it comes to adapting your look on the fly, octopuses and cuttlefish absolutely put human efforts to shame. That's why scientists have turned to nature in an attempt to create truly amazing robotic camo, and it's already looking really, really amazing.

The new skin-like material mimics that of the cephalopods, which allow the aquatic creatures to raise or lower parts of their skin to create bumps and other shapes. In nature, the animals use this ability to mimic rocks and other features of the sea floor so that they can blend in for hunting or predator evasion purposes. Scientists believe this ability could be extremely useful for robots, and have set about making programmable skin that can take any shape that is needed.

The synthetic skin works a lot like the one nature has bestowed upon octopuses and cuttlefish, with a stiff membrane restricting the expansion of certain portions of the skin, but allowing other sections to balloon. When air is pumped in, the skin appears to morph into new shapes. This creates a 3D disguise that is incredible effective in nature, and would presumably also be quite powerful when applied to a robot.

Research robots could potentially use this kind of camo to observe animals without detection, but the other very obvious application is related to the military.

Case in point: the eternally-dirty sheet pan that always seems to have brown, burnt-on residue coating the sides.

But we don't have to resign ourselves to this fate — there's a simple two-ingredient solution that is probably already in your cupboard.

Mix ½ cup baking soda and ½ cup white vinegar with hot water in the sink. (We prefer Heinz white vinegar and Arm & Hammer baking soda, but this will work with any brands, really.) It will bubble up like a school science project, but that reaction is what helps loosen the residue. Make sure your sink is plugged so your pans stay submerged, and let it soak for 30 minutes to an hour before scrubbing away with a scouring pad, steel wool, or the scrubby side of your sponge. Although steel wool is most likely to scratch your pans, it's OK — you want them to look well-worn and used, but scrub in even circular motions to make the lines less noticeable. That elbow grease your parents always like to go on and on about? Yeah, time to use it.

After the scrub-down, wash with regular soap and water to finishing cleaning, and then dry immediately to prevent rust. This process is also a twofer: It helps clean out your drain — which you definitely don't clean enough — with the combo of baking soda and vinegar. It's all very easy, but remember to rock dishwashing gloves during this process to save your hands from getting all scratched up by the rough scrubber.

I had a sheet pan that I tried cleaning vigorously with my tried-and-true Scrub Daddy sponge at least half a dozen times, but the corners still had mysterious residue lingering around. So I made a soft of bath bomb for my pan, let it soak overnight — because I fell asleep and forgot about it, honestly; an hour probably would have probably been fine — and went to town on it with steel wool. I was hoping for an arm workout, but it was surprisingly easy. The brown stuff came off in a few seconds per scrub, and it wasn't noticeably scratched because most my cleaning was in the corners. I believe in miracles.

Vinegar isn't only for cleaning sheet pans. If there's a similar coating around the edge of a stainless steel sauté pan, boil a few cups of water with ½ cup vinegar for a few minutes, pour out, and wash as usual. We all know not to use steel wool on a Dutch Oven, so this is also a great way to clean it without scratching the precious enameled surface. If this doesn't work, Bar Keepers Friend powder is a good bet. It's powerful, yet gentle on your precious Le Creuset. You can sprinkle some powder directly on a scouring pad or sponge, wet it, and wash in circles.

Once you get 'em clean and looking (almost) as good as new, you'll want to maintain that shiny surface.

While he noted that the Like button succeeds at some things like drawing attention to a friend’s interests or acting as a catalyst for “positive sentiment,” it also results in gobs of “time wasted” when looking at videos that “don’t nourish your life” or are just constant distractions that are unproductive and disruptive.

This topic was recently highlighted in The Guardian, which said that smartphone use (and technology in general) is not just addictive, but it contributes to “continuous partial attention,” wreaking havoc on people’s ability to focus and potentially making them dumber.

“One recent study showed that the mere presence of smartphones damages cognitive capacity – even when the device is turned off,” the article noted.

Many of these early technologists are now “weaning themselves off their own products” and teaching their children to put down iPhones, iPads, and laptops, the Guardian added. However, the problem is large technology companies often define success as “time spent on site,” Rosenstein wrote.

Rosenstein is now co-founder of a workplace software startup, known as Asana, and is currently working on an app that seeks to address some these issues.

Use versus abuse

""You need to define addiction. A lot of people just like to use the technology a lot"" but aren't necessarily addicted, Nir Eyal, author of ""Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products,"" who has taught at Stanford Graduate School of Business and Design School, told Fox News.

""If you throw around this word 'addiction,' it really hurts people. It disempowers people to take control of it. 'It's not my fault, it's the technology's fault.'"" Eyal said, adding if you shirk personal responsibility, you're more likely to relapse.

But companies do have a ""moral imperative"" to at least try to help real addicts. ""We have personally identifiable information who is using and who is abusing,"" he said.

For example, a company could have a policy where ""if you use our product more than X number of hours per week, we're going to reach out to and ask if we can help you,"" he said. And if they are receptive and accept the offer for help, then the company can step in, he said.

The famed Chicago Bears coach came under fire for making the comments during a radio interview on Monday about NFL players kneeling during the national anthem. He issued an apology the next day, saying he was talking about professional football and not society as a whole.

“I have absolutely seen oppression in society in the last 100 years,” the Hall of Fame tight end and Super Bowl-winning coach said in statement to WGN-TV in Chicago. “The interview was about the NFL and related issues. That’s where my head was at.”

The interview aired before the Chicago Bears played the Minnesota Vikings on Monday night.

The 77-year-old old Ditka previously has made harsh comments about players who take a knee, which has sparked fierce debate about issues such as patriotism and protest. He said he would bench players who didn’t stand during the anthem.

Ditka went further on Monday, saying he didn’t know what “social injustices” players are protesting.

“There has been no oppression in the last 100 years that I know of,” he said.

Ditka’s comments triggered a quick backlash, with many chastising him for seemingly ignoring or not knowing about Jim Crow Laws that enforced racial segregation and the lynching of African Americans that occurred well into Ditka’s lifetime.

“Great coach ... clueless person,” tweeted retired NFL player Steve Smith.

Even in Chicago, where Ditka is revered, the reaction was critical and incredulous.

“It’s so ridiculous, it’s hard to have a conversation about it,” Carmen DeFalco, an ESPN radio host in Chicago, told Chicago television station WLS-TV. “I don’t know how you could grow up in this country — especially when he did — and be completely unaware of something as significant as the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s.”",Mike Ditka apologizes for comment on racial oppression,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/2017/10/11/mike-ditka-apologizes-for-comment-on-racial-oppression.html

The group, who was out fishing for brook trout, ended their day without much to show for it.

The next morning, Therre said, he got up early and was able to get some response from the fish with his “Lake Clear Wobbler with a small spinner and worm behind it.”

“This combination has been used in the Adirondacks for almost a century, The brook trout responded quickly. Unfortunately, nobody else had one,” he told NYup.com. “The nearest place was a several hour portage and trip to get there. Nobody else wanted to do that.”

So when they all stopped to have lunch, Therre’s son came up with his own solution to the lure shortage – he was going to make his own out of the leftovers from his lunch.

“We stopped to have lunch and my son had a sandwich and energy drink. As he took a sip and set his can down, he said, ‘I'm going to make a wobbler out of the (pink) can.’ I told him it was worth a try but wasn't sure it would work,” Therre said.

Excess space is a luxury that most of us do not enjoy while our kids are living at home. But many of my clients find that once their grown children have moved out of the house and established their own households, they suddenly have extra unused spaces. At some point, those childhood bedrooms get cleaned out and stand waiting for a fresh coat of paint and a new purpose.

If you’re lucky enough to have extra square footage in your nest, here are eight ideas for turning that space into something fit for your current lifestyle.

1. A walk-in closet and dressing room. I love the idea of transforming an extra bedroom into a beautiful walk-in closet and dressing room. Several of my clients have done this, gaining both functionality and luxury. One client was even able to connect her new dressing room to her master bath — a nice perk if your floor plan allows. Many companies specialize in custom cabinetry and closets and can help you add this extra bit of comfort to your home.

2. A home office. Some people telecommute, others finish work projects or emails after hours at home, while still others simply enjoy having a dedicated home office for paying bills and taking care of other personal business. An extra bedroom is a perfect option for a home office because the door can be closed for solitude and focus or to hide clutter. You might line closets in the room with custom shelving and cabinets. Or, if this level of construction is not in your budget, you might purchase some beautiful storage solutions at furniture stores that can help you create a good-looking and organized home office.

3. A guest bedroom. Perhaps your adult children live out of town and stay for several nights when they visit. Or maybe other friends or family members often bunk in your home. A dedicated guest room might be just what you need. To make this a relatively inexpensive project, you might repurpose some furniture from a child’s former bedroom. A fresh coat of paint, new bedding, and updated accessories may be all you need to complete its new look.

4. A craft room. If you are someone who enjoys scrapbooking, jewelry making, sewing or similar hobbies, a dedicated craft room may be exactly what you crave. Frequently, craft projects span days or even weeks, and putting supplies away in the middle of a project can be cumbersome. Even if your funds do not allow for built-ins, a large table and wall shelving can work wonders for storing and organizing craft materials.

5. A reading nook. Maybe you have been longing for a quiet, comfortable place to relax with a good book — a small spare bedroom easily could be outfitted for this purpose. You may be able to relocate a comfortable chair from elsewhere in your home. Add a good reading lamp and a small book shelf and, if you want to go further, paint the walls a new color and add accessories, artwork and throw pillows. A cozy blanket in a bright color is another inexpensive way to add style to your reading spot.

6. An exercise gym. Outfit a small extra bedroom with exercise equipment and a wall-mounted television. Watching your favorite show while working out can make the time much more pleasant — I’m speaking from experience here. Also, large wall mirrors not only make a small bedroom appear larger but can help you ensure correct form and prevent injuries.

7. A yoga or pilates studio. With an available bedroom, a quiet dedicated space for yoga or pilates may be an attainable luxury. If your space and budget allow, enhancing a new studio by adding sliding doors out to a private garden is a wonderful way to create a special place with plenty of light and fresh air. A bubbling fountain augments the mood. Painting the walls a cool, calming color such as blue or gray can also boost the tranquility.

8. A multifunctional space. If you have only one spare bedroom but a variety of needs, a Murphy bed or wall bed may be the solution for you. Multiple companies specialize in beds that fold effortlessly into an attractive wall cabinet when not needed. That way, you can use your spare room as a home office, craft space or exercise studio without a bed taking up floor space — at least not until just before your visiting children arrive.",How to make use and better your life with a spare bedroom,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/09/28/how-to-make-use-and-better-your-life-with-spare-bedroom.html

I now see I was lucky to have been a Boy Scout at that time instead of today.
Rest in Peace Boy Scouts.","Editor's note: The following column originally appeared on The Resurgent.

We all knew this was coming. The Boy Scouts of America stood for over a century on its strong foundation of Judeo-Christian values, growing boys into young men, and young men into leaders. However, in recent years the BSA has allowed cracks to form in that foundation.

From the lifting of the ban on openly gay boys from joining the organization, to the sanctioning of openly gay adult leaders, to the encouragement of so-called “transgendered” boys to join, the BSA’s moral foundation has been rapidly and steadily eroding into dust.

As soon as the BSA changed the definition of the phrase “morally straight” in the generations-old Scout Oath back in 2013, allowing for homosexual membership, we all knew that this first compromise would not be the last. We all knew that it was only a matter of time before the BSA compromised itself into oblivion.

That day has now arrived.

From the BSA’s website:

""Today, the Boy Scouts of America Board of Directors unanimously approved to welcome girls into its iconic Cub Scout program and to deliver a Scouting program for older girls that will enable them to advance and earn the highest rank of Eagle Scout.""

This is incredibly disappointing news, but in light of the BSA’s changes over the last few years, it isn’t at all surprising. It does, however, mark a complete transformation for the organization. The Boy Scouts has always been exclusively for boys. As Ben Shapiro famously noted, it’s in the name.

There are plenty of organizations out there for all different varieties of youth. The Boy Scouts even have several co-ed programs for both boys and girls. The girls already have the Girl Scouts. If the Girl Scouts isn’t working, why not work to fix that organization instead? There is absolutely no need for the Boy Scouts to change who they are to be “inclusive.”

What now separates the Boy Scouts from any other youth organization? The BSA has now effectively rendered obsolete both the Boy Scouts and the Girl Scouts. If the Boy Scouts is a better youth organization for girls, why would any girl ever want to join the Girl Scouts?

More incredibly, I have to wonder why any parent would want their young teenage girls camping in the woods with young teenage boys? Who exactly is okay with this?

As an Eagle Scout myself, this is an incredibly difficult piece for me to write. My fondest memories from my youth come from my time in Boy Scouts. I learned a great deal about myself, about leadership, and about manhood in those years. The friendships I made with both adult leaders and fellow Scouts can never be replaced. Earning the rank of Eagle Scout in 2002 was the greatest achievement of my life at the time. Another honor was when my beloved Scout troop invited me back to town to participate in its centennial celebration earlier this year. My scouting experiences have guided me throughout my adulthood and will continue to do so.

I now see I was lucky to have been a Boy Scout at that time instead of today. Those experiences would not have been the same had the BSA not been so strict on its membership policies. It is important for boys and young men to grow together free from the distraction of girls.

I suspect the Almighty Dollar now motivates BSA more than the Almighty. Membership (and revenue) has been declining steadily for years. Suddenly membership eligibility is now opened to a whole new demographic. Draw your own conclusions there.

This is what the Left does best: target and destroy everything good in America. They cannot compete with us on ideas, so they have to eliminate everything that makes us who we are. If they were truly motivated to provide girls, homosexuals, and “transgenders,” with the same experiences Boy Scouts provides, then they would form their own youth organization. But it isn’t really about that, is it?

The Mertz glacier tongue cracking off in 2010 also played a significant role in the region, reported The Guardian.","A colony of about 40,000 Adélie penguins in Antarctica suffered a “catastrophic breeding event” after French scientists discovered only two chicks survived at the start of the year -- the second time in the past four years the population has been ravaged by starvation, reported The Guardian.

In response to the breeding tragedy, researchers are now seeking the creation of a marine protected area in East Antarctica.

Scientists found thousands of dead or unhatched chicks in East Antarctica, which has been attributed to an unusual amount of sea ice coupled with extensive rain that left the colony of about 18,000 breeding penguin pairs traveling longer distances to find food, and chicks struggling to keep dry and warm.

The colony suffered a similar occurrence in 2013 where no chicks survived, reported The Guardian.

Recently, Antarctica has had low numbers of summer sea ice, but the area around the colony was an exception. The Mertz glacier tongue cracking off in 2010 also played a significant role in the region, reported The Guardian.

“The Mertz glacier impact on the region sets the scene in 2010 and when unusual meteorological events, driven by large climatic variations, hit in some years this leads to massive failures,” Ropert-Coudert told the Guardian. “In other words, there may still be years when the breeding will be OK, or even good for this colony, but the scene is set for massive impacts to hit on a more or less regular basis.”

Ropert-Coudert added that the increase in sea ice is negatively impacting the species, and noted that “optimum sea-ice cover” is needed to “thrive.”

Climate change as well as fishing and tourism has also had an impact on the Adélie penguins, resulting in decreased populations and the fear of possible extinction according to some researchers, reported The Guardian.","Only two chicks survive as colony of 40,000 penguins suffer breeding tragedy",http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/10/13/only-two-chicks-survive-as-colony-40000-penguins-suffer-breeding-tragedy.html

Obama and his administration wanted to be as much a part of Hollywood as Hollywood wanted to be a part of him.","Last year at the 89th Annual Academy Awards, then-Vice President Joe Biden walked on stage to a standing ovation to introduce Lady Gaga. He gave a passionate speech on the topic of campus sexual assault, about the need to speak up and “intervene in situations when consent has not or cannot be given.”

In 2013, Michelle Obama appeared at the Oscars via satellite from the White House decked in full evening gown and flanked by U.S. military service members to announce the winner of the best picture Oscar, which just so happened to go to director Ben Affleck’s “Argo.”

These are just two of the most prominent examples of how closely the Obama administration – and with it, the Democratic Party – has been tied to Hollywood, using them as messengers to push their agenda out to the mass public.

The late night hosts who only last week were happy to help Chuck Schumer push the Democrats’ gun control message are suddenly mute when it comes to Weinstein. And this is exactly where the Democrats find themselves in a bind. The party has depended on celebrity messaging for eight years.

It’s also the reason why Democrats can’t easily undo their connections to the sexual assault scandal involving super mogul Harvey Weinstein that is currently rocking the foundations of the industry.

Weinstein once stated that Hollywood “has the best moral compass, because it has compassion” – and for the past eight or so years, the Democratic Party has embraced Weinstein and his philosophy on Hollywood.

The flirtations between the party and Hollywood were not simply brief cameos at awards shows. President Obama used Hollywood to push almost every social action program his administration rolled out.

On ObamaCare, he enrolled the likes of Lebron James in a promotional video, Bill Murray in an Oval Office visit, and his famous “Between Two Ferns” appearance with Zach Galifianakis. Several celebrities, including Amy Pohler, Connie Britton, Olivia Wilde and Lady Gaga, Mark Ruffalo, Alyssa Milano and Mia Farrow participated in hashtag campaigns to “#GetCovered”. Liberal news outlet Mother Jones was kind enough to cull most of them into one piece.

When Obama wanted to give the impression he was tackling prison reform, he went to HBO and Vice. On Opioid abuse, he enlisted pop rapper Macklemore and MTV to film a video at the White House. Tom Hanks wrote about the virtues of free community college for the New York Times. Christina Hendricks was invited by the White House to speak at a family values summit. Alison Janney of West Wing fame cameoed to a twitterpated White House press corps.

On the Iran Deal, Obama enlisted Morgan Freeman as well as comedian and nuclear physicist Jack Black. Saturday Night Live, which refused to address the Weinstein scandal altogether last weekend, sang “To Sir With Love” to send Obama off into the sunset after eight years of Hollywood doting. By the end of his term, Obama had gone full Hollywood, appearing with Jerry Seinfeld simply for the fun of it.

This was why, despite very few actual legislative accomplishments, Obama’s presidency always felt more relevant in the moment than perhaps it actually was. It was so intertwined with the same faces in our culture that we see on magazine stands, album covers, movie screens and sitcoms. Obama always felt fresh and cool among the Hollywood elite, despite his party being decimated out from underneath him in consecutive congressional wave elections.

Obama and his administration wanted to be as much a part of Hollywood as Hollywood wanted to be a part of him. This was his chosen path to push his agenda -- through the people in culture with the loudest microphones whom he felt could influence the largest number of people to fall in line with his ideas.

Hillary Clinton tried to mimic this same strategy with her campaign, enlisting athletes, TV stars and pop stars to help drag her over the finish line. Clinton chose high-priced Hollywood fundraisers at the homes of stars like Gwenyth Paltrow over campaign stops in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Names such as George Clooney (also a personal friend of the Obamas), Ben Affleck and Matt Damon offered public support. Clooney alone raised $1.5 million for Clinton at a fundraiser in April of last year, with such names as Spielberg and Katzenberg in attendance.

Clinton regularly appeared on the campaign trail next to celebs such as Jay Z (a personal friend of Weinstein’s) and Beyoncé. Lena Dunham appeared with her in Ohio (a state she lost), as did the cast of the long defunct “West Wing.” Katy Perry was a Clinton campaign staple, even outfitting herself in dresses with Hillary’s slogan and logos. Actress Elizabeth Banks appeared at the Democratic Convention this past year, expertly mocking Donald Trump’s strobe light spaceship entrance onto the stage.

None of this, it seems, worked against Trump – who was able to tap into the forgotten voters of the rural rustbelt. These are the voters who don’t much care what Jimmy Kimmel or Sean Penn or Leonardo DiCaprio are preaching to them about the Earth’s climate or gun control – maybe because they’re more worried about the fact that they can’t afford their health care premium and have to use money to pay for their ObamaCare tax penalty that they could have used to fix their house, or car, or take their family on a vacation instead.

In fact, it seems the more Democrats have depended on Hollywood stars to sell their message, the more that most of the middle class in the middle of the country have tuned them out as their legislative and electoral majorities shrink.

Actress Alyssa Milano and other entertainment types campaigned actively for Democrat John Ossoff, who lost a money-soaked election in Georgia’s 6th District in June. Hollywood was also vocal in Montana’s May congressional election, where Republican Greg Gianforte coasted to victory, even after being charged for assaulting a reporter only days before.

The question now, heading into 2018 and 2020, is where does the party go without its celebrity base – which they have almost no choice but to shun in the fallout surrounding Harvey Weinstein and Hollywood’s pathetically lame (and delayed) response to the “open secret” (according to many) of his decades-long sexual exploitation of women.

Weinstein’s connections run deeper than simple campaign donations. Weinstein sold influence. He was so “in” among the Democratic Power Base that President Obama felt comfortable enough allowing his teenage daughter to intern for his film company. For the Democrats and their party, hoping to catch the coattails of the Obama cool they’ve been severely lacking since his exit, severing their connections to an industry facing a crisis of character will be easier said than done.

The late night hosts who only last week were happy to help Chuck Schumer push the Democrats’ gun control message are suddenly mute when it comes to Weinstein. And this is exactly where the Democrats find themselves in a bind. The party has depended on celebrity messaging for the better part of eight years, and were clearly planning to depend on it heading into the 2018 and 2020 elections (remember Maxine Waters appearing to raucous applause as a voice of The Resistance™ at the MTV Movie Awards?).

But the days of happy backslapping with Ben Affleck and George Clooney are coming to an end for a party that now has to distance itself from celebrity-spokespeople who were content to lecture the rest of the country about their religion, their guns or their politics – but who couldn’t seem to bring themselves to clean up their own house by calling out one of their closest friends and business colleagues for preying upon vulnerable young women – for years.



If the Democrats were a smart party – and they’ve done nothing of late to suggest that they are – they would be huddling in offices around the parts of the country they lost, devising a plan of action on how to move on without Hollywood spokespeople who will do nothing but remind voters of their association with Weinstein.

Distancing themselves from Hollywood and Weinstein could, in fact, ultimately be a gift to a decimated party flailing for a message beyond symbolic resistance. It could force Democrats to get back to the dirty work of organizing at a grassroots level and focusing on a message that appeals to that big useless chunk of land between Los Angeles and New York.

But just as it was apparently evident with Harvey Weinstein, the rest of Hollywood isn’t particularly good at taking “no” for answer.",Weinstein scandal -- Can Democrats afford to cut Hollywood loose?,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/13/weinstein-scandal-can-democrats-afford-to-cut-hollywood-loose.html

“Being pregnant is supposed to be one of the most amazing journeys you will ever embark on,” Brianna wrote. “You're creating a new life. You are experiencing unconditional love for someone you have not even met.”

Austin's accident happened when Brianna was nine months pregnant, she wrote. She said she went to bed, then woke up to a life-changing scene.

“I still remember my mother in law waking me up that morning. ‘Austin had an accident,’"" she said. ""All I knew was that my husband was in the hospital. The worst part? I didn't know why.""

Brianna wrote that her husband had suffered a brain hemorrhage, and says doctors blamed it on “excessive energy drink consumption” after running a toxicology screen and ruling out drugs.

Austin was already in surgery by the time Brianna and family arrived at the hospital. It wasn’t until nearly five hours later that she got to see her husband, Brianna wrote.

“The next day was round two of brain surgery. Following this were strokes, seizures, swelling, and more things we weren't prepared for. There was a moment, sitting by his hospital bed, just praying he would be okay, that I knew I would never give up on him. No matter how messy our life would become. I was going to be by his side through all of it.""

Judging by photos shared of Austin and Brianna shared on Endres Photography's Facebook page — which, too, appear to have been removed from the site — doctors had removed part of Austin's skull during his surgeries.

Brianna, meanwhile, was still unsure of her husband's fate. ""After two weeks of living in a hospital, wondering if he would survive or be taken from us, [the family] made our way back home. The time had come for me to deliver our baby.”

Austin was still in the hospital when Brianna delivered their baby, but she said that “a beautiful miracle happened as I delivered our son. Austin woke up.”

“I went about a week without seeing him. I thought about him every day. I cried as I looked at my child who looked just like his daddy. When the baby was only a week old, I left him with my in-laws. I knew I needed to see Austin. I needed to tell him that our baby was here,” she said.

Waste pullouts are a secret weapon of the well-oiled kitchen machine. They do the dirty job of handling your garbage, recycling and more. In fact, among surveyed homeowners who are remodeling a kitchen and upgrading cabinets, the No. 1 storage addition is a pullout waste or recycling cabinet, according to the latest Houzz kitchen trends study. But what makes them better than a regular garbage can? Actually, a pullout bin can have quite a few advantages, both in style and function. Here are some reasons why a humble pullout cabinet for waste deserves a little consideration and a space in your kitchen.

Out of sight, out of mind. When you think about your dream kitchen, what do you imagine? I’ll bet the garbage bin is not the first thing that comes to mind. But then, this is the whole point of a waste pullout: It tucks the garbage, recycling and other waste bins out of sight but within easy access. That way you don’t have to look at a messy freestanding bin or struggle with a tiny, seemingly always full can tucked under the sink.

Seamless integration. Because a waste pullout is essentially just a very deep drawer, it can easily be integrated into the look of your cabinetry, bringing some great contemporary functionality to very traditional or transitional style.

In fact, it’s quite common for a pullout drawer to be faced out with multiple false fronts to help it blend more seamlessly into a cabinet scheme.

RELATED: Pick Out the Perfect Drawer Pulls

Ease of use. If you cook often, one of the trickiest and yet most common tasks is sweeping away the remnants from chopping. You can carefully carry a chopping board to the bin, or you can bring the bin to the chopping board. Locating your garbage or compost pullout below a chopping zone means you can sweep waste directly into the bin with ease.

Here’s another smart take on this idea: a pullout chopping block (in place of a typical drawer) positioned above a waste pullout, with a simple hole to allow for trimmings to be swept directly into the bin. A great option for small kitchens, as the whole chopping station can be closed away when not in use, and the main counter can still be used for other things.

Waste sorting. Pullout cabinets aren’t just useful for holding your garbage bins. More and more cities today not only facilitate recycling or composting, they also require some level of waste sorting, and this requires managing multiple bins.

Depending on the system you use, you can easily have space for two sizable bins, or many smaller ones, configured with one tucked behind the other in a full-depth cabinet, or side by side, or many other configurations to suit your typical needs.

Odor control. One major concern that people often have with waste bins is the odors that can linger in the kitchen. There are several possible ways to combat this issue, and one is by using compartments with individual lids for organic waste.

Some waste pullout systems even integrate a special bin with a securely sealing lid specifically to hold compost, so you don’t have to change it with excessive frequency just to keep odors in check. Keep in mind how quickly it will fill; you’ll want to plan ahead so that organic waste isn’t left sitting exposed to air for too long.

Another option is to put different types of waste into their own cabinets with appropriately sized bins so that you only have to open the relevant compartment at any particular time. You can devote more space for plastics and less for compost, or vice versa, depending on your needs.

All-in-one storage. If you want to make sure nobody has an excuse for not changing the bin when it’s full, try a drawer that includes a small storage drawer inside, and you can keep garbage bags and related products right by the bins themselves.

You can also use interior drawers to split compartments into smaller subcompartments or to keep cleaning products or deodorizers on hand.

A fit for any budget. Want a fully luxe look? For just a little extra investment, a system with side panels (which can be custom fitted by your cabinetmaker) will more fully cover the bins for a discreet look even while the cabinet is pulled open.

Meanwhile, at the other end of the budget spectrum, pullout systems integrated into a standard door cabinet can turn any underused space into a garbage pullout with room for multiple bins without a total renovation. Plus, for dexterous chefs, they can be pulled and pushed by foot to facilitate disposal even when hands are full.",7 reasons to consider pullout waste and recycling cabinets,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/08/03/7-reasons-to-consider-pullout-waste-and-recycling-cabinets.html

How to create a substance-free family culture that can sustain a family business?
Make no bones about the fact that substance abuse is not what your family does.
It’s a genuine investment that will pay dividends – for your family business, yes, but more importantly, for your family’s sense of belonging.","Just last month, the Department of Health and Human Services announced its intention to dedicate an extra $144 million towards fighting the opioid crisis – a decision which, while helpful, is long overdue. Substance abuse, and opioid abuse in particular, continues to wreak havoc on this country. Ninety-one Americans die each day from opioid abuse, and drug offenders make up the large part of our nation’s incarcerated population.

It’s a health care problem, it’s a criminal justice problem – but it’s also a family problem, and it’s one that is especially challenging for families who run a family business. I’ve spent all of my life and much of my career observing and advising family businesses, and time and time again I’ve seen that substance abuse plays a large role in the sad fact that 70 percent of family-owned businesses don’t make it past one generation. The collateral damage when a family business falls apart extends to the employees, the stockholders, the lenders, the suppliers, the customers, and even the tax base and economic health of the entire community.

And, economic consequences aside, addiction has deep emotional consequences and can destroy what is an otherwise healthy family business. A longtime friend of mine recently confided in me his sorrow over his two sons, both of whom had been doing wonderfully in college – until they discovered alcohol and quickly become addicted.

My friend tried putting his sons in treatment programs, but it didn’t work. He tried tough love, but his kids wound up hating him. His business prospered, but today his children won’t speak to him. He can’t hand his business on to them, his hoped-for legacy is in tatters, and much of what gave his life meaning has vaporized. What good, he asks himself, does it do to succeed financially and fail as a family?

I was deeply saddened by my friend’s story, but even more saddened to learn that he’s not alone.

One study found that more than half of family businesses had or were struggling with an addiction issue within the family. This may sound shocking, but it stacks up with other statistics: One in ten Americans have struggled with some kind of drug abuse and one in eight with alcohol abuse. Many American families don’t know whether their life’s work will live beyond them into the next generation or whether addiction and substance abuse will have the final say.

So – what to do? How to create a substance-free family culture that can sustain a family business? How to avoid heartbreaking situations like the one my friend found himself in?

There’s no one single answer, and even among healthy families, things will look different. But I’ve generally found that among the families that last, three core values were emphasized:

Be clear. Make no bones about the fact that substance abuse is not what your family does. Parents have far more influence than they know. According to Joe Califano, former Secretary of Health Education and Welfare under President Carter and the founder of the Center on Addiction and Substance (CASA), “Parent power is the greatest weapon we have to curb substance abuse.”

He encourages parents to emphasize that substance abuse is not simply illegal but seriously dangerous, and to take the same attitude towards it that they do towards asbestos. Most parents would be in an uproar if they found out their child’s school has asbestos, but are willing to let substance abuse in school slide. And kids respond to this kind of clear condemnation: Those who know their parents would be “very upset” are more likely to abstain from drugs and alcohol than those who know their parents would only be “a little” or “not upset at all.”

Be together. Oftentimes, risky behaviors result from unloving homes. When children do not feel loved and valued by their parents, they are far more likely to look for love elsewhere – and oftentimes, that means succumbing to peer pressure to win admiration and acceptance.

Simply spending time together – without screens and without distractions – will increase family bonding and a child’s sense of worth and belonging. CASA found that teens who eat dinner with their parents fewer than three nights each week are more susceptible to smoking, drinking and drug abuse than those who eat with their parents five nights or more each week.

Be fun. Teach kids early on that you can have fun and be creative without substances. If they see you getting creative and enjoying yourself without alcohol and drugs, they’re less likely to turn to those things as a way to have fun.

Whatever you do, whether it be sports, board games, arts and crafts, or music, it’s important to intentionally set aside time to do it.

These things are important for all families that want to develop a strong family culture – but they are especially important for parents who themselves come from families that struggle with substance abuse. Creating a stable family is particularly hard when you have genetics and family patterns working against you – but not impossible.

Dr. Falk Lohoff, a scholar at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, argues that “While genetic factors can increase the risk of becoming addicted, they are not deterministic. There are also protective factors.” And one of the biggest protective factors is simple delay. CASA found that with each year of delay in substance use, the likelihood of addiction drops.

By putting the hard work in now of establishing clear values, spending quality time together and having creative, clean fun, you can create the kind of culture where your children will not only be able to perpetuate the family business, but will actually want to work for you and with you. It’s a genuine investment that will pay dividends – for your family business, yes, but more importantly, for your family’s sense of belonging. ​",Mitzi Perdue: Substance abuse is sinking America's family businesses.

Each day, Faulkner will continue the conversation on the top news stories by utilizing the resources of FNC journalists in the field, plus one-on-one interviews with newsmakers and roundtable discussions with the network’s top contributors. Outnumbered Overtime originally debuted as a web show led by Faulkner following the TV version every day and her new program will seek to harness the popularity of that effort.

Faulkner added, “Three years ago, we enhanced cable news with a show that combines news and opinion, predominantly from the female point of view, and immediately, Outnumbered became the number one show in its timeslot. I am proud of the work we’re continuing to do there, and blessed to have this added opportunity to create a new program that will help inform our viewers and keep them engaged in a conversation surrounding the day’s headlines.”

Smith commented, “There’s no one better in the business than Bill Hemmer and I am honored to kick off the network’s news hours with him, informing our viewers of the biggest stories and issues driving the day.”

Following Outnumbered Overtime, Perino will host The Daily Briefing at 2PM/ET, an hour often dominated by breaking news, White House press briefings, and more from Washington and around the nation. With her understanding of what makes news, how to respond to it and her unique political expertise, Perino will break it all down with insight from key Beltway experts.

Perino remarked, “Our new show will aim to take on the major issues facing Americans and explore them from all angles. I am excited for this opportunity to draw from my political background to help our viewers get beyond the headlines and better understand what is really going on behind the scenes in Washington each day.”

Three rhinoceros calves, rescued during monsoon floods over the past two years at a famed wildlife preserve in India's northeast, were transported Friday to a zoo as part of a conservation program.

The calves, aged 1to 2, were taken by trucks to the zoo in Gauhati, the capital of Assam state, from the Center for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation near Kaziranga National Park, said Tajas Mariswamy, a regional forest officer.

Injured or orphaned wild animals are treated at the center and returned to their natural habitats or to adopted homes.

The Gauhati Zoo already has eight rhinoceroses.

Every year Kaziranga National Park, which has the world's largest population of more than 2,500 one-horned rhinoceroses as well as many other species, gets flooded by heavy monsoon rains which force animals to move to higher ground. India's monsoon season runs from June through September.

S.M. Singh, director of the park, said Friday that during this year's monsoon 32 rhinos died because of floods.

Three songs into his show in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the singer launched into a five-minute speech that honored the 58 killed and nearly 500 hurt in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. But Aldean took a defiant tone in telling concertgoers to resist living in fear, and he called for more of the national unity he's seen since the attack.

Miller, 34, said Aldean made them proud and viewed the evening as a triumph.

""It was therapeutic and kind of like a cleansing all at the same time,"" she said. ""We just wanted to represent family, friends, love and hope.""

Aldean gave fans the show they wanted. The Georgia native is one of country music's biggest stars, touring in support of his album ""They Don't Know,"" which debuted atop the Billboard 200 in 2016. Much of his catalog includes Southern rock, pop and hip-hop influences, a mix of hard-charging party anthems and ballads with lyrics about farm work, drinking and small-town life.

He blasted through hits including ""Big Green Tractor,"" ''Fly Over States"" and ""She's Country,"" and popped open a can of beer onstage after the encore.

Aldean canceled shows in California last week to mourn those killed Oct. 1 at the outdoor Route 91 festival. He resumed his tour in an arena where concertgoers walked through metal detectors, and police presence was visible.

During my years of painting people’s homes, I’ve learned that small spaces don’t have to be boring or go unnoticed. All it takes is a little paint. By adding paint in strategic places around the home, you can easily and inexpensively transform a space. Plus, there is a good chance you could accomplish at least one of these eight painting projects during the course of one weekend.

Here are eight spaces to consider painting and my tips and tricks on making even the smallest places have a big impact.

1. Entryway. When a guest arrives, their first impression is based on your home’s exterior and the front door. Realtors call this curb appeal. But the very next thing guests will notice is the area right inside your front door, so you should use it to make a statement.

If your home has a formal entry, choose a paint color that is one to two shades darker than the next room. A darker paint color in the entryway can make the space feel more inviting, like a warm hug.

If your home has an open floor plan without a defined entryway, use paint to create one. Try a bold color on the wall surrounding the front door and an adjacent wall as visual borders for the entry.

2. Hall bath. Small bathrooms might appear to be limited when it comes to design, but they can easily be transformed with a quick paint color update.

How do you pick a color for this small bathroom? Look around your home for spots of color that crop up in your art or drapes. For example, a living room that is mostly beige with blue accent pieces would coordinate well with a bathroom painted in that same shade of blue.

RELATED: What Color Works Best in a Traditional-Style Bathroom?

Dark colors also have been trending with homeowners I’ve worked with lately. To offset the dark nature of the paint, we typically recommend keeping the other design details, such as the floors and sink, light to make sure the room still feels open and bright.

Worried one color will overwhelm the small space? Consider installing a chair rail as a natural divider. Then paint the lower portion of the wall in a statement color while leaving the wall area above a neutral tone.

3. Bookshelf. Whether the bookshelves in your home are built-in or freestanding, you can easily create style with paint. Remove the shelves from the surround and paint the back wall of the case. Don’t be afraid to go bold with your paint color, because once the shelves and objects on the shelves are in place, your color choice will seem more subtle. You will get an instant pop of color without being too in-your-face.

4. Closet. This space is often overlooked when it comes to paint, but a fresh coat of paint on the walls and shelving in your closet can go a long way. With a small- or medium-sized closet, keep your paint color choice bright and light.

With a large walk-in closet, consider using a paint color that complements the attached room.

For shelving, use an oil-based paint for durability against scratches and scuffs.

5. Hallway. Hallways are typically long and narrow and, depending on the lighting, can also be dark. When choosing a paint color for the hallway, consider the paint colors in connecting rooms and then go one to two shades lighter. The colors will complement each other and coordinate the home’s overall design. Plus, a lighter shade will brighten up the passageway.

6. Accent wall. If you have a small amount of paint and want to make the biggest impact on your home’s design, then an accent wall is your best bet. Choose a wall in your living room or master bedroom that you want to highlight, such as the area behind the sofa or bed.

Once it is painted, hang coordinating artwork on the accent wall to finish the design.

7. Kitchen nooks and crannies. Typically, I find there isn’t too much paintable space in the kitchen. But when I do find it, it’s between the cabinets, appliances and backsplash.

When space is limited, I always encourage owners to go bold and use colors that offset the room’s features. For example, in a kitchen with white cabinets and natural stone countertops, pick a hunter green or dark blue. In large quantities, these dark shades might feel overwhelming, but in small quantities, they give the room a strong dimension.

8. Laundry room. You can’t avoid the task of laundry, so at least make it a room that is easy on the eyes and generates positivity. Think of a paint color you would never dream of using in the social areas of your home but would make you happy, such as a playful orange, a bold purple or a sunshine yellow. Who knows, being around your favorite color might even make the chore a little more enjoyable.",Transform a whole house by painting these 8 small spaces,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/09/22/transform-whole-house-by-painting-these-8-small-spaces.html

Austrians elect a new government Sunday with polls indicating that the country will drift strongly to the right.

Here are some questions and answers about the election, and why it's significant beyond Austria's borders.

___

WHY NOW — AND WHO ARE THE MAIN CONTENDERS?

Sunday's vote is coming a year ahead of schedule after squabbles lead to the breakup last spring of the coalition government of the Social Democrats and the People's Party. A total of 16 parties are vying for 183 seats in the national parliament and will be chosen by Austria's 6.4 million eligible voters.

The People's Party, which has shifted from centrist to right-wing positions, is leading in the pre-vote polls. Austria's traditionally right-wing and anti-migrant Freedom Party is second and the center-left Social Democrats are trailing in third place. Others that may clear the 4 percent hurdle needed to get into parliament are the Greens, the liberal NEOS, and Liste Pilz, led by former Greens politician Peter Pilz.

__

WHAT'S BEHIND AUSTRIA'S RIGHTWARD DRIFT?

In a word— migrants. The 2015 influx of hundreds of thousands of people fleeing the war in Syria and poverty elsewhere into the EU's prosperous heartland left Austria with nearly 100,000 new and mostly Muslim migrants. That has fueled fears Austria's traditional Western and Christian culture is in danger. As a result, voters are receptive to the anti-migrant platforms of both the People's Party and the Freedom Party.

Although the Social Democrats have come either first or second in elections since World War II, voters are not receptive right now to the party's focus on social justice.

___

WHY IS THE PEOPLE'S PARTY AHEAD OF THE FREEDOM PARTY?

While their anti-migrant message is similar, the delivery differs. The Freedom Party has long used inflammatory and negative terminology in describing migrants in general and Muslims in particular. While it has publicly dissociated itself from decades of covert anti-Semitism, it continues to attract the neo-Nazi fringe. The People's Party in contrast, has no tradition of anti-Semitism and speaks of the perceived need to crack down on illegal migration and radical Islam in more measured terms. That makes it attractive to voters concerned about migrants and Muslims but who reject the racist and xenophobic sentiment many associate with the Freedom Party.

___

HOW HAS THE PEOPLE'S PARTY REINVENTED ITSELF?

As the government coalition was unraveling, the People's Party appointed Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz as its head, and the telegenic 31-year old set about to reinvent the party's image.

Long criticized as a stodgy old-boys network, the party under Kurz now sells itself as a fresh wind in the political landscape. It shrugs off criticism that it was part of the political establishment for decades — and that it has coopted Freedom Party positions on immigration that it has long opposed.

As Kurz's star waxes, Chancellor Christian Kern's is waning. The former head of Austria's state railway has seen his message as the bringer of change usurped by Kurz.

___

POST-VOTE SCENARIOS AND WHAT THAT MEANS FOR EUROPE

Polls suggest the People's Party will win Sunday's vote and the Freedom Party will come in second. With Kern saying the Social Democrats will go into the opposition if they do not win and a handful of other parties struggling to just get into parliament, the most likely scenario is a People's Party-Freedom Party coalition. But others are possible, depending on the results.

No one expects the European Union to impose sanctions on Austria like it did the last time the Freedom Party entered government in 2000. Still, because the party encourages euroskeptic and anti-immigrant sentiment, many would view its move into government as renewed evidence of right-wing political sentiment in Europe.",Austria's national vote Sunday: Questions and answers,https://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/10/13/austrias-national-vote-sunday-questions-and-answers.html

Officials have said that Trump hates the requirement more than the nuclear deal itself because it forces him to take a position every three months on what he has repeatedly denounced as the worst deal in American history.
American allies, who have pressed the White House to remain in the nuclear accord, will be closely watching the president's address.
The Europeans, along with the other parties, Iran, Russia and China, have ruled out reopening the deal.","President Donald Trump will say Friday the Iran nuclear deal is no longer in U.S. national security interests, but he won't withdraw from the landmark 2015 accord or immediately re-impose sanctions against Tehran, according to U.S. officials and outside advisers to the administration.

Trump's speech from the White House will outline specific faults he finds in the pact but will also focus on an array of Iran's troubling non-nuclear activities, four officials and advisers said. Those include Tehran's ballistic missile program, support for Syrian President Bashar Assad, Lebanon's Hezbollah movement and other groups that destabilize the region, including in Yemen, human rights abuses and cyber warfare.

In his speech, Trump will notify Congress that he is ""decertifying"" the deal, arguing that while Iran may be complying with the letter of the agreement, the accord itself is not sufficient to be in U.S. interests.

The decertification will not pull the U.S. out of the agreement or re-impose sanctions, but it will kick those matters to Congress. U.S. lawmakers will then have 60 days to decide whether to snap the sanctions back into place or modify the legislation that governs U.S. participation in the deal.

Under current U.S. law, Trump faces a Sunday deadline to notify Congress whether Iran is complying with the accord that was negotiated over 18 months by the Obama administration and determine if it remains a national security priority. Although Trump will allow that Iran is living up to the letter of the agreement, he will make the case that the deal is fatally flawed and that its non-nuclear behavior violates the spirit of the regional stability it was intended to encourage, the officials and advisers said.

The officials and advisers, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly preview the speech, said Trump will not call for a re-imposition of nuclear sanctions on Tehran. He will instead urge lawmakers to codify tough new requirements for Tehran to continue to benefit from the sanctions relief that it won in exchange for curbing its atomic program, they said. And he'll announce his long-anticipated intent to impose sanctions on portions of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps by designating them terrorist organization under an existing executive order, according to the officials and advisers.

""The reckless behavior of the Iranian regime, and the IRGC in particular, poses one of the most dangerous threats to the interests of the United States and to regional stability,"" the White House said in a statement released ahead of the speech. The statement, which did not reveal Trump's decision, denounced the Obama administration for its ""myopic focus on Iran's nuclear program to the exclusion of the regime's many other malign activities"" and said the same ""mistakes"" would not be repeated.

""The Trump administration's Iran policy will address the totality of these threats from and malign activities by the Government of Iran and will seek to bring about a change in the Iranian's regime's behavior,"" it said.

Ali Larijani, Iran's parliament speaker, said Friday that any U.S. move against a nuclear deal with Iran would be an ""insult"" to the United Nations because the U.N. had given the deal its blessing.

He added that any revision of the deal would allow Iran to take its own actions, and warned that the U.S. move could destabilize the international situation.

""We will continue to adhere to our obligations ... for as long as other parties observe the agreement,"" he said on a visit to Russia.

Officials have said that Trump hates the requirement more than the nuclear deal itself because it forces him to take a position every three months on what he has repeatedly denounced as the worst deal in American history. That frequency has also irritated aides who have complained that they are spending inordinate amounts of time on certification at the expense of other issues.

White House aides had initially sought a venue for Trump's address that would project American power and determination. The shuttered former Iranian embassy in Washington was briefly considered before being deemed inappropriate. Officials also considered the Iwo Jima Marine Corps Memorial, which was ruled out because it is currently being renovated. The Diplomatic Reception Room at the White House was eventually agreed.

American allies, who have pressed the White House to remain in the nuclear accord, will be closely watching the president's address. Trump wants to impress on the European parties to the accord — Germany, France and Britain — the importance of fixing what he sees as flaws in the nuclear accord and addressing malign behavior not covered in the agreement.

The Europeans, along with the other parties, Iran, Russia and China, have ruled out reopening the deal. But some, notably France, have signaled a willingness to tackle unresolved issues in supplementary negotiations. Among those issues are the expiration of several restrictions on advanced nuclear activity under so-called ""sunset clauses"" that will allow Iran to begin ramping up its enrichment capabilities after 10 years, the end of an arms embargo and the eventual easing of demands for a halt to its missile program.

In the speech, Trump hopes to ""recruit"" the Europeans into joining his broad strategy, particularly by punishing the Revolutionary Guard, which he and his national security team believe is fomenting instability, violence and extremism throughout the Middle East and beyond, according to one official.

In anticipation of Trump's announcements, Republican legislators have drawn up a new version of the law replacing the current 90-day timetable with ""semi-annual"" certifications, according to drafts seen by the Associated Press this week.

Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Bob Corker said in a statement on Friday that his panel had agreed to fresh certification criteria to include items that are also the province of the U.N. nuclear watchdog and require the U.S. intelligence community to determine if Iran is carrying out illicit activity in facilities to which the International Atomic Energy Agency has not had access.

The certification would also demand that the intelligence community produce judgments on Iranian behavior not covered by the nuclear deal, including missile testing and development, backing for Hezbollah and Assad and threats to Israel and the Mideast more broadly, according to the drafts.

“Baldwin called the driver of a big black SUV ‘a meatball’ and kept asking him and the passenger to get out,” said the witness, who noticed the incident after it had already begun.

In a string of fiery tweets, McGowan said she repeatedly warned Amazon about “HW” and “begged” the company not to work with the movie mogul but was told by an unnamed studio executive that “it hadn’t been proven.”

The actress also alleged Amazon Studios killed a show she planned to write and direct after she heard “a Weinstein bailout was in the works.”

“I forcefully begged studio head to do the right thing,” McGowan tweeted. “I was ignored. Deal was done. Amazon won a dirty Oscar.”

Amazon said the company is ""reviewing our options for our projects we have with the Weinstein Company.""

Meanwhile, an Amazon rep told Variety and TheWrap Thursday night that Amazon Studios head Roy Price was a ""on leave of absence effective immediately.""

Price's reported suspension came after Isa Hackett, a producer for Amazon’s “The Man in the High Castle,” told The Hollywood Reporter that he repeatedly propositioned her at a company party in July 2015.

Hackett said that Price started making lewd comments during a cab ride to the party -- and continued even after she told him she's a lesbian with a wife and children, the magazine reported. At one point, Hackett claimed that Price told her: ""You will love my d--k.""

Hackett claimed Price did not stop once they arrived at the party and even approached her and loudly said “Anal sex!” in her ear.

In 2013, Michelle Obama appeared at the Oscars via satellite from the White House decked in full evening gown and flanked by U.S. military service members to announce the winner of the best picture Oscar, which just so happened to go to director Ben Affleck’s “Argo.”

These are just two of the most prominent examples of how closely the Obama administration – and with it, the Democratic Party – has been tied to Hollywood, using them as messengers to push their agenda out to the mass public.

The late night hosts who only last week were happy to help Chuck Schumer push the Democrats’ gun control message are suddenly mute when it comes to Weinstein. And this is exactly where the Democrats find themselves in a bind. The party has depended on celebrity messaging for eight years.

It’s also the reason why Democrats can’t easily undo their connections to the sexual assault scandal involving super mogul Harvey Weinstein that is currently rocking the foundations of the industry.

Weinstein once stated that Hollywood “has the best moral compass, because it has compassion” – and for the past eight or so years, the Democratic Party has embraced Weinstein and his philosophy on Hollywood.

The flirtations between the party and Hollywood were not simply brief cameos at awards shows. President Obama used Hollywood to push almost every social action program his administration rolled out.

On ObamaCare, he enrolled the likes of Lebron James in a promotional video, Bill Murray in an Oval Office visit, and his famous “Between Two Ferns” appearance with Zach Galifianakis. Several celebrities, including Amy Pohler, Connie Britton, Olivia Wilde and Lady Gaga, Mark Ruffalo, Alyssa Milano and Mia Farrow participated in hashtag campaigns to “#GetCovered”. Liberal news outlet Mother Jones was kind enough to cull most of them into one piece.

When Obama wanted to give the impression he was tackling prison reform, he went to HBO and Vice. On Opioid abuse, he enlisted pop rapper Macklemore and MTV to film a video at the White House. Tom Hanks wrote about the virtues of free community college for the New York Times. Christina Hendricks was invited by the White House to speak at a family values summit. Alison Janney of West Wing fame cameoed to a twitterpated White House press corps.

On the Iran Deal, Obama enlisted Morgan Freeman as well as comedian and nuclear physicist Jack Black. Saturday Night Live, which refused to address the Weinstein scandal altogether last weekend, sang “To Sir With Love” to send Obama off into the sunset after eight years of Hollywood doting. By the end of his term, Obama had gone full Hollywood, appearing with Jerry Seinfeld simply for the fun of it.

This was why, despite very few actual legislative accomplishments, Obama’s presidency always felt more relevant in the moment than perhaps it actually was. It was so intertwined with the same faces in our culture that we see on magazine stands, album covers, movie screens and sitcoms. Obama always felt fresh and cool among the Hollywood elite, despite his party being decimated out from underneath him in consecutive congressional wave elections.

Obama and his administration wanted to be as much a part of Hollywood as Hollywood wanted to be a part of him. This was his chosen path to push his agenda -- through the people in culture with the loudest microphones whom he felt could influence the largest number of people to fall in line with his ideas.

Hillary Clinton tried to mimic this same strategy with her campaign, enlisting athletes, TV stars and pop stars to help drag her over the finish line. Clinton chose high-priced Hollywood fundraisers at the homes of stars like Gwenyth Paltrow over campaign stops in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Names such as George Clooney (also a personal friend of the Obamas), Ben Affleck and Matt Damon offered public support. Clooney alone raised $1.5 million for Clinton at a fundraiser in April of last year, with such names as Spielberg and Katzenberg in attendance.

Clinton regularly appeared on the campaign trail next to celebs such as Jay Z (a personal friend of Weinstein’s) and Beyoncé. Lena Dunham appeared with her in Ohio (a state she lost), as did the cast of the long defunct “West Wing.” Katy Perry was a Clinton campaign staple, even outfitting herself in dresses with Hillary’s slogan and logos. Actress Elizabeth Banks appeared at the Democratic Convention this past year, expertly mocking Donald Trump’s strobe light spaceship entrance onto the stage.

None of this, it seems, worked against Trump – who was able to tap into the forgotten voters of the rural rustbelt. These are the voters who don’t much care what Jimmy Kimmel or Sean Penn or Leonardo DiCaprio are preaching to them about the Earth’s climate or gun control – maybe because they’re more worried about the fact that they can’t afford their health care premium and have to use money to pay for their ObamaCare tax penalty that they could have used to fix their house, or car, or take their family on a vacation instead.

In fact, it seems the more Democrats have depended on Hollywood stars to sell their message, the more that most of the middle class in the middle of the country have tuned them out as their legislative and electoral majorities shrink.

Actress Alyssa Milano and other entertainment types campaigned actively for Democrat John Ossoff, who lost a money-soaked election in Georgia’s 6th District in June. Hollywood was also vocal in Montana’s May congressional election, where Republican Greg Gianforte coasted to victory, even after being charged for assaulting a reporter only days before.

The question now, heading into 2018 and 2020, is where does the party go without its celebrity base – which they have almost no choice but to shun in the fallout surrounding Harvey Weinstein and Hollywood’s pathetically lame (and delayed) response to the “open secret” (according to many) of his decades-long sexual exploitation of women.

Weinstein’s connections run deeper than simple campaign donations. Weinstein sold influence. He was so “in” among the Democratic Power Base that President Obama felt comfortable enough allowing his teenage daughter to intern for his film company. For the Democrats and their party, hoping to catch the coattails of the Obama cool they’ve been severely lacking since his exit, severing their connections to an industry facing a crisis of character will be easier said than done.

The late night hosts who only last week were happy to help Chuck Schumer push the Democrats’ gun control message are suddenly mute when it comes to Weinstein. And this is exactly where the Democrats find themselves in a bind. The party has depended on celebrity messaging for the better part of eight years, and were clearly planning to depend on it heading into the 2018 and 2020 elections (remember Maxine Waters appearing to raucous applause as a voice of The Resistance™ at the MTV Movie Awards?).

But the days of happy backslapping with Ben Affleck and George Clooney are coming to an end for a party that now has to distance itself from celebrity-spokespeople who were content to lecture the rest of the country about their religion, their guns or their politics – but who couldn’t seem to bring themselves to clean up their own house by calling out one of their closest friends and business colleagues for preying upon vulnerable young women – for years.



If the Democrats were a smart party – and they’ve done nothing of late to suggest that they are – they would be huddling in offices around the parts of the country they lost, devising a plan of action on how to move on without Hollywood spokespeople who will do nothing but remind voters of their association with Weinstein.

Distancing themselves from Hollywood and Weinstein could, in fact, ultimately be a gift to a decimated party flailing for a message beyond symbolic resistance. It could force Democrats to get back to the dirty work of organizing at a grassroots level and focusing on a message that appeals to that big useless chunk of land between Los Angeles and New York.

But just as it was apparently evident with Harvey Weinstein, the rest of Hollywood isn’t particularly good at taking “no” for answer.",Weinstein scandal -- Can Democrats afford to cut Hollywood loose?,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/13/weinstein-scandal-can-democrats-afford-to-cut-hollywood-loose.html

The Cuomo campaign released the following statement:

""The allegations against Harvey Weinstein are disturbing, horrid and the debate should be on how to best root out this reprehensible behavior and protect women from harassment and abuse. It’s shameful that some have sought to use this matter to score political points, but the real issues are far too serious to allow any distraction to overtake them. For that reason, the extraordinary step will be taken of giving all contributions from prior campaigns whose committees have been closed for years so that we can dispense with the Republican ploys and focus on the real issues.”

The statement ended with a shot at Republicans: “Will Republicans accept the support of a president who himself disrespected, demeaned and harassed women? Will they support pay equity? Where do they stand on Betsy DeVos rolling back Title 9 protection for sexual assault on college campuses? Do they support Roe v Wade? These are the answers that the people of this country deserve.""

The angler stopped breathing and suffered cardiac arrest on Boscombe Pier in Bournemouth where the group was fishing, BBC reports.

Members of Boscombe Pier Sea Anglers performed CPR on their friend while waiting for the emergency crews. Paramedics arrived soon after and realized the fish’s barbs and gills had become stuck in the angler’s throat.

The kitchen has more places for cooties than anywhere else in your home – even more than your bathroom, on average. We are going to look at those spots where bacteria love to hide and give you some tips and tools to keep them clean and sanitary.

1. Sinks. You might be surprised to learn that there are more germs in your kitchen sink than are in your toilet. From raw meat juices, dirty dishes and leftover food particles, the kitchen sink is a hotbed for bacteria. Therefore, any day that you use your sink for preparing food or soaking dishes, pots and pans, it should be washed down with hot soapy water and a sponge.

2. Sponges. Speaking of sponges, there have been many discussions online about the germs found in sponges and what will work to clean them. Recently, The New York Times ran an article that quoted a study from Germany claiming that cleaning a sponge only makes the bacteria on them worse. But after further research, the author wrote another article that said cleaning your sponge is still important to do. So the debate seems to remain up in the air.

However, if you still want to clean your sponge, you can either put it in the microwave on high for a minute or try a new tool called a SpongeBath that uses citric acid to keep the sponge clean and disinfected.

3. Hand towels. Hand towels are magnets for nasty germs. More often than not, we mindlessly wipe our hands on our towels, without thinking what we’re leaving behind. Raw meat juices, raw eggs from batter or even rotting food can often be found on a kitchen towel.

The trick is to change them at least once a week — more often if the towels get a lot of use — and wash dirty ones in hot water. You can also add a teaspoon of bleach to the wash to kill bacteria.

4. Knobs and handles. Every kitchen has more than a few door knobs and handles. Between everyday germs that are on your hands and the food germs you find in the kitchen, those cabinet knobs and handles can be full of bacteria.

You can use a simple solution of distilled white vinegar and some rubbing alcohol in a spray bottle and wipe with a microfiber cloth. The vinegar alone kills 98% of the bacteria, and the alcohol should kill the rest.

5. Salt and pepper shakers. Bet you never thought of your salt or pepper shakers as a place where germs are being transferred, but when was the last time you wiped them down with something other than a wet cloth (if that). These items are being handled by everyone in your family, and therefore germs are being spread to everyone.

6. Refrigerator handles. The handles of your refrigerator are touched countless times a day. Add in the fact that you are opening the fridge with hands that are preparing a meal and you can imagine all the germs and bacteria that are on those handles.

Get into the habit of wiping them down daily if possible. Use the same white vinegar and rubbing alcohol solution previously mentioned.

7. Cutting boards. Wooden cutting boards have proved to be full of more bacteria than a toilet seat. If used for cutting raw meat, they can also contain salmonella, which can lead to cross contamination.

To clean a cutting board, submerge it in hot soapy water after each use. You can also disinfect it with a mix of distilled white vinegar, lemon juice and salt. Consider plastic cutting boards that can go in the dishwasher.

8. Remote controls. TV remotes in any room of the house are apt to hold a variety of germs. But the remote in the kitchen is the worst of all. Food bacteria from meal prepping might be all over it.

Consider keeping the remote inside a ziplock bag and operating it through the bag. That way the germs are on the bag and not in all the cracks and crevices of the remote. Change the bag often.",8 overlooked germy places in your kitchen to clean now,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/04/8-overlooked-germy-places-in-your-kitchen-to-clean-now.html

Bruce Hornsby could be heard at Key West’s Mallory Square as a “reclamation party” got underway, Thursday afternoon. The feeling was positive and the outlook was bright.

Hours later, Key West Mayor Craig Cates came in to Two Friends Patio Restaurant for dinner, as nearby Duval Street began to show signs of life.

“Key West is going to be open for business soon,” said Cates.

When asked about the higher volume of people out and about, the mayor replied, “Well, we’re taking visitors now. We haven’t advertised yet,” he said.

Cates, however, pointed out that the hardest hit parts of the Keys are still picking up the pieces from Irma’s devastation. “We understand our neighbors to the north in the Florida Keys got more damage than us,” he said.

In nearby Big Pine Key, the cleanup is still ongoing.

Among those cleaning up are 85-year-old Wes Harris and his wife. “We’ve been married 63 years,” he said.

The couple rode out the storm near their now beat-up home.

The wheelchair ramp into Harris’ home was just recently repaired by first responders, but there’s still so much more to do.

“See that rock? You see how big that rock is?” Harris said as he pointed to a large boulder in his yard. “That’s not my rock. I don’t know where the hell it came from.”

The legally blind U.S. Army veteran, who suffers from spinal stenosis, lost his orchid ranch, which he says had between 7,000 and 8,000 flowers.

Harris is so tough that the idea of getting a little emotional over the relief effort in the aftermath of the storm makes him annoyed.

“I just can’t believe how everybody has helped. It’s absolutely unbelievable,” Harris said.

Harris’ post-storm story isn’t necessarily unique. Residents told 7News about problems with their house, their boat, or in some cases, both.

Big names also came to help out the Keys, in the form of former football player Tim Tebow and U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.

“So many people are so tough, and what they’ve gone through,” said Tebow. “You know what’s even more special? So many people, who don’t know what’s even going on with their houses, but they’re still volunteering for other people that need help.”

Residents appreciated Tebow’s visit. “He’s such a huge model for me, so it’s a nice thing that he came down here to the Keys,” said one woman.

7News cameras captured Rubio posing for pictures, as food, ice and relief supplies got to those in need.

When asked what he would say to those residents who fear they may be forgotten, Rubio responded: “They won’t be forgotten by us — I don’t know if someone else will — primarily because we’ve spent a lot of time, personally, in the Keys, up and down this place. I mean my family, we’ve had so many incredible memories here. We want to see the Keys come back.”

Meanwhile, Harris indicated he will make it through that strong current called adversity, probably because of his big heart. “You’ve got to keep stroking, bud. That’s all you can do,” he said.

As the reclamation party begins in Key West, many residents feel that, because the cleanup is still underway, the party is happening too soon. however, others feel that it needs to happen to show that the Florida Keys are still alive.

Officials said tourism will return to Key West in a limited capacity on Sunday with the arrival of a cruise ship at the Margaritaville Pier. It is scheduled to arrive at noon.

FOX NEWS - President Donald Trump plans to halt payments to insurers under the Affordable Care Act, the 2010 health care law also known as ObamaCare.

It’s the latest effort in the president’s bid to ultimately “repeal and replace” what’s considered the signature legislation of his White House predecessor.

Word of Trump’s latest plan came from two people familiar with the decision, who spoke to the Associated Press. They requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

The White House said in a statement that the Department of Health and Human Services has determined there is no appropriation for cost-sharing reduction payments to insurers under the Obamacare law.

Trump's decision was expected to rattle already-unsteady insurance marketplaces. The president has previously threatened to end the payments, which help reduce health insurance copays and deductibles for people with modest incomes, but remain under a legal cloud.

Trump has privately told at least one lawmaker that the payments may continue if a bipartisan deal is reached on heath care, The Wall Street Journal reported.

Pushback expected

The president's action will likely to trigger a lawsuit from state attorneys general, who contend the subsidies to insurers are fully authorized by federal law, and the president's position is reckless.

“I love the Star-Spangled Banner so much because I love America,” Suraci said.","It was just another college football game on Saturday in Hartford, Connecticut, until just before kickoff, an announcement came over the loud speakers that there would be no playing of the national anthem.

Everyone was on the field, the coin toss had just happened, and players had their helmets off, standing at attention, ready for the anthem to be played, Coach Jeff Devanney told Fox News.

But after a few moments of silence, it was announced the PA system failed – and there would be no playing of the Anthem.

Trinity senior fullback Ethan Suraci told Fox News the silence “felt like forever, honestly. You could hear the crowd and the opposing team” expressing disappointment over the announcement.

Suraci said he immediately started belting out the words to what he calls “America’s song,” which also happens to be his favorite song, and it seemed everyone joined in.

""There were almost three different waves of the Star-Spangled Banner going,” Coach Devanney said. Trinity’s team, Hamilton’s team, and the crowd each had started singing “almost like an echo,” but he added, “It all seemed to end on the same note.”

“That was awesome!” said sportscaster Jake Donnelly, who captured the video and posted it on YouTube. “Not many tenors on either end of the field here this afternoon, but a bunch of players that absolutely love America and love the National Anthem. That was one of the coolest things I have ever seen,” Donnelly added.

“It was a fantastic display of unity and patriotism and gave everyone in the crowd, the teams, and hopefully those who watch the video; chills of hope for a better United States of America and happiness to see us as a society beginning to heal - despite the polarization we see among the citizens and our politicians,” Suraci said.

The incident came a day before Vice President Mike Pence’s decision to leave Sunday’s NFL game between the Indianapolis Colts and the San Francisco 49ers, when several 49er players kneeled during the Anthem.

Coach Devanney said he discussed the NFL protests with his team, calling it a “complicated issue.”

President Trump tweeted Wednesday it’s “about time” NFL’s Goodell called on players to stand for the national anthem.

The senior political science major, who identifies as a Republican and voted for Trump, agrees.

“I am in total agreement with one's constitutional right to protest. However, these players are protesting in an incorrect forum,” he said. “Why insult an entire country and all those who fell for her?”

The 5-foot-10-inch, 225-pound fullback always stands and proudly holds his hand over his heart, just as he did on Saturday.

No one really knows who first started singing the anthem in at the Jessee/Miller Field, but Coach Devanney told Fox News, “I wouldn’t be shocked if Ethan was the first one, given his love of the song.”

In fact, Suraci listens to the “Star-Spangled Banner” as sung by Celine Dion every day after he’s done with school.

Stewart let the story slip during an Oct. 11 interview with People, in which Snoop also shared his secret favorite dish (a sandwich of peanut butter, pickes and potato chips) and Stewart admitted that she'd like to dress up like Beyonce for a day. But perhaps the cherry on top of the interview was when Martha told People of her craziest kitchen disaster ever.

Stewart began by saying she usually has a trip for keeping her kitchen blunders on the down-low — she just keeps them to herself.

“Oh, I’ve had lots of disasters, but I never let anybody know about them — that’s the secret,” she said. But eventually Martha relented, and explained how her biggest catastrophe involved Newman and her cherished dog, Bear.

“The worst one was I was catering a party for Paul Newman. He was my neighbor, and he asked me to cater a party for him,” Stewart divulged.

“He wanted Moroccan food, so I made b’stillas, which are pigeon pies. Beautiful ones, with their design of powdered sugar on the top — I think there were 10 of them,” she added.

“I put them out on my stone wall to cool before we packed them in the truck,” she continued. “And my beautiful little dog, little Bear, ate the tops off all 10.”

“To Little Bear? Nothing! It was my fault,” Stewart said.

What is almost certainly a camouflaged prototype of the long rumored mid-engine Chevrolet Corvette was spotted pulling into the drive-through of a Michigan Mickey D’s, with two more and a current convertible Corvette parked in the lot nearby.

Despite the heavy cladding and dazzling wrap, the shape of the front of the vehicle exhibits the distinct style of a Corvette, while its long rear deck is a clear indication that its motor is in the middle.

Chevrolet hasn’t even yet acknowledged that it is working on such a vehicle, so details are scarce. Speculation is that it will feature a lightweight chassis, however, and may reintroduce an overhead cam engine to the Corvette lineup, along with a hybrid powertrain.

As for when we’ll know for sure, with the prototypes looking nearly complete, a debut at the Detroit Auto Show in January is looking likely, and sales should follow in 2019.

The internet is reeling over the color of a sneaker after Twitter user @TFILDOLANS posted a photo of the shoe that appear gray with teal accents to some people, while others see pink with white accents. The user wrote in the tweet on Wednesday: “What colour is this,” igniting a lengthy debate that amounted to thousands of people chipping in their input.

Many people are perplexed on what color the shoe is actually supposed to be.

“So is it actually grey and teal or pink and white[?]” one user asked.

“PEOPLE R SAYING ITS PINK N WHITE??? LIKE ITS GREY AND LIGHT BLUE/TEAL LIKE WTFF,” another user said.

Bush in the annual Warrior 100K mountain bike ride has a personal story of overcoming adversity. Warriors and civilians alike train for months for the privilege of challenging the rocky switchback single-track trails on Bush’s Texas ranch. The ride has its own momentum, and each year it is more about the networks that are forming and the obstacles being overcome than the physical challenge of the ride itself.

Out on the trail, the veterans ride in a kind of formation, banding together to assist someone who falls or has difficulty. Self-appointed supervisors, who must have been officers in war, bark out orders to start and stop. I am proud that my training allowed me to make it all the way up the challenging windy trail called Waterfall, over the narrow bridges and around the ridge in the lowest gear, and that I completed the two-day event on Sunday without falling.

But this ride wasn’t about me.

Many of the warriors who participate in the 100K carry incredible stories of courage and fortitude. President Bush said he was proud of retired Maj. Peter Way, who lost most of his right leg in Afghanistan and is transitioning from a hand cycle to a pedal-assisted e-bike with the help of a special leg prosthesis. He injured his back during the first day of this year’s ride, but he was back the next day, enduring intense pain, with the support of his brethren in Team 43, to ride at the conclusion of the event.

Research has shown that at least 20 percent of veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars suffer from post-traumatic stress or depression, but less than half seek help.

The theme this year was the Bush Institute’s new Warrior Wellness Alliance, which approaches the debilitating invisible wounds of war (traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress) with the wisdom that no one knows how to help a vet like another vet.

As President Bush told me in an interview, “One, admit you got a problem. Pretty logical. If a vet kind of keeps it in inside, no one will understand what I think, no one can possibly relate to what I feel like, and doesn’t share, obviously that leads to negative consequences.

“Secondly, when you seek help, you and I can be … we can be sympathetic. But we can’t possibly relate to what it’s like to see a friend killed in combat. And yet there are others who can. And here in this group, people have progressed from severe depression, a severe case of PTS, to a moderate case. In some cases, a light case of it, and they can share with their pal what it took. And so it’s logical, and it works.”

The Warrior Wellness Alliance focuses on the roles of spouses and caregivers, and it connects peer-to-peer veteran networks with expert health care providers around the country. The Stephen A. Cohen Military Family Clinics are heavily involved, including the one at my own medical center. Research has shown that at least 20 percent of veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars suffer from post-traumatic stress or depression, but less than half seek help.

The alliance hopes to help overcome this by building support systems like Team 43, which come together at sports events like the bike ride and share stories, struggles and hopes.

One of the most inspiring stories involves Marine Cpl. Dave Smith, who spoke at the first Warrior 100K mountain bike ride that I attended in 2012 and returned this year to ride with the alumni. He wears a haunted expression in President Bush’s evocative portrait in his book Portraits of Courage.

In Iraq in 2004, Smith’s unit came under heavy fire, and while trying to defend his position, he accidentally shot a fellow Marine in the leg. He has suffered for it ever since. He once put a shotgun in his mouth and almost pulled the trigger. He stopped himself at the last minute, thinking of a fellow vet who committed suicide and hurt many who cared about him.

Smith’s motto now is “Never give up.” He says he has sustained post-traumatic growth and that his heavy networking with fellow vets has helped him rebuild his life.

“A lot of it had to do with serving other people,” President Bush told me. “He got his spirit back, now married, and seems great.”

Identifying quality wood furniture can be difficult these days. Many pieces look great in the store, only to prove flimsy once you get them home and start to use them. Here’s what to look for, and what to avoid, when shopping for your next piece of wood furniture.

When made with high-quality materials and solid construction, wood furniture can last for decades and sometimes even centuries. But not everything you see in stores is built to last. Buy something that’s made poorly and you’ll start to see wear and tear way too soon. How can you tell the difference? It’s harder than you might think. The first thing to pay attention to is the wood itself.

Solid wood. The highest-quality material for wood furniture is solid wood. This type of furniture will be made from single pieces of wood or wood boards that are glued together to make panels — trees are only so wide, after all. If something is described as being made with solid wood, find out if that describes the entire piece or just certain parts.

Hardwood. Solid wood can be categorized as either hardwood or softwood. Hardwood comes from slower-growing trees and the wood is denser and more resistant to dings. Common hardwoods include oak, ash, walnut, cherry and maple.

Softwood. Softwood comes from faster-growing trees and the wood is less dense. Some common softwoods are pine, fir and poplar. Since these trees grow faster, furniture made using their wood tends to be less expensive than pieces made from hardwood.

Domestic wood. Domestic wood comes from trees that are grown and processed in the United States. Common domestic wood species include oak, maple, cherry, walnut, ash, poplar and pine.

A quick note about how wood is described: The species can describe either the material or the stain color. So something described as walnut might be stained that color but actually be made from pine. This isn’t necessarily bad — just make sure you know what you’re getting. You shouldn’t be paying walnut prices for a piece of furniture made from less-expensive wood.

Imported wood. A lot of imported furniture is made from tropical wood species such as rubberwood (sometimes known as plantation hardwood), mango, acacia or sheesham (a type of rosewood). These species can produce a sturdy piece of furniture, but they may be susceptible to cracking if they’re coming from a humid environment to a drier one.

Benefits of solid wood. Ensuring that your furniture is 100 percent solid wood is a pretty fail-safe way to know that you’re purchasing something high-quality. Solid wood construction is extremely long-lasting and can be easily refinished and repaired down the road.

Cons of solid wood. Solid wood is definitely the best choice for furniture but, as with any natural material, there can be downsides. Solid wood is more susceptible to changes in climate, which may cause it to crack or warp. It’s also more expensive than furniture made from engineered wood products.

Plywood. Plywood (sometimes called engineered hardwood) is made by gluing together thin layers of solid wood. When used in furniture construction, plywood is covered with a thin layer of stained and finished wood — a veneer.

Pros of plywood. The main benefit of plywood is that it’s stable when the climate changes and is less likely to warp or crack in dry climates. It can also give you a sturdy piece of furniture at a lower cost than solid wood.

Cons of plywood. Sometimes the quality of plywood comes down to the quality of the veneer. Poor-quality veneers can chip, revealing the lower-quality wood underneath. Damage may also be difficult to repair since the bulk of the furniture is made using a different wood species than the veneer. Also, some plywood is made using chemicals with formaldehyde, which can affect indoor air quality, although formaldehyde-free plywood is available.

MDF. Medium-density fiberboard is made from wood waste products (basically sawdust) that have been mixed with resins. The mixture is compressed to create large, flat boards. For furniture, MDF is finished with a layer of real-wood veneer or non-wood laminate.

Pros and cons of MDF. There are more cons than pros when you’re talking about MDF furniture. Pieces made from it are less expensive than those made of solid wood or plywood, which makes them budget-friendly. However, MDF requires a lot of chemicals to make and is the highest-formaldehyde-emitting wood product out there. Other downsides: It can easily be damaged by water, it’s difficult to repair, it doesn’t hold screws very well and it’s heavy.

Particle board. Made similarly to MDF, particle board uses larger wood scraps to create boards. You can differentiate particle board from MDF by spotting the pockets of air when looking at it from the side.

Pros and cons of particle board. The one thing particle board has going for it is that it’s inexpensive. And then there are the downsides: It emits formaldehyde, requires a lot of chemicals to produce, is susceptible to moisture damage and really doesn’t hold screws well. Particle board furniture tends to loosen up quickly, resulting in wobbles.

Veneers. A veneer is a thin sheet of real wood that is applied to the outside of a piece of wood furniture. It can be added to any of the wood products mentioned above. Veneers are used when you want to match up wood grain to create a design, or to cover a lower-cost piece of furniture.

Selecting veneered furniture. Veneer quality varies widely. Look for those that are thicker, have good adhesion and are glued to solid wood or plywood as opposed to MDF or particle board. Poorly done veneers can peel and chip.

Retail sales rose 1.6 percent in September, after slipping 0.1 percent in August, the Commerce Department said Friday. Auto sales jumped 3.6 percent, the most since March 2015. Gas sales climbed 5.8 percent, the most in four and a half years, likely reflecting price spikes after Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.

Even excluding the volatile auto and gas categories, sales rose a solid 0.5 percent, up from a 0.1 percent gain in August.

Consumers are optimistic about the economy, unemployment has hit a 16-year low, and wages have ticked up in recent months. That should boost spending and broader economic growth in the coming months.

Most of the gains last month were likely fueled by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which slammed into Texas, Florida and other southeastern states in late August and September.

Sales at home and garden supply stores rose 2.1 percent, probably lifted by hurricane preparation, as well as repairs and renovations in the aftermath of the storms. Grocery store sales increased 0.8 percent, the most since April 2016, likely boosted by restocking after the hurricanes hit.

Sales at general merchandise stores, which include big box retailers such as Walmart and Target, rose 0.3 percent.

Online retailers reported another healthy gain of 0.5 percent. E-commerce sales have jumped 9.2 percent in the past year, more than double the overall sales increase of 4.4 percent.

Not all stores saw a boost: Sales at furnishers, electronics and appliance stores, and sporting goods stores fell.

The retail sales report is closely watched because it provides an early read on consumer activity each month. Consumer spending accounts for about 70 percent of the economy.

U.S. economic growth likely slowed in the July-September quarter as the hurricanes shut down thousands of businesses, employees were forced to miss work, and power was cut to millions of homes. Analysts forecast that the economy expanded at a 2 percent annual pace in the third quarter, down from a 3 percent gain in the April-June quarter.

Yet the economy is expected to rebound in the final three months of the year as rebuilding and repair work accelerates. Construction and engineering firms are expected to step up hiring as homes, commercial buildings and roads and bridges are fixed. Economists expect growth will pick up to a 2.5 percent to 3 percent pace.","US retail sales leapt 1.6 pct. last month, most in 2 ½ years",https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/13/us-retail-sales-leapt-1-6-pct-last-month-most-in-2-years.html
