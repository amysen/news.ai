Graffiti has come a long way since the 1970s when fly-by-night taggers sprayed their work on bridge abutments or subway cars then slipped away before the authorities arrived. These days, fashion labels use it in their photo shoots. Huge corporations include it in their ad campaigns. In museums and auction houses, it has been rebranded with a classy new name: aerosol art.

On Tuesday, however, a trial began in Brooklyn that will eventually determine whether graffiti, despite its transient nature, should be recognized as art to the point of being protected by federal law. The trial, which is likely to explore broad questions of aesthetics, property rights and the relationship between the arts and gentrification, has, at its heart, pitted more than 20 graffiti artists whose work appeared in the beloved 5Pointz complex in Long Island City, Queens, against the owner of the buildings who demolished both them and the art adorning their walls.

5Pointz was a rare collaboration between a real-estate developer and a group of street artists. In 1993, when Long Island City was beset by crime, the developer, Jerry Wolkoff, allowed a crew of taggers to decorate his buildings at 45-46 Davis Street with a wild array of colorful, swirling murals.

For 20 years, 5Pointz was an offbeat tourist destination that not only attracted thousands of visitors, but also helped transformed Long Island City into the thriving residential neighborhood it is today. 5Pointz eventually became “the world’s largest open-air aerosol museum,” in the words of Eric Baum, a lawyer for the artists, but its existence was always predicated on Mr. Wolkoff tearing it down and developing the complex, which he ultimately did in 2014.

Before the demolition, the artists tried several times to stop it — asking city officials to grant the complex landmark status, even attempting to buy 5Pointz themselves, Mr. Baum said.

Unlike many of Suharto’s former acolytes, Mr. Wanandi admits that the events of 1965-66 spiraled out of control.","“We knew about these things more generally, but it’s great to have this information in black and white so it’s not just based on oral interviews with victims,” said John Roosa, an associate professor of history at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver and author of a book on the events of 1965. “The U.S. was following what was happening very closely, and if it weren’t for its support, you could argue that the army would never have felt the confidence to take power.”

The Indonesian slaughter took place at a time when Southeast Asia, still emerging from colonialism, was energized by socialist ideology.

The United States already had boots on the ground in Vietnam. Indonesia, then led by President Sukarno and home to one of the world’s largest Communist parties, was seen by Washington as the next domino that could fall.

When a group of hard-line generals blamed Communist Party operatives for a failed coup attempt in 1965, with China accused as a mastermind, Washington did little to challenge that narrative.

The United States government largely stayed silent as the death toll mounted at the hands of the Indonesian Army, paramilitaries and religious mobs. The extrajudicial killings spread beyond suspected Communists to target ethnic Chinese, students, union members and anyone who might have personal feuds with the hit men. Tens of thousands of others were thrown into tropical gulags.

Eventually, President Sukarno, with his anti-American talk and socialist sympathies, was replaced by Suharto, a general who held power for 32 years, instituting a policy he called the New Order to reinvigorate the economy through foreign aid and investment.

Another of the newly released cables shows how the American Embassy in Jakarta made clear that any aid from the United States was contingent on Sukarno’s being removed from power. Upon Suharto’s ascension in March 1966, that American aid began to flow.

In some of the cables, American diplomats exulted in the abrupt political transition, even as they noted the rising body count. One file refers to the political changes as a “fantastic switch.”

The Indonesian military, which still wields considerable power today, has tried to blame the orgy of violence on a public furious with the excesses of the Communist Party, absolving itself of direct culpability.

But the cables indicate how members of the American foreign service, at least, held the military directly responsible for some of the deaths. One cable alleges that Suharto gave the orders for certain mass executions.

In 2015, Senator Tom Udall of New Mexico reintroduced a resolution in the Senate calling for Indonesia to face up to its traumatic history. He also held the United States to account for its “military and financial support” there, which included providing lists of possible leftist sympathizers to the Indonesian government and, as one cable released Tuesday showed, pushing to bury foreign news coverage of the killings.

The legacy of the massacre continues to divide Indonesia. For decades, under Suharto’s rule, Indonesians dared not call for justice. Even after he was deposed in 1998, there was little effort to set up an Indonesian form of a truth and reconciliation commission.

But in part after the filmmaker Joshua Oppenheimer released a documentary in 2012 called “The Act of Killing,” chronicling the life of an unrepentant hit man in the purge, members of Indonesian society began to delve into its history.

Joko Widodo, the Indonesian president, has talked about the need to address past human rights violations.

Still, there are limits to how far Indonesia is willing to go. Nursyahbani Katjasungkana, a human rights lawyer, helped convene an international people’s tribunal on the killings at The Hague in 2015. (The court had no real authority beyond an airing of testimony, but it held the Indonesian government responsible for crimes against humanity and accused the United States, Britain and Australia of complicity.)

But in recent months, conservative groups have rekindled anti-Communist sensibilities in Indonesia. Efforts last month to organize screenings of Mr. Oppenheimer’s second documentary, “The Look of Silence,” were restricted by a military directive. A mob gathered around a building where Ms. Katjasungkana and others were believed to be gathering to talk about the violence.

“I just hope these new documents will encourage the Indonesian government to be more open and stop the state denial that the military was involved in these atrocities,” she said. “Hopefully, America will also admit its involvement.”

Jusuf Wanandi is a Chinese-Indonesian who supported Suharto for decades, even if he grew disillusioned with his strongman-like leadership. Unlike many of Suharto’s former acolytes, Mr. Wanandi admits that the events of 1965-66 spiraled out of control.

Yet even he advised patience.

The gestures began last season, spurred by Colin Kaepernick, then the quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, to draw attention to racial oppression and police brutality against black Americans.

The Miami Dolphins’ owner, Stephen Ross, speaking in New York at a business meeting of the 32 owners, said that the league had made no changes to its policy and that players would be free to protest again this weekend.

“I can’t really tell you what people are going to do,” Ross said when asked if players would continue to protest. “The league has a policy. It hasn’t changed.”

The league’s rule book never required players to stand for the anthem but says they must be on the sideline during the song and “should” stand for it.

The ambiguity in the rule has made it difficult for the league to fine players who have either sat or knelt for the anthem, and the owners had discussed clarifying the wording to make standing for the anthem mandatory.

By leaving the rule alone, the league has chosen to avoid more internal strife with its players and to potentially weather more criticism from fans and President Trump, who has repeatedly ridiculed the league for not firing players who demonstrate during the anthem.

“We need to be above petty attacks from anybody, because racial and socioeconomic inequality has existed in this country for too long,” Jed York, the chief executive and co-owner of the San Francisco 49ers, said when asked about the president’s criticism of the league. “You got to block out the noise and go do your job, and that’s what we need to focus on.”

The meeting on Tuesday included the N.F.L.’s commissioner, Roger Goodell; the director of the players’ union, DeMaurice F. Smith; and 11 owners, including Robert K. Kraft of the New England Patriots and Arthur M. Blank of the Atlanta Falcons. They met for almost four hours with a dozen players, including Malcolm Jenkins of the Philadelphia Eagles, Eric Reid of the 49ers and Kenny Stills of the Dolphins, all of whom have protested during the anthem.

“We just talked about how the owners could come alongside us and we could, collectively, collaboratively, work together to actually create some change, real changes,” Jenkins said afterward, flanked by other players. “We feel a real responsibility to our country, to our communities, so we’re working through ways to really have long lasting, real change.”

Jenkins said there had been no discussion during the meeting about prohibiting players from kneeling during the national anthem; whether players continue to do so, he said, would be an individual decision.

He also said that Kaepernick had been invited to the meeting but chose not to attend. Kaepernick’s lawyer, Mark Geragos, later said it was possible that Kaepernick would attend future meetings.

The league’s broadcasters and sponsors have tried to tiptoe past the public spat as pockets of fans have said they would no longer go to games or buy N.F.L. merchandise. Some teams, too, have had to handle a large number of calls from angry fans. Last week, the Jaguars took the unusual step of apologizing to military leaders in the Jacksonville area for demonstrating during the national anthem before their game in London last month.

According to a copy of the letter obtained by The Associated Press, the Jaguars’ president, Mark Lamping, said that the team was “remiss in not fully comprehending the effect of the national anthem demonstration on foreign soil has had on the men and women who have or continue to serve our country.”

To find a way to extinguish the crisis, Goodell has tried to persuade the players’ union to help him to persuade the players to stand for the anthem.

On Monday, Goodell and Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Doug Baldwin sent a letter of support to the congressional sponsors of the Sentencing Reform and Correction Act, a bill designed to increase rehabilitation of people convicted of crimes.

Protesters from the Black Lives Matter movement gathered outside the hotel where the owners were meeting. One demonstrator, Hank Newsome, said Kaepernick was being unfairly treated by the N.F.L. because he brought attention to uncomfortable issues, including racism.

“What I see with the N.F.L. owners is a bunch of good old boys telling the players: Stay in your place,” he said.

Not long after, two protesters confronted the Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones as he walked through the lobby of the hotel, saying that the players were kneeling during the anthem to end white supremacy. Jones listened to the protesters but did not speak to them.

Goodell said late Tuesday that the owners had not asked the players for a pledge to stop protesting during the anthem. He said the league and players would most likely meet again in the next two weeks.

Goodell’s efforts to forge a consensus among the owners come as they are considering whether to extend his current contract by another five years.

Goodell has tried to mollify the players by visiting Philadelphia, Miami and other cities to speak to them and witness their work in the community.

But with the president continuing to harangue the N.F.L. on Twitter, and fans increasingly upset about the league’s handling of the issue, including in Jacksonville, where a fan paid to have a plane fly over the Jaguars’ stadium carrying a message calling for a boycott of the team and the N.F.L., the owners continue to fret over the protests and how they will affect the league’s brand when television ratings have started to slip.

The league also continues to grapple with Kaepernick, who filed a grievance accusing the owners of colluding to keep him from joining a team.

Assemblywoman Cristina Garcia, a Democrat who leads the Legislative Women’s Caucus and spoke of her own experiences being grabbed, said there was too much onus on women who lived through the harassment.

“Why does the burden have to be on the victims?” she asked. “There are no guarantees we’re going to be protected. We’re talking about our reputations and our careers. How am I going to prove that you’re holding legislation because you’ve harassed me? People will get called crazy or worse.”

Pamela Lopez, a Sacramento lobbyist who said that a lawmaker trapped her inside a bathroom while he masturbated, said that rather than identifying “one guy who takes the fall,” she was more concerned about changing a “pervasive culture” in the Legislature.

“If we could be less punitive and not make it about one or two people, then we might be able to see some change,” she said. “We need everyone to be able to step in and say something as soon as they hear something is off. We need everyone to say, ‘No, enough, that’s not O.K.’”

Several kingdoms in the National Basketball Association have risen (and fallen) this century. Shaquille O’Neal and Kobe Bryant uncomfortably shared a throne for the Los Angeles Lakers. A sommelier of talent, Gregg Popovich, extracted the best from the San Antonio Spurs’ international smorgasbord. The Miami Heat forged the triumvirate that made LeBron James a champion.

Each of those teams had significant success, winning multiple titles. But none have dominated like the Golden State Warriors.

In the past three seasons, the Warriors have made three finals and won two titles, losing only 39 regular-season games in that span. (The Sacramento Kings have lost at least that many games for 11 consecutive seasons.) They went 47-15 in the postseason against the league’s best competition. Stephen Curry was twice named the most valuable player. Two seasons ago they set an N.B.A. record with 73 wins.

While the competition frantically tried to keep up this off-season by trading for superstars, the Warriors quietly retained their key players: Curry, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson. That dynamic core fell short in Tuesday night’s season opener, a 122-121 loss to the Houston Rockets, but if preseason predictions are any indication, the Warriors’ season will end in victory.

All 21 ESPN analysts picked the Warriors to win their third title in four seasons. So did all 11 writers at The Ringer. And all seven at Sports Illustrated. And all four at USA Today. And all three at NBC Sports.

No pressure.

The present government — a coalition of the radical left and nationalist right — came to power in early 2015 on an anti-austerity, frequently anti-German platform. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras demanded support with no strings attached.

When Greece’s partners and creditors called his bluff, the country defaulted on a payment to the International Monetary Fund and was on the brink of exiting the eurozone when Mr. Tsipras signed on to a new bailout agreement with even tougher terms. Forced to abandon his radical policy, he came to rely on the German chancellor for support and understanding. But his brinkmanship undermined earlier efforts and pushed Greece back into recession. The country is still trying to pull itself together, with the economy showing modest growth this year.

Now it is German politicians who threaten to derail the relationship that held the eurozone together. Even before the Sept. 24 election, the surge in support for the extreme-right-wing Alternative for Germany party had skewed the country’s politics, with members of other parties echoing some of its demands, including opposition to the eurozone and to support for Greece.

In trying to forge a governing coalition, Ms. Merkel will have to reconcile contradictory policies among potential partners and placate critics within her own party. The Free Democrats, who are likely partners, advocate a hard line on Greece. Recently, the party leader, Christian Lindner, accused the soon-to-be-former finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, who had repeatedly proposed that Greece leave the eurozone (at least temporarily), of being too soft. Mr. Lindner is in a position to demand commitments that there be no debt relief for Greece and that Germany maintain a strict fiscal policy with regard to Europe.

This is a difficult time for liberal democracy. The threat to the European Union and its principles demands a stronger union, as the new French president, Emmanuel Macron, has stressed. The European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, refers to the need for social values that go beyond the concerns of the single market and the eurozone.

Over the past few years, Ms. Merkel has agreed to move toward closer union. This was not so clear at the start of the crisis. In 2010, there was no centralized fund to rescue Greece. The system that was adopted, mainly at Germany’s insistence, involved eurozone countries making bilateral loans to Greece; its terms were punitive, and it also made taxpayers in donor countries keenly aware that their money was going toward bailing out the Greeks rather than protecting the common currency.

This caused lasting suspicion of Greece in many countries. It kept the focus on national interests rather than encouraging confidence in the European whole. The immigration crisis magnified this, with several countries breaking ranks with the European Union’s policy, erecting walls and refusing to accept their quota of refugees, choosing their own perceived interests over the bloc’s principles.

The eurozone now has the institutions and procedures to cope with economic emergencies. It dealt with crises in Ireland, Portugal and Cyprus without provoking turmoil similar to that in Greece or inciting anger in donor countries. The European Central Bank — despite German protestations — plays a more active role defending the euro and member states than it did in 2010. As long as Greece remains in bailout limbo, however, it is shut out of the E.C.B.’s bond-buying program, which would give Greek banks greater liquidity and improve confidence in the economy.

It is no surprise that populists have made gains in Germany. But they still account for a small percentage of voters and should not be allowed a disproportionate say in national policy. There is too much at stake. In Greece, we saw what happens when politicians with slogans rather than serious proposals dominate the scene. In Greece, though, it is the Greeks who pay for their mistakes. The world cannot afford for Germans to make the same mistake.

The hashtag #BrooklynCow began trending on Twitter, where users debated the fate of the bull, pleaded for gentle treatment from the authorities and corrected gender pronouns.

When the Parks Department tweeted, “Hey, has anyone seen a cow?” a user pointed out that the correct term for male cattle is “bull.”

“Excuse our calf … er, gaffe,” the department replied.

But it wasn’t all utter nonsense.

On his freedom run, the bull knocked over a stroller with a child, who was taken to an area hospital, according to the police.

As unusual as the incident seemed, renegade cows and bulls have happened before in the city.

Their fates have been mixed. Sometimes they are returned to the butchers they have fled from, and other times they’re more fortunate. A bull who cantered around Queens for a day in 2016 was adopted by Jon Stewart, and taken to his private rescue.

The Brooklyn bull was eventually brought down by tranquilizer, administered at about 1 p.m., and led into a trailer about 30 minutes later, according to the police.

As of Tuesday night, it was unclear where the bull escaped from. He was turned over to Animal Care Centers of New York City, who named him Jimmy K., after the late night host Jimmy Kimmel, and was later transferred to the Skylands Animal Sanctuary.

The Dow Jones industrial average briefly climbed over 23,000 points yesterday for the first time.

Thirty years ago this week, the stock market plummeted 508 points, or nearly 23 percent, in a single day. It was the largest one-day drop in history.

On Oct. 19, 1987, people stopped each other in the streets to ask about the market, or stood transfixed in front of ticker tapes and televisions to see how low it would go. The day came to be known as Black Monday.

Regular folks at the time wondered: Was there anything they could do to save themselves?

“For some, the answer to that question was a dismal and heartbreaking no,” wrote The Times, “It was too late.”

While panic swept the trading floors, Wall Street traders, who “are usually quick with the wisecracks following everyone else’s disasters,” were left “with an unprecedented loss for words,” according to The Times.

For others, The Times noted that after the crash, “the joy of investing is gone,”

It would take two years for the market to return to the same level.

The cause of the crash is still being debated — some think it was an inflated market correcting itself, and others blame it on “dumb computers,” or computer programs that sold stocks that fell to a certain price. WNYC is doing a series of stories on the crash this week.

Created and directed by Nabil Al-Raee and Zoe Lafferty, this study of soldiers waiting out the standoff with diminishing supplies and stamina takes a more naturalistic and overtly didactic approach than “Burning Doors.” The characters here include a scene-bridging tour guide, who reminds us of the sacredness of the setting — summoned in crepuscular stateliness by Andy Purves (lighting) and Anna Gisle (set).

But most of the play is devoted to conversation among six soldiers, who debate the existential toll of resistance and the historical value of martyrdom in dialogue that emphasizes exposition and theme over individual character. Despite the intrinsic suspense of the setup and the likability of the performers, “The Siege” often registers as sincere but static, like an animated chapter from a partisan history book.

The astonishment of “Burning Doors” — conceived and staged by the troupe founders and artistic directors (in exile), Nikolai Khalezin and Natalia Koliada — is its ability to translate political rage and impotence into an art of indirection that is often as complex as it is powerful. This is no trumpeting call to arms, or not only that, but an open-ended portrait of both the sociology and psychology of the artist as rebel in Eastern Europe.

At the production’s center are three specific artists of the 21st century: Ms. Alyokhina of Pussy Riot; the Russian political performance artist Petr Pavlensky, whose widely reported acts of civil disobedience have included nailing his scrotum to Red Square; and the Ukranian filmmaker Oleg Sentsov, who is in jail in Russia for alleged acts of terrorism.

Ms. Alyokhina — whose book “Riot Days,” published in English this year, is in part a memoir of incarceration — is here to testify on her own behalf. She becomes a participant in the ensemble’s impressionistic re-creations of an outcast childhood, a brutalizing stint in prison (in which cavity searches were common events) and the bewildering early days of freedom.

She even appears in a drolly self-conscious question-and-answer session, in English, with the audience. (The questions on the night I saw the show included, “What do we do about Trump?” Her answer, delivered tentatively and almost shyly: “I would resist. But it’s you, not me,” who must make the decision.)

The words of Mr. Pavlensky and Mr. Sentsov, who have been highly articulate in state psychiatric exams and court statements and testimony, are spoken — and projected — here as well. (Most of the performance is in Russian and Belarusian, with English supertitles.)

As for the opposition, it is given comic voice by two actors, embodying Russian fat cat apparatchiks (Pavel Haradnitski and Andrei Urazau), who discuss how to deal with the incomprehensible behavior of subversive artists while sitting, face to face, on toilets. (That scene has a triumphant visual punch line, involving women dressed in signature Pussy Riot balaclavas, wielding flashlights and rolls of toilet paper.)

The production also summons the lyricism under duress of the French poet Paul Éluard (whose “Liberty,” a totemic work for the French Resistance during World War II, is recited by Maryia Sazonava in a noose and harness, suspended agonizingly above the stage); and the ruminations of Michel Foucault (delivered by Maryna Yurevich as a circus ringmaster-cum-judge) on subjugation and punishment.

The twisted human forms of the art of Egon Schiele are conjured in haunting ballets of what might be called defensive masochism. The performers coil their bodies increasingly inward, as if to squeeze their own flesh into invisibility.

The punishment of one’s own flesh is notoriously the specialty of Mr. Pavlensky, whose performance pieces of protest include — in addition to the scrotum nailing — setting fire to the doors of the Russian Federal Security Service building, sewing his lips together and wrapping his body in barbed wire.

“Burning Doors,” which has been designed as a sort of prison cell of the mind by Mr. Khalezin, makes the subliminal case that such painful activities are of a piece with a longstanding, specifically Russian sensibility. In the 19th century, Dostoyevsky wrote about the phenomenon of self-laceration, as both a physical and spiritual form of torment, a naturally unnatural response to the divisive absurdities of self and society.

Two of this production’s most haunting vignettes are set to Dostoyevsky’s words. A naked performer slowly dresses himself while reciting Prince Myshkin’s account from “The Idiot” of a man awaiting his execution, counting down what he believes to be the final moments of his life.

The actor here, Kyril Masheka, is steeped in a raw, empathic fear and sorrow that make putting on clothes a fraught and irrelevant-seeming business. And in a scene from “The Brothers Karamazov,” a dialectic debate on viciousness and goodness between Ivan and Alyosha (Mr. Haradnitski and Mr. Urazau) becomes a furniture-upending wrestling match.

Philosophical issues of immortal import assume a mortal — and moral — urgency. And Dostoyevsky’s questions about persisting, and resisting, in the face of institutionalized inhumanity glow with an infectious fever.

Intel said its intent “was to convey the performance capabilities of our processors through the visual metaphor of a sprinter,” but acknowledged, “Unfortunately, our execution did not deliver our intended message and in fact proved to be insensitive and insulting.”

Dove, May 2011

In 2011, Dove was criticized for another ad: this one showing three women standing side by side, each with lighter skin than the woman next to her. Behind them were signs reading “before” and “after”; the “before” sign, positioned behind an African-American woman, showed cracked skin, while the “after” sign, behind a white woman, showed smooth skin.

“Visibly more beautiful skin,” the ad read.

Edelman, the public relations company representing Dove, said in a statement to Gawker: “All three women are intended to demonstrate the ‘after’ product benefit. We do not condone any activity or imagery that intentionally insults any audience.”

The fact that the most recent ad was Dove’s second to cause offense was not lost on social media users.

Popchips, May 2012

Popchips drew fire in 2012 for an ad in which Ashton Kutcher played several characters — including a Bollywood producer named Raj, complete with brownface and an Indian accent.

Popchips initially urged viewers to watch the ad in the humorous “spirit it was intended.” Later, its chief executive, Keith Belling, said in a statement: “Our team worked hard to create a lighthearted parody featuring a variety of characters that was meant to provide a few laughs. We did not intend to offend anyone. I take full responsibility and apologize to anyone we offended.”

Qiaobi, May 2016

In a 2016 commercial for the Chinese company Qiaobi’s laundry detergent, an Asian woman shoves a detergent pod into a black man’s mouth and puts him in a washing machine, from which he emerges as a light-skinned Asian.

A spokeswoman for Qiaobi, Xu Chunyan, was unapologetic. “We did this for some sensational effect,” she said at the time. “If we just show laundry like all the other advertisements, ours will not stand out.”

Nivea, April 2017

In April, the skin care company Nivea released a deodorant ad that read, “White is purity.” White supremacists on the internet took note, with one 4chan user writing, “Nivea has chosen our side.”

A representative of Nivea’s parent company, Beiersdorf, said it had “never intended to hurt anybody or to raise any wrong interpretation.”

But, like Dove, Nivea had offended before.

Six years earlier, after apologizing for an ad that showed a black man preparing to throw away his old Afro-wearing head behind the words “Re-civilize yourself,” it promised to review “current development and approval processes” in order to “avoid any kind of future misleading interpretations.”",Dove Drops an Ad Accused of Racism,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/08/business/dove-ad-racist.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

“To a certain extent, any postpartum depression is just depression that happens to emerge in the postpartum period,” she said.","The idea that parents who haven’t given birth can get postpartum depression isn’t entirely new. Studies have shown, for example, that moms and dads who adopt children also show signs of the condition.

But some mental health experts question whether what fathers experience after birth is truly postpartum depression.

“There’s no question the perinatal time is one of the hardest for both men and women,” said Dr. Samantha Meltzer-Brody, a professor of perinatal psychiatry at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine. “But the process of birthing and the hormonal gymnastics that women experience is on a different planet.” When it comes to depression in dads versus moms, “I see them as utterly apples and oranges,” she said.

Indeed, defining postpartum depression has been a centuries-long pursuit, hobbled by a social stigma that prevents many women from acknowledging they have a problem. Women plagued by the sadness, anxiety and suicidal thoughts associated with the condition — first noted by Hippocrates in 400 B.C. — have long been told it was all in their heads, or blamed themselves for not being good enough moms.

In the past five years, several studies have shown evidence of a long-suspected link between postpartum depression and the hormonal fluctuations common to women after birth, bringing greater medical legitimacy to the diagnosis. Some of the shame and stigma surrounding the condition has also lifted as high-profile mothers like Brooke Shields, Gwyneth Paltrow and, most recently, Ivanka Trump have shared their own stories of postpartum depression.

Yet researchers still can’t say how large a role hormones may play relative to other factors like stress, sleep deprivation and a history of mental illness.

“What I take issue with is the contention that men don’t go through the wild hormonal changes” that women do, said Will Courtenay, a psychologist and author of “Dying to Be Men: Psychosocial, Environmental and Biobehavioral Directions in Promoting the Health of Men and Boys.” “It’s not just testosterone” that fluctuates in new fathers, he noted, “but also other hormones that we know are associated with births in women,” including estradiol and prolactin, he said.

And women are hardly alone in facing the stigma surrounding mental illness. “There is a very powerful myth in this country that men don’t get depressed, or if they do, they shouldn’t express it,” said Dr. Courtenay. “Consequently, men are less likely to get treated for depression.” To wit: Adam Busby, a father who appeared on the TLC reality series “OutDaughtered,” faced criticism in July after he went public with his depression following the birth of his quintuplets.

In 2007, Dr. Courtenay established Postpartummen.com as a gathering place for new dads struggling with mental health issues. Today, the site offers resources for men in search of assistance. Postpartum Support International also hosts a free phone consultation for dads on the first Monday of every month.

What both sides agree is that too little attention has been paid to the role of men in the postpartum discussion. Dr. Jennifer L. Payne, director of the Women’s Mood Disorders Center at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, said the new research helps shed light on the role that spouses and hormones may play in the condition but stopped short of labeling what men experience as postpartum depression. The U.S.C. study, she said, “was about depressive symptoms, and I would not call that postpartum depression. I think that’s a very different ballgame.”

Dr. Saxbe isn’t so sure. “To a certain extent, any postpartum depression is just depression that happens to emerge in the postpartum period,” she said. “It’s not super conclusive that there’s an obvious hormonal reason in women, either.”

Mr. Sandler, now 45, sees things differently. Following his panic attack, he sought help from a psychiatrist, who prescribed medication and helped him see that his son’s “difficult infant phase” wouldn’t last forever.

“After three months, I started coming around,” he said. He credits the medication for helping ease his anxiety — “It helped not having those peaks and valleys” — and his “very supportive wife” for helping him focus on the joys of having a baby.

Since then, fathering “has been a wonderful experience,” he said.

Does he believe he had postpartum depression? “I don’t want my experience to take away from anything a woman goes through,” he said. “This is nowhere in the same category.”",Can Fathers Have Postpartum Depression?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/well/family/can-fathers-have-postpartum-depression.html

Professional stylists often discuss goals, priorities and other issues in order to develop a client’s personal style. It’s a long process that can take months of working one on one with someone.

“Working with a stylist is more about figuring out who you are, and then dressing yourself accordingly,” Ms. Messiah added. “You really get to understand how things are supposed to fit so you can maximize its use in your closet.”

Don’t expect to get the same level of service in a box, Ms. Messiah says. She suggests having specific action items ready for your online stylist because, unlike an in-person stylist, they won’t ask you questions about your priorities and goals. It’s crucial to have an idea of what you want beforehand. Instead of “I want a better wardrobe,” you might tell your stylist, “I need nicer dresses to wear to company cocktail parties” or “I need casual clothes that also look professional for my remote job.”

As long as you keep your expectations realistic, however, these services can be useful, and there are a number of ways to ensure you have the best possible experience with them.

Pick the right box to start

There are two different categories of clothing box services: subscription-only and try-and-buy. Subscription-only services, like Threads Monthly or Five Four Club, don’t send clothes that are intended to be sent back. (In fact, some don’t even offer refunds.) These subscription boxes work just like Birchbox or Blue Apron: you sign up for a box and keep what you get.

By comparison, Stitch Fix and Trunk Club are try-and-buy services, meaning you try on the clothes and only buy the items you keep. You can order a box regularly and set up your own subscription, but they’re ultimately designed to allow you to try on clothes in the comfort of your home. This also means you need to trust yourself to reliably send back the items that don’t fit or that you don’t like.

If you know what kind of clothing you like and simply want a regular shipment of new threads every month, subscription-only services are probably your best bet. However, if you’re looking to try new styles, address specific clothing needs for your body, or just need the help of a professional to pick out pieces, you’ll probably want to stick with the flexibility of try-and-buy.

Our favorite pick, Stitch Fix, offers that flexibility. It also offers a variety of sizing, from petite to tall to plus-size, which is another factor you want to consider when picking the right box. Most, but not all, boxes have clothes that fit a variety of body types, and you can typically find this information in the FAQ section of their website. For more on what made Stitch Fix the winning choice — and for details on other options — check out our full comparison and test at Wirecutter, a New York Times company.

Give your stylist specific feedback

Once you sign up for a service, take the time to fill out your profile thoroughly. Stitch Fix and Bombfell, two of the most popular options, take you through a series of detailed questions about your measurements and preferences.

This can be time-consuming, but the more time you spend offering accurate answers, the better chance you have of getting a box you like. With Trunk Club, another popular option, you’ll answer a few basic questions, too, but then a stylist will contact you, either via email or chat, to get more insight and feedback from you.

“I would take the time because that really informs what you’re getting,” said Jon Shanahan of the YouTube style channel The Kavalier. “When I first used Trunk Club, I just wrote a couple of things to my stylist, and looking back it wasn’t very helpful. If you take the time to say why things fit what you like, it’s in their best interest to get you right as a customer.”

Mr. Shanahan even suggests getting feedback about your style from friends and family to help you with the process. Many of these services also include a section where you can leave a message for your stylist. Don’t leave that field blank. Give your stylist as much information as possible so they know what to work with.

If you want specific items in your wardrobe, let them know. If you have specific goals for your style, like more clothes for networking events, tell them. Search for some styles you like on Pinterest, pin them to a board, and send the link to your stylist. Most services will directly ask for a Pinterest board link.

Learn some style basics

It doesn’t hurt to learn the basics of personal style, either. This way, you know you’re requesting the right types of clothing, and clothing that you like and that looks good on you.

“I think there’s something fundamentally wrong with how we think about style. “You don’t know why you’re wearing something, so it just ends up being another thing in the back of your closet. Get to the reasons why you want something,” Ms. Messiah suggested.

Personal styling is often a self-discovery process that explores your desires beyond the clothing. The process helps you determine why you want to look better in the first place, and then encourages you to align your personal goals, career goals, and even relationship goals with your style. If you want to excel in your corporate career, for example, you’ll do well to focus on choosing professional clothing that supports that goal. That means leaving out shorts and T-shirts when you place your order.

Try a second box

Your online stylist might not get it right the first time around. “You need to give it two cycles for them to really nail everything,” Mr. Shanahan added. “That’s when you really start to say, ‘Yes you got this.’”

The idea is that the more you work with your stylist, the better a grasp they’ll have on what you’re looking for, specifically. In fact, when you send items back, most services allow you to briefly explain why you’re sending that particular item back. Maybe the shoulders are too big or you just have too many of that type of item in your wardrobe already. Your stylist will see these notes and know not to send you similar pieces next time.

Thus at $20 to $25 a box, it may be worth a second or third chance if you’re unhappy with the first box. And some boxes, like Bombfell, don’t have a styling fee at all. As Mr. Shanahan put it, “You might as well give it a couple of shots because there’s a very low barrier to entry.”

Finally, it’s worth noting that shopping for clothing can also be a stressful experience, namely when you don’t find anything that fits you quite right. Try to have fun, and remember to exercise some self-compassion along the way.

“It’s not you, it’s the clothes,” Ms. Messiah said. “There’s vanity sizing. No one designs the clothes with you in mind.” She advises her own clients to keep an open mind when it comes to trying on new things and remember: “it’s all part of a journey, but at the end of the day, it’s just clothes.”",How to Use Clothing Subscription Boxes to Find Your Personal Style,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/smarter-living/clothing-box-services-stitch-fix-trunk-club.html

With the fall of Raqqa, the Islamic State has lost the two most important cities of its self-declared caliphate in three months.
Hundreds of Islamic State fighters had decamped from Raqqa to Mayadeen in recent months, taking heavy equipment with them.
It is unclear what happened to the last several hundred Islamic State fighters holed up in Raqqa.
Witnesses in Raqqa said that several busloads of Islamic State fighters, both Syrians and foreigners, had been allowed to board buses to Deir al-Zour.","Whether final or not, the seemingly inevitable defeat in Raqqa of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, carries heavy symbolic weight. At its height in 2014, the group controlled Iraq’s second-largest city, Mosul, as well as Raqqa and large stretches of land on both sides of the border. And it had grand aspirations to increase its territory and cement its rule.

The Islamic State leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who once spent time in a prison run by occupying American troops in Iraq, claimed to be the successor to the caliphs, the Islamic emperors who shaped the region in past centuries. He persuaded tens of thousands of Muslims from around the world, some new to the faith or poorly versed in it, to travel to the region to fight. The group seized the ancient ruins of Palmyra in Syria and those of Hatra in Iraq, destroying important historical monuments in the name of its interpretation of Islam.

With the fall of Raqqa, the Islamic State has lost the two most important cities of its self-declared caliphate in three months. It was pushed out of Mosul in July, and now holds only a fraction of the territory it once controlled.

Analysts say the group is already preparing for a new phase, morphing back into the kind of underground insurgency it started as, when it took root among disaffected Sunni populations that were willing to tolerate, if not wholeheartedly embrace, its ultraconservative brand of Islam. And while many Arabs quickly soured on the group because of its brutal crackdowns and unfulfilled promises, their underlying political disaffection has not been addressed.

Another major concern, now that Islamic State-held territory is reduced, is how countries in Europe, in the Middle East and around the world will handle the foreigners who joined the group in places like Syria and might return home and plan attacks there.

A victory in Raqqa has come at a heavy cost. Much of the city has been devastated by American-led airstrikes that killed more than 1,000 civilians, according to tallies by local activists and international monitors. In earlier years, many were killed by Russian and Syrian government strikes. About 270,000 residents have been displaced by the fighting, and thousands of homes have been destroyed.

Hassan Mohammad Ali, a member of a civilian council backed by the United States and the Syrian Democratic Forces that is supposed to be responsible for rebuilding the city, said last week that reconstruction would be a challenge.

“The city is in ruins; it needs time,” he said. “And it needs prospects that are beyond ours, our energy.” Just providing bread to areas retaken from the Islamic State was stretching the council’s capacity, he said.

Dr. Mohammad Ahmed Saleh, a resident of the city who now works in a hospital in Tal al-Abyad, said he was eager to return home but was bracing for the worst.

“I’m expecting to see a new Hiroshima,” he said by telephone, taking a break from treating a newly arrived contingent of 19 wounded people from Raqqa, a mix of civilians and fighters for the Islamic State. “I’m trying to be mentally prepared when I go. I’ll be lucky if I see one of my house’s walls still standing.”

Many former residents said they had no plans to go back.

“Today, I decided to start a new life,” said Wadha Huwaidi, who fled Raqqa a few months ago. “I’m sad, of course, but I had nothing left there. My house was destroyed, my children, my husband all collapsed. There’s nothing left that makes me feel I want to go back.”

For months, Islamic State commanders and fighters have been withdrawing from Raqqa and moving southeast into the neighboring province of Deir al-Zour. They have clustered in neighborhoods in the provincial capital, which is also called Deir al-Zour, as well as in the town of Mayadeen and in a town on the border with Iraq called al-Bukamal. Hundreds of Islamic State fighters had decamped from Raqqa to Mayadeen in recent months, taking heavy equipment with them.

But over the weekend, Syrian government forces, backed by their Russian and Iranian allies, took Mayadeen and continued their advance into the provincial capital, leaving the Islamic State with the border town as the only urban area entirely under its control in Syria. Beyond that, Islamic State fighters are scattered in a large area of the Syrian desert, outside population centers.

It is unclear what happened to the last several hundred Islamic State fighters holed up in Raqqa. There were conflicting reports about whether foreign fighters among them would be allowed to evacuate on buses in a surrender deal.

Last week, the United States-led coalition said there would be no negotiated withdrawal of Islamic State fighters, just the evacuation of civilians, if necessary, to keep them out of the crossfire. But in previous battles, in Hawija and Tal Afar, surrendering fighters were allowed to board buses to Islamic State-held territory. Witnesses in Raqqa said that several busloads of Islamic State fighters, both Syrians and foreigners, had been allowed to board buses to Deir al-Zour.

The fall of Raqqa threatens to inflame relations between Kurds and Arabs, who have been fighting the Islamic State in an uneasy alliance with the United States-led coalition — but against an enemy that is rapidly melting away. Most immediately, they may be at odds over the future governing of Raqqa.

Similar tensions were on display in Kirkuk, Iraq, on Monday after Iraqi government forces drove out Kurdish forces to the cheers of Turkmens and Arabs in the ethnically mixed city.

The battle against the Islamic State has also led to touchy de facto partnerships internationally, with the United States, Russia and Iran all fighting the group in sometimes competing efforts, vying for influence.

Deir al-Zour, home to most of Syria’s modest oil reserves, continues to be a flash point for possible tensions between the two rival coalitions fighting the Islamic State: Russia, Iran and the Syrian government on one side, and the United States and the Syrian Democratic Forces on the other.

Both sides want to increase their influence over the region as their proxies race one another to take Islamic State areas straddling Syria and Iraq. The Syrian government and its allies, Iran and Russia, are steadily driving the Islamic State from Deir al-Zour, and a crucial question is whether the government will ultimately seek to retake full control of Raqqa as well.","Raqqa, ISIS ‘Capital,’ Is Captured, U.S.-Backed Forces Say",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/world/middleeast/isis-syria-raqqa.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

But the Haqqanis freed no one else. American officials said communications with the Haqqani network had gotten garbled, causing confusion, and the death of the leader of the Taliban, killed by a United States drone strike last year, also set back efforts to rescue the hostages. The diapers that F.B.I. agents in Afghanistan had bought for Ms. Coleman’s children would go unused.

Not only were hostages kept in captivity, the militants were also not done kidnapping. In August 2016, they seized an Australian, Timothy Weeks, and an American, Kevin King, 61, both teachers at the American University of Afghanistan in Kabul. Navy SEALs launched a rescue operation but came up empty; a tip about where the men were being held turned out to be outdated.

But last month, the American intelligence community caught a break. The C.I.A. had positioned the drone over a Haqqani encampment in the Kurram Valley, a region near Pakistan’s border with Afghanistan. It spotted the woman believed to be Ms. Coleman among the armed fighters.

The commandos of SEAL Team 6, tapped to rescue the family, started rehearsing. The raid was to take place not far from where the C.I.A. had originally spotted the family, according to one military official.

But the risky operation planned on Pakistani soil was called off because some in the United States government were not certain that the people spotted by the drones were Ms. Coleman, Mr. Boyle and their children, according to the officials. Others voiced worries about the difficult terrain and the moon — it was too bright for a nighttime airborne raid.

Why the Haqqanis decided to move the family is not clear. But on Oct. 11, as they headed toward Kohat, a city farther inside Pakistan, American intelligence officials realized they could not let the opportunity to save the family slip by — the United States had to act.

American officials formed a plan to press the Pakistani government. Mr. Trump was briefed, and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson both backed the idea that should the Pakistani government decline to try to rescue the family, the Navy SEALs would go in.

Officials said that as Mr. Hale, the ambassador, conveyed the Trump administration’s demands, other senior officials, including Gen. Joseph L. Votel, who oversees American military operations in the Middle East and southwest Asia as head of the United States Central Command, were also applying pressure.

The push worked. American officials said the Pakistanis acted quickly, intercepting the vehicle with Ms. Coleman and her family. According to Pakistani security officials, they were able to shoot out the tires of the vehicle, but the captors manage to flee.

Mr. Boyle has said a gun battle ensued before he and his family were freed, but American officials remained skeptical and a Pakistani military spokesman has said only that the vehicle’s tires were blown out.

In an interview after he was freed, Mr. Boyle praised the Pakistanis: “Our gratitude is boundless.”",Navy SEALs Were Ready if Pakistan Failed to Free Family Held as Hostages,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/world/asia/hostage-rescue-pakistan-navy-seals.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Foreign Policy and Military Modernization

Throughout his speech, Mr. Xi described China as a “great power” or a “strong power” 26 times, a clear departure from the days when leaders in Beijing depicted their country as a poor, modest player abroad. “China will continue to play its part as a major and responsible country,” Mr. Xi said.

Mr. Xi said China was committed to supporting international cooperation, global economic integration and the developing world. He also highlighted his trademark “One Belt, One Road” initiative to build roads, railways and other infrastructure projects that solidify Chinese economic and political influence.

But Mr. Xi also took a hard line on some issues. Near the start of his report, he called China’s building of artificial islands in the South China Sea a highlight of his first five years, despite the fact that they have raised tensions with other Asian countries, and the United States Navy.

Mr. Xi also warned that China had to gird for possible conflict. Having reorganized China’s military during his first term, Mr. Xi promised more changes in the next five years, including greater professionalization of officers and more innovation in weaponry. By midcentury, he said, China’s military would be first class in every way, though he did not give details of what that meant.

“A military is built to fight,” Mr. Xi said. “Our military must regard combat capability as the criterion to meet in all its work, and focus on how to win when it is called on.”

Taiwan and Hong Kong

Just days ago, soccer fans in Hong Kong angered many in mainland China by turning their backs to the Chinese national flag during the playing of China’s national anthem. The show of disrespect was the latest sign of the deep unhappiness at Beijing’s opposition to full-fledged democracy in the former British colony, where there are even calls for independence from China.

In his speech, Mr. Xi said that Hong Kong and nearby Macau, a former Portuguese colony, can govern themselves, but only “with patriots playing the principal role.” He also called for the return of Taiwan, a self-governing island, to mainland Chinese control, before delivering the line that won the loudest applause of his marathon speech: “We will never allow anyone, any organization, or any political party, at any time or in any form, to separate any part of Chinese territory from China.”

Security at Home, Too

While Mr. Xi’s report described a more confident, engaged China abroad, it also dwelled on the risks from social tensions created by decades of rapid growth. While Mr. Xi has tightened China’s already strict controls on protest, dissent and unrest, he warned that the sources of social discontent were changing in ways that demanded new responses.

“What we now face is the contradiction between unbalanced and inadequate development and the people’s ever-growing needs for a better life,” Mr. Xi said. He said improving people’s lives included reducing pollution, improving schools and health care, and ensuring fairer access to courts and the justice system.

But keeping China under control requires sticks as well as carrots, Mr. Xi told delegates. Mr. Xi has already established a National Security Commission, a secretive body that helps steer domestic security. China would further “improve the national security system, and strengthen national security capacity,” he said.

To do that, Mr. Xi promised more efforts to control the internet, including the use of censorship to “clearly oppose and resist the whole range of erroneous viewpoints.”

Leading China Into a New Era

Among the many slogans used by Mr. Xi, one stood out. Time and again, Mr. Xi said China had entered a “new era” under his stewardship, and the phrase also featured in the long-winded title of his report: “Secure a Decisive Victory in Building a Moderately Prosperous Society in All Respects and Strive for the Great Success of Socialism With Chinese Characteristics for a New Era.”

“It will be an era that sees China moving closer to center stage,” Mr. Xi said.

Mr. Xi also made clear that he was the best leader to guide China into this new era. By using that phrase and others like it, Mr. Xi appeared to be making the case that he was to this new era what iconic Chinese leaders like Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping had been in their times.

Mr. Xi also held out China as a model for the new era, saying his country had developed its economy without imitating Western values. “It offers a new option for other countries and nations who want to speed up their development while preserving their independence,” he said.",Xi Jinping’s Marathon Speech: Five Takeaways,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/world/asia/china-xi-jinping-party-congress.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Identify your values before donating

When considering how to give, it’s helpful to start by asking what motivates you.

“You pick the issue with your heart and you pick the organization with your head,” said Jacob Harold, the chief executive of GuideStar, a nonprofit that publishes information about charities in an effort to promote transparency.

People with ties to a region may want to give locally. Animal lovers may want to give to a shelter. Others may want their money directed to certain groups of people, like children, or causes, like public health.

Many opt to leave the decision to the charities themselves, which is sometimes best: “If you’re trusting them with your money, you should trust them to spend it well,” Mr. Harold said.

Decide how to spend your time

Your time is a resource, too, and you should decide how you want to spend it.

Some people prefer to deeply research the charities they support, while others simply want to know they’re giving to a trustworthy group.

For those who prefer the latter, Mr. Harold recommends groups like Global Giving, which collects donations and redistributes the funds to vetted, locally focused organizations.

Do your research before you give

Evaluating a charity is often the most daunting part of donating, but it doesn’t have to be.

In addition to GuideStar and Charity Navigator, the Better Business Bureau’s Wise Giving Alliance and Charity Watch offer helpful resources.

Tax filings and other documents can shed light on a group’s operations, but donors should look beyond the numbers, too, experts said. That includes reviewing an organization’s website, annual report, governing board and mission.

“If the organization is only talking about the problem, but not talking about how the work they do leads to solutions to that problem, that is a red flag,” Mr. Harold said.

Ask questions about the charity, including how much experience it has in disaster relief, how long it’s been around, how it measures accomplishments, and how others in the field talk about it.

He also said that too much focus is often placed on overhead, a measure of administrative and fund-raising costs. While it can signal inefficient spending or, worse, fraud, some overhead is necessary to support a nonprofit’s long-term viability.

Cash is often the best way to help

It may feel impersonal, but money is often the most useful form of donation. Unlike goods, financial gifts have no associated transportation costs.

A $20 pair of jeans, for example, would cost about $165 to ship from Washington, D.C., to the capital of Honduras, according to an online calculator developed by the University of Rhode Island. That money could instead be used locally to buy 24 blankets, nearly 33,000 liters of water or a variety of other supplies, according to the calculator.

There are secondary benefits, too: With cash, relief organizations can support local economies, according to the Center for International Disaster Information, which was created by the United States Agency for International Development.

Follow up later. Recovery takes a long time.

Donations surge in the immediate aftermath of disasters, but recoveries unfold over a much longer timeline.

For that reason, donors should consider sustained involvement with charities, whether that involves checking up on how resources were spent and how needs have changed weeks or months down the line or making automatic monthly contributions.

Mr. Rodriguez, who is white, was raised by a Nigerian stepfather, married a Guatemalan woman, and for years relied on an Iraqi next-door neighbor to help his family when he was fighting overseas. He does not consider himself prejudiced.

“How can they say I hate Iraqis? I gave my soul for Iraq,” he said.

But friends and family say four deployments to war zones left him changed, especially the first one. In 2004 he went to Ramadi, Iraq, as a 27-year-old platoonsergeant. The tour with the Second Battalion, Fourth Marine Regiment is widely thought to be one of the deadliest six months of any American unit in either Iraq or Afghanistan. Thirty-four Marines were killed and more than 255 were wounded.

Several moments from those months still commandeer Mr. Rodriguez’s thoughts, but none more so than the morning of April 6, 2004, when he was leading a dozen Marines down an urban boulevard and rooftops erupted with the flash of gunfire. Hundreds of enemy fighters had launched a coordinated ambush all over the city. By sundown, 12 Marines in the battalion were dead.

In an interview, Mr. Rodriguez tried to describe the fight, but stammered and fell silent several times before beginning to cry.

According to other Marines from the squad, the ambush split their group in two, and Mr. Rodriguez ordered his half into a house to assess a grim situation. A pair of Marines lay dead in the street. Two more a block away had been hit by a grenade. Reinforcements were bogged down. Enemy fighters were trying to scale the walls into the courtyard of the house. Ammunition was running low.

Pieces of the battle are clear to him more than a decade later: the frantic crackle of the platoon radio, the feeble thumbs-up from a 21-year-old private who had been shot in the neck. The anger he felt after recovering the fly-covered body of a 19-year-old Marine after the battle — a kid who had written a letter to his church saying faith in God would keep him safe.

Other parts are a blur. The citation for a Bronze Star that Mr. Rodriguez received for valor says he killed 10 enemy fighters that day. He doesn’t remember clearly.

“I went to zone black. No conscience, no fear, no nothing,” he said in a phone interview late one night. “I didn’t care if I was going to die. I just did my job as an infantry man.”

“You come home, you have to live with yourself,” he added. “I’m a bad person now, I went against all I had ever been taught.”

When he returned home, friends said, Mr. Rodriguez seemed drained. He spoke little about what had happened, but couldn’t sleep and drank heavily. He began having visions at night of dead Marines. On anniversaries he visited their graves and weathered the blame from their families. He put in paperwork to award the men Bronze Stars, and hung the citations on his wall.

Many in the battalion were also haunted by the experience, but it was early in the war, and formal PTSD diagnoses were rare, said Winston Jaugan, who was Mr. Rodriguez’s friend and, as a gunnery sergeant, his boss. “No one had a diagnosis. They would just give us pills for everything — Valium, Ambien. And we would drink,” he said.

As a leader, other Marines said, Mr. Rodriguez carried a particularly heavy burden.

“He was like the father of the squad,” said Joe Hays, who was hit by a grenade during the battle. “And he saw everything that went wrong as his fault.”

SATURDAY PUZZLE — I’m going to do something a bit different today. I’ve spilled a few clues, but I want you to get through the puzzle yourself, mostly so you will appreciate the rest of the column. I’ve been looking for an opportunity to develop my Lewis Black impression, and this is it.

Mr. Walden, who is one of the nicest people you would ever want to meet, quietly takes his aggressions out by writing the kind of clues that make many solvers, myself included, feel a lot like this dog:

That’s called misdirection. Misdirection is when you look at a clue like 20D’s “One who tries to avoid being touched” and your brain starts to run through the names of disorders where people don’t like being touched because that’s got to be what the constructor is thinking, right, and then the answer winds up being an odd word like EPEEIST. (A “touch” is when your fencing opponent scores against you.)

It’s when you see a clue like “Fabulous speaker?” and think O.K., maybe it’s AESOP, because you’ve been trained, I mean trained, to think AESOP’s fables whenever you see the word “fabulous” in a clue, but the answer turns out to be LIAR. And he’s not wrong. Someone who tells tales is a LIAR.

The incidence of mouth and throat cancers caused by the human papilloma virus in men has now surpassed the incidence of HPV-related cervical cancers in women, researchers report.

The study, in the Annals of Internal Medicine, found that 11 million men and 3.2 million women in the United States had oral HPV infections. Among them, 7 million men and 1.4 million women had strains that can cause cancers of the throat, tongue and other areas of the head and neck.

The risk of infection was higher for smokers, for people who have had multiple sex partners, and for men who have sex with men. Frequent oral sex also increased the risk. The rate was higher among men who also had genital HPV. (Almost half of men aged 18 to 60 have a genital HPV infection, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.)

Neither age nor income made a difference in high-risk oral infection rates, but rates among non-Hispanic blacks were higher than other races and ethnicities.

HPV vaccination is recommended starting at age 11 or 12 and is effective, said the senior author, Ashish A. Deshmukh, an assistant professor at the University of Florida, and “it’s crucial that parents vaccinate boys as well as girls.”

“I noticed that when I cooked, my dad especially would make us all sit down and eat together,” he said. “I loved it.”

He graduated from college in Canada and made his first fortune in 1999, when he and his brother sold Zip2 — a digital mapping service that helped newspapers including The New York Times produce online city guides — to Compaq Computer for $307 million. He became an investor in his brother’s other ventures, including PayPal and Tesla. (He is on the board of both Elon Musk’s electric car company and his rocket company, SpaceX, as well as Chipotle Mexican Grill.)

Set financially, Mr. Musk moved from Silicon Valley to New York and enrolled in the French Culinary Institute (now the International Culinary Center). He lived near the World Trade Center, and after the 9/11 attacks, spent six weeks volunteering as a cook for firefighters and other people working the pile. He finally understood, he said, the link between food and community.

Soon after, he and Jen Lewin, his first wife, left for Colorado, where he met Mr. Matheson and opened The Kitchen in 2004. With its deep farm-to-table ethos and casually elegant style, the restaurant was an immediate hit.

Both projects were running just fine without him, so Mr. Musk became chief executive of another tech company. Then, on a 2010 trip with his family in Jackson Hole, Wyo., he was sliding down a snowy hill on an inner tube when it flipped. He broke his neck and was temporarily paralyzed.

During the two months he had to lie flat on his back, it became clear that he wanted to devote himself to food. He and his wife divorced; he quit the tech company and dedicated himself to changing the way Americans eat.

Mr. Musk became interested in school gardens. He remains friendly with his ex-wife (the couple have two boys, and he has a daughter with another woman), and Ms. Lewin designed modular curved plastic planters that could be arranged in any schoolyard. Paired with instructions on how they can be used to teach subjects like science, the first gardens were installed in Denver schools in 2011.

Mr. Musk has begun a chain of hyper-local restaurants called Next Door, which he and Mr. Matheson envision as the Applebee’s for a new generation.

All the food is cooked from scratch. Menus feature wild salmon, burgers of local pasture-raised beef and big Greek salads with vegetables from nearby farms. Entree prices average $14, and the restaurants are designed so customers sit down together to eat and get their meals almost as soon as they order.

The first opened six years ago next to The Kitchen in Boulder. In September, another opened in a huge urban renewal project in Memphis called Crosstown Concourse, an abandoned Sears distribution center that has been turned into apartments and shops, with a school, a health clinic and an arts center. The partners plan to add 50 more Next Door restaurants by the end of 2020.

Mr. Musk also opened an outpost of his more upscale Kitchen restaurant inside a 4,500-acre urban park called Shelby Farms in the center of Memphis. But he insisted that he be allowed to buy 300 acres nearby that for decades had been used to grow cotton, so he could turn it into an organic farm, a project now in the works.

He is also testing the Kitchenette, a little takeout spot in Shelby Farms that sells locally grown, well-prepared meals for about $5 — his answer to a fast-food restaurant.

Mr. Musk’s nonprofit arm, The Kitchen Community, has put learning gardens into 100 Memphis schools, providing both staff and materials. Each one costs about $40,000, money that comes from the Musk Foundation and local donors. He has placed his gardens in schools in Los Angeles, Pittsburgh and 150 in Chicago, where Mayor Rahm Emanuel gave the project $2 million in city funds. By 2020, Mr. Musk hopes to have them in more than 1,000 schools.

He is not a fan of traditional school garden programs. “They don’t scale at all,” he said.

There are other ways to ruffle the feathers of Alice Waters, the Bay Area chef who helped pioneer the American slow-food movement and the concept of the edible schoolyard, but criticizing her approach to local food and school gardens is near the top of the list.

“I don’t want to hear another word about scaling,” Ms. Waters said. “He doesn’t know what he doesn’t know. He’s very earnest about what he’s doing, but he doesn’t know enough about farming and about the soil. He wants to do the right thing, but he just hasn’t done his homework. Not everything has to be scalable.”

Mr. Musk says he is “absolutely in conflict” with Ms. Waters. “I love her, but I don’t agree with her views.”

Critics have taken on his Square Roots project, too. The idea is to train young farmers by teaching them to grow greens with nothing but enhanced water and LEDs in shipping containers, and then sell the lettuce and kale to local restaurants and office workers.

Last year the project installed 10 containers in the parking lot of the old Pfizer factory in South Williamsburg, Brooklyn, each able to grow as much produce as two acres of dirt. In August, Square Roots secured $5.4 million in private seed funding, and has grants from the United States Department of Agriculture. Mr. Musk wants one in every major city.

Whether food actually needs soil is one of the flash points between organic traditionalists and people like Mr. Musk. “Ideologically, they prefer soil,” he said. “We don’t care. Let them fight their fight.”

Mr. Musk’s ascent has underscored a generational rift that pits old-liners who shun aspects of emerging food science against a new wave of food disrupters who haven’t embraced the roles that history, flavor and pleasure play, said Garrett Broad, an assistant professor at Fordham University who recently wrote about one aspect of the divide for the publication Civil Eats.

“Somebody like Kimbal Musk could be an important bridge to bring some of these ideas together,” Dr. Broad said.

Maybe, Mr. Musk says. He is as much a believer in the power of technology as anyone in Silicon Valley. But he is a cook at heart.

“Optimizing for efficiency over everything else sucks,” he said. “Have you ever eaten in Palo Alto?”

Mr. Cordero, who was a police officer in the Dominican Republic before immigrating to the United States, had no criminal record. A co-worker testified that he could not have been the drug dealer, as he was in the store during the period in question. No drugs were found on him during a strip search that Mr. Cordero said involved him taking off his underwear. Eventually the charges against him were dropped.

In his lawsuit against the police, Mr. Cordero accused the officers of arresting him because they wanted to make the overtime pay that ensued from an arrest near the end of their shift. In his decision, Judge Weinstein noted that one of the officers involved in arresting Mr. Cordero, Hugo Hugasian, had previously been suspended from the force for 60 days and required to pay $1,203.74 in restitution for claiming overtime pay for hours he did not work. And Judge Weinstein noted that officers were paid at least 22 hours of overtime for the arrests of Mr. Cordero and the other man outside the bodega.

In the ruling, Judge Weinstein said that after holding a trial on Mr. Cordero’s case early next year, he would, if Mr. Cordero proved his case, hold a second proceeding — to examine the prevalence of police lying and whether false arrests were being carried out to generate overtime. That second hearing, Judge Weinstein said, would focus on whether the Police Department has a policy of not taking “reasonable steps to control lying by police officers.”

In a statement, Nicholas Paolucci, a spokesman for the city’s Law Department, downplayed the significance of Judge Weinstein’s decision. Mr. Paolucci also said that the arrest of Mr. Cordero was “supported by probable cause and that there is no evidence to support any legal claim against the City of New York.”

Gabriel Harvis, a lawyer for Mr. Cordero, said that Judge Weinstein’s ruling set the stage for the biggest challenge to unconstitutional policing practices in New York City since a trial in 2013 over the department’s overreliance on stop-and-frisk tactics.

1A: When you hear the word “place,” you’re thinking of an external locale, aren’t you? So, “Place where analysis is done?” doesn’t lead you immediately to LEFT BRAIN. But it’s true. The right hemisphere of the brain is the more creative side.

Constructor Notes

While it may not necessarily be my magnum opus, this is my favorite puzzle I’ve ever created. That’s because the puzzle is me*. I’ll shamelessly admit that I’ve listened to “TRAP QUEEN” at least 1,738 times. I’m equally obsessed with Pink Floyd, and “US AND THEM” is a classic. I graduated from U.V.A.’s engineering school this past May, though I was an ECON MAJOR as well. CHOCO TACO as a crossword entry feels animated yet quirky, and that about sums me up. LEFT BRAIN? My right brain doesn’t exist. LOGARITHM? I’m a numbers guy. ATTIC DOOR? Eh, I’m weird and have my flaws, I suppose. I could go on and on about how much I enjoyed making this thing, but like talking about myself, it just feels awkward. I guess it’s worth noting that on top of everything else, this is my first true crossword publication since I became the Times’ new assistant puzzles editor!

(Mr. Schlesinger moved to New York City.)
As a centenarian raised in an opinionated family of four daughters and a son, Mrs. Schlesinger considered feminism nothing novel.","On a three-month grand tour of Europe by car when she was 17, she and family members, including her mother and three sisters, paid a visit in Paris to Alice B. Toklas, who had been a classmate of her mother’s at Radcliffe before becoming known as the American expatriate partner of Gertrude Stein.

Marian Cannon also went to Radcliffe, graduating in 1934, and as a graduation gift her parents sent her, alone, across the country and by ship to China — 10,000 miles altogether — when she was barely 22.

“Early on I decided being a painter was what I wanted to be, but I wanted to be a lot of other things too,” she told The Atlantic in 2013. “I wanted to write. I wanted to play tennis. I wanted to have a lot of friends. I wanted to have a lot of beaus.

“I think I’ve been very lucky. But I think that I’ve made some of it for myself. I never gave up. I wanted it all, in other words, and I think I really almost got it all too.”

She said she credited her independence in part to her mother, whose advice to her children was: “It doesn’t really matter if your house is that dirty. Go ahead and do your thing.” (“Of course,” Mrs. Schlesinger added, her mother “did have a nice maid who came in every day.”)

She met Arthur Schlesinger Jr. in her parents’ living room when he was a college junior. They married in 1940. The son of a Harvard professor, he became one, too, as well as a widely read historian.

It wasn’t long before she was also introduced to a young Massachusetts congressman, John F. Kennedy, who was contemplating a Senate race. He impressed her, despite an ethnic bias that she said she had inherited from her mother, who carped that “the Irish make the political villains too attractive for defeat.”

“I guess I partook of the atmosphere of the times,” Mrs. Schlesinger wrote in her memoir “I Remember: A Life of Politics, Painting and People” (2011), published when she was 99. “It was an unthinking and deplorable prejudice. So when this attractive, well-bred, sophisticated young man came in, I was completely unprepared. I think it was at that moment that whatever prejudice was left in me melted away.”

She wrote of Kennedy: “He had for me the somewhat dubious air of a young man who had wandered into a nest of pure-minded intellectuals, who, as far as he was concerned, spouted nonsense and foolish chitchat. The next time I met him the intellectuals were falling all over him.”

Her husband among them.

When Mr. Schlesinger endorsed Kennedy in 1960 for the Democratic presidential nomination, she not only stuck with her idol, Gov. Adlai E. Stevenson of Illinois, who was also running, but also said so publicly — prompting Kennedy’s brother Robert to complain to Mr. Schlesinger, “Can’t you control your own wife — or are you like me?”

In his 1965 book about the Kennedy administration, “A Thousand Days,” Mr. Schlesinger, who had been the president’s special assistant, “imparted to the now-emerging legend of Camelot a historian’s imprimatur,” Richard Aldous, a Bard College historian and Mr. Schlesinger’s biographer, wrote this month in Boston Review.

Mrs. Schlesinger was considerably more equivocal about the Kennedys. In a 1980 oral history for the Kennedy Library in Boston, she described them as a self-centered crew who treated people who worked for them as “courtiers” and whose legacy included “lives that were wrecked.”

“There was a roller-coaster atmosphere in those years,” she recalled in “I Remember.”

“One felt that the administration reveled in crisis, and there were plenty of crises, some genuine and some invented for their own sake,” she wrote. “I had a curious feeling that great decisions were made in an almost frivolous way, like the Bay of Pigs fiasco, which from my remote perch seemed to have been run by a bunch of hubris-mad teenagers, mostly Yale boys, who dominated the Central Intelligence Agency and who looked upon the Cuban enterprise and the catastrophe rather like a Harvard-Yale game they would win next time.”

Marian Cannon was born on Sept. 13, 1912, in Franklin, N.H., where her parents had a vacation home, and grew up in Cambridge. Her father, Walter Bradford Cannon, a prominent Harvard Medical School physiologist, coined the term “fight or flight” to describe the nervous system’s response to a threat. Her mother, Cornelia James Cannon, was a successful novelist and feminist who expressed concern that unrestricted immigration would dilute America’s old stock.

Before she married, in 1940, Marian spent a year in China living with her sister Wilma Cannon Fairbank and Wilma’s husband, John King Fairbank, who became an eminent historian of China at Harvard.

She and Mr. Schlesinger divorced in 1970; he remarried the next year and died in 2007. She did not remarry.

In addition to her son Stephen, also an author, Mrs. Schlesinger is survived by another son, Andrew, an author and documentarian; a daughter, Christina Schlesinger, an artist; three grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. Another daughter, Katherine Kinderman, a writer and producer, died in 2004.

After the divorce, Mrs. Schlesinger left Washington to return to Cambridge, where she painted, wrote and illustrated five children’s books and published another reminiscence, “Snatched From Oblivion: A Cambridge Memoir” (1979). (Mr. Schlesinger moved to New York City.)

In theory, each of these ideas would be best tested across more than just one building or street, and all of them would be more easily implemented together. Once you cover your traffic lights in sensors, it’s easier to turn them into air-quality monitors, too; as long as you’re redesigning streets around driverless cars, you can also think about what the delivery robots need.

The prospect of a city designed by technologists, at least as a thought experiment until now, has made some nervous, urbanists especially. The tech industry is better known in its own Silicon Valley back yard for contributing to rather than solving urban problems like unaffordable housing and traffic. And its corporate campuses are mostly models of how not to build cities, with mega office parks (and spaceships designs) dependent on cars and detached from their neighboring communities.

There’s no small contradiction in having tech founders muse about how to build better cities from places that bear little resemblance to lively cities at all.

The tech industry also thrives by working in ways that can be incompatible with public-sector city-building. It’s hard to “move fast and break things” in government, and public funds don’t allow for the failure rates that venture capital does. New tech products are often targeted to early adopters, and they spread to the rest of us later. But you can’t do that with innovations in public service; if the tech savvy get the nicer bus routes or the new Wi-Fi kiosks first, that raises equity issues for the rest of the city.

There’s also the hitch that cities are inherently organic and unpredictable. They resist omniscient engineering. And past efforts at doing that — whether through the urban renewal of individual neighborhoods or the wholesale development of utopias — have invariably failed for that reason.

Many intractable urban problems are in fact not engineering problems at all, including the ones that most look like it. Housing is very expensive in a place like San Francisco not because we haven’t developed the right engineering methods to build it more cheaply. Unaffordable housing is largely a political problem — we haven’t developed the societal consensus to build enough of it.

Sidewalk Labs, to its credit, has internalized many of these criticisms. The company, formed by Google two years ago, has pointedly been based in New York City and not Silicon Valley. It’s staffed by both technologists and government alums. Its leader, the former New York City deputy mayor Dan Doctoroff, openly acknowledges the gulf between technologists and city government types. And Sidewalk Labs says it wants to bridge the two.

“We all collectively see cities as about friction: good friction and bad friction,” Mr. Doctoroff told me not long after Sidewalk Labs started. “Good friction is serendipity, it’s opportunity, it’s diversity, it’s seeing 40 different nationalities on the subway as you commute in the morning. Bad friction is congestion, it’s pollution.”

The technologist’s temptation may be to try to build a city from scratch, with none of that friction. And especially without the greatest friction of all, politics. In Toronto, Sidewalk Labs is looking at something in between a blank slate and New York City: a sizable plot of land to develop that’s still part of a city large enough that any successful ideas could ultimately spread.

Because it’s looking at a neighborhood and not just a typical developer’s parcel, Sidewalk Labs can play with all the infrastructure that connects those parcels — the utility grid, the street network, the sidewalks. But there would be no point in doing all that if there weren’t thousands of people nearby ready to move in, as is the case in rapidly growing Toronto. (Google also announced Tuesday that it would move its Canadian headquarters, which are in Toronto, into the first pilot phase of the development.)

Gabriel Harvis, a lawyer for Mr. Cordero, said that Judge Weinstein’s ruling set the stage for the biggest challenge to unconstitutional policing practices in New York City since a trial in 2013 over the department’s overreliance on stop-and-frisk tactics.

Mr. Harvis said that he intended to call as witnesses high-ranking police officials, though he noted that he also remained open to settlement offers from the city before trial.",Brooklyn Judge Seeks to Examine Prevalence of Police Lying,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/nyregion/brooklyn-judge-police-perjury-nypd.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

Shannon Mulcahy’s job at an Indiana steel plant moved to Mexico. Donald Trump vowed to keep factory jobs inside the United States.

We discuss how the president’s promise of “America First” has met the realities of American manufacturing.

On today’s episode:

• Farah Stockman, a national correspondent with The New York Times, wrote about the closure of the Rexnord factory.

• Shannon Mulcahy worked at Rexnord for nearly 18 years.

Background reading:

• Workers like Ms. Mulcahy took pride in their jobs at the Rexnord factory in Indianapolis. The bearings they made were top-notch. In the end, it didn’t matter.

When the music ended, Mr. Bazan locked eyes with one of them, Sissy.
He reveled in family life and photographed his wife and sons incessantly.
He started teaching photo workshops, where his students became part of his extended family, too.
“This book has brought many tears in my eyes in the making,” Mr. Bazan, 58, said.","Ernesto Bazan was teaching a workshop in Brazil in 2013 when he received a call that his father, a surgeon and professor of medicine, had died in Sicily. He rushed home to Palermo, arriving just in time for the viewing, a powerful, if painful moment. Afterward, the body was cremated.

As dark smoke drifted from the funeral home’s chimney into the overcast sky, Mr. Bazan took what he called “the last portrait” of his father — making permanent a moment that underscored the fleeting nature of human existence.

That photograph became the cornerstone of his new book, “Before You Grow Up,” a family album he created for his twin 19-year-old sons, Stefano and Pietro, in which elegant photographs are mixed with drawings, letters, his mother’s journal entries, memorabilia and notebook pages.

Photo

“I made this book as a legacy for my sons, a visual testament that they can carry with them, and share with the people that they love,” he said, “and always love each other as my wife and I have been teaching them to do.”

The book echoes Mr. Bazan’s roles as a son; a husband to his wife, Sissy; and a father. Designed with Kevin Sweeney, it captures the joys and sorrows of 21st-century family life.

Mr. Bazan grew up in Palermo with the expectation that he would follow in his father’s footsteps and become a doctor. He started taking “average” pictures as a teenager, he recalled, and when he was 17 a voice came to him in a dream, whispering, “You’ve got to be a photographer.”

After two years arguing with his father over his career choice, he left for New York City to study photography and soon after began working internationally. He first traveled to Cuba in 1992 and was struck by the generosity of Cubans.

“I felt a very powerful connection with them,” he said. “Like I belonged to that place in another life.”

On a return trip three years later, Mr. Bazan and his friend and printer Mike Levin stumbled upon a scene that seemed out of a 1940s Italian movie, he recalled, as he watched “three beautiful young girls dancing in the streets of Havana.” Mr. Bazan started dancing with a 70-year-old woman while his friend chatted up other, younger, women. When the music ended, Mr. Bazan locked eyes with one of them, Sissy.

They married three years later. Shortly after, they had twins.

Mr. Bazan worked as an accredited photographer in Havana for an Italian sports newspaper and documented his new home in images infused with the rhythms of Cuba. He reveled in family life and photographed his wife and sons incessantly. He started teaching photo workshops, where his students became part of his extended family, too.

But nothing is ever straightforward in Cuba. When the authorities suspected that the workshops were really journalism classes in disguise, he was forced to stop. The decision was more than he could bear, so he relocated to Veracruz, Mexico, in 2006.

“I had to flee Cuba to continue teaching my workshop and to continue to be who I am,” he said.

But his sojourn was fruitful: He has published three books of his Cuban photographs — “Bazan: Cuba,” “Al Campo” and “Isla” — and moved to New Jersey in order to fulfill his sons’ desire to finish high school in the United States.

Photo

For seven years he struggled to make a book that would be his legacy to his sons, whom he had “photographed from the womb,” he said. It was, at times, a difficult and even painful process.

“This book has brought many tears in my eyes in the making,” Mr. Bazan, 58, said. “It’s a family album that also deals with sickness, sadness, mourning and death, but with an uplifting and positive look at the future, particularly the one of my children, who are beginning their new soulful journey into their adult part of life.”

Ultimately, “Before You Grow Up” is about the importance of family and the fragility of life — what a man leaves behind for his children, as well as grandchildren and great-grandchildren he might never meet.

“I hope my sons remember me as a decent father that was there for them at all times,” he said, “like my father and mother have been for me.”

“Research shows that when girls are empowered and have strong connections outside of the family, they have a better chance of protecting themselves and their future,” Ms. Sinclair said.
Looking at her own career, she felt that photography could be a vehicle to help these girls.
“A lot of the photographs they’ve taken speak to the different moments in their lives,” Ms. Sinclair said.
“They say that every girl who is empowered impacts at least 250 people in her community,” Ms. Sinclair said.","Having spent 15 years photographing child marriages around the world, Stephanie Sinclair is uniquely positioned to understand its lasting impact on communities and, especially, on the girls who were forced to wed against their will. “You can’t expect individuals who have been through significant abuse to just act normal as soon as they get out of that situation,” she said. “They need to be nurtured, to be given the time and the tools to heal.”

With this in mind, Ms. Sinclair last year started the Tehani Photo Workshop — named after an 8-year-old Yemeni bride — in partnership with the Samburu Girls Foundation. The Kenyan organization, led by Josephine Kulea, focuses on educating girls rescued from child marriage, female genital mutilation and beading, a tradition where girls adorned with red beads have to serve the needs of an older male relative.

“Research shows that when girls are empowered and have strong connections outside of the family, they have a better chance of protecting themselves and their future,” Ms. Sinclair said. Looking at her own career, she felt that photography could be a vehicle to help these girls. “The independence that comes with a such a career, the knowledge you acquire through meeting other people, and the freedom the camera gives you to express yourself can’t be underplayed,” she said. “Instinctively, I knew that a photo workshop could nurture the girls in a unique way.”

Twice now, a dozen or so 11- to 16-year-olds gathered at the Ngari Hill Eco-Lodge for five days to talk about images and the place of women in society. Ms. Sinclair shares her long-term project, which helps the participants understand that it’s a global issue affecting one girl every two seconds; that it’s the result of women not being valued as they should; and that what they’d been through is not their fault. She also introduces basic photographic concepts using examples of work done by or on strong African women. The goal is to inspire them while also teaching them photo skills before they pair off with another participant and are joined by a student-mentor from the previous workshop to make pictures in the surrounding hills.

“A lot of the photographs they’ve taken speak to the different moments in their lives,” Ms. Sinclair said. “Many, this year, even re-enacted what happened to them. We didn’t tell them to do this.” In one, Jackline holds out her beaded necklace while dressed in her school uniform, an effort to demonstrate how beading interrupts education. In another, Nachaki leans against a branch off the ground. “I was worried they’d fall when I first saw them climbing, but then they told me how, when they fled their marriage and hid in the forest, they’d sleep in trees to protect themselves from the animals in the wild,” Ms. Sinclair recalled.

Others hint at the bonds developing among the girls, like in the picture of Linnet and Eunice laughing in their room, or Susan and Silvana walking arm in arm, as well as in the portraits they’ve made of each other. Only when sitter and photographer are in sync do you get images that capture both vulnerability and strength.

Photo

The workshop culminates in a community exhibition and presentation where they speak about what matters most to them. Both times, Ms. Sinclair said, they felt compelled to share what they’d been through, how it affected them, why girls’ lives matter, and why they should have the same opportunities as boys. In short, how “girls can do anything,” a line they often repeated in their remarks. The message resonated powerfully with those in attendance. Not only did it come from those who lived through the ordeal, but also from community members, female relatives, and young women who speak the same language and share the same cultural background.

“They say that every girl who is empowered impacts at least 250 people in her community,” Ms. Sinclair said. “Though we’ve only had 22 students so far, slowly those number add up.”

She hopes to hold more workshops, in Kenya and elsewhere, as long as her not-for-profit “Too Young to Wed” continues receiving the financing and logistical support to do its work without taking any shortcuts.

“You want these workshops to be intimate, because therapy isn’t a mass process,” she said. “It’s not just the act of photography that helps; it’s bringing together girls who have all experienced a similar type of trauma for what really is a retreat, a time to be nurtured, to grow, and to build community.”

She will join “The Project,” Network Ten’s top news and current affairs program, starting next year, Ten said. The deal could make her the highest-paid female host on Australian television, local news reports said.

Her departure comes as other news outlets have been facing questions about gender pay disparities. In July, the BBC released pay data showing that women represented only one-third of the on-air talent who were paid at least 150,000 pounds, or about $200,000, by the broadcaster in the past year.

Ms. Wilkinson’s move drew praise from leading women across the media industry.

“What a woman. Lisa Wilkinson taking a stand for women everywhere by asking for equal pay with her co-host and walking when Channel Nine refused,” wrote Mia Freedman, co-founder of the women’s media company Mamamia. “Now she has a better deal at Channel 10.”

Her departure from Nine Network also drew the attention of prominent politicians.

“If the reason is about equal pay, I say good on her,” said Gladys Berejiklian, the premier of New South Wales. “I think she’s sending a very strong message to the community.”

Nine Network acknowledged Ms. Wilkinson’s contribution to “The Today Show,” saying that her partnership with Mr. Stefanovic had “taken the show to the success it is today.”

The pair embodied the easygoing Australian character with lighthearted banter and moments of mutual appreciation, with Ms. Wilkinson playing the calm, composed foil to Mr. Stefanovic’s regular tomfoolery.

Before hiring Ms. Wilkinson in 2007, Nine Network cycled through various co-hosts for Mr. Stefanovic to chip away at the popularity of “Sunrise,” the long-dominant breakfast show on Seven Network.

After Ms. Wilkinson joined “The Today Show,” its audience gradually increased, although not enough to overtake “Sunrise.”

“It was a stunning turnaround for a program many had written off a decade earlier,” wrote Michael Lallo, an entertainment reporter for Fairfax Media. “This should have been sufficient proof of Wilkinson’s value.”

Mr. Stefanovic opened the show Tuesday morning by acknowledging his shock at the departure of Ms. Wilkinson and thanking her for her support, citing “the laughs, sage advice, the calmness.”

“For 10 years Lisa has dragged herself out of bed at 3:30 in the morning, fed the dogs and cats, put a load of washing on, and come into work and sat on my left to inform you at home about what’s happening in the world,” Mr. Stefanovic said.

Nine Network said it would be “going in another direction” and considering its options over “the coming weeks and months.”

On Monday, Ms. Wilkinson was described by a fellow anchor, Leigh Sales of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, as a “steady, consistent, highly competent, warm and delightful presence” on “The Today Show.”",Australian TV Host’s Departure Raises Questions on Gender Pay Gap,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/world/australia/gender-pay-gap-lisa-wilkinson.html

In the past month, it has stopped trucks filled with North Korean seafood, ordered Chinese banks to drop North Korean clients and vowed to shut down North Korean companies.
Some North Korean workers in northeast China are already heading home.
“North Korea is exporting crimes against humanity,” says Remco Breuker, a Dutch historian who led an investigation of companies using North Korean workers in Europe.
When the disco lights at Pyongyang Okryu flashed on, our waitress appeared onstage in a lime green dress, crooning a North Korean melody.","Nor is North Korea as ossified as outsiders might imagine. Kim still wields the instruments of totalitarian power, but he has relaxed the state’s grip on the economy, allowing officials and ordinary citizens greater autonomy to make money and engage in trade, so long as a chunk of the profits flows to Kim’s inner circle. As a result, the North Korean economy grew 3.9 percent last year. Food prices have stabilized. Mobile phones have proliferated. And construction cranes now dot Pyongyang’s rising skyline. “North Korea is no longer a communist country,” says Justin Hastings, the author of the book “A Most Enterprising Country.” “Every state entity has been deputized to make money.”

The nebulous unit that supervises much of North Korea’s hard-currency trade is a Workers’ Party of Korea bureau with the Orwellian name Office 39. As sanctions become more onerous, North Korean companies, whether dealing with licit or illicit goods, have become adept at operating with multiple layers of disguise: false identities, fast-changing front companies, ships sailing under “flags of convenience” from places like Togo or Tuvalu. Office 39 doesn’t coordinate all this activity, recent defectors say; along with other departments, it acts more like a collection agency, setting dollar quotas that enterprises must meet by any means necessary.

Kim Kwang-jin, a defector who worked in Singapore for a bank affiliated with North Korea, says his firm met its quota by running reinsurance scams on factory fires, transportation accidents and other disasters. In 2003, Kim Kwang-jin told me, he arranged to send Kim Jong-un’s father and predecessor, Kim Jong-il, the annual quota as a birthday gift — $20 million in cash, stuffed into two heavy-duty bags. The Dear Leader was so pleased that he sent a thank-you note along with fruit, blankets and a DVD player. “North Korea has gotten more adept at hiding its tracks since then,” says Kim, who now works at a think tank run by South Korea’s intelligence service. “But it is also much more dependent on China.”

The countries have a love-hate relationship. In the Korean War, the two newly formed Communist states forged a bond that Chairman Mao Zedong claimed was “as close as lips and teeth.” But Kim Il-sung, who was nearly killed by Chinese allies in the 1930s, feared that China would take over his country at the end of the war. Decades later, when the Soviet Union, its main benefactor, collapsed North Korea had nowhere to turn but China and felt betrayed when Beijing established ties with South Korea in 1992. China now accounts for more than 80 percent of North Korean trade, yet Kim Jong-un — channeling his grandfather’s resentment — openly defies Beijing, accelerating his nuclear-weapons program and even timing missile tests to embarrass President Xi Jinping.

Until now, the calculus in Beijing has been guided by caution. Push North Korea too hard, the reasoning goes, and the resulting conflict or collapse could lead to millions of refugees pouring into China and a united, America-aligned Korea becoming entrenched on its doorstep. Now the balance may be shifting. Alarmed by Kim’s nuclear provocations — and perhaps pressured by the Trump administration — China is acting tougher on sanctions. In the past month, it has stopped trucks filled with North Korean seafood, ordered Chinese banks to drop North Korean clients and vowed to shut down North Korean companies. Some North Korean workers in northeast China are already heading home. As James Reilly, an associate professor at the University of Sydney, puts it, “China has really crossed the Rubicon.”

Yet there are serious doubts about how far China is willing to go. And because North Korean enterprises rarely leave their fingerprints on overseas bank accounts or companies, how tough can Beijing’s enforcement be? To skeptics, China’s late conversion signals not a commitment to sanctions but a desire not to be scapegoated by Washington, where the default position has long been that China is responsible for its wayward little brother. “China is not the only country that matters,” says Andrea Berger, a North Korea expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. “North Korea has a big footprint overseas, so we have to look at its networks around the world, too.”

North Korean trade outside China is deep and varied, its value often underestimated. Russia employs tens of thousands of North Korean workers in construction sites and Siberian logging camps even as it helps Pyongyang evade sanctions on oil imports. In Africa, where North Korea formed strong bonds during the independence struggles, the most visible signs are the massive statues built for leaders and dictators by North Korea’s state art studio, Mansudae. Behind these monuments is a bustling trade in arms, minerals and manpower, often aided by embassy staff. Only rarely are shipments stopped. Last year, though, Egyptian customs agents found 30,000 North Korean rocket-propelled grenades hidden under a mound of iron ore on a ship bound for their country, a United States ally. Since then, the Trump administration has withheld almost $300 million in aid and military funding from Egypt.

United Nations’ sanctions are now targeting one of the most lucrative enterprises: the export of quasi slave labor. An estimated 100,000 North Koreans are toiling around the world in abysmal conditions: 12-to-16-hour days under constant surveillance, their wages and freedom confiscated by the state. “North Korea is exporting crimes against humanity,” says Remco Breuker, a Dutch historian who led an investigation of companies using North Korean workers in Europe. These laborers can be found in roughly 40 countries, from shipyards in Poland to building sites in Qatar — to the little restaurant in my neighborhood.

When the disco lights at Pyongyang Okryu flashed on, our waitress appeared onstage in a lime green dress, crooning a North Korean melody. Two others danced beside her with little sense of rhythm or joy. Last year, 12 waitresses and a manager working in a restaurant in Ningbo, China, defected en masse, so the control over workers’ lives is reportedly even tighter now. Unlike my last visit to a North Korean restaurant, there were no homages to the leader, no conga lines to “Country Roads.” But near the end of the show, our waitress donned a traditional gown and played the 21-string gayageum, a kind of zither dating back to medieval times, when her Korean ancestors reigned over part of what is now China. After paying the bill — a hefty sum for Bangkok — I carried my sleeping son out and the waitress patted his head. I may be wrong, but I think I even detected a genuine smile.",North Korea Is No Longer the Hermit Kingdom — but How Long Will China Be Its Lifeline?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/magazine/north-korea-is-no-longer-the-hermit-kingdom-but-how-long-will-china-be-its-lifeline.html

The hashtag #BrooklynCow began trending on Twitter, where users debated the fate of the bull, pleaded for gentle treatment from the authorities and corrected gender pronouns.

When the Parks Department tweeted, “Hey, has anyone seen a cow?” a user pointed out that the correct term for male cattle is “bull.”

“Excuse our calf … er, gaffe,” the department replied.

But it wasn’t all utter nonsense.

On his freedom run, the bull knocked over a stroller with a child, who was taken to an area hospital, according to the police.

As unusual as the incident seemed, renegade cows and bulls have happened before in the city.

Their fates have been mixed. Sometimes they are returned to the butchers they have fled from, and other times they’re more fortunate. A bull who cantered around Queens for a day in 2016 was adopted by Jon Stewart, and taken to his private rescue.

The Brooklyn bull was eventually brought down by tranquilizer, administered at about 1 p.m., and led into a trailer about 30 minutes later, according to the police.

As of Tuesday night, it was unclear where the bull escaped from. He was turned over to Animal Care Centers of New York City, who named him Jimmy K., after the late night host Jimmy Kimmel, and was later transferred to the Skylands Animal Sanctuary.

The Dow Jones industrial average briefly climbed over 23,000 points yesterday for the first time.

Thirty years ago this week, the stock market plummeted 508 points, or nearly 23 percent, in a single day. It was the largest one-day drop in history.

On Oct. 19, 1987, people stopped each other in the streets to ask about the market, or stood transfixed in front of ticker tapes and televisions to see how low it would go. The day came to be known as Black Monday.

Regular folks at the time wondered: Was there anything they could do to save themselves?

“For some, the answer to that question was a dismal and heartbreaking no,” wrote The Times, “It was too late.”

While panic swept the trading floors, Wall Street traders, who “are usually quick with the wisecracks following everyone else’s disasters,” were left “with an unprecedented loss for words,” according to The Times.

For others, The Times noted that after the crash, “the joy of investing is gone,”

It would take two years for the market to return to the same level.

The cause of the crash is still being debated — some think it was an inflated market correcting itself, and others blame it on “dumb computers,” or computer programs that sold stocks that fell to a certain price. WNYC is doing a series of stories on the crash this week.

Mr. Dilling is mostly tranquil about these changes.","Mr. Dilling believes that even a few years ago, a design like “Rexy” would have been unthinkable for a legacy brand like Coach. But recently Tiffany & Company, Bergdorf Goodman and Fendi, among others, have hired Lite Brite to help them liven up their images.

“If you’re Coach, how do you remarket yourself?” Mr. Dilling said. (Besides picking a strangely hippie-sounding name, Tapestry, for your parent company.) “I mean, you make leather handbags. That’s tough. You have to think of something that cuts through the visual clutter, and neon definitely cuts through.”

But even as fashion brands are using neon to showcase their modernity, they’re also hoping to invoke our nostalgia. While installing a cascading neon rainbow in Stella McCartney’s store in the meatpacking district, Mr. Dilling overheard multiple shoppers mention its “retro” quality. (Never mind that they each thought it evoked a different decade.)

Tiffany, too, has taken up neon to try and reclaim some of its midcentury irreverence. In the 1970s, for instance, the company’s celebrated window designer Gene Moore created a neon-lit Chinese food container spilling diamond-encrusted pendants instead of noodles.

Richard Moore, the vice president of creative visual merchandising at Tiffany (no relation to Gene Moore), said that type of creativity “has not necessarily translated to consumer perception of the brand, and that’s why neon feels particularly relevant right now.” This fall, Tiffany’s Fifth Avenue windows display a neon orange “Don’t Walk” hand wearing an engagement ring. The (perhaps obvious) symbolism: A Tiffany ring will stop traffic. Like the Chinese-takeout container, said Mr. Moore, “it’s very urban, very New York, very iconic.”

He said that today’s young people are especially attracted to things that are handcrafted, as most neon is. Signs are created by artisan “tube benders” who heat the glass in 2,000-degree flames, shape it and then fill it with gas.

Argon with a dash of mercury naturally shines blue, while neon is naturally “motel sign” red. These are the classic colors that first arrived in the United States from Paris in the early 1920s and replaced the pointillist incandescent “spectaculars” that dominated city center marquees.

“Whatever you could do with light bulbs, you could do in bigger, better, clearer ways with neon tubes,” said Eric Lynxwiler, 44, a preservationist and historian at the Museum of Neon Art in Glendale, Calif. “Every business in the nation that wanted to be perceived as modern in that Art Deco era had to have neon.”

Neon dimmed briefly during World War II, as chemicals and glass grew scarce, and then proliferated across the American highway afterward, as businesses competed for a car-bound public. But by the late 1960s, spurred in part by Lady Bird Johnson’s national “beautification” campaign, townships began passing anti-neon laws. That, along with the introduction of cheap, backlit plastic signs, ended the medium’s glorious run.

Neon returned briefly in the 1980s, its comeback linked to 1950s nostalgia. Today’s resurgence, though, which Mr. Lynxwiler says we’re riding “in a big, big way,” seems more about hope for the future. “We want the promise that everything is going to be O.K.,” Mr. Lynxwiler said. “We want the joy back. We’ve moved away from the dark Edison bulb toward something bright.”

At DeKalb Market Hall, a new food hall in Downtown Brooklyn, all vendors were instructed to hang a neon sign. “We’re bringing the city back pre-hipster,” said Anna Castellani, 46, DeKalb’s managing partner. “I’m definitely not complaining about missing the ’70s or ’80s in New York. But I love the chaotic nature of a street full of different lights. You feel like you’re in the city.”

Neon has also become central to a handful of urban renewal projects in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, San Francisco and Oklahoma City, whose downtown, from the 1920s to the 1950s, was home to 52 car dealerships, many of them neon lit. After decades of urban decline and the devastation of the 1995 bombing, civic and business leaders sought to develop that old stretch of “Automobile Alley.” This included grants for new businesses to hang neon.

“We felt like it could be a very important movement to help us regenerate the neighborhood,” said Rand Elliott, president of Elliott & Associates Architects and chairman of the Automobile Alley Association’s design committee.

To date, 29 businesses have hung neon on the six-block stretch of Broadway, including a massive 24-by-23-foot reproduction of the original Buick sign, which was installed in 2014. “Each sign is very distinctive,” Mr. Elliott said. “It’s like art hanging on these buildings.”

And yet even as these new signs go up and restoration efforts increase, many of the historic signs have shut off. In New York City, the red, green and yellow P & G Café facade at 73rd and Amsterdam has vanished; so too the luminous purple sign with an excitedly leaping girl in Times Square and the multistory signs for Eagle Clothes and Kentile Floors in Brooklyn.

“There were so many signs here, that nobody thought we should preserve them,” said Mr. Dilling, who works just a few blocks from where Eagle Clothes once towered above the Gowanus Canal. “And now with the development, they’re gone.”

The same developers who are taking over these spaces sometimes hire Mr. Dilling. He is currently making a five-foot-tall record for Henry Hall, an upscale residential complex on the West Side of Manhattan, where Legacy Recording Studios once stood. There will be a trendy restaurant named after the studios, once the East Coast center of film and Broadway recording, and a “Jam” room with Fender Stratocaster guitars and the neon record.

Mr. Dilling is mostly tranquil about these changes. “For years reporters would call and be like, ‘Neon’s a dying industry. How does it feel to be one of the last guys?’” he said. “But it just dies to be reborn.”",Tired of Twee Edison Bulbs?

With the fall of Raqqa, the Islamic State has lost the two most important cities of its self-declared caliphate in three months.
Hundreds of Islamic State fighters had decamped from Raqqa to Mayadeen in recent months, taking heavy equipment with them.
It is unclear what happened to the last several hundred Islamic State fighters holed up in Raqqa.
Witnesses in Raqqa said that several busloads of Islamic State fighters, both Syrians and foreigners, had been allowed to board buses to Deir al-Zour.","Whether final or not, the seemingly inevitable defeat in Raqqa of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, carries heavy symbolic weight. At its height in 2014, the group controlled Iraq’s second-largest city, Mosul, as well as Raqqa and large stretches of land on both sides of the border. And it had grand aspirations to increase its territory and cement its rule.

The Islamic State leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who once spent time in a prison run by occupying American troops in Iraq, claimed to be the successor to the caliphs, the Islamic emperors who shaped the region in past centuries. He persuaded tens of thousands of Muslims from around the world, some new to the faith or poorly versed in it, to travel to the region to fight. The group seized the ancient ruins of Palmyra in Syria and those of Hatra in Iraq, destroying important historical monuments in the name of its interpretation of Islam.

With the fall of Raqqa, the Islamic State has lost the two most important cities of its self-declared caliphate in three months. It was pushed out of Mosul in July, and now holds only a fraction of the territory it once controlled.

Analysts say the group is already preparing for a new phase, morphing back into the kind of underground insurgency it started as, when it took root among disaffected Sunni populations that were willing to tolerate, if not wholeheartedly embrace, its ultraconservative brand of Islam. And while many Arabs quickly soured on the group because of its brutal crackdowns and unfulfilled promises, their underlying political disaffection has not been addressed.

Another major concern, now that Islamic State-held territory is reduced, is how countries in Europe, in the Middle East and around the world will handle the foreigners who joined the group in places like Syria and might return home and plan attacks there.

A victory in Raqqa has come at a heavy cost. Much of the city has been devastated by American-led airstrikes that killed more than 1,000 civilians, according to tallies by local activists and international monitors. In earlier years, many were killed by Russian and Syrian government strikes. About 270,000 residents have been displaced by the fighting, and thousands of homes have been destroyed.

Hassan Mohammad Ali, a member of a civilian council backed by the United States and the Syrian Democratic Forces that is supposed to be responsible for rebuilding the city, said last week that reconstruction would be a challenge.

“The city is in ruins; it needs time,” he said. “And it needs prospects that are beyond ours, our energy.” Just providing bread to areas retaken from the Islamic State was stretching the council’s capacity, he said.

Dr. Mohammad Ahmed Saleh, a resident of the city who now works in a hospital in Tal al-Abyad, said he was eager to return home but was bracing for the worst.

“I’m expecting to see a new Hiroshima,” he said by telephone, taking a break from treating a newly arrived contingent of 19 wounded people from Raqqa, a mix of civilians and fighters for the Islamic State. “I’m trying to be mentally prepared when I go. I’ll be lucky if I see one of my house’s walls still standing.”

Many former residents said they had no plans to go back.

“Today, I decided to start a new life,” said Wadha Huwaidi, who fled Raqqa a few months ago. “I’m sad, of course, but I had nothing left there. My house was destroyed, my children, my husband all collapsed. There’s nothing left that makes me feel I want to go back.”

For months, Islamic State commanders and fighters have been withdrawing from Raqqa and moving southeast into the neighboring province of Deir al-Zour. They have clustered in neighborhoods in the provincial capital, which is also called Deir al-Zour, as well as in the town of Mayadeen and in a town on the border with Iraq called al-Bukamal. Hundreds of Islamic State fighters had decamped from Raqqa to Mayadeen in recent months, taking heavy equipment with them.

But over the weekend, Syrian government forces, backed by their Russian and Iranian allies, took Mayadeen and continued their advance into the provincial capital, leaving the Islamic State with the border town as the only urban area entirely under its control in Syria. Beyond that, Islamic State fighters are scattered in a large area of the Syrian desert, outside population centers.

It is unclear what happened to the last several hundred Islamic State fighters holed up in Raqqa. There were conflicting reports about whether foreign fighters among them would be allowed to evacuate on buses in a surrender deal.

Last week, the United States-led coalition said there would be no negotiated withdrawal of Islamic State fighters, just the evacuation of civilians, if necessary, to keep them out of the crossfire. But in previous battles, in Hawija and Tal Afar, surrendering fighters were allowed to board buses to Islamic State-held territory. Witnesses in Raqqa said that several busloads of Islamic State fighters, both Syrians and foreigners, had been allowed to board buses to Deir al-Zour.

The fall of Raqqa threatens to inflame relations between Kurds and Arabs, who have been fighting the Islamic State in an uneasy alliance with the United States-led coalition — but against an enemy that is rapidly melting away. Most immediately, they may be at odds over the future governing of Raqqa.

Similar tensions were on display in Kirkuk, Iraq, on Monday after Iraqi government forces drove out Kurdish forces to the cheers of Turkmens and Arabs in the ethnically mixed city.

The battle against the Islamic State has also led to touchy de facto partnerships internationally, with the United States, Russia and Iran all fighting the group in sometimes competing efforts, vying for influence.

Deir al-Zour, home to most of Syria’s modest oil reserves, continues to be a flash point for possible tensions between the two rival coalitions fighting the Islamic State: Russia, Iran and the Syrian government on one side, and the United States and the Syrian Democratic Forces on the other.

Both sides want to increase their influence over the region as their proxies race one another to take Islamic State areas straddling Syria and Iraq. The Syrian government and its allies, Iran and Russia, are steadily driving the Islamic State from Deir al-Zour, and a crucial question is whether the government will ultimately seek to retake full control of Raqqa as well.","Raqqa, ISIS ‘Capital,’ Is Captured, U.S.-Backed Forces Say",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/world/middleeast/isis-syria-raqqa.html

Unlike some of his colleagues in the tech world, Mr. Musk is driven more by cooking than by the love of a good algorithm. Growing up in Pretoria, South Africa, he started in the kitchen at age 12, making meals as a way to bring his family together. His mother, the model Maye Musk, worked as a dietitian to support the family after she divorced his father, Errol Musk, an engineer and pilot.

At her house, Mr. Musk said, “it was all brown bread and plain yogurt.” At his dad’s, he and his brother and sister, Tosca (now a film producer and director), ate whatever the maid cooked, usually in front of the TV. “It wasn’t very good,” he recalled.

“I noticed that when I cooked, my dad especially would make us all sit down and eat together,” he said. “I loved it.”

He graduated from college in Canada and made his first fortune in 1999, when he and his brother sold Zip2 — a digital mapping service that helped newspapers including The New York Times produce online city guides — to Compaq Computer for $307 million. He became an investor in his brother’s other ventures, including PayPal and Tesla. (He is on the board of both Elon Musk’s electric car company and his rocket company, SpaceX, as well as Chipotle Mexican Grill.)

Set financially, Mr. Musk moved from Silicon Valley to New York and enrolled in the French Culinary Institute (now the International Culinary Center). He lived near the World Trade Center, and after the 9/11 attacks, spent six weeks volunteering as a cook for firefighters and other people working the pile. He finally understood, he said, the link between food and community.

Soon after, he and Jen Lewin, his first wife, left for Colorado, where he met Mr. Matheson and opened The Kitchen in 2004. With its deep farm-to-table ethos and casually elegant style, the restaurant was an immediate hit.

Both projects were running just fine without him, so Mr. Musk became chief executive of another tech company. Then, on a 2010 trip with his family in Jackson Hole, Wyo., he was sliding down a snowy hill on an inner tube when it flipped. He broke his neck and was temporarily paralyzed.

During the two months he had to lie flat on his back, it became clear that he wanted to devote himself to food. He and his wife divorced; he quit the tech company and dedicated himself to changing the way Americans eat.

Mr. Musk became interested in school gardens. He remains friendly with his ex-wife (the couple have two boys, and he has a daughter with another woman), and Ms. Lewin designed modular curved plastic planters that could be arranged in any schoolyard.

All the food is cooked from scratch. Menus feature wild salmon, burgers of local pasture-raised beef and big Greek salads with vegetables from nearby farms. Entree prices average $14, and the restaurants are designed so customers sit down together to eat and get their meals almost as soon as they order.

The first opened six years ago next to The Kitchen in Boulder. In September, another opened in a huge urban renewal project in Memphis called Crosstown Concourse, an abandoned Sears distribution center that has been turned into apartments and shops, with a school, a health clinic and an arts center. The partners plan to add 50 more Next Door restaurants by the end of 2020.

Mr. Musk also opened an outpost of his more upscale Kitchen restaurant inside a 4,500-acre urban park called Shelby Farms in the center of Memphis. But he insisted that he be allowed to buy 300 acres nearby that for decades had been used to grow cotton, so he could turn it into an organic farm, a project now in the works.

He is also testing the Kitchenette, a little takeout spot in Shelby Farms that sells locally grown, well-prepared meals for about $5 — his answer to a fast-food restaurant.

Mr. Musk’s nonprofit arm, The Kitchen Community, has put learning gardens into 100 Memphis schools, providing both staff and materials. Each one costs about $40,000, money that comes from the Musk Foundation and local donors. He has placed his gardens in schools in Los Angeles, Pittsburgh and 150 in Chicago, where Mayor Rahm Emanuel gave the project $2 million in city funds. By 2020, Mr. Musk hopes to have them in more than 1,000 schools.

He is not a fan of traditional school garden programs. “They don’t scale at all,” he said.

There are other ways to ruffle the feathers of Alice Waters, the Bay Area chef who helped pioneer the American slow-food movement and the concept of the edible schoolyard, but criticizing her approach to local food and school gardens is near the top of the list.

“I don’t want to hear another word about scaling,” Ms. Waters said. “He doesn’t know what he doesn’t know. He’s very earnest about what he’s doing, but he doesn’t know enough about farming and about the soil. He wants to do the right thing, but he just hasn’t done his homework. Not everything has to be scalable.”

Mr. Musk says he is “absolutely in conflict” with Ms. Waters. “I love her, but I don’t agree with her views.”

Critics have taken on his Square Roots project, too. The idea is to train young farmers by teaching them to grow greens with nothing but enhanced water and LEDs in shipping containers, and then sell the lettuce and kale to local restaurants and office workers.

Last year the project installed 10 containers in the parking lot of the old Pfizer factory in South Williamsburg, Brooklyn, each able to grow as much produce as two acres of dirt. In August, Square Roots secured $5.4 million in private seed funding, and has grants from the United States Department of Agriculture. Mr. Musk wants one in every major city.

Whether food actually needs soil is one of the flash points between organic traditionalists and people like Mr. Musk. “Ideologically, they prefer soil,” he said. “We don’t care. Let them fight their fight.”

Mr. Musk’s ascent has underscored a generational rift that pits old-liners who shun aspects of emerging food science against a new wave of food disrupters who haven’t embraced the roles that history, flavor and pleasure play, said Garrett Broad, an assistant professor at Fordham University who recently wrote about one aspect of the divide for the publication Civil Eats.

“Somebody like Kimbal Musk could be an important bridge to bring some of these ideas together,” Dr. Broad said.

Maybe, Mr. Musk says. He is as much a believer in the power of technology as anyone in Silicon Valley. But he is a cook at heart.

“Optimizing for efficiency over everything else sucks,” he said. “Have you ever eaten in Palo Alto?”

“Research shows that when girls are empowered and have strong connections outside of the family, they have a better chance of protecting themselves and their future,” Ms. Sinclair said.
Looking at her own career, she felt that photography could be a vehicle to help these girls.
“A lot of the photographs they’ve taken speak to the different moments in their lives,” Ms. Sinclair said.
“They say that every girl who is empowered impacts at least 250 people in her community,” Ms. Sinclair said.","Having spent 15 years photographing child marriages around the world, Stephanie Sinclair is uniquely positioned to understand its lasting impact on communities and, especially, on the girls who were forced to wed against their will. “You can’t expect individuals who have been through significant abuse to just act normal as soon as they get out of that situation,” she said. “They need to be nurtured, to be given the time and the tools to heal.”

With this in mind, Ms. Sinclair last year started the Tehani Photo Workshop — named after an 8-year-old Yemeni bride — in partnership with the Samburu Girls Foundation. The Kenyan organization, led by Josephine Kulea, focuses on educating girls rescued from child marriage, female genital mutilation and beading, a tradition where girls adorned with red beads have to serve the needs of an older male relative.

“Research shows that when girls are empowered and have strong connections outside of the family, they have a better chance of protecting themselves and their future,” Ms. Sinclair said. Looking at her own career, she felt that photography could be a vehicle to help these girls. “The independence that comes with a such a career, the knowledge you acquire through meeting other people, and the freedom the camera gives you to express yourself can’t be underplayed,” she said. “Instinctively, I knew that a photo workshop could nurture the girls in a unique way.”

Twice now, a dozen or so 11- to 16-year-olds gathered at the Ngari Hill Eco-Lodge for five days to talk about images and the place of women in society. Ms. Sinclair shares her long-term project, which helps the participants understand that it’s a global issue affecting one girl every two seconds; that it’s the result of women not being valued as they should; and that what they’d been through is not their fault. She also introduces basic photographic concepts using examples of work done by or on strong African women. The goal is to inspire them while also teaching them photo skills before they pair off with another participant and are joined by a student-mentor from the previous workshop to make pictures in the surrounding hills.

“A lot of the photographs they’ve taken speak to the different moments in their lives,” Ms. Sinclair said. “Many, this year, even re-enacted what happened to them. We didn’t tell them to do this.” In one, Jackline holds out her beaded necklace while dressed in her school uniform, an effort to demonstrate how beading interrupts education. In another, Nachaki leans against a branch off the ground. “I was worried they’d fall when I first saw them climbing, but then they told me how, when they fled their marriage and hid in the forest, they’d sleep in trees to protect themselves from the animals in the wild,” Ms. Sinclair recalled.

Others hint at the bonds developing among the girls, like in the picture of Linnet and Eunice laughing in their room, or Susan and Silvana walking arm in arm, as well as in the portraits they’ve made of each other. Only when sitter and photographer are in sync do you get images that capture both vulnerability and strength.

The workshop culminates in a community exhibition and presentation where they speak about what matters most to them. Both times, Ms. Sinclair said, they felt compelled to share what they’d been through, how it affected them, why girls’ lives matter, and why they should have the same opportunities as boys. In short, how “girls can do anything,” a line they often repeated in their remarks. The message resonated powerfully with those in attendance. Not only did it come from those who lived through the ordeal, but also from community members, female relatives, and young women who speak the same language and share the same cultural background.

“They say that every girl who is empowered impacts at least 250 people in her community,” Ms. Sinclair said. “Though we’ve only had 22 students so far, slowly those number add up.”

She hopes to hold more workshops, in Kenya and elsewhere, as long as her not-for-profit “Too Young to Wed” continues receiving the financing and logistical support to do its work without taking any shortcuts.

“You want these workshops to be intimate, because therapy isn’t a mass process,” she said. “It’s not just the act of photography that helps; it’s bringing together girls who have all experienced a similar type of trauma for what really is a retreat, a time to be nurtured, to grow, and to build community.”

These giant shrooms typically pop up in acidic soils near spruce, oak or birch trees and when they get enough rain. While Mr. Reisz admires them, he probably won’t be feeding these magical-looking mushrooms to his children. They contain two mind-altering neurotoxins called ibotenic acid and muscimol which are known to affect humans and other animals.

Strange things can happen when mammals ingest them, too. In January, news reports suggested that eating fly agaric fungi made fearless coyotes terrorize motorists in the moonlight in California. Reindeer historically have tripped on them too, and in some places fly agaric has even been associated with Christmas. Some historians even chalk the victories of Viking “Beserker Warriors” to the fearlessness induced after ingesting Amanita muscaria.

In studies using rats, muscimol was infused into parts of the amygdala, a brain region that is known to process emotional fear memories in humans. The drug shut down the rats’ ability to learn about and respond to threats.

But in humans, it can also do the opposite. Its effects range from dry mouth and rapid heartbeat to euphoria, hallucinations, feeling closer to God and fear.

Incorrect doses or preparations are poisonous. In at least one case, doctors found the fly agari in the stomach contents of a person found in a coma. Additionally, Amanita muscaria are often confused with relatives: deadly impostors known as the death cap and the destroying angel.

Mr. Reisz thinks that maybe the mushrooms he found were able to get so big and numerous because of recent weather, and that other locals, seeking them for their psychoactive properties, had not yet picked them.

The citation for a Bronze Star that Mr. Rodriguez received for valor says he killed 10 enemy fighters that day.","Both Mr. Rodriguez and Mr. Sahib are trying to move on from lives upended by war, and both want justice. But they have different ideas of what that means.

Mr. Rodriguez, who is white, was raised by a Nigerian stepfather, married a Guatemalan woman, and for years relied on an Iraqi next-door neighbor to help his family when he was fighting overseas. He does not consider himself prejudiced.

“How can they say I hate Iraqis? I gave my soul for Iraq,” he said.

But friends and family say four deployments to war zones left him changed, especially the first one. In 2004 he went to Ramadi, Iraq, as a 27-year-old platoonsergeant. The tour with the Second Battalion, Fourth Marine Regiment is widely thought to be one of the deadliest six months of any American unit in either Iraq or Afghanistan. Thirty-four Marines were killed and more than 255 were wounded.

Several moments from those months still commandeer Mr. Rodriguez’s thoughts, but none more so than the morning of April 6, 2004, when he was leading a dozen Marines down an urban boulevard and rooftops erupted with the flash of gunfire. Hundreds of enemy fighters had launched a coordinated ambush all over the city. By sundown, 12 Marines in the battalion were dead.

In an interview, Mr. Rodriguez tried to describe the fight, but stammered and fell silent several times before beginning to cry.

According to other Marines from the squad, the ambush split their group in two, and Mr. Rodriguez ordered his half into a house to assess a grim situation. A pair of Marines lay dead in the street. Two more a block away had been hit by a grenade. Reinforcements were bogged down. Enemy fighters were trying to scale the walls into the courtyard of the house. Ammunition was running low.

Pieces of the battle are clear to him more than a decade later: the frantic crackle of the platoon radio, the feeble thumbs-up from a 21-year-old private who had been shot in the neck. The anger he felt after recovering the fly-covered body of a 19-year-old Marine after the battle — a kid who had written a letter to his church saying faith in God would keep him safe.

Other parts are a blur. The citation for a Bronze Star that Mr. Rodriguez received for valor says he killed 10 enemy fighters that day. He doesn’t remember clearly.

“I went to zone black. No conscience, no fear, no nothing,” he said in a phone interview late one night. “I didn’t care if I was going to die. I just did my job as an infantry man.”

“You come home, you have to live with yourself,” he added. “I’m a bad person now, I went against all I had ever been taught.”

When he returned home, friends said, Mr. Rodriguez seemed drained. He spoke little about what had happened, but couldn’t sleep and drank heavily. He began having visions at night of dead Marines. On anniversaries he visited their graves and weathered the blame from their families. He put in paperwork to award the men Bronze Stars, and hung the citations on his wall.

Many in the battalion were also haunted by the experience, but it was early in the war, and formal PTSD diagnoses were rare, said Winston Jaugan, who was Mr. Rodriguez’s friend and, as a gunnery sergeant, his boss. “No one had a diagnosis. They would just give us pills for everything — Valium, Ambien. And we would drink,” he said.

As a leader, other Marines said, Mr. Rodriguez carried a particularly heavy burden.

“He was like the father of the squad,” said Joe Hays, who was hit by a grenade during the battle. “And he saw everything that went wrong as his fault.”

Then she stamped the backs of the canvases with a Louvre seal, added her own signature and escorted them from the museum.
“The Metro is like the subway in New York,” Mr. Guilbert said.","Andre Martin and Renaud Wald made off with the paintings from the Louvre without triggering the dreaded “red procedure.” That’s the high-tech system that automatically seals exits and locks doors throughout the vast museum within two minutes of a security breach. The duo then carried the artworks to a nearby Metro station and casually boarded a train.

Just two cool customers who just pulled off the most brazen daylight art heist ever captured on film?

Non. The two are Louvre copyists, upholders of what Ivan Guilbert, a Parisian photojournalist, calls “a beautiful tradition” that dates to the French Revolution. In November 1793, one month after Marie Antoinette was beheaded, the revolutionary national assembly declared the Louvre Palace, Louis XIV’s former residence on the Right Bank of the Seine, open to the public. All citizens were welcomed to enjoy the national art treasures stored there, previously for the pleasure of the golden carriage set only.

Called the Central Museum of the Arts of the Republic, the people’s musée took the democratic ideal a step further. Any professional, amateur or aspiring painter was invited to enter the museum, set up an easel — provided free of charge to this day — and have a go at copying a masterpiece.

Thousands have since followed suit. Among them are such art history boldfaced names as Paul Cézanne, Edgar Degas, Marc Chagall, Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dalí. The goal for them, and the present-day copyists whom Mr. Guilbert photographed for Le Parisien Magazine, is to learn the secrets of color, technique and composition by copying the works of some of the greatest artists of all time. “It’s like a free school,” says Mr. Guilbert.

Photo

“You have to copy and recopy the masters,” Degas once said, “and it’s only after having proved oneself as a good copyist that you can reasonably try to do a still life of a radish.”

The ambitions of the copyists Mr. Guilbert photographed went well beyond fruits and vegetables. Marius Allier, a 26-year-old graduate of the School of Fine Arts in Paris, drew crowds as he tackled Eugène Delacroix’s “Women of Algiers (in their Apartment).” The 1834 painting presents challenges that have made it long popular among copyists, including Picasso, who later painted his own variations in the 1950s.

Catherine Balpe, an amateur painter, copied Theodore Chasseriau’s 1843 portrait, “The Two Sisters,” as a gift for her husband. Sam Rachamin journeyed from his home in Israel to render his copy of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres’s 1808 painting, “The Bather.”

Mr. Martin, 58, is a professional painter — but of houses, not canvases. A self-taught artist who paints using an easel and much smaller brushes when he’s not climbing ladders, copied “View of Pirna from the Sonnenstein Castle” by the Italian artist Bernardo Bellotto.

Though the Louvre, unlike other leading museums, does not charge copyists for the privilege, applicants can wait up to two years for one of the 250 permits the museum issues annually. Valid for three months, it allows them to work in the museum’s galleries from 9:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. most days, except Sundays and holidays, from September through June.

Photo

Tourists and other museum visitors can bring cameras into the Louvre and take pictures. But because Mr. Guilbert planned to shoot for publication, he applied for, and received permission to spend three days in the galleries with the copyists. “For me, the assignment was like a romantic experience,” he says.

With the Louvre’s magnificent interior architecture enhancing the composition of his shots, Mr. Guilbert chose to use the same light that illuminates the masterworks, to strong effect. “I never used a flash,” he says. “It’s most interesting to work with what you’re given.”

Finished with their copies, Mssrs. Martin and Wald, a photographer who copied Agnolo Bronzino’s “Portrait of a Man Holding a Statuette,” met with Isabelle Vieilleville, director of the Louvre’s copy office. To guard against forgeries, she checked that the two copyists had used canvases that were one-fifth smaller or larger than the original, and that the original artists’ signatures were not reproduced on the copies. Then she stamped the backs of the canvases with a Louvre seal, added her own signature and escorted them from the museum.

On the train, masterworks in hand, they drew little more than a double take or two. “The Metro is like the subway in New York,” Mr. Guilbert said. “There was not really much reaction from the other passengers. They have seen it all.”

He said the Assembly had created a committee in August to establish new rules aimed at cracking down on sexual harassment or intimidation.
“The letter shows that sexual harassment is as prevalent in the Capitol as it is anywhere else in society,” Mr. Rendon said.
She said until now women had routinely engaged on quiet rescue missions to help women caught what she described as predatory situations while working in lawmakers’ offices.
“The kind of sexism and misogynism that is pervasive in our culture is definitely prevalent in Sacramento,” Mr. Wiener said.","“Men have groped and touched us without our consent, made inappropriate comments about our bodies and our abilities,” the letter said, adding: “Why didn’t we speak out? Sometimes out of fear. Sometimes out of shame. Often these men hold our professional fates in their hands.”

The California legislature has set the national agenda on a variety of issues, including the environment, immigration and taxes. Although the state has produced a number of powerful female politicians, about 80 percent of the legislature is male.

Cristina Garcia, a Democratic member of the state Assembly who signed the letter, said Tuesday she has been routinely accosted by men who harassed her and made comments about her appearance while she was trying to discuss legislation.

“Multiple people have grabbed my butt and grabbed my breasts,” she said. “We’re talking about senior lobbyists and lawmakers.”

Ms. Garcia, and the other women who came forward, did not name the lobbyists or lawmakers involved in the encounters. The letter was first published in The Los Angeles Times on Tuesday morning.

Pamela Lopez, a partner at a Sacramento lobbying firm, said that for years she has dealt with inappropriate suggestions from male officials, but the most disturbing episode came early last year, at a social gathering of lawmakers and lobbyists in a Sacramento bar.

As Ms. Lopez walked into the restroom, she said, she felt a large body pressing behind her. When she turned around, she saw that a lawmaker had locked the door behind him, had undone his pants and asked her to touch his genitals.

“He had exposed himself and begun masturbating,” she said. “All I was thinking was what do I do, what do I do. And of course, I didn’t want to cause a scene.”

“I said, ‘No, I am not going to touch you,’ ” she said. “I was firm and clear but I did not want to make a scene and he continued to masturbate and he kind of moved toward me and said, ‘Just put your hand on me.’ I said no.”

Karen Skelton, a political strategist and lawyer in Sacramento who signed the letter, said she experienced harassment firsthand when she was hired by a Fortune 500 company six years ago to run a campaign on behalf of a major legislative initiative. Her job included dealing with an elected California official involved with the issue.

“This guy did things to me like touch my leg under the table at lunch and brush back my hair over my shoulder and sending me texts at 1 in the morning asking where I was,” she said, declining to name him. “I felt creeped out. I’m a big girl. I can deal with it. What if I had been 22, someone new to this, who needed to support their family?”

There has been a long and notorious history of sexual misconduct in state houses and Congress going back over at least the past 50 years. Many state Capitols are famous for being old boys’ clubs. Many, including the one in Sacramento, are in relatively isolated parts of the state, away from family, friends and onlookers, in a culture marked by late-night dinners and drinking.

Albany, the New York capital, has had an outsize reputation for sexual misbehavior, exemplified by an episode in 2012 in which Assemblyman Vito J. Lopez, a powerful Brooklyn Democrat, was found to have sexually harassed female staff members. The leader of the State Assembly at the time, Sheldon Silver, was harshly criticized for keeping Mr. Lopez’s behavior, and financial settlements to victims, secret, perhaps allowing additional women to be abused. Mr. Lopez resigned in 2013, and the Assembly enacted a series of reforms, including mandatory reporting of any complaint of sexual harassment, an independent investigator and a ban on confidential settlements.

Christine Pelosi, a signer of the letter who is the leader of the California Democratic Women’s Caucus, said that legislators “act differently in Sacramento — which is almost fantasy camp — as opposed to how they act as home.”.

Anthony Rendon, the speaker of the California State Assembly, said he did not think the Assembly ethics committee, which handles charges of sexual misconduct, could launch an investigation based on the letter, because it did not mention any names of offenders. He said the Assembly had created a committee in August to establish new rules aimed at cracking down on sexual harassment or intimidation.

“The letter shows that sexual harassment is as prevalent in the Capitol as it is anywhere else in society,” Mr. Rendon said.

Samantha Corbin, a lobbyist and former legislative aide who helped organize the drive, said many of the California women who signed the letter had overcome fears of retaliation, emboldened by the women who related their stories about Mr. Weinstein in stories published by The New York Times and The New Yorker.

She said until now women had routinely engaged on quiet rescue missions to help women caught what she described as predatory situations while working in lawmakers’ offices.

“We give each other tips on how to avoid certain situation – who might exercise predatory behavior,” she said.

“You are talking about power brokers in the largest state in the country,” she said.

Ms. Pelosi, who is the daughter of Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader of the House of Representatives, said it was difficult for many of the women to sign the letter. “I understand the courage of these women – Republicans and Democrats – coming forward. It is very, very, very hard.”

Kevin de Leon, the president of the state Senate, issued a statement saying he applauded “the courage of women working in and around the Capitol who are coming forward and making their voices known.”

Mr. de Leon, who announced this week he was running for the Senate, did not say whether he was aware of these kinds of episodes and did not return a request for comment.

Scott Wiener, a newly elected member of the state Senate, said he had been struck by the culture he had found since coming to Sacramento. “The kind of sexism and misogynism that is pervasive in our culture is definitely prevalent in Sacramento,” Mr. Wiener said.

New allegations of harassment have emerged in other states in recent days, too. Teresa Tanzi, a Democratic state representative in Rhode Island, said on Tuesday that a male lawmaker who outranked her once told her “that if I want to see my bills advance, there was one thing I could do to make that happen.”

“It was stated very matter of factly that if I would have sex with this person, it would increase the likelihood of my bills passing,” Ms. Tanzi said in an interview, although she declined to name the lawmaker or specify when the comment was made.

At this point in her career, Minaj is able to reconcile, somewhat, her struggles.","THROUGHOUT HER CAREER, Minaj has demonstrated a discipline and intelligence that is rare among other pop stars of her generation. She has what she describes to me as “the X-factor, which is just the thing you can’t put into words.” Onika Tanya Maraj was born in Saint James, Trinidad and Tobago, in 1982, and immigrated to Queens, N.Y., with her family at the age of 5. She began her music career singing with various rappers and working odd jobs. When she waitressed, she wrote lyrics constantly on the notepad she used to take orders. There is genuine pleasure in her voice as she reminisces about this. “I would take people’s order and then a rap might come to me just by what they’re wearing or what they said or did, and I would go in the kitchen and write it down, put it in the back of my little thing or my apron, and by the time I was done I would have all of these sheets of paper thrown around everywhere with raps.”

Since then, her career has been a checklist of milestones. In 2009, she was the first woman artist signed to Young Money, the label founded by Lil Wayne. Three mixtapes and three studio albums — “Pink Friday” in 2010, “Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded” in 2012 and “The Pink Print” in 2014 — followed, and in March 2017, Minaj surpassed Aretha Franklin for the most appearances (76) by a woman on the Billboard Hot 100, a record Franklin had held for almost 40 years. She is the rare hip-hop artist who has successfully and sustainably crossed over into pop music. Minaj, M.I.A. and Madonna performed their single, “Give Me All Your Luvin,” at the 2012 Super Bowl. Days later she performed solo at the Grammy Awards. Her dance song “Starships” went platinum six times over. She even collaborated with Ariana Grande on 2016’s song “Side to Side,” and while the pairing was unexpected given Grande’s previously wholesome image, the song went triple platinum. Minaj does not temper her swagger or sexuality. Sometimes, when I am daydreaming, I marvel at the phrases “dick bicycle” and “If you wanna ménage I got a tricycle” from “Side to Side,” which are so damn clever and funny and vulgar but also accurate as hell for a song Grande once described as being “about riding leading to soreness.”

Minaj’s music is characterized by urgent lyrics, spitting in a range of voices and accents. Her rhymes range from bold and aggressive, to coquettish, to wanton and sultry, with a soupçon of women’s empowerment. The pace of her rapping is often breathless but her diction is impeccable. There is wit and sly humor in her work. Take the 2014 single “Only” where Minaj raps, “My man full, he just ate, I don’t duck nobody but tape/ Yeah, that was a setup for a punch line on duct tape.” She quite simply broadened the definition of hip-hop, making it more joyful, energetic and robust.

Nicki Minaj is also coming down with a cold. Yes, I know what I did there, but it also happens to be true. When we meet, she has just missed a rehearsal for an upcoming performance at Philipp Plein’s runway show because of the encroaching sickness, and is medicating herself with Theraflu, NyQuil and rest. Having to fly to New York did not help. Minaj was in Miami (where she now spends most of her time) working on her fourth studio album, the title of which is, for now, a well-kept secret but is “super, super iconic.”

That studio time begot the beginnings of her cold — the air-conditioning always blasting, shutting off, blasting again — a vicious cycle of climate control. Minaj ended up spending two nights in the studio because it was one of those sessions where she was able to “write and record and listen back and have excitement in all three of those stages.”

It took a long time to get to that place, Minaj tells me, and now, “sonically, I know what the album’s about to sound like. I know what this album is gonna mean to my fans. This album is everything in my life coming full circle and me being truly, genuinely happy. It feels almost like a celebration. The last album, ‘The Pink Print,’ was almost like my diary, closing the chapter on certain things and not knowing if I was happy or sad about beginning new chapters. I was really writing about feeling unsure. Now, I can tell you guys what happened for the last two years of my life. I know who I am. I am getting Nicki Minaj figured out with this album and I’m loving her.”

MINAJ’S PUBLIC IMAGE and personas are carefully curated. The tabloids have assiduously tracked her professional and personal lives and I restrain myself from asking about her ex Safaree Samuels, who appears on “Love & Hip Hop,” a reality television series about the music industry, and if she would ever give Drake a shot. (I restrain myself greatly.) I don’t know that anyone but her inner circle knows who Nicki Minaj really is.

This elusiveness is compounded by her fascinating catalog of performative alter egos, including Harajuku Barbie (a fashionista obsessed with pink and Minaj’s longest-running persona), Nicki Teresa (known as “The Healer”) and the sexually explicit Nicki Lewinsky — there is even a male persona, Roman Zolanski, a slightly exaggerated version of Minaj herself. She has a vocal range that can go from a high-pitched twittering to a growl in a few bars. In both music and regular conversation, she enjoys playing with accents, offering up valley girl-speak or island patois. During our time together, she switched to a British accent a couple of times and then effortlessly returned to her normal voice, a slightly affectless cadence that recalls her Queens upbringing. In public, she often wears dramatic makeup, dramatic outfits and a rainbow of dramatic wigs, which is to say she performs both on- and offstage. There is no point during our conversation where Minaj demonstrates anything but absolute self-awareness. She pauses briefly before she answers my questions, as if calculating every possible outcome to everything she says. By the end of the interview, I am impressed by her fierce intelligence.

But she’s at her most animated and unguarded when she’s talking about music, and she thinks about music in deep and complex ways. She has strong opinions on what’s necessary to make a great rapper: “Do you sound intelligent? Does your flow switch up? Are you in command of the beat? I listen for things like that.” Jay-Z, Lil Wayne, Foxy Brown — “Those are the three I keep in my head when I’m writing because they’ve influenced me so much,” she says. “I feel like I’m a part of all of them.”

I’m curious about whom Minaj thinks she’s influenced herself. She tells me that around two years ago, Kanye West said to her, “ ‘Every girl I hear rap, I can hear Nicki in her rap.’ I didn’t ask him who, but that was such a great compliment. Because sometimes you think you’re the only one that can hear those types of things.”

It feels like Minaj is on the verge of another big moment in her career, and she knows it. “This is definitely the most inspired and free and excited I’ve been since I started releasing albums through a label,” she says. She is also deeply reflective about her evolution as an artist. I ask if the transition from making mixtapes to studio albums compromises the joy of creation and she answers, “Yeah, because ... artists do it to themselves. I’m not going to blame a label. You just overthink. When you’re doing your own little thing, you feel like, I can be myself, I can be crazy. When you start working with a record company, you start thinking you need a bigger sound. I wanted to get back to the place where I wasn’t second-guessing things so much. Sometimes simple is O.K.”

I ask her what it has taken to get to this place of newfound confidence and trusting her instincts. “I believe in my gift wholeheartedly,” she says. But this self-assurance was not easy to come by. “Sometimes I wake up and say, ‘I don’t know if I can do this anymore,’ you know? I’ve had those times. I’ve had those years where I’m just like, ‘Am I good enough?’ ” But she believes in her “ability to withstand what would break the normal girl,” she says.

At this point in her career, Minaj is able to reconcile, somewhat, her struggles. “I kind of love that I’ve had to go through so many hurdles to get where I am because I feel like I deserve it.” She is frank about what she has been up against. “I had so much going against me in the beginning: being black, being a woman, being a female rapper. No matter how many times I get on a track with everyone’s favorite M.C. and hold my own, the culture never seems to want to give me my props as an M.C., as a lyricist, as a writer. I got to prove myself a hundred times, whereas the guys that came in around the same time as I did, they were given the titles so much quicker without anybody second-guessing.”

I am struck by these words because I’ve heard similar sentiments from other successful women in male-dominated industries — this sense that their endurance and perseverance contribute to their greatness. But, above all, Minaj has persevered because she is always in control of her craft. Neither her work nor her success are accidental. When we finish talking and I make my exit, there are more people in the hallway, waiting for their time with her. She remains in command of the beat.","Nicki Minaj, Always in Control",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/t-magazine/nicki-minaj.html

Here’s how that neutron star formed:

For most of their existence, stars emit light through fusion — the merging of hydrogen atoms into helium, which releases gargantuan amounts of energy. When a large star — probably at least six times the mass of the sun — exhausts its hydrogen, it begins to collapse. The collapse accelerates so quickly that it sets off cataclysmic explosion known as a supernova. What’s left over is an extremely dense cinder that is only about six miles wide, but packs in more mass than the sun. The pressure is so great that electrons and protons are squeezed together into neutrons.

A single thimbleful of a neutron star weighs as much as several million elephants.

How does a neutron star differ from a black hole?

A neutron star is a stellar cinder that stopped collapsing. But when even larger stars explode, the remaining core is so dense that the core continues collapsing until it turns into a black hole. Here’s our guide to black holes.

What happens when two neutron stars collide?

In the case of the discovery that was detailed on Monday, the merging objects were probably survivors of massive stars that had been orbiting each other and had each puffed up and then died in spectacular supernova explosions. Making reasonable assumptions about their spins, the astronomers calculated that these neutron stars were about 1.1 and 1.6 times as massive as the sun, smack in the known range of neutron stars.

As they approached each other, swirling a thousand times a second, tidal forces bulged their surfaces outward. Quite a bit of the material was ejected and formed a fat doughnut around the merging stars.

At the moment they touched each other, a shock wave squeezed more material out of their polar regions, but the doughnut and extreme magnetic fields confined the material into an ultra-high-speed jet emitting a blitzkrieg of radiation. That blast set off the gravitational waves detected by LIGO, as well as the light show spotted by a variety of telescopes.

What are gravitational waves?

Watch this video we made in 2016 when LIGO first detected them to learn more about these ripples in space-time that confirmed key aspects of Albert Einstein’s theories.

How do neutron star collisions create gold and platinum?

It is not easy to explain how the universe made heavy elements like uranium. The Big Bang that started the universe created only the lightest elements — hydrogen, helium and a little bit of lithium. Just floating around in space, these light elements do not combine into heavier elements.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The insides of stars can fuse these lighter elements into heavier ones like carbon and oxygen, all the way to iron. That still left the mystery of the origins of elements heavier than iron like gold and platinum.

When two neutron stars collide, they expel neutrons into surrounding space, which slam into free-floating heavy nuclei in their stellar neighborhood. When enough of these collisions occurred, neutrons piled on top of more neutrons and created these heavier elements, notably gold.

These heavier elements drifted around, some accumulating in the gas and dust clouds that formed into new stars and planets including our solar system. The gold in a wedding ring is likely made of the leftovers from a long-ago neutron star collision somewhere in our galaxy.

What are gamma rays and what do they have to do with colliding neutron stars?

A gamma ray is a particle of light, a photon, but it’s a very high energy form of light. It’s more energetic than an X-ray, which in turn is more energetic than ultraviolet light, which is more energetic than the visible light we see.

For years, astronomers have been fascinated and perplexed by bursts of gamma rays that they were spotting in the skies. These ultra-high-energy particles told of some distant, cataclysmic, unimaginably powerful events.

The detection of this particular gamma-ray burst led astronomers to point a multitude of other telescopes at the same spot, including the LIGO observatory that detects the vibrations in space-time known as gravitational waves. That is what scientists reported on Monday.

LIGO’s gravitational wave measurements helped astronomers pin down what they thought caused at least some of these outbursts: the merger of neutron stars.

What will scientists do with what they’ve just learned?

Collisions of neutron stars are still something novel for scientists. The plethora of data will allow them to test and refine their theories and computer models of what happens. This is another a piece of the puzzle for trying to figure out how the galaxy came to be filled with the elements that became planets, people, plants and everything else.",It Was a Universe-Shaking Announcement.

The sweetness of chilled spot prawns under a few drops of olive oil made me shiver with pleasure. A trio of flash-seared Hokkaido sea scallop, Pacific mackerel whose skin had been peppered and griddled, and raw amberjack under tiny cells of finger lime suggested that Mr. Torrisi could run a stunning sushi restaurant.

My eyes rolled back in my head whenever I ate sea urchin. In one appetizer, it is arranged on griddled pretzel bread with mustard oil and tiny cubes of green apple. In another, lobes of it are layered into an iced bowl to be eaten, with crème fraîche and chives if you like, over blini, hard-cooked eggs, toast or, my favorites, creamy potato halves roasted in duck fat. (Caviar and trout roe are served the same way.)

Mr. Torrisi’s approach is to be lavish with punctiliously cared-for seafood and to outfit it sparingly. A beautiful illustration is the cured king salmon, two long, intensely flavorful strips served with a single potato dressed with mustard, shallots and dill. Another is any of the whole fish. The skin on turbot caught in Portugal is seared to a satisfying crackle on a plancha and served with a simple lemon vinaigrette. Like the Dover sole, it is lifted from its skeleton by a slim captain (they’re all slim) who performs the surgery wearing a Tom Ford suit.

One night five captains in five suits filleted five sole for five diners at a table next to mine. It looked like a scene from “Ocean’s Eleven” that didn’t make the final cut.

But some of the more elaborate dishes are underwhelming. I don’t know how striped bass with banana peppers and “mole spices” can be dull, but it is. Coconut-orange vinaigrette sounds like a terrific sauce for lobster, but it added very little except sweetness, which the lobster didn’t need. Chopped gazpacho ingredients over a puddle of actual gazpacho was both too complicated (why not just serve gazpacho?) and too plain (the cucumbers and tomatoes didn’t shine with flavor).

This is all a huge improvement on what prevailed in the last years of the Four Seasons. But it doesn’t make you feel as if you are in the hands of one of the city’s best chefs, which Mr. Torrisi is, I think. Even at its best, the food rarely rises to the technical brilliance or boldness of, say, the green curry mushroom mille-feuille or the Vietnamese-flavored chicken legs he put on the menu at Dirty French. If his cooking at the Pool had some of that swagger, what’s on the plates could live up to the best parts of the original architecture and help make up for the renovation’s mistakes.

This is exactly what happens when Stephanie Prida’s desserts arrive. Ms. Prida, who until a few months ago was the pastry chef at Manresa in Los Gatos, Calif., has a knack for combining flavors that seem to get more interesting as you go along, like a crème brûlée with shaved plums and bitter almond ice cream under a squiggle of reduced sherry vinegar, or coconut parfait and fluffy pink-grapefruit mousse sandwiched between the thinnest possible layers of matcha sablé.

Bottles of Chateau d’Yquem going back to 1811 are kept in a glass wine room just off the entrance to the Pool, where they cast a beautiful amber glow that the servers are fond of pointing out. Enjoy it as you walk in, because this is as close as you will get to a dessert wine of any kind unless you are ready to spend at least $95, the price of the least expensive glass.

The wine list is full of wonderful bottles, but its most noteworthy feature is its breezy lack of concern for normal budgets. Out of dozens of sparkling wines, more than 30 are priced above $1,000. Just one is under $90. This is quite a pinch to put on customers who are already paying between $39 and $74 for main courses.

The Grill/Pool bifurcation extends to the dining room staff. In the Pool they are reserved, poised, deferential and seem to have been directed not to show any warmth or wit. Compared with the talkative, jokey characters in the Grill, who are ready to flambé something at the drop of a hat, the servers in the Pool are cardboard figures in tailored suits.

Major Food Group has no fear of going over the top. So I’m reluctant to suggest that the Pool needs more personality and drama — these guys are capable of stocking the pool with live sharks if they thought it would help. But the restaurant needs something, because at these prices, what might pass for restraint and simplicity can start to seem like a sophisticated heist.

Since 2005, he has done so for 19 writing systems (and he’s currently working to add another eight). With Noor’s help, and some financial support from a research center at the University of California, Berkeley, he drew up the basic set of letters and defined how they combine, what rules govern punctuation and whether spaces exist between words, then submitted a proposal to the Unicode Consortium, the organization that maintains the standards for digital scripts. In 2018, seven years after Pandey’s discovery, what came to be called Hanifi Rohingya will be rolled out in Unicode’s 11th version. The Rohingya will be able to communicate online with one another, using their own alphabet.

As a practical matter, this will not have much impact for the Rohingya who are suffering in Myanmar, many of whom are illiterate and shut off from educational and technological opportunity. “The spread of this new digital system is unlikely to go to scale,” Maung Zarni, a human rights activist who works on Rohingya issues, and Natalie Brinham, a Ph.D. fellow at Queen Mary University of London, told me in an email. They emphasized that the Rohingya do not have the autonomy to organize their own schools. But given the group’s history of oppression, the encoding of their language carries considerable symbolic weight because it legitimizes an oppressed minority and their language. “It becomes a tool of unity to help people come together,” Noor says.

Creating such interconnectedness and expanding the linguistic powers of technology users around the world is the whole point of Unicode. If the work is slow, that’s because standardizing a writing system for computers is a delicate art that relies on both engineering and diplomacy. And the time and attention of the volunteers who maintain the standard are finite. So what happens when a new system of visual communication like emoji emerges and comes under their purview? Things get even slower and the mission more complicated.

Shortly after finishing a linguistics Ph.D. at Berkeley in 1980, Ken Whistler was frustrated by the inability of mainframe computers to print the specialized phonetic symbols that linguists use. I can fix that, he thought, and he then hacked an early personal computer to do so. In 1989, on one of his first days on the job at a software start-up, his boss told him to meet with a Xerox computer scientist, Joe Becker, who had just published a manifesto on multilingual computing. “The people of the world need to be able to communicate and compute in their own native languages,” Becker wrote, “not just in English.”

At the time, computing in the United States relied on encodings like those from the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (usually known as ASCII), which assigned numerical identifiers to letters, numbers, punctuation and behaviors (like “indent”). The capital letter “A,” for instance, had an ASCII code of 065, or 01000001 in the 0s and 1s in the binary code of computers. Each textual character used by a computer needs its own unique sequence, a numerical identifier or “character encoding.” The problem with ASCII was that it had only 256 codes to distribute and far more than 256 characters in the world needing identifiers.

In order to work with more writing systems than ASCII was able to handle, technology companies like Apple, Xerox, IBM, DEC, Hewlett-Packard and even Kodak created their proprietary encodings. None of them worked with the others. To complicate things further, some nations insisted as a matter of national pride on their own standards for text data. “The proliferation of character encodings was chaos,” Whistler says.

Joe Becker gathered like-minded computer scientists to bring order to the chaos, arguing that cooperation was needed among companies. The result was the Unicode Consortium, which was incorporated in 1991. He also maintained that the solution had to be international and helped broker an alliance with the International Organization for Standardization, which maintains more than 20,000 standards related to products and services, from the tensile strength of yarn to the chemical composition of toys. Such standards are meant to ensure, among other things, that things from one country can be used in the industrial processes of another. Standardized shipping containers, for instance, have made international commerce far more efficient. Standards don’t become regulations; they’re conventions, “recipes for reality” in the words of Lawrence Busch, a sociologist emeritus at Michigan State University who studies how standards arise. Unicode unified all the numerical identifiers and made sure they were reliable and up-to-date.

As is the case in other standards organizations, full membership in the nonprofit Unicode Consortium comes with the right to vote on changes to the standard. Membership dues are $18,000 annually; current full members include global tech giants (like Apple, Facebook and Google) and the Sultanate of Oman (which wants to see digital Arabic improved). A second membership tier includes a university, government bodies in Bangladesh and India, a typeface company and an emoji search engine. Over the years, members came and went, depending on their immediate interest in issues of standardization.

Unicode’s idealistic founders intended to bring the personal-computing revolution to everyone on the planet, regardless of language. “The people who really got the bug,” Whistler says, “saw themselves at an inflection point in history and their chance to make a difference.” No fortunes have been made through Unicode, unless you count the platforms (like Twitter) and products (like the iPhone) that adopted the standard.

Unicode’s history is full of attacks by governments, activists and eccentrics. In the early 1990s, the Chinese government objected to the encoding of Tibetan. About five years ago, Hungarian nationalists tried to sabotage the encoding for Old Hungarian because they wanted it to be called “Szekley-Hungarian Rovas” instead. An encoding for an alphabet used to write Nepal Bhasa and Sanskrit was delayed a few years ago by ethnonationalists who mistrusted the proposal because they objected to the author’s surname. Over and over, the Unicode Consortium has protected its standard from such political attacks.

The standard’s effectiveness helped. “If standards work, they’re invisible and can be ignored by the public,” Busch says. Twenty years after its first version, Unicode had become the default text-data standard, adopted by device manufacturers and software companies all over the world. Each version of the standard ushered more users into a seamless digital world of text. “We used to ask ourselves, ‘How many years do you think the consortium will need to be in place before we can publish the last version?’ ” Whistler recalls. The end was finally in sight — at one point the consortium had barely more than 50 writing systems to add.

On a downtown San Francisco street last November, partygoers were lined up at a Taco Bell truck to get tacos. Inside the nearby co-working space, Covo, was the opening night party of Emojicon, a weekend-long celebration of all things emoji, held just days before the presidential election. Only foods that could be depicted with emojis were being served, while a balloon artist twisted approximations of various emojis.

In the late 1990s, when Japanese phone manufacturers first put emojis on their devices as marketing gimmicks, messaging standards required that emojis be sent as text data — as characters matched to strings of numbers, not as images. But emojis were unreadable on devices that couldn’t translate their numerical identifiers.

When a software engineer named Graham Asher suggested in 2000 that Unicode take responsibility for emojis, the consortium demurred on the grounds that pictures were subjectively interpreted. A few years later, companies like Apple and Microsoft realized that the increasingly popular Japanese emojis would appear as gibberish on their products and pushed the consortium to encode them. By 2009, 974 emojis had been assigned numerical identifiers, which were released the following year.

As the demand for new emojis surged, so, too, did the criticisms. White human figures didn’t reflect the diversity of real skin colors. Many emojis for specific professions (like police officer and construction worker) had only male figures, while icons for foods didn’t represent what people around the world actually ate. Millions of users wanted to communicate using the language of emoji, and as consumers, they expected change to be swift. One thing appeared to be slowing things down: the Unicode Consortium.

At Emojicon, resentment toward Unicode was simmering amid the emoji karaoke, emoji improv and talks on emoji linguistics. “Such a 1980s sci-fi villain name,” one participant grumbled. “Who put them in charge?” A student from Rice University, Mark Bramhill, complained that the requirements for the yoga-pose emoji he had proposed were off-puttingly specific, almost as if they were meant to deter him. A general antiestablishment frustration seemed to be directed at the ruling organization. One speaker, Latoya Peterson, the deputy editor of digital innovation for ESPN’s “The Undefeated,” urged people to submit proposals to Unicode for more diverse emojis. “We are the internet!” she said. “It is us!”

On the first morning of Emojicon, Mark Davis, president of Unicode, explained in a talk that the consortium also maintains the repository for time and date formats, currency and language names and other information that adapts computer functions to where a user is. Even more demanding technically is making sure that characters behave as users want them to. One major achievement has been ironing out how right-to-left alphabets like Arabic are used in the same line of text as left-to-right ones like Latin, which affects billions of users and can take years to adjust. Dealing with emojis, in short, is a small, though increasing, part of the consortium’s responsibilities.

Davis mentioned that once characters become part of the Unicode standard, they’re never removed. This inspired one young designer in the audience to announce that he’d ensure his legacy by proposing emojis until one was accepted. The crowd laughed; Davis smiled coolly, perhaps because Unicode committees have been overwhelmed with some 500 submissions in the last three years.

Not everyone thinks that Unicode should be in the emoji business at all. I met several people at Emojicon promoting apps that treat emojis like pictures, not text, and I heard an idea floated for a separate standards body for emojis run by people with nontechnical backgrounds. “Normal people can have an opinion about why there isn’t a cupcake emoji,” said Jennifer 8. Lee, an entrepreneur and a film producer whose advocacy on behalf of a dumpling emoji inspired her to organize Emojicon. The issue isn’t space — Unicode has about 800,000 unused numerical identifiers — but about whose expertise and worldview shapes the standard and prioritizes its projects.

“Emoji has had a tendency to subtract attention from the other important things the consortium needs to be working on,” Ken Whistler says. He believes that Unicode was right to take responsibility for emoji, because it has the technical expertise to deal with character chaos (and has dealt with it before). But emoji is an unwanted distraction. “We can spend hours arguing for an emoji for chopsticks, and then have nobody in the room pay any attention to details for what’s required for Nepal, which the people in Nepal use to write their language. That’s my main concern: emoji eats the attention span both in the committee and for key people with other responsibilities.”

Emoji has nonetheless provided a boost to Unicode. Companies frequently used to implement partial versions of the standard, but the spread of emoji now forces them to adopt more complete versions of it. As a result, smartphones that can manage emoji will be more likely to have Hanifi Rohingya on them too. The stream of proposals also makes the standard seem alive, attracting new volunteers to Unicode’s mission. It’s not unusual for people who come to the organization through an interest in emoji to end up embracing its priorities. “Working on characters used in a small province of China, even if it’s 20,000 people who are going to use it, that’s a more important use of their time than deliberating over whether the hand of my yoga emoji is in the right position,” Mark Bramhill told me.

Since its creation was announced in 2015, the “Adopt a Character” program, through which individuals and organizations can sponsor any characters, including emojis, has raised more than $200,000. A percentage of the proceeds goes to support the Script Encoding Initiative, a research project based at Berkeley, which is headed by the linguistics researcher Deborah Anderson, who is devoted to making Unicode truly universal. One the consortium recently accepted is called Nyiakeng Puachue Hmong, devised for the Hmong language by a minister in California whose parishioners have been using it for more than 25 years. Still in the proposal stage is Tigalari, once used to write Sanskrit and other Indian languages.

One way to read the story of Unicode in the time of emoji is to see a privileged generation of tech consumers confronting the fact that they can’t communicate in ways they want to on their devices: through emoji. They get involved in standards-making, which yields them some satisfaction but slows down the speed with which millions of others around the world get access to the most basic of online linguistic powers. “There are always winners and losers in standards,” Lawrence Busch says. “You might want to say, ultimately we’d like everyone to win and nobody to lose too much, but we’re stuck with the fact that we have to make decisions, and when we make them, those decisions are going to be less acceptable to some than to others.”",How the Appetite for Emojis Complicates the Effort to Standardize the World’s Alphabets,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/magazine/how-the-appetite-for-emojis-complicates-the-effort-to-standardize-the-worlds-alphabets.html

President Trump has made a habit of filling important jobs with people dedicated to undermining the laws they’re supposed to administer while pampering the industries they’re supposed to regulate. His nominee for the Environmental Protection Agency’s top clean air post, William Wehrum, is a retread from the George W. Bush administration with a deep doctrinal dislike of clean air regulations. His choice to run the White House Council on Environmental Quality is borderline comical: Kathleen Hartnett White, a former Texas official who believes that the main greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, is harmless. Yet no nomination has been as brazen, as dangerous to public health and as deserving of Senate rejection as that of Michael Dourson to run the E.P.A. office in charge of reviewing chemicals used in agriculture, industry and household products.

Mr. Dourson is a scientist for hire. A toxicologist and a professor at the University of Cincinnati, he has a long history of consulting for chemical companies and conducting studies paid for with industry money. He frequently decided that the compounds he was evaluating were safe at exposure levels that are far more dangerous to public health than levels recommended by the E.P.A., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other agencies. His nomination is enthusiastically endorsed by the chemical industry. It horrifies environmental groups, public health advocates, firefighters and scientists and has inspired many letters in opposition to the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which may vote as early as Wednesday.

Among the chemicals that received a favorable nod from Mr. Dourson is 1,4-dioxane, which is used by paint and coating manufacturers and is also found in shampoos and other personal care products. His analysis recommended a safe level that was 1,000 times higher than the E.P.A.’s recommended level; the agency considers the chemical “a likely carcinogen.”

Another is PFOA, a chemical used by DuPont to make nonstick surfaces. The compound has been linked to cancers, thyroid diseases and other health problems. Working for West Virginia on the recommendation of DuPont, Mr. Dourson in 2002 helped establish a safety threshold of 150 parts per billion for PFOA in drinking water. That is substantially higher than the standard of 1 part per billion that DuPont’s own scientists had recommended more than a decade earlier, and higher still than the health advisory level of 0.07 parts per billion set by the E.P.A. last year.

More broadly troubling is that Mr. Dourson, if approved, will set back an arduous, yearslong effort to improve the regulation of chemicals. Last year, after many false starts, Congress passed a bipartisan bill that updated the Toxic Substances Control Act, a 1976 law that had made it very hard for regulators to ban or regulate chemicals by requiring the E.P.A. to meet a very high burden of proof before taking action. The law also made it easy for companies to keep data about their products hidden from the public by claiming the information was a “trade secret.” The new law simplified the task by streamlining it, directing the E.P.A. to review at least 20 substances at a time, giving priority to the riskiest chemicals. The money to do this work will come from up to $25 million in annual fees paid by chemical manufacturers and processors.

Experts fear that if confirmed Mr. Dourson will put a much greater emphasis on pleasing the chemical industry than on protecting public health. He could, for instance, order his staff to cherry-pick studies and data that in turn would lead to lax standards or even allow the continued use of chemicals that ought to be banned outright. In March, the E.P.A. administrator, Scott Pruitt, rejected a staff recommendation to ban the pesticide chlorpyrifos, which scientists believe has harmed farm workers and children. Any decisions Mr. Dourson would make would most likely remain in place for years or even decades. E.P.A. reviews take several years to complete, and the agency has a long list of chemicals it needs to study.",Mr. Trump Outdoes Himself in Picking a Conflicted Regulator,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/opinion/mr-trump-outdoes-himself-in-picking-a-conflicted-regulator.html

The Five run server clouds, app stores, ad networks and venture firms, altars to which the smaller guys must pay a sizable tax just for existing. For the Five, the start-up economy has turned into a heads-I-win-tails-you-lose proposition — they love start-ups, but in the same way that orcas love baby seals.

There is perhaps no better example of this dynamic than what has happened to Snap, the company that makes the disappearing messaging app Snapchat. Although it is one of the most innovative consumer-focused internet companies — Snap created a whole new paradigm in social networking, and pioneered the idea that the camera is the future of human communication — it has been battered by the giants.

After failing to buy Snap several years ago, Facebook repeatedly tried to copy its key innovations. This year, when Facebook lifted Snapchat’s Stories feature for Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook’s main app, it seemed to deliver a death blow.

But Facebook isn’t the only behemoth trying to feed off Snap’s carcass. In January, Snap signed a cloud hosting deal with Google. It agreed to pay Google $400 million a year for the next five years. Note that Snap booked only about $330 million in ad revenue in the first half of this year. In other words, it’s paying more than half of its revenue to Google.

Oh, and do you know who its largest competitors in the internet ad market are? Surprise! Facebook and Google.

The small guys won’t concede any this, of course. Unbridled optimism fuels start-up world, and many investors and start-up executives I talked to in recent weeks argued that with the insane amounts of money pouring into start-ups, the Five don’t have the whole game won.

They said the Five’s platforms had made starting companies cheaper and easier, and pointed to several successful start-ups that managed to elude the Five’s clutches in the last few years: Netflix, Uber and Airbnb. And when you look at business-focused companies that aren’t household names, you come up with dozens more, from Slack to Stripe to Square.

“In a lot of ways I’d say it hasn’t changed,” said Joey Levin, the chief executive of IAC, an internet and media company based in New York. “I’ve been around the internet long enough, and the first thing we used to ask in every meeting when I started was, ‘Why won’t Microsoft do your business?’ Then six years later it was, ‘Why doesn’t Google do it?’ Now it’s a combination of why can’t Facebook, Google, Apple or Amazon do this?”

Mr. Levin’s position is interesting. Even if you may not have heard of it, IAC has been battling giants online for a long time. The company grew out of the media tycoon Barry Diller’s television holdings of the 1990s; over the last two decades, IAC created a string of digital brands that tried to find some foothold outside the fiefs of the giants. Among them are Expedia, Match.com, Tinder, Ask.com and Vimeo.

Some of these companies became the biggest brands in their categories, while others were also-rans that came up short against the day’s tech giants. In many cases, though, IAC made money by shrewdly navigating the giants. Sometimes it worked with the behemoths, other times it competed with them, and always it looked for opportunities above and beneath and between the giants, like a clever pigeon picking up crumbs around a picnic table.

IAC’s latest gambit is Angi Homeservices, a company that combines two big brands aimed at home repair and refurbishing, Angie’s List and HomeAdvisor. That company competes directly with some of the Five — both Google and Amazon have services meant to help you find people to install things your house.

Chris Terrill, the chief executive, told me that Angi Homeservices had a dedicated team working on providing a service that’s superior to anything the giants can build. But he also said his company was eager to team up with one of the big guys — for instance, on one of their voice-assistant platforms — because working with one of the Five could ease its path into the big leagues.

“We think that a smart voice provider will say, ‘If I want to win at all costs, we’ll go get the very best partner’ — and that’s us,” Mr. Terrill said.

In some ways, IAC could be a model for the internet company of tomorrow. It clearly aims big and isn’t going for second place. But it has also internalized a kind of working method that recognizes the Five as more-or-less permanent fixtures of the internet. It’s not betting on their demise; rather, it’s betting on their continued success. If Angi is to win, so will one or more of the Five.

IAC’s executives recognize the danger of a digital marketplace that is so heavily dependent on big guys. “I think the opportunities are still there, but I do worry that some of the biggest players are going to stifle that competition by trying to do and own too much themselves,” Mr. Terrill said.

I asked another IAC veteran, Dara Khosrowshahi — who until recently was the chief executive of Expedia — whether he believed the internet was still an open field for innovation, or whether the Five were closing it off.

“I’m mixed as it relates to that,” he said. “I fundamentally think innovative ideas can still survive and thrive, but the Googles and Facebooks of the world have so much more intelligence as to mass consumer behavior that they probably have an unfair advantage in identifying these early fast movers — and are willing to pay prices that are extraordinary for them.”

In August, Mr. Khosrowshahi was appointed chief executive of Uber, where he will have to deal with the giants more directly. Though his company is the most highly valued start-up of our age, its success seems far from assured. Many of its problems are of its own making, and Mr. Khosrowshahi is determined to fix them.

But like Snap, Uber is at the mercy of the Five. Alphabet, Google’s parent company, is an investor in Uber. But Alphabet’s autonomous-car company, Waymo, is also a competitor to Uber. On top of that, Waymo has sued Uber, alleging theft of trade secrets.

The future of Uber, of ride-hailing and of autonomous vehicles in America is hazy.

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — I like to think of myself as a “word person” — someone who knows and loves words — but every once in a while, that perception gets jolted.

That is a problem with our command.” My own experience and those I’ve learned about from other women support this statistic.

I witnessed misogyny at all levels of my six years in the military. On Monday mornings, while working in the motor pool to clean and maintain our Humvees, male soldiers would gather around a single cellphone to watch porn and talk in detail of their sexual escapades. I quickly learned and got accustomed to hearing terms for violent sexual activity too graphic to detail here. This language and the images of sexual violence they represented quickly became part of my psychological reality. I myself began to objectify women, and found myself troubled and confused by my own gender identity.

Misogyny was present in the smallest of things, like the nude pinups of women that the chain of command allowed in work shelters, but bigger things, too, like the frequent accounts of male-on-female assault and rape. One of my friends, on a deployment to Afghanistan, was so brutally raped by a male soldier that she is now physically unable to carry and give birth to a child. (She was recently medically discharged after 19 years of active duty and in is in rehabilitation for post-traumatic stress disorder, including daily thoughts of suicide.) Another friend, while stationed in South Korea, was tied up in her bedroom, raped and beaten by several male soldiers, then found in a bloody bath four days later.

In the United States, sexual assault is reported to be declining (dropping 58 percent between 1995 and 2010). But in the military it’s increasing enormously, so much so that the United Nations has gotten involved and the Pentagon reported that the military received a record number of sexual assault reports in 2016. This year we saw the persistence of this culture in the Marines United photo scandal, in which hundreds of Marines circulated intimate photos of women to a secret Facebook group without their consent. Despite the historical advances of women into combat and leadership roles, not a whole lot is being done to change this culture.

Misogyny, of course, is present in every other sector of society, but there is an important distinction in the military. Michael Kimmel, author of “Angry White Men” and a professor of sociology at Stony Brook University, told me, “The military is the same as every other organization, in that these informal cultural barriers have shown up everywhere.” But the military is different because of transparent hierarchy. “If the top of the military wanted this to stop, it would stop. Period.”

The military, more than any other American institution, runs on an unwavering chain of command. It is entirely based on the taking and giving of orders. But there remain entrenched problems with the system of military justice. It is the chain of command that is responsible for investigation and punishment of sexual assaults.

In 2013, Senator Gillibrand introduced legislation to remove the chain of command from handling these cases. It narrowly failed to meet the 60-vote threshold required to avoid a filibuster. In 2014, Senator Gillibrand fought and lost again. In 2016, she tried to reintroduce the bill, but the Republican leadership would not allow the bill onto the floor because the Department of Defense said taking away commanders’ authority would “undermine good order and discipline.” As a result, reports from the department’s Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office show that year after year, almost no progress has been made toward ending sexual assault in the military, despite its repeated promises to do so.

Lawrence Korb, a former assistant secretary of defense and senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, told me, “The chain of command cannot be involved in issues of sexual assault because the issue gets diluted and distorted.” A military lawyer I deployed with agrees. He estimated that in his eight years of service, “95 percent of crimes prosecuted were crimes caught, or reported, by an outside agency, not internal to the unit.” This was because those crimes being reported by an outside agency had to be prosecuted. Otherwise, commanders would bury allegations because having harassment or assault cases reflects poorly on them. As a manager, it’s simply easier to squash the problem by transferring the accused perpetrator or the victim out of the unit.

Many of our closest allies’ militaries, including those of Britain, Canada, Israel, Germany, Norway and Australia, have already moved reporting and prosecution of violent sex crimes outside of the chain of command. But why haven’t we?

Some in the military have decided on their own that it will stop, with them.

When I was moved into a different platoon in South Korea, I fell under the leadership of the man who would become my mentor. With his guidance, I pushed myself physically, getting near-perfect scores on my fitness and marksmanship tests. He helped me study for Soldier of the Month competitions, which I won numerous times. This led to my promotion to sergeant, just shy of my second anniversary of being in the Army. When rumors spread that I was promoted because I must have slept around, my mentor sat down with the rest of my platoon and set them straight. He told them forcefully that it was not true and to cease the rumor spreading immediately.

Because someone defended me at that critical moment, and because of guidance from other true leaders, I was able to sharpen my mental and physical acumen and attain positions in the United States Embassy in Iraq and as a member of the personal staff for Lt. Gen. Frank Helmick, the former commanding general of the XVIII Airborne Corps. General Helmick nurtured my passion for writing and planted the seed for me to later pursue it professionally. These positive experiences with men greatly enhanced my self-worth and have helped me succeed, both in and out of the military.

I wish I could say my military career ended well, but it didn’t. As my career progressed, I was confronted with more poor treatment by my superiors. It became all too clear to me that despite the many devoted, professional men who hold up the honor of military service, the atmosphere toward women in general had not changed.

The military is morally obligated to stop the systemwide mistreatment of women in its ranks, but that change will not be made until it is enforced from the top leadership on down. It is too big and important a job to be left to a few good men.","Military Women, Too, Should Serve Unmolested",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/opinion/military-women-molested.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

PhotoIn an interview with Lincoln Kirstein, who wrote an essay for Evans’s 1938 book “American Photographs,” Evans said, “Take Atget, whose work I now know very well.","From grizzled cotton farmers to quiet small-town buildings and roadside stands, Walker Evans built his reputation on chronicling America’s out-of-the-way places and people. And while he was a prodigious chronicler of vernacular American culture, his own roots were hardly common. Born Walker Evans III, the scion of a prominent family, he grew up in privilege, attending Phillips Academy and then Williams College, dropping out after one year.

A turning point for Evans was his decision — like many young men of means — to go to Paris in 1926 to study for a year at the Sorbonne. His stay filled his head with ideas gleaned from Flaubert and Baudelaire, but it was another Frenchman — Eugène Atget — whose work affected him the most, leading to the dry, observational style that became his visual signature.

Clément Chéroux, a French curator, organized a massive Walker Evans retrospective at the Centre Pompidou in Paris, which recently traveled to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, (where he is now the head of the photography department). He said Evans tried to emulate in America what Atget did in Paris.

“Atget has tried to define, through his photographs — what is the Parisian vernacular? What is the visual spirit of Paris? And Evans has done exactly the same with America,” Mr. Chéroux said. “What is so interesting for me, in this exchange between American and French culture, is that he has tried to define the American vernacular culture, but with the method and style of French culture.”

Evans embodied a paradox: a member of the American elite drawn to unfussy places, urban workers and desperate farmers, becoming best known for his seminal project with James Agee, “Let Us Now Praise Famous Men,” about America’s poor and downtrodden during the Great Depression.

For Mr. Chéroux, this paradox was an interesting way to understand Evans. The curator has done scholarly research into the vernacular, which he defines as “useful, domestic and popular” in an essay in the exhibition catalog. “Maybe one of the reasons why I’m fascinated with Evans is because there is so much paradox in his work,” he said. “There is this dialectical tension between Europe and the U.S., and there is also this very strong dialectical tension between an aristocratic or elite point of view, and a subject which is definitely popular culture, and workers.”

The specific nature of the Atget-Evans vision, with its emphasis on large format, razor sharp, perfectly observed, almost preternaturally quiet moments, allows the photographs to impress viewers nearly a century later. Evans had a simple explanation: Atget’s photographs had a transcendent quality, which he tried to emulate.

In an interview with Lincoln Kirstein, who wrote an essay for Evans’s 1938 book “American Photographs,” Evans said, “Take Atget, whose work I now know very well. In his work you do feel what some people call poetry. I do call it that also, but a better word for it, to me, is, well – when Atget does even a tree root, he transcends that thing. And by God somebody else does not.”

By looking at things previously unobserved, or subjects once thought beneath the purview of art, Evans created a vision of America that is still inextricable from our national identity. And while his initial exposure to Atget’s work might have been coincidental — his friend Berenice Abbott showed him a trove of the Frenchman’s work — his subsequent choice of subject matter was not.

In another essay in the exhibition catalog, Evans said his early work was influenced by his feelings about the United States. “I was really anti-American at the time,” he said. “America was a big business and I wanted to escape. It nauseated me. My photography was a semi-conscious reaction against right-thinking and optimism; it was an attack on the establishment. I could just hear my father saying, ‘Why do you want to look at those scenes, they’re depressing. Why don’t you look at the nice things in life?’ Nothing original about that though.”

This might be the key to understanding his role in the history of photography, as he heavily influenced subsequent generations, including the famed “New Topographics” movement of the 1970s. (When asked via email whether Evans’s work had inspired him and his colleagues, Stephen Shore simply replied, “Yes.”)

According to Mr. Chéroux, Evans was able to adopt a neutral stance and let the magic, or inherent tension, of a scene speak for itself. He notably contrasted this style against the showy, artsy technique employed by contemporaries like Alfred Stieglitz and the Modernists.

“He wants to disappear in front of his subject, to let this emotion transfer from the subject to the viewer,” he said of Evans. “I think this is really what he understood. It’s the reason why he is so close to Atget. All the photographers who think that the subject is more important than themselves are in this position.”

The retrospective, while focusing on the past, and including selections from Evans’s personal collection of vernacular art, also allows viewers to appreciate how photography, a slice out of time, relates to the present. In particular, his 1937 photographs showing people displaced by floods in the South are just as relevant today.

“That’s the power of art,” Mr. Chéroux said, “to address some historical questions, but to address them in the present time. To create a kind of effect that is both present and past, and I think this is something photography is really great at.”

As with the case of Mr. O’Reilly, their findings were bolstered not just by testimony but by legal documents and company records.
“If you look across these various episodes, there are a lot of similarities,” Ms. Steel said.
Ms. Kantor and Ms. Twohey were likewise unaware of the dimensions of the Weinstein case when they began working on it.
Mr. Weinstein was fired by the Weinstein Company three days after The Times’s first report was published.","And on Oct. 5, Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey revealed that the Hollywood megaproducer Harvey Weinstein has been confronted with sexual harassment allegations for nearly three decades, and in at least eight cases has reached settlements with his accusers. Many more accusations of harassment and assault have been leveled at Mr. Weinstein — on the pages of The Times, in other publications and on social media — in the days since. As with the case of Mr. O’Reilly, their findings were bolstered not just by testimony but by legal documents and company records.

All of these journalists say they experienced much the same thing while reporting: ever more women telling the same stories about a small handful of powerful men.

“If you look across these various episodes, there are a lot of similarities,” Ms. Steel said. “Men offering career advancements and then asking somebody up to their hotel room, or building a relationship with someone and then making these unwanted sexual advances.”

She and Mr. Schmidt began their investigation into Mr. O’Reilly’s conduct by looking at the case of Andrea Mackris, a former Fox producer who sued him for harassment in 2004. They learned that Ms. Mackris wasn’t the only one who had made allegations of this nature.

Ms. Kantor and Ms. Twohey were likewise unaware of the dimensions of the Weinstein case when they began working on it. “In a way, we’re asking the same questions now as we were at the start of the reporting,” Ms. Kantor said, “which is, what is the scale and scope of this thing?”

There are a number of factors that make allegations of sexual harrassment difficult to report. In all three cases, reporters said sources were hesitant to speak out because their allegations were so intimate; because they feared reprisal by powerful men; and in many instances, the women involved had entered into settlements that included nondisclosure agreements.

“Until reporting on this, I didn’t realize the extent that these settlements and these confidentiality agreements played in this whole ecosystem,” Ms. Steel said. “As soon as a woman signs this, she can’t talk about her allegations ever again.”

Given the challenges, these stories required weeks or months of painstaking work. “Getting people to speak on the record about these painful experiences requires time, patience and establishing trust,” said Matt Purdy, a deputy managing editor at The Times. “We have given reporters that time and the support of editors because this is a subject that absolutely demands to be brought into the open in a big way.”

Mr. Schmidt and Ms. Steel took nearly eight months with the O’Reilly story; Ms. Benner worked for over a month on the Silicon Valley article; and Ms. Kantor and Ms. Twohey spent four months working on the Weinstein case. (That included, for several weeks near the end, a number of consecutive nights spent at the office until midnight or 1 a.m. Their editor, Rebecca Corbett, who heads The Times’s investigative projects desk, sometimes stayed even later.)

The reporters weren’t immune, either, to much the same kind of intimidation and bullying their sources said they’d faced. “The people who carried out the unacceptable behavior threw up as many hurdles as possible,” said Pui-Wing Tam, The Times’s technology editor, who worked on the Silicon Valley story. “Many used threats, yelling and blamed the victims. At times, they called me to try and undermine the credibility of the reporters themselves.”

(“What can I say?” she added. “That just won’t work, folks.”)

And Mr. Weinstein threatened to sue The Times this month. “He had one high-priced consultant or lawyer after another — ” Ms. Kantor began.

“An army,” Ms. Twohey confirmed. “It was an army attacking us.”

Ms. Steel, meanwhile, had already been subject to the displeasure of Mr. O’Reilly. When reporting an unrelated article on him in February 2015, he’d called her and told her, on the record: “I am coming after you with everything I have,” and, “You can take it as a threat.”

The experience equipped Ms. Steel with an empathetic perspective while reporting the harassment story two years later. “When I was talking to sources, I knew what it was like to be on the other side of a phone call when O’Reilly was saying threatening things,” she said.

And when it came to telling their stories, at least some of the women featured in all three articles were heartened by The Times’s commitment to the topic.

“We did have some sources who had never spoken to another journalist,” Ms. Kantor said. They opened up to her and Ms. Twohey in part, they said, because they had seen the success of the O’Reilly and Silicon Valley stories.

Still, all the reporters emphasized that their motivation wasn’t advocacy. “We didn’t seek out to do this reporting to take someone down,” Ms. Steel said.

Ms. Kantor concurred. “Sometimes sources would say things to me like, ‘Go get him,’” Ms. Kantor said. “I don’t have any personal animus toward Harvey Weinstein. For us, this is really just about uncovering the truth.”

For all three cases, that process of uncovering has had a dual effect. On one hand, to discover the extent of the allegations — and the pervasiveness of the culture — has been overwhelming. The reporters said they spent days afterward sorting through dozens of tips; Ms. Steel said people working across a range of industries asked her to look into their similar experiences. As she put it, “It’s disheartening to see that there’s still this power imbalance and that this culture of misogyny really remains in our businesses and in our lives.”

On the other hand, the investigations are beginning to have powerful real-life consequences. Mr. Weinstein was fired by the Weinstein Company three days after The Times’s first report was published. Mr. O’Reilly was ousted by Fox News on April 19. And the venture capitalist Dave McClure stepped down from his company, 500 Startups, several days after Ms. Benner’s report.

The journalists agreed that there has also been an accompanying shift in the culture around disclosure. “I think that what you saw almost immediately was a growing safe space for more women to come forward and tell their stories,” Ms. Twohey said. One source, she said, had been particularly frightened about potential blowback but has since received many notes of gratitude — even flowers, Ms. Twohey said.

Ms. Steel said she was struck, in the course of doing research, by how differently the media portrays these women’s stories even since Andrea Mackris first filed suit against Mr. O’Reilly (and her personal life was subsequently dragged through the mud in the tabloids) in 2004.

“I’ve thought a lot about that,” Ms. Steel said. “There’s this whole history of women who have made these allegations before. How would their stories have been told today?”

“Now that Angelina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow have come forward, I wonder if it will take some of the weird societal sting out of it,” Ms. Benner said. “We are so much more than the bad things that happen to us.”",How to Break a Sexual Harassment Story,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/15/insider/sexual-harassment-weinstein-oreilly.html

The sweetness of chilled spot prawns under a few drops of olive oil made me shiver with pleasure. A trio of flash-seared Hokkaido sea scallop, Pacific mackerel whose skin had been peppered and griddled, and raw amberjack under tiny cells of finger lime suggested that Mr. Torrisi could run a stunning sushi restaurant.

My eyes rolled back in my head whenever I ate sea urchin. In one appetizer, it is arranged on griddled pretzel bread with mustard oil and tiny cubes of green apple. In another, lobes of it are layered into an iced bowl to be eaten, with crème fraîche and chives if you like, over blini, hard-cooked eggs, toast or, my favorites, creamy potato halves roasted in duck fat. (Caviar and trout roe are served the same way.)

Mr. Torrisi’s approach is to be lavish with punctiliously cared-for seafood and to outfit it sparingly. A beautiful illustration is the cured king salmon, two long, intensely flavorful strips served with a single potato dressed with mustard, shallots and dill. Another is any of the whole fish. The skin on turbot caught in Portugal is seared to a satisfying crackle on a plancha and served with a simple lemon vinaigrette. Like the Dover sole, it is lifted from its skeleton by a slim captain (they’re all slim) who performs the surgery wearing a Tom Ford suit.

One night five captains in five suits filleted five sole for five diners at a table next to mine. It looked like a scene from “Ocean’s Eleven” that didn’t make the final cut.

But some of the more elaborate dishes are underwhelming. I don’t know how striped bass with banana peppers and “mole spices” can be dull, but it is. Coconut-orange vinaigrette sounds like a terrific sauce for lobster, but it added very little except sweetness, which the lobster didn’t need. Chopped gazpacho ingredients over a puddle of actual gazpacho was both too complicated (why not just serve gazpacho?) and too plain (the cucumbers and tomatoes didn’t shine with flavor).

This is all a huge improvement on what prevailed in the last years of the Four Seasons. But it doesn’t make you feel as if you are in the hands of one of the city’s best chefs, which Mr. Torrisi is, I think. Even at its best, the food rarely rises to the technical brilliance or boldness of, say, the green curry mushroom mille-feuille or the Vietnamese-flavored chicken legs he put on the menu at Dirty French. If his cooking at the Pool had some of that swagger, what’s on the plates could live up to the best parts of the original architecture and help make up for the renovation’s mistakes.

This is exactly what happens when Stephanie Prida’s desserts arrive. Ms. Prida, who until a few months ago was the pastry chef at Manresa in Los Gatos, Calif., has a knack for combining flavors that seem to get more interesting as you go along, like a crème brûlée with shaved plums and bitter almond ice cream under a squiggle of reduced sherry vinegar, or coconut parfait and fluffy pink-grapefruit mousse sandwiched between the thinnest possible layers of matcha sablé.

Bottles of Chateau d’Yquem going back to 1811 are kept in a glass wine room just off the entrance to the Pool, where they cast a beautiful amber glow that the servers are fond of pointing out. Enjoy it as you walk in, because this is as close as you will get to a dessert wine of any kind unless you are ready to spend at least $95, the price of the least expensive glass.

The wine list is full of wonderful bottles, but its most noteworthy feature is its breezy lack of concern for normal budgets. Out of dozens of sparkling wines, more than 30 are priced above $1,000. Just one is under $90. This is quite a pinch to put on customers who are already paying between $39 and $74 for main courses.

The Grill/Pool bifurcation extends to the dining room staff. In the Pool they are reserved, poised, deferential and seem to have been directed not to show any warmth or wit. Compared with the talkative, jokey characters in the Grill, who are ready to flambé something at the drop of a hat, the servers in the Pool are cardboard figures in tailored suits.

Major Food Group has no fear of going over the top. So I’m reluctant to suggest that the Pool needs more personality and drama — these guys are capable of stocking the pool with live sharks if they thought it would help. But the restaurant needs something, because at these prices, what might pass for restraint and simplicity can start to seem like a sophisticated heist.

The measure is creating friction. Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, reflecting his most conservative members, came out against the deal on Wednesday.

“The speaker does not see anything that changes his view that the Senate should keep its focus on repeal and replace of Obamacare,” said Doug Andres, a spokesman for Mr. Ryan.

But the authors of the measure may be gaining support for the moment that they have the most leverage. In December, the government will run out of money, and no bill to keep it funded can pass without Democratic votes. At that point, supporters of the Alexander-Murray measure can insist on its inclusion in any spending bill and threaten to shut down the government if they do not prevail. Already, several Republicans have backed the agreement, including Senators John McCain of Arizona, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.

Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana and the co-author with Senator Lindsey Graham of the most recent legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act, offered his qualified support: “If combined with greater flexibility to allow states to lower costs, this will set the stage for replace through a mechanism such as Graham-Cassidy. I will study this proposal to see if it accomplishes these goals.”

Mr. Alexander, speaking Wednesday at a forum convened by Axios, a news website, said: “The president engineered the bipartisan agreement by calling me and asking me to work with Senator Murray to do it. I’ve talked with him three times in the last 10 days about it.”

Mr. Alexander predicted that the plan would “pass in some form before the end of the year.” And he said the deal included several victories for conservatives, making it easier for states to revamp their insurance markets and allowing people of any age to buy low-cost, high-deductible health plans providing catastrophic coverage.

A federal judge ruled in 2016 that the federal payments to insurance companies, known as cost-sharing reductions, violated the Constitution because Congress never provided money for them. Citing that ruling, Mr. Trump announced last week that he would stop the payments.

Mr. Trump says he still supports longer-range efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with block grants to the states.

Such big changes would not take effect until 2020 or 2021, Mr. Alexander said. “What do you do in the meantime?” he asked. “What you don’t want to do in the meantime is create chaos and hurt millions of Americans.”

“What does chaos do?” Mr. Alexander asked. “It’s a four-lane highway to a single-payer solution. It’s a birthday present for Bernie Sanders,” the independent Vermont senator and leading advocate for a single-payer “Medicare for all” health care system.

The Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, quickly pushed back on the president’s Twitter post, expressing exasperation in remarks on the Senate floor.

“Frankly, the president doesn’t know what he’s talking about in the compromise,” Mr. Schumer said. “It doesn’t bail out insurance companies. It helps people who are sick and who need health care.”

Mr. Schumer said the president “keeps zigging and zagging, so it’s impossible to govern.”

“Our only hope is maybe tomorrow he’ll be for this again,” he added.

Indeed, Mr. Trump’s exact views on the Senate measure have been hard to pin down over the past 24 hours or so.

At a news conference at the White House on Tuesday afternoon, virtually as the deal was being announced at the Capitol, Mr. Trump voiced support for the plan. He vowed to try again to repeal the Affordable Care Act but said the emerging bipartisan deal would “get us over this intermediate hump” in the meantime.

The president described the Senate plan as a “short-term solution so that we don’t have this very dangerous little period.”

Hours later, in a speech to the conservative Heritage Foundation, Mr. Trump commended the work of Mr. Alexander and Ms. Murray, but he said that Congress needed to “find a solution to the Obamacare mess instead of providing bailouts to insurance companies.”

FRIDAY PUZZLE — When you’ve had a busy or a tough week — a week where it feels as if your hair is on fire — your best bet is to find a distraction. Ideally, this distraction should be good for you (or at least not terribly harmful) and should allow you to focus hard on it so that you can temporarily displace thoughts about what kindled that hair fire to begin with.

My own go-to distractions are running, reading, cooking and knitting. When I really need to distract myself and focus down, I enjoy British-style cryptic crosswords. I’m sure you have your own distractions.

My point is, once the hair fire is extinguished and the smoke settles, you deserve a reward for making it through. The Venn diagram of “distractions from hair fires” and “rewards” probably overlaps quite a bit, but in my opinion, sitting down on a Friday with a lovely beverage and a Patrick Berry themeless crossword is one of the best ways to end the week. I put that firmly in the rewards circle.

Mr. Berry can bring some fresh entries to his grids and bring back entries that have not been seen for a while. The middle section — BARBARA JORDAN, SOCIAL STUDIES and ACCOUNT HOLDER — is O.K. in terms of liveliness, but those are all debuts, so bonus points there.

Unlike some of his colleagues in the tech world, Mr. Musk is driven more by cooking than by the love of a good algorithm. Growing up in Pretoria, South Africa, he started in the kitchen at age 12, making meals as a way to bring his family together. His mother, the model Maye Musk, worked as a dietitian to support the family after she divorced his father, Errol Musk, an engineer and pilot.

At her house, Mr. Musk said, “it was all brown bread and plain yogurt.” At his dad’s, he and his brother and sister, Tosca (now a film producer and director), ate whatever the maid cooked, usually in front of the TV. “It wasn’t very good,” he recalled.

“I noticed that when I cooked, my dad especially would make us all sit down and eat together,” he said. “I loved it.”

He graduated from college in Canada and made his first fortune in 1999, when he and his brother sold Zip2 — a digital mapping service that helped newspapers including The New York Times produce online city guides — to Compaq Computer for $307 million. He became an investor in his brother’s other ventures, including PayPal and Tesla. (He is on the board of both Elon Musk’s electric car company and his rocket company, SpaceX, as well as Chipotle Mexican Grill.)

Set financially, Mr. Musk moved from Silicon Valley to New York and enrolled in the French Culinary Institute (now the International Culinary Center). He lived near the World Trade Center, and after the 9/11 attacks, spent six weeks volunteering as a cook for firefighters and other people working the pile. He finally understood, he said, the link between food and community.

Soon after, he and Jen Lewin, his first wife, left for Colorado, where he met Mr. Matheson and opened The Kitchen in 2004. With its deep farm-to-table ethos and casually elegant style, the restaurant was an immediate hit.

Both projects were running just fine without him, so Mr. Musk became chief executive of another tech company. Then, on a 2010 trip with his family in Jackson Hole, Wyo., he was sliding down a snowy hill on an inner tube when it flipped. He broke his neck and was temporarily paralyzed.

During the two months he had to lie flat on his back, it became clear that he wanted to devote himself to food. He and his wife divorced; he quit the tech company and dedicated himself to changing the way Americans eat.

Mr. Musk became interested in school gardens. He remains friendly with his ex-wife (the couple have two boys, and he has a daughter with another woman), and Ms. Lewin designed modular curved plastic planters that could be arranged in any schoolyard. Paired with instructions on how they can be used to teach subjects like science, the first gardens were installed in Denver schools in 2011.

Mr. Musk has begun a chain of hyper-local restaurants called Next Door, which he and Mr. Matheson envision as the Applebee’s for a new generation.

All the food is cooked from scratch. Menus feature wild salmon, burgers of local pasture-raised beef and big Greek salads with vegetables from nearby farms. Entree prices average $14, and the restaurants are designed so customers sit down together to eat and get their meals almost as soon as they order.

The first opened six years ago next to The Kitchen in Boulder. In September, another opened in a huge urban renewal project in Memphis called Crosstown Concourse, an abandoned Sears distribution center that has been turned into apartments and shops, with a school, a health clinic and an arts center. The partners plan to add 50 more Next Door restaurants by the end of 2020.

Mr. Musk also opened an outpost of his more upscale Kitchen restaurant inside a 4,500-acre urban park called Shelby Farms in the center of Memphis. But he insisted that he be allowed to buy 300 acres nearby that for decades had been used to grow cotton, so he could turn it into an organic farm, a project now in the works.

He is also testing the Kitchenette, a little takeout spot in Shelby Farms that sells locally grown, well-prepared meals for about $5 — his answer to a fast-food restaurant.

Mr. Musk’s nonprofit arm, The Kitchen Community, has put learning gardens into 100 Memphis schools, providing both staff and materials. Each one costs about $40,000, money that comes from the Musk Foundation and local donors. He has placed his gardens in schools in Los Angeles, Pittsburgh and 150 in Chicago, where Mayor Rahm Emanuel gave the project $2 million in city funds. By 2020, Mr. Musk hopes to have them in more than 1,000 schools.

He is not a fan of traditional school garden programs. “They don’t scale at all,” he said.

There are other ways to ruffle the feathers of Alice Waters, the Bay Area chef who helped pioneer the American slow-food movement and the concept of the edible schoolyard, but criticizing her approach to local food and school gardens is near the top of the list.

“I don’t want to hear another word about scaling,” Ms. Waters said. “He doesn’t know what he doesn’t know. He’s very earnest about what he’s doing, but he doesn’t know enough about farming and about the soil. He wants to do the right thing, but he just hasn’t done his homework. Not everything has to be scalable.”

Mr. Musk says he is “absolutely in conflict” with Ms. Waters. “I love her, but I don’t agree with her views.”

Critics have taken on his Square Roots project, too. The idea is to train young farmers by teaching them to grow greens with nothing but enhanced water and LEDs in shipping containers, and then sell the lettuce and kale to local restaurants and office workers.

Last year the project installed 10 containers in the parking lot of the old Pfizer factory in South Williamsburg, Brooklyn, each able to grow as much produce as two acres of dirt. In August, Square Roots secured $5.4 million in private seed funding, and has grants from the United States Department of Agriculture. Mr. Musk wants one in every major city.

Whether food actually needs soil is one of the flash points between organic traditionalists and people like Mr. Musk. “Ideologically, they prefer soil,” he said. “We don’t care. Let them fight their fight.”

Mr. Musk’s ascent has underscored a generational rift that pits old-liners who shun aspects of emerging food science against a new wave of food disrupters who haven’t embraced the roles that history, flavor and pleasure play, said Garrett Broad, an assistant professor at Fordham University who recently wrote about one aspect of the divide for the publication Civil Eats.

“Somebody like Kimbal Musk could be an important bridge to bring some of these ideas together,” Dr. Broad said.

Maybe, Mr. Musk says. He is as much a believer in the power of technology as anyone in Silicon Valley. But he is a cook at heart.

“Optimizing for efficiency over everything else sucks,” he said. “Have you ever eaten in Palo Alto?”

That is a problem with our command.” My own experience and those I’ve learned about from other women support this statistic.

I witnessed misogyny at all levels of my six years in the military. On Monday mornings, while working in the motor pool to clean and maintain our Humvees, male soldiers would gather around a single cellphone to watch porn and talk in detail of their sexual escapades. I quickly learned and got accustomed to hearing terms for violent sexual activity too graphic to detail here. This language and the images of sexual violence they represented quickly became part of my psychological reality. I myself began to objectify women, and found myself troubled and confused by my own gender identity.

Misogyny was present in the smallest of things, like the nude pinups of women that the chain of command allowed in work shelters, but bigger things, too, like the frequent accounts of male-on-female assault and rape. One of my friends, on a deployment to Afghanistan, was so brutally raped by a male soldier that she is now physically unable to carry and give birth to a child. (She was recently medically discharged after 19 years of active duty and in is in rehabilitation for post-traumatic stress disorder, including daily thoughts of suicide.) Another friend, while stationed in South Korea, was tied up in her bedroom, raped and beaten by several male soldiers, then found in a bloody bath four days later.

In the United States, sexual assault is reported to be declining (dropping 58 percent between 1995 and 2010). But in the military it’s increasing enormously, so much so that the United Nations has gotten involved and the Pentagon reported that the military received a record number of sexual assault reports in 2016. This year we saw the persistence of this culture in the Marines United photo scandal, in which hundreds of Marines circulated intimate photos of women to a secret Facebook group without their consent. Despite the historical advances of women into combat and leadership roles, not a whole lot is being done to change this culture.

Misogyny, of course, is present in every other sector of society, but there is an important distinction in the military. Michael Kimmel, author of “Angry White Men” and a professor of sociology at Stony Brook University, told me, “The military is the same as every other organization, in that these informal cultural barriers have shown up everywhere.” But the military is different because of transparent hierarchy. “If the top of the military wanted this to stop, it would stop. Period.”

The military, more than any other American institution, runs on an unwavering chain of command. It is entirely based on the taking and giving of orders. But there remain entrenched problems with the system of military justice. It is the chain of command that is responsible for investigation and punishment of sexual assaults.

In 2013, Senator Gillibrand introduced legislation to remove the chain of command from handling these cases. It narrowly failed to meet the 60-vote threshold required to avoid a filibuster. In 2014, Senator Gillibrand fought and lost again. In 2016, she tried to reintroduce the bill, but the Republican leadership would not allow the bill onto the floor because the Department of Defense said taking away commanders’ authority would “undermine good order and discipline.” As a result, reports from the department’s Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office show that year after year, almost no progress has been made toward ending sexual assault in the military, despite its repeated promises to do so.

Lawrence Korb, a former assistant secretary of defense and senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, told me, “The chain of command cannot be involved in issues of sexual assault because the issue gets diluted and distorted.” A military lawyer I deployed with agrees. He estimated that in his eight years of service, “95 percent of crimes prosecuted were crimes caught, or reported, by an outside agency, not internal to the unit.” This was because those crimes being reported by an outside agency had to be prosecuted. Otherwise, commanders would bury allegations because having harassment or assault cases reflects poorly on them. As a manager, it’s simply easier to squash the problem by transferring the accused perpetrator or the victim out of the unit.

Many of our closest allies’ militaries, including those of Britain, Canada, Israel, Germany, Norway and Australia, have already moved reporting and prosecution of violent sex crimes outside of the chain of command. But why haven’t we?

Some in the military have decided on their own that it will stop, with them.

When I was moved into a different platoon in South Korea, I fell under the leadership of the man who would become my mentor. With his guidance, I pushed myself physically, getting near-perfect scores on my fitness and marksmanship tests. He helped me study for Soldier of the Month competitions, which I won numerous times. This led to my promotion to sergeant, just shy of my second anniversary of being in the Army. When rumors spread that I was promoted because I must have slept around, my mentor sat down with the rest of my platoon and set them straight. He told them forcefully that it was not true and to cease the rumor spreading immediately.

Because someone defended me at that critical moment, and because of guidance from other true leaders, I was able to sharpen my mental and physical acumen and attain positions in the United States Embassy in Iraq and as a member of the personal staff for Lt. Gen. Frank Helmick, the former commanding general of the XVIII Airborne Corps. General Helmick nurtured my passion for writing and planted the seed for me to later pursue it professionally. These positive experiences with men greatly enhanced my self-worth and have helped me succeed, both in and out of the military.

I wish I could say my military career ended well, but it didn’t. As my career progressed, I was confronted with more poor treatment by my superiors. It became all too clear to me that despite the many devoted, professional men who hold up the honor of military service, the atmosphere toward women in general had not changed.

The military is morally obligated to stop the systemwide mistreatment of women in its ranks, but that change will not be made until it is enforced from the top leadership on down. It is too big and important a job to be left to a few good men.","Military Women, Too, Should Serve Unmolested",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/opinion/military-women-molested.html

Of course there’s humor in sex-related subjects. But there should be sensitivity too, so my reporting approach didn’t waver from its normal course: Be respectful and nonjudgmental. It’s possible to be considerate, empathetic and amused at the same time.

Since custom condoms were new to America, it was challenging to find people with firsthand experience. So I asked the company to ask if any customers would allow me to contact them. Two men did, answering my questions with admirable candor.

I also wanted to find men independently. After various efforts, I heeded a sex researcher’s advice to contact a Reddit group for men who call their penises small. Some members were wary. “Who are you bro, I doubt your legitimacy,” one wrote, adding, “What articles have you written pertaining to the issues of sex and other taboo topics?” But when I described some of my stories, he replied, “Thanks for clearing my concerns up.”

Another suggested I was fishing in a shallow pond, saying that “most of us here don’t suffer from too much sex.” But several men gave unvarnished answers via private message.

When interviewing condom creators or users by phone, I found private spaces in the newsroom. Not that I was embarrassed, but conversations about penis dimensions and sex might sound startling or funny to colleagues, and I worried interview subjects might hear someone’s inadvertent chuckles.

When writing the story, my goal was to be straightforward but not racy. Sex stories have occasionally made some editors squeamish, and sometimes sexual vocabulary has been sanitized. But discussing sexual health with clarity can help people learn things they may be uncomfortable asking about. It can help remove tinges of shame or salaciousness from a basic human behavior.

In the condom context, even anodyne sentences can contain unintentional double entendres. Ron Frezieres, a longtime expert, said “there’s a lot of gymnastics involved in doing condom research.” Davin Wedel, the custom condom company president, said, about poor condom fit, “We’re trying to address it head on.”

An incorrigible punster, I tried to be corrigible, refraining (mostly) from wordplay. I did suggest the following headline — because of its high-minded allusions to Plato and Martin Luther King Jr., of course: “Will Custom-Fit Condoms Take the Measure of a Man?”

It is unclear what possessed Woody Allen, of all people, to comment on the accusations of sexual predation against Harvey Weinstein, when he could have just not said anything, not expressed sympathy for an alleged serial rapist, not accused long-silenced women who said they were sexually assaulted of contributing to “a witch hunt atmosphere” and not felt compelled to issue a pouty follow-up statement in which he didn’t apologize but, in fact, reiterated how “sad” he feels for Weinstein because Weinstein is “sick.”

I’m kidding! It’s totally clear why Allen would issue such a statement — why he wouldn’t hesitate to include the astonishing confession that “no one ever came to me or told me horror stories with any real seriousness,” implying that people did tell him about Weinstein but he, with that odd omniscience native to the very rich, deemed them insufficiently serious. It’s also totally clear why Allen felt untouchable enough to add that even if he had believed the “horror stories,” he wouldn’t have been interested, let alone concerned, because he is a serious man busy making serious man-art. He said people wouldn’t bother coming to him anyway, because, as he described it: “You’re not interested in it. You are interested in making your movie.” (That last bit is fair, actually. If I’d been sexually assaulted by Harvey Weinstein, literally my last instinct would be to go to Woody Allen for help.)

It’s clear because the cultural malfunction that allows Allen to feel comfortable issuing that statement is the same malfunction that gave us Allen and Weinstein in the first place: the smothering, delusional, galactic entitlement of powerful men.

When Allen and other men warn of “a witch hunt atmosphere, a Salem atmosphere” what they mean is an atmosphere in which they’re expected to comport themselves with the care, consideration and fear of consequences that the rest of us call basic professionalism and respect for shared humanity. On some level, to some men — and you can call me a hysteric but I am done mincing words on this — there is no injustice quite so unnaturally, viscerally grotesque as a white man being fired.

Sometimes out of fear. Sometimes out of shame. Often these men hold our professional fates in their hands.”

The California legislature has set the national agenda on a variety of issues, including the environment, immigration and taxes. Although the state has produced a number of powerful female politicians, about 80 percent of the legislature is male.

Cristina Garcia, a Democratic member of the state Assembly who signed the letter, said Tuesday she has been routinely accosted by men who harassed her and made comments about her appearance while she was trying to discuss legislation.

“Multiple people have grabbed my butt and grabbed my breasts,” she said. “We’re talking about senior lobbyists and lawmakers.”

Ms. Garcia, and the other women who came forward, did not name the lobbyists or lawmakers involved in the encounters. The letter was first published in The Los Angeles Times on Tuesday morning.

Pamela Lopez, a partner at a Sacramento lobbying firm, said that for years she has dealt with inappropriate suggestions from male officials, but the most disturbing episode came early last year, at a social gathering of lawmakers and lobbyists in a Sacramento bar.

As Ms. Lopez walked into the restroom, she said, she felt a large body pressing behind her. When she turned around, she saw that a lawmaker had locked the door behind him, had undone his pants and asked her to touch his genitals.

“He had exposed himself and begun masturbating,” she said. “All I was thinking was what do I do, what do I do. And of course, I didn’t want to cause a scene.”

“I said, ‘No, I am not going to touch you,’ ” she said. “I was firm and clear but I did not want to make a scene and he continued to masturbate and he kind of moved toward me and said, ‘Just put your hand on me.’ I said no.”

Karen Skelton, a political strategist and lawyer in Sacramento who signed the letter, said she experienced harassment firsthand when she was hired by a Fortune 500 company six years ago to run a campaign on behalf of a major legislative initiative. Her job included dealing with an elected California official involved with the issue.

“This guy did things to me like touch my leg under the table at lunch and brush back my hair over my shoulder and sending me texts at 1 in the morning asking where I was,” she said, declining to name him. “I felt creeped out.

There has been a long and notorious history of sexual misconduct in state houses and Congress going back over at least the past 50 years. Many state Capitols are famous for being old boys’ clubs. Many, including the one in Sacramento, are in relatively isolated parts of the state, away from family, friends and onlookers, in a culture marked by late-night dinners and drinking.

Albany, the New York capital, has had an outsize reputation for sexual misbehavior, exemplified by an episode in 2012 in which Assemblyman Vito J. Lopez, a powerful Brooklyn Democrat, was found to have sexually harassed female staff members. The leader of the State Assembly at the time, Sheldon Silver, was harshly criticized for keeping Mr. Lopez’s behavior, and financial settlements to victims, secret, perhaps allowing additional women to be abused. Mr. Lopez resigned in 2013, and the Assembly enacted a series of reforms, including mandatory reporting of any complaint of sexual harassment, an independent investigator and a ban on confidential settlements.

Christine Pelosi, a signer of the letter who is the leader of the California Democratic Women’s Caucus, said that legislators “act differently in Sacramento — which is almost fantasy camp — as opposed to how they act as home.”.

Anthony Rendon, the speaker of the California State Assembly, said he did not think the Assembly ethics committee, which handles charges of sexual misconduct, could launch an investigation based on the letter, because it did not mention any names of offenders. He said the Assembly had created a committee in August to establish new rules aimed at cracking down on sexual harassment or intimidation.

“The letter shows that sexual harassment is as prevalent in the Capitol as it is anywhere else in society,” Mr. Rendon said.

Samantha Corbin, a lobbyist and former legislative aide who helped organize the drive, said many of the California women who signed the letter had overcome fears of retaliation, emboldened by the women who related their stories about Mr. Weinstein in stories published by The New York Times and The New Yorker.

She said until now women had routinely engaged on quiet rescue missions to help women caught what she described as predatory situations while working in lawmakers’ offices.

“We give each other tips on how to avoid certain situation – who might exercise predatory behavior,” she said.

“You are talking about power brokers in the largest state in the country,” she said.

Ms. Pelosi, who is the daughter of Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader of the House of Representatives, said it was difficult for many of the women to sign the letter. “I understand the courage of these women – Republicans and Democrats – coming forward. It is very, very, very hard.”

Kevin de Leon, the president of the state Senate, issued a statement saying he applauded “the courage of women working in and around the Capitol who are coming forward and making their voices known.”

Mr. de Leon, who announced this week he was running for the Senate, did not say whether he was aware of these kinds of episodes and did not return a request for comment.

Scott Wiener, a newly elected member of the state Senate, said he had been struck by the culture he had found since coming to Sacramento. “The kind of sexism and misogynism that is pervasive in our culture is definitely prevalent in Sacramento,” Mr. Wiener said.

New allegations of harassment have emerged in other states in recent days, too. Teresa Tanzi, a Democratic state representative in Rhode Island, said on Tuesday that a male lawmaker who outranked her once told her “that if I want to see my bills advance, there was one thing I could do to make that happen.”

“It was stated very matter of factly that if I would have sex with this person, it would increase the likelihood of my bills passing,” Ms. Tanzi said in an interview, although she declined to name the lawmaker or specify when the comment was made.

But for Mr. Nikolaou, the project, called “…Balkaniotheque” and sponsored by the Onassis Foundation, became more than a multifaceted look at the region. It has been a search for his very identity.

“I am a Greek,” said Mr. Nikolaou, who calls both Athens and Chalkis home. “And I have multiple identities. I belong in the East, in the West, but I also belong in the Balkans. This was forgotten for Greeks. None define themselves as Balkan. I had to find myself.”

Early on, Mr. Nikolaou said the project felt like psychoanalysis, a dive into his soul and the way he learned how to feel. He became fixated on the notion of a shared, repressed Balkan identity, one that he could unearth and restore to the collective memory.

He bore witness to funerals, celebrated at weddings and made intimate connections with those who opened their homes and lives to him. That vulnerability fostered a sense of human unity that Mr. Nikolaou hopes to showcase.

“The Balkans are a place where people look so different, but they are so alike in the way they face life,” he said. “And that must be what will lead us in the future. It may seem utopian, but deep inside me I believe that all people can live without borders. Even in the war-crushed Balkans, we can. It is enough to look at what it is that unites us.

Pope Francis recently announced that he would dedicate his 2018 World Communications Day address to the topic of fake news, and the United States Congress is investigating how Russian agents manipulated Facebook and Twitter to spread false stories and stoke conspiracy theories to sway the 2016 presidential election.

But ahead of crucial Italian elections early next year, the country has become an especially fertile ground for digital deceit. Frustrated by economic woes, upset by a migrant crisis and fed a steady diet of partisan media, many Italians subscribe to all kinds of conspiracy theories. It is what they call dietrologia, the belief that there is also always something dietro, or behind, the surface.

The Italian passion for seeing intrigue — whether or not it exists — around every corner runs deep, said Alessandro Campi, a professor of political science at Perugia University. “All of this is part of the Italian cultural heritage,” he said.

A history of scheming Borgia cardinals, waves of foreign domination, papal crackdowns and corrupt governments had imbued Italians with an abiding distrust in authority, Mr. Campi said.

In recent years, this background has helped erode the standing of traditional political parties while being expertly exploited by political upstarts, insurgents and outsiders, none more so than the surging Five Star Movement and its founder, Beppe Grillo.

“I’d say that the Five Star Movement believes more than any other political party in conspiracy theories,” said Mr. Campi, an editor of “Conspiracies and Plots — From Machiavelli to Beppe Grillo.”

“It’s not only a tactic,” Mr. Campi said of the movement, which has succeeded in attracting votes from the left and the right with an ideologically ambiguous form of populism. “It’s their political worldview.”

Nicola Biondo, a former chief of communications for the Five Star Movement, said that for the party, spreading conspiracies was akin to a policy.

“They use the term Great Powers, never specifying who those powers are,” said Mr. Biondo, who has recently written a book, “Supernova: How Five Star Was Killed,” with another party defector. “It is a mantra.”

Ms. Boldrini, sponsor of the new student curriculum, asserts that the web cannot be forfeited to the fringes, and that the government must teach the next generation of Italian voters how to defend themselves against falsehoods and conspiracy theories designed to play on their fears.

She said she had included Google and Facebook in the project in an acknowledgment that virtual space is where many young Italians live.

Nevertheless, she expressed skepticism in particular about Facebook’s commitment to reining in fake news and hate speech, and recognized the possibility that the Italian school project provided the embattled giant with a much-needed public relations boon.

Facebook was quick to applaud the program. Laura Bononcini, chief of public policy for Facebook in Italy, Greece and Malta, said on Tuesday that “the program is part of an international effort. Education and media literacy are a crucial part of our effort to curb the spread of false news, and collaboration with schools is pivotal.”

Ms. Boldrini also noted that Facebook was contributing by promoting the initiative through targeted ads to high-school-age users, and she said she hoped that the program, which aimed to show students how their “likes” were monetized and politicized, could become a “pilot program” for Facebook throughout Europe.

But some of the Italian course load seems unrealistic. While some tips are useful, such as keeping an eye out for parody URLs, students are also called upon to reach out to experts to verify news stories, essentially asking the students to re-report articles.

The program seeks to deputize students as fake-news hunters, showing them how to create their own blogs or social accounts to expose false stories and “showing how you uncovered it.”

In Italy, that gives them a lot of ground to cover.

For months here, conspiracy theorists who reject scientific consensus have connected vaccinations to medical conditions including autism in children, often blaming pharmaceutical companies as a dark force behind the medical practice. It was an issue that struck a nerve in Italy and played right into the wheelhouse of the Five Star Movement’s distrust of expertise and authority.

In May, amid a measles outbreak, Italy strengthened its vaccination requirements for school-age children, prompting so-called No-Vax activists to protest outside the Italian Parliament for the right to choose.

The vaccination opponents were especially strong in the Five Star Movement, whose leader, Mr. Grillo, once attacked vaccines as a scam by pharmaceutical companies with the intention of “weakening children’s immune systems.”

His wildly popular blog has alleged that some vaccines “can kill,” and websites, such as La Fucina, run by another party leader, Davide Casaleggio, have published anti-vaccine reports.

(In the past, other sites associated with Mr. Casaleggio or Mr. Grillo have also carried sensational reports by Russian-backed news outlets that were deemed false and damaging to the movement’s political enemies.)

“It’s what the pharmaceutical companies do, and it’s questionable,” said Paola Barile, 65, as she stood with a Five Star Movement flag wrapped around her shoulders at a protest last week in front of Parliament. “The spell has been broken for us also on vaccines.”

At the same rally, Five Star activists screamed “shame” and railed against the political parties, right and left, for joining forces to draft a new electoral law they considered (maybe correctly this time) designed to keep the movement out of power.

But the Five Star Movement is not the only political force to have profited from fake news, and students are not the only ones who can be deceived by it.

Last weekend, Gian Marco Centinaio, a senator from the Northern League, a right-leaning party, acknowledged that he had put on Facebook a post, subsequently shared 18,000 times, of a picture of a man identified as Ms. Boldrini’s brother, and complained how the news programs “don’t cover” the man’s no-show job that paid 47,000 euros, or more than $55,000, a month.

In November 1793, one month after Marie Antoinette was beheaded, the revolutionary national assembly declared the Louvre Palace, Louis XIV’s former residence on the Right Bank of the Seine, open to the public. All citizens were welcomed to enjoy the national art treasures stored there, previously for the pleasure of the golden carriage set only.

Called the Central Museum of the Arts of the Republic, the people’s musée took the democratic ideal a step further. Any professional, amateur or aspiring painter was invited to enter the museum, set up an easel — provided free of charge to this day — and have a go at copying a masterpiece.

Thousands have since followed suit. Among them are such art history boldfaced names as Paul Cézanne, Edgar Degas, Marc Chagall, Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dalí. The goal for them, and the present-day copyists whom Mr. Guilbert photographed for Le Parisien Magazine, is to learn the secrets of color, technique and composition by copying the works of some of the greatest artists of all time. “It’s like a free school,” says Mr. Guilbert.

“You have to copy and recopy the masters,” Degas once said, “and it’s only after having proved oneself as a good copyist that you can reasonably try to do a still life of a radish.”

The ambitions of the copyists Mr. Guilbert photographed went well beyond fruits and vegetables. Marius Allier, a 26-year-old graduate of the School of Fine Arts in Paris, drew crowds as he tackled Eugène Delacroix’s “Women of Algiers (in their Apartment).” The 1834 painting presents challenges that have made it long popular among copyists, including Picasso, who later painted his own variations in the 1950s.

Catherine Balpe, an amateur painter, copied Theodore Chasseriau’s 1843 portrait, “The Two Sisters,” as a gift for her husband. Sam Rachamin journeyed from his home in Israel to render his copy of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres’s 1808 painting, “The Bather.”

Mr. Martin, 58, is a professional painter — but of houses, not canvases. A self-taught artist who paints using an easel and much smaller brushes when he’s not climbing ladders, copied “View of Pirna from the Sonnenstein Castle” by the Italian artist Bernardo Bellotto.

Though the Louvre, unlike other leading museums, does not charge copyists for the privilege, applicants can wait up to two years for one of the 250 permits the museum issues annually. Valid for three months, it allows them to work in the museum’s galleries from 9:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. most days, except Sundays and holidays, from September through June.

Tourists and other museum visitors can bring cameras into the Louvre and take pictures. But because Mr. Guilbert planned to shoot for publication, he applied for, and received permission to spend three days in the galleries with the copyists. “For me, the assignment was like a romantic experience,” he says.

With the Louvre’s magnificent interior architecture enhancing the composition of his shots, Mr. Guilbert chose to use the same light that illuminates the masterworks, to strong effect. “I never used a flash,” he says. “It’s most interesting to work with what you’re given.”

Finished with their copies, Mssrs. Martin and Wald, a photographer who copied Agnolo Bronzino’s “Portrait of a Man Holding a Statuette,” met with Isabelle Vieilleville, director of the Louvre’s copy office. To guard against forgeries, she checked that the two copyists had used canvases that were one-fifth smaller or larger than the original, and that the original artists’ signatures were not reproduced on the copies. Then she stamped the backs of the canvases with a Louvre seal, added her own signature and escorted them from the museum.

On the train, masterworks in hand, they drew little more than a double take or two. “The Metro is like the subway in New York,” Mr. Guilbert said. “There was not really much reaction from the other passengers. They have seen it all.”

This is such a fascinating moment for a revival. What took so long?

Over the last couple decades, I’ve been reluctant to do it. How do you do it again and at least hope for an impact that maybe is comparable? “Butterfly,” I think, successfully addressed some issues in the culture in its first iteration. It would be really nice if there was a way to feel similarly resonant with the culture today.

I feel like it anticipated what we now call intersectionality, this notion that issues like sexual orientation and gender identity and sexism and racism are all interrelated. So I feel good about that.

You worry about cultural impact rather than “Can we get a production of the same caliber?”

I think the two are related. Part of the reason “M. Butterfly” worked the first time around is because I was collaborating with a director who really understood how to use the theater. When [the producer] Nelle Nugent and I started talking about Julie Taymor, that was a really exciting notion.

Because her visual sense is so acute, I sometimes feel she doesn’t get enough credit for the degree to which she is fundamentally focused on story and character. Julie was asking a lot of questions about the text. She wanted to make sure that I was clear about what Song’s motivations were and Song’s point of view as well as Gallimard’s, because so much of the show is taken from Gallimard’s point of view.

Did that make you want to clarify things in the text?

Coming back to it now, it’s still not a docudrama, but there were aspects to the real story which we both felt could complicate the story in an interesting way and also bring out more strongly, I hope, Song’s point of view and Song’s experience in that relationship. And that led to going back into the text. I wasn’t sure, because it’s a play that’s very much associated with me and it was successful the first time around and did I really want to mess with it. But I really loved going back and reacquainting myself with those characters.

The dilemmas that they’re dealing with continue to be a lot of core issues that I face as a writer, whether they have to do with questions of identity or the fluidity of that identity, how the way we perceive ourselves changes given our social context changing. That’s the soil that I like to till.

Photo

How does now feel different from then, in terms of where we are as a culture?

I think the complexities of gender, our culture is much more aware of those, and different gender expressions. But we clearly are still caught in a kind of toxic masculinity that not only affects the relations between men and women but even, more explicitly now, affects our political decisions and particularly the way that we as a nation try to deal with the world.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

In the play, both the new and the old versions, Gallimard falls into a relationship with an Asian woman who he believes to be sort of submissive and extrapolates from that how the West should deal with the East politically. Today, when we have a president who feels that the way to deal with North Korea or Muslim countries or whatever is by being tougher and more abrasively masculine, that feels to me incredibly consistent with the story “M. Butterfly” is trying to tell.

And the notion of male dominance over women as a manifestation of true masculinity is certainly very much in our current discourse and very much part of the play.

Does it make any difference to have a female director on a play that’s so much about male and female identity?

I certainly didn’t want to work with Julie Taymor because she’s a female director. That said, I’m aware of the degree to which I can only see the world through my point of view, and it’s really helpful when I want to know what the other points of view are. For instance, if Julie’s telling me that the minor female characters don’t seem as expressively developed, I think that’s really useful to know.

Did she say that?

Umm, she might have said that.

How old were you when you wrote “M. Butterfly”?

When it opened, I was 30. So I probably wrote it when I was 28, maybe?

Photo

There are things about the original that were shocking in its time, and I don’t think a lot of those things are particularly shocking nowadays. That provides an opportunity to go back in and look at these characters even more as fully formed human beings, as opposed to being kind of overwhelmed by the surprise and the shock of the story.

How different is it?

There’s a lot of tweaking of specifics in order to create more three-dimensionality, create more nuance, enrich the love story and try to balance out the Song and Gallimard points of view a little.

One specific example: Shi Pei Pu, who was the actual spy, played in a Chinese opera called “Butterfly Lovers.” “Butterfly Lovers” is nowadays a very popular Chinese story. It also is about gender confusion. So we have kind of incorporated an awareness of “Butterfly Lovers” into this version of the story.

What impact did the success of “M. Butterfly” have on Asian-American representation in the theater?

I think it meant something that there, (A), was a play by an Asian-American author on Broadway and, (B), that it was successful. Has that led to the gates being opened over the past 30 years? Not really. For a long time, I continued to be the only Asian-American author that was ever done on Broadway.

There’s been a big explosion of Asian-American playwrights and talent Off Broadway and in the regions. In general, Broadway continues to be not inclusive in a way that represents the population. It is just a good business model to begin to diversify both the faces and the stories that exist in the theater — as TV is starting to learn.

Did you expect progress to move faster in the wider culture?

I expected it to move faster over the last 20 years, and I’m kind of encouraged by the degree to which the pace has picked up over the last, say, three to four years. It feels like maybe there’s a tipping point going on.",New Flight for a New ‘Butterfly’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/theater/new-flight-for-a-new-butterfly.html

With economy, a bit of gauzy nostalgia and likable performances, it revisits an early episode from the life of Thurgood Marshall, the civil rights lawyer who became the first African-American to hold a seat on the Supreme Court. From the 1940s to the early ’60s, he argued 32 cases before the court, winning most. “Sometimes history takes things into its own hands,” Marshall once said, but he also regularly gave history a shove.

“Marshall” isn’t about the famous cases that he argued in front of the court, including the history-making Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, which led the court to declare racially segregated public schools unconstitutional. Instead, the movie focuses on a 1941 case involving Eleanor Strubing, a wealthy white woman from Greenwich, Conn., who accused her black chauffeur and butler, Joseph Spell, of raping her and then pushing her off a bridge. After hours of questioning, Spell confessed. The racist reactions to the charges, which invoked the dangerous Jim Crow stereotype of the ravaging black man, caught the notice of N.A.A.C.P., which sent Marshall to the rescue.

Jauntily self-possessed, the movie’s Thurgood (Chadwick Boseman) rides in like a cavalry of one, taking the measure of the town and its escalating tension. He’s soon joined by another lawyer, Sam Friedman (Josh Gad), a button-down type who reluctantly joins the defense and reasonably fears the attention it will bring. The pair’s introduction immediately sets the alpha and beta tag-team dynamic: Thurgood casually asks for a hand with his bags, and Sam ends up carrying the load. The scene telegraphs the shifting power dynamics Thurgood represents, but it also announces that the movie will resort to easy, ingratiating comedy to sell the goods.

Video

Seamlessly directed by Reginald Hudlin from a script by the father-and-son team of Michael and Jacob Koskoff, the movie primarily involves Thurgood’s strategy to free Joseph. Part of what made the case important to the N.A.A.C.P., as the scholar Daniel J. Sharfstein has written, was that it took place in the North instead of the South, where the organization was fighting on multiple fronts. In the 1930s, the activist W.E.B. Du Bois argued that the idea that there was no prejudice in the North was a fable. “The difference between North and South in the matter of segregation,” he wrote in 1934, “is largely a difference of degree.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

“Marshall” takes up that refrain both in its restaging of the trial and through the evolution of Thurgood and Sam’s slow-warming relationship. As the case comes into focus, Joseph (Sterling K. Brown) and Eleanor (Kate Hudson) take their opposing seats, the jury troops in, and the nasty judge (James Cromwell) starts snarling. Thurgood rapidly takes the lead while slyly poking and strategically prodding Sam to rise to the occasion. Thurgood and Sam banter, lash out, jostle for position and occasionally deliver some stink eye, especially Sam (at Thurgood). Like his character, Mr. Boseman is the star of this show, while Mr. Gad is the second banana and often comic relief. Both performers are natural showmen who never step on each other’s moment; they’re fun to watch.

It’s all a bit too much fun at times. The chuckles and legal-eagle bromance make the difficult, disturbing story flow easily, but there are moments when you wish that Mr. Hudlin would ease up on the comedy. Sam, in particular, occasionally comes uncomfortably close to a being a caricature, one of those bespectacled, emasculated types who need a kick in the pants, a sock in the jaw, so they can man up. The broadness of the characterizations is of a piece with the movie’s anxious rhythms and relentless forward drive. These may be a function of the clock running out on Joseph, along with a desire to entertain. But there’s little reflective or quiet time with the characters, these men of righteous action who chase clues before swooping into court and history.","Review: In ‘Marshall,’ a Legal Pioneer Gives History a Shove",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/movies/marshall-review-chadwick-boseman.html

But Mr. Trump’s remarks have drawn angry rebukes from allies of the former president because his claims about Mr. Obama are false — he called or met with relatives of multiple fallen service members. Former military commanders, for their part, said Mr. Trump was politicizing one of the saddest and most sacred duties of the presidency.

Mr. Obama invited Mr. Kelly and his wife, Karen, to a breakfast for Gold Star families — those who have lost children in combat — at the White House in May 2011. The couple were seated at a table with the first lady, Michelle Obama. At the time, Mr. Kelly was the senior military assistant to Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta.

Mr. Kelly has not addressed the dispute. But colleagues who worked with him at the Pentagon during that period said they did not recall him expressing unhappiness with the way Mr. Obama handled the death of his son. In a statement issued shortly after Lieutenant Kelly’s death, Mr. Kelly and his wife noted that “the nation he served has honored us with promoting him posthumously to first lieutenant of Marines.”

Other military commanders noted that neither Mr. Obama nor President George W. Bush routinely called the families of fallen soldiers because that would have been logistically impossible. It could also raise questions about why one family merited a call but another did not.

“It’s been my observation in all the years I’ve been in the military that all presidents, as commander in chief, feel an enormous sense of loss and compassion and pain about those who are killed under their command,” said Jack Keane, a retired four-star Army general. “How they express that is entirely up to them, and I think we should respect that.”

Referring to Mr. Trump’s predecessors, Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said on Twitter: “POTUS 43 & 44 and first ladies cared deeply, worked tirelessly for the serving, the fallen, and their families. Not politics. Sacred Trust.”

Other former Obama officials castigated Mr. Trump for what they said was a cynical mischaracterization of Mr. Obama’s record, which included regular visits to Dover Air Force Base to greet the coffins of returning forces, pilgrimages to Arlington National Cemetery and visits to wounded troops at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.

“Stop the damn lying — you’re the President,” former Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. wrote on Twitter. “I went to Dover AFB with 44 and saw him comfort the families of both the fallen military & DEA.”

When Mr. Trump made the comparison to Mr. Obama and other former presidents at a news conference on Monday, he dialed back his initial assertion that Mr. Obama did not call the families of fallen service members when a reporter asked him about it again.

“President Obama, I think, probably did sometimes and maybe sometimes he didn’t,” Mr. Trump said, standing in the Rose Garden alongside Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader. “That’s what I was told. All I can do is ask my generals.”

On Tuesday, it became clear that Mr. Trump’s source was Mr. Kelly, a former commander of the military’s Southern Command, whom he recruited in July from the Department of Homeland Security to serve as chief of staff. Officials credit Mr. Kelly with imposing discipline on an unruly West Wing staff and on how information is given to the president.

As a wartime commander, Mr. Kelly led troops in intense combat in western Iraq. In 2003, he became the first Marine colonel since 1951 to be promoted to brigadier general while in active combat.

The death of Mr. Kelly’s son may have played a role in his selection to the cabinet. During the transition, people close to Mr. Trump said he wanted people on his national security team who understood personally the hazards of sending Americans into battle.

But Mr. Kelly has been reluctant to discuss his son. He asked the hosts of the eulogy he gave, in St. Louis in 2010, not to mention Lieutenant Kelly when they introduced him.

Asked about his son on Memorial Day in an interview on Fox & Friends, Mr. Kelly, his voice choking, replied, “Finest guy.”

“Wonderful guy. Wonderful husband. Wonderful son. Wonderful brother. Brave beyond all get out,” he added. “His men still correspond with us. They still mourn him as we do.”",Top General’s Grief Becomes Political Talking Point for Trump,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/us/politics/john-kelly-trump-fallen-troops.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

Mr. Price became a bit player in the Weinstein story when Rose McGowan, an actress who had reached a settlement with Mr. Weinstein in 1997 after an episode at a film festival, posted a series of tweets directed at Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon. In them, Ms. McGowan said she had told the head of Amazon Studios that Mr. Weinstein had raped her. (Ms. McGowan did not mention Mr. Price by name and did not respond to a message on Twitter asking for clarification.)

Before that series of tweets, Ms. McGowan had directed a Twitter message at Mr. Price concerning Mr. Weinstein, asking, “Remember when I told you not to do a deal with him and why?”

Mr. Price, a Harvard alumnus who once worked at the consulting firm McKinsey & Company, had been an executive at Amazon for the last 13 years. He oversaw several TV shows, including “Transparent” and “The Man in the High Castle.”

Amazon’s original programming has not gotten the same buzz as Netflix shows like “Stranger Things” or Hulu’s “The Handmaid’s Tale,” which won an Emmy last month in the best drama category. Amazon was already in the process of trying out a new game plan for its original programming by time Mr. Price was suspended.

On his watch, Amazon distributed the Oscar-winning film “Manchester by the Sea,” and made itself into a force on the film festival circuit. The recent New York Film Festival opened with an Amazon-financed film, Richard Linklater’s “Last Flag Flying”; featured an Amazon coproduction, Todd Haynes’s “Wonderstruck,” as its “centerpiece” attraction; and closed with the Amazon-distributed “Wonder Wheel,” the latest from Woody Allen. The red-carpet portion of the “Wonder Wheel” premiere was canceled on Saturday, two days after Amazon announced Mr. Price’s suspension.

In Iraq, where the group that became the Islamic State took root, security officials are bracing for future waves of suicide attacks against civilians. And even if governments are able to head off organized plots like the Paris attacks of 2015, officials around the globe concede that they have almost no way of stopping lone wolf assaults inspired or enabled by Islamic State propaganda that lives online.

“It is clear that we are contending with an intense U.K. terrorist threat from Islamist extremists,” Andrew Parker, the director of Britain’s MI5 intelligence service, said in a speech on Tuesday. “That threat is multidimensional, evolving rapidly, and operating at a scale and pace we’ve not seen before.”

American and European counterterrorism officials acknowledge that they do not know the exact capabilities the Islamic State retains, or how much the appeal of the group’s ideology has been dented by its string of heavy military defeats.

Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, predicted last month that the loss of territory would precipitate a loss of credibility. “We’ll continue to see reduction in territory, reduction in freedom of movement, reduced resources and less credibility in the narrative,” he told a Senate hearing.

Others are less sanguine. They point to a speech by the Islamic State spokesman Abu Muhammed al-Adnani, before his death in an American drone strike last year, urging the group’s followers to fight on as a lean, agile insurgency instead of the bureaucratic juggernaut it had become.

But for Mr. Nikolaou, the project, called “…Balkaniotheque” and sponsored by the Onassis Foundation, became more than a multifaceted look at the region. It has been a search for his very identity.

“I am a Greek,” said Mr. Nikolaou, who calls both Athens and Chalkis home. “And I have multiple identities. I belong in the East, in the West, but I also belong in the Balkans. This was forgotten for Greeks. None define themselves as Balkan. I had to find myself.”

Early on, Mr. Nikolaou said the project felt like psychoanalysis, a dive into his soul and the way he learned how to feel. He became fixated on the notion of a shared, repressed Balkan identity, one that he could unearth and restore to the collective memory.

“I wish to describe the Balkan soul,” he said. “Which seems to be dark and intractable, but it becomes simple, warm and human when it flames up.”

Mr. Nikolaou said he allowed the places to which he journeyed to choose him, not the other way around. In his travels, he’s been to nearly a dozen countries, exploring bustling capital cities as well as Roma ghettos and mountain villages.

“I made more than 20 trips trying not just to take photos, but to feel the Balkan reality,” he said. “To see those deep characteristics of the Balkan people that I believe are common all over the peninsula.”

The Balkan people were very hospitable, Mr. Nikolaou said, though he preferred to stay in the remote, rural areas. “There I met the most important people,” he said. “People totally free from the stress of our civilization. People with pain in their eyes but firstly, with big, big heart.”

He bore witness to funerals, celebrated at weddings and made intimate connections with those who opened their homes and lives to him. That vulnerability fostered a sense of human unity that Mr. Nikolaou hopes to showcase.

“The Balkans are a place where people look so different, but they are so alike in the way they face life,” he said. “And that must be what will lead us in the future. It may seem utopian, but deep inside me I believe that all people can live without borders. Even in the war-crushed Balkans, we can. It is enough to look at what it is that unites us. And what unites us is more important than what keeps us divided.”

In addition to her son Stephen, also an author, Mrs. Schlesinger is survived by another son, Andrew, an author and documentarian; a daughter, Christina Schlesinger, an artist; three grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.
(Mr. Schlesinger moved to New York City.)
As a centenarian raised in an opinionated family of four daughters and a son, Mrs. Schlesinger considered feminism nothing novel.","On a three-month grand tour of Europe by car when she was 17, she and family members, including her mother and three sisters, paid a visit in Paris to Alice B. Toklas, who had been a classmate of her mother’s at Radcliffe before becoming known as the American expatriate partner of Gertrude Stein.

Marian Cannon also went to Radcliffe, graduating in 1934, and as a graduation gift her parents sent her, alone, across the country and by ship to China — 10,000 miles altogether — when she was barely 22.

“Early on I decided being a painter was what I wanted to be, but I wanted to be a lot of other things too,” she told The Atlantic in 2013. “I wanted to write. I wanted to play tennis. I wanted to have a lot of friends. I wanted to have a lot of beaus.

“I think I’ve been very lucky. But I think that I’ve made some of it for myself. I never gave up. I wanted it all, in other words, and I think I really almost got it all too.”

She said she credited her independence in part to her mother, whose advice to her children was: “It doesn’t really matter if your house is that dirty. Go ahead and do your thing.” (“Of course,” Mrs. Schlesinger added, her mother “did have a nice maid who came in every day.”)

She met Arthur Schlesinger Jr. in her parents’ living room when he was a college junior. They married in 1940. The son of a Harvard professor, he became one, too, as well as a widely read historian.

It wasn’t long before she was also introduced to a young Massachusetts congressman, John F. Kennedy, who was contemplating a Senate race. He impressed her, despite an ethnic bias that she said she had inherited from her mother, who carped that “the Irish make the political villains too attractive for defeat.”

“I guess I partook of the atmosphere of the times,” Mrs. Schlesinger wrote in her memoir “I Remember: A Life of Politics, Painting and People” (2011), published when she was 99. “It was an unthinking and deplorable prejudice. So when this attractive, well-bred, sophisticated young man came in, I was completely unprepared. I think it was at that moment that whatever prejudice was left in me melted away.”

She wrote of Kennedy: “He had for me the somewhat dubious air of a young man who had wandered into a nest of pure-minded intellectuals, who, as far as he was concerned, spouted nonsense and foolish chitchat. The next time I met him the intellectuals were falling all over him.”

Her husband among them.

When Mr. Schlesinger endorsed Kennedy in 1960 for the Democratic presidential nomination, she not only stuck with her idol, Gov. Adlai E. Stevenson of Illinois, who was also running, but also said so publicly — prompting Kennedy’s brother Robert to complain to Mr. Schlesinger, “Can’t you control your own wife — or are you like me?”

In his 1965 book about the Kennedy administration, “A Thousand Days,” Mr. Schlesinger, who had been the president’s special assistant, “imparted to the now-emerging legend of Camelot a historian’s imprimatur,” Richard Aldous, a Bard College historian and Mr. Schlesinger’s biographer, wrote this month in Boston Review.

Mrs. Schlesinger was considerably more equivocal about the Kennedys. In a 1980 oral history for the Kennedy Library in Boston, she described them as a self-centered crew who treated people who worked for them as “courtiers” and whose legacy included “lives that were wrecked.”

“There was a roller-coaster atmosphere in those years,” she recalled in “I Remember.”

“One felt that the administration reveled in crisis, and there were plenty of crises, some genuine and some invented for their own sake,” she wrote. “I had a curious feeling that great decisions were made in an almost frivolous way, like the Bay of Pigs fiasco, which from my remote perch seemed to have been run by a bunch of hubris-mad teenagers, mostly Yale boys, who dominated the Central Intelligence Agency and who looked upon the Cuban enterprise and the catastrophe rather like a Harvard-Yale game they would win next time.”

Marian Cannon was born on Sept. 13, 1912, in Franklin, N.H., where her parents had a vacation home, and grew up in Cambridge. Her father, Walter Bradford Cannon, a prominent Harvard Medical School physiologist, coined the term “fight or flight” to describe the nervous system’s response to a threat. Her mother, Cornelia James Cannon, was a successful novelist and feminist who expressed concern that unrestricted immigration would dilute America’s old stock.

Before she married, in 1940, Marian spent a year in China living with her sister Wilma Cannon Fairbank and Wilma’s husband, John King Fairbank, who became an eminent historian of China at Harvard.

In addition to her son Stephen, also an author, Mrs. Schlesinger is survived by another son, Andrew, an author and documentarian; a daughter, Christina Schlesinger, an artist; three grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. Another daughter, Katherine Kinderman, a writer and producer, died in 2004.

After the divorce, Mrs. Schlesinger left Washington to return to Cambridge, where she painted, wrote and illustrated five children’s books and published another reminiscence, “Snatched From Oblivion: A Cambridge Memoir” (1979). (Mr. Schlesinger moved to New York City.)

That is why, in 1582, Pope Gregory XIII ordered that everyone stop messing around and use one calendar. Even then, the later a country switched over, the more days had to be dropped in order to stay in sync with the vernal equinox and the winter solstice. This resulted in a lot of confusion for a while, including the month of September 1752 in North America, which looked like this and which children across the continent still whisper about as “The Best Start to the School Year Ever.”

Appreciating Bush a little more, in this specific way, could offer some reason for optimism about the right.
What’s the matter with the Republican Party?","The success of Donald Trump’s populist candidacy seemed like a partial repudiation of this Randian turn, and a possible return to the middle-class-focused politics that had made Reagan and Bush successful — albeit in a more aggressively nationalist and mercantilist form. But as president, Trump has essentially become the Frankian caricature in full, draping the rhetoric of populism over an agenda that so far offers little or nothing to the middle class, making appeals to the religious right that are notable in their cynicism, and rallying his base through culture-war controversies distinguished mostly by their ginned-up phoniness.

So “What’s the Matter With Kansas?” was a poor guide to the party of Reagan and George W. Bush, but thus far it is a very useful guide to the Trump administration. And two possible takeaways from this shift seem worth considering.

The first is that, for all its failures, not everything about the Bush era was disastrous, and there were ways in which the Bush White House had a clearer sense of what conservatism should offer to the common man than any its would-be successors have come up with since.

This doesn’t excuse the disaster of Iraq or the various problems with Bush’s domestic agenda, including the way that one of his middle-class-friendly policies, the push for homeownership, contributed to the housing bubble and the crash. But it is still a mistake for the right to dismiss the Bush agenda as merely “a failure and a fraud,” as my friend Peter Suderman did recently in these pages, and also a mistake for liberals to suggest that Trump is just returning to the Bush playbook, as New York’s Jonathan Chait did in a recent piece.

Because he’s not really returning to it; indeed, as things stand in key respects Trump would benefit from imitating Bush. His tax plan offers much less to working Americans than did the Bush tax cuts. His larger agenda is much less thought-through than what Bush attempted in his first term. And if Trump wants to make his populism something more than just a con, he probably has to start with an issue — the child tax credit — that was part of both the Bush agenda and the Contract With America.

Appreciating Bush a little more, in this specific way, could offer some reason for optimism about the right. After all his administration was not that long ago, its record suggests that conservatism doesn’t have to be a mix of Randianism and racial resentment, and there’s no necessary reason that Republicans couldn’t learn important lessons from Bush’s failures (don’t try to build democracies in the Middle East, don’t pass an immigration increase your base doesn’t want, etc.) while also returning to his politically effective focus on the middle class.

But if you prefer pessimism, you’ll dwell instead on the second takeaway from Thomas Frank’s Trump-era vindication — namely, that a depressing percentage of American conservatives seem perfectly happy with the bargain that Frank claimed defined their party, with a president who ignores their economic interests and public policy more generally and offers instead the perpetual distraction of Twitter feuds and pseudo-patriotic grandstanding.

This dispiriting contentment is the sentiment you see from some of Trump’s blue-collar supporters, who love his uncouth rhetorical war on his fellow coastal elites so much that they’re willing to forgive him his threadbare policy agenda or else trust that gridlock and inertia will protect them from Republican bills whose actual contents they might probably oppose.

It’s also what you see from a segment of religious conservatives, like those gathered at last week’s Values Voters Summit, who cheered rapturously for an empty, strutting nationalism and a president who makes a mockery of the remoralized culture that they claim to seek.

Note that I don’t mean the religious conservatives who supported Trump reluctantly and in a transactional spirit, and who welcome his conservative judicial nominees. I mean those who plainly prefer his brutish braggart’s style to the sort of public decency that Bush or, in a different way, Mitt Romney offered — and who either spin elaborate fantasies about Trump the Christian or laud him as a Conan-esque warlord they think will drive their enemies before them.

For these Trump-besotted believers, you get the sense that the Bush administration’s attempts to devise a substantial socially conservative agenda, from bioethics to marriage promotion to faith-based initiatives and more, are remembered not for being timorous, limited or flawed (all of which they were) but for being simply boring. Far better to have a president who really sticks it to those overpaid babies in the N.F.L. and makes the liberals howl with outrage — that’s what a real and fighting conservatism should be all about!

What’s the matter with the Republican Party? Many things, but right now above all this: Far too many Trump supporters, far too many conservatives, have seen the then-inaccurate caricature that Frank painted 13 years ago brought to blaring, Technicolor life by Trump — and they’ve decided to become part of the caricature themselves, become exactly what their enemies and critics said they were, become a movement of plutocrats and grievance-mongers with an ever-weaker understanding of the common good.

The path out of caricature requires a different moral vision. It requires new ideas and new thinking and new models of leadership. But it also requires looking backward, to Bush and Reagan, to a Republicanism that had a thousand flaws but also understood a few important things Trump’s party has deliberately forgotten.",What’s the Matter With Republicans?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/opinion/whats-the-matter-with-republicans.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Crew catalog, a skill he had honed running Popular Merchandise.

He would often write a kind of introduction to each catalog, setting the issue’s theme. A favorite one, headlined “A Tradition of Artful Simplicity,” ran in the spring 1989 catalog and epitomized the company’s aspirational-Brahmin sensibility:

“For Kennebunk to Nantucket, Narragansett Bay to Amagansett, and points South and West, here’s a J. Crew vision of sober but resonant color, rugged, sensuous fabric, and dedication to meaningful detail.”

Mr. Cinader was known as an exacting manager who toiled over his copy and had little tolerance for imperfection. An industry consultant once recalled to The Times that Mr. Cinader had sent an underling’s work back several times because the staples on the pages weren’t straight.

In the late 1980s, after a run of what Mr. Cinader described as “explosive” growth, the company began opening its own retail stores, a sometimes treacherous transition that had been the undoing of other catalog businesses. J. Crew opened its first store at the South Street Seaport in Manhattan, followed by stores in San Francisco, Chestnut Hill, Mass., and other places.

The segue proved successful, and by the mid-’90s the company had several dozen stores collectively generating revenue in excess of $500 per square foot, an enviable performance for a specialty apparel retailer at the time. Among its rivals, J. Crew was also relatively early in establishing an effective internet presence.

Mr. Cinader delighted in the company’s ability to capture the popular imagination, as demonstrated by its occasional appearance in New Yorker cartoons. He particularly enjoyed one titled “The Love Song of J. Alfred Crew,” Roz Chast’s parody of a T. S. Eliot poem. (“I grow old … I grow old … I shall wear the bottoms of my relaxed-fit, button-fly, size-38, in Wheat, trousers rolled.”)

In 1997, the Cinaders sold 88 percent of the company for roughly a half-billion dollars to the private equity firm Texas Pacific Group, which planned to scale up its modest retail presence. Mr. Cinader retired while Ms. Scott, his daughter, stayed on as chairwoman for several years.

The success of the company owed much to Mr. Cinader and Ms. Scott’s scrupulous focus on their target demographic: affluent, high-achieving people who wanted to signal a certain pedigree with their fashion choices, but not one so stuffy that they would think twice before associating with it.

Articles in the business press over the years have described J. Crew’s niche as one notch below Ralph Lauren and one notch above retailers like Gap or the Limited.

While the company’s first catalog featured photographs from the Weld Boathouse at Harvard, J. Crew marketed itself to the man or woman who might have attended any college or university and simply wanted to evoke a hint of the Ivy League.

The models in J. Crew catalogs “were definitely preppy,” said Richard Jaffe, a longtime retail industry analyst who followed the company.

“These are people with perfect teeth, jumping into water, climbing off sailboats,” he added. “It was a very aspirational lifestyle.”

After its purchase, the company expanded rapidly and, with Ms. Scott sidelined, stumbled. Sales per square foot slumped, and the company churned through several chief executives.

Finally, in 2003, J. Crew hired Millard Drexler, who had helped chart Gap’s success during the previous two decades, to lead it. Mr. Drexler bet on more expensive fabrics and gradually incorporated more inventive, high-fashion elements. The company rebounded and went public in 2006.

Still, J. Crew has struggled in recent years amid changing demographics and consumer tastes. While Michelle Obama’s occasional appearances in J. Crew sweaters and skirts appeared to affirm the company’s position as the de facto clothier of the middle-aged meritocracy, millennial consumers were seeking more distinctiveness in their attire.

“Instead of a wardrobe you wear to work, wear to play, wear to go out at night, the younger generation is able to deal with one wardrobe,” Mr. Jaffe said. “The last thing you want to do if you buy one sweater this year is look like everyone else.”

The company announced that J. Crew sales decreased by 7 percent to about $443 million in the second quarter of this fiscal year. As of late August, it operated 274 J. Crew retail stores.

Arthur Cinader was born on Sept. 8, 1927, in New York City to Mitchell and Sarah Cinader. He attended the Bronx High School of Science before finishing high school in Arizona, where he had moved for health reasons.

He attended the University of Arizona and Yale Medical School but did not complete his studies at either school, dropping out of Yale to join his father’s company.

Mr. Cinader is survived by Ms. Scott as well as by his wife, the former Johanna van Riel; three other daughters, Martha Mimms, Maud Bryt, and Abigail Olson; a son, Arthur Jr.; and 13 grandchildren.

Mr. Cinader spent much of his retirement in Santa Fe but also traveled frequently to the Netherlands, his wife’s native country, and to New York and Washington, where he was involved with policy groups like the libertarian Cato Institute and the conservative American Enterprise Institute.","Arthur Cinader, Who Started J.

In Iraq, where the group that became the Islamic State took root, security officials are bracing for future waves of suicide attacks against civilians. And even if governments are able to head off organized plots like the Paris attacks of 2015, officials around the globe concede that they have almost no way of stopping lone wolf assaults inspired or enabled by Islamic State propaganda that lives online.

“It is clear that we are contending with an intense U.K. terrorist threat from Islamist extremists,” Andrew Parker, the director of Britain’s MI5 intelligence service, said in a speech on Tuesday. “That threat is multidimensional, evolving rapidly, and operating at a scale and pace we’ve not seen before.”

American and European counterterrorism officials acknowledge that they do not know the exact capabilities the Islamic State retains, or how much the appeal of the group’s ideology has been dented by its string of heavy military defeats.

Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, predicted last month that the loss of territory would precipitate a loss of credibility. “We’ll continue to see reduction in territory, reduction in freedom of movement, reduced resources and less credibility in the narrative,” he told a Senate hearing.

Others are less sanguine. They point to a speech by the Islamic State spokesman Abu Muhammed al-Adnani, before his death in an American drone strike last year, urging the group’s followers to fight on as a lean, agile insurgency instead of the bureaucratic juggernaut it had become.

The Celtics, minus their new star, went on to lose to the Cavaliers, 102-99.

Boston drastically revamped its roster in the off-season despite having been the top seed in the Eastern Conference in last season’s playoffs. Hayward was brought in as a free agent after seven years with the Utah Jazz, and Irving was added in a trade with the Cavaliers. The Celtics jettisoned franchise mainstays like Isaiah Thomas, Crowder and Avery Bradley.

Thomas, who had helped recruit Hayward to Boston before he was sent to Cleveland in the trade for Irving, was reported to have visited Hayward in Cleveland’s locker room while he was being evaluated by members of the medical staff from both teams. James was also reported to have visited Hayward.

Without Hayward, the Celtics fell behind by as many as 18 points, but they rallied and took a lead with less than two minutes left in the game. Down the stretch, Boston could not keep up and the Cavaliers closed the game on a 7-1 run to secure the 3-point victory. James finished the game with 29 points, 16 rebounds and 9 assists while Irving, his former teammate, had 22 points and 10 assists but missed a last-second 3-pointer that would have tied the game.

Hayward’s injury, which was reminiscent of a compound fracture that Paul George of Oklahoma City sustained during an Olympic exhibition three years ago, rendered the result of a much-anticipated game almost meaningless. The Celtics did not provide an immediate timetable for Hayward’s rehabilitation, but it figures to be a lengthy process.

Athletes and coaches from across the N.B.A. and other sports leagues reacted with horror and sympathy immediately after the injury was broadcast on television.

Asked about it before his team’s opening-night matchup against the Houston Rockets, Coach Steve Kerr of the Golden State Warriors said, “It was terrifying. The whole coaches’ office was just devastated watching it. It just shows the fragile nature of what we do.”

“It’s the greatest fireworks show in the universe,” said David Reitze of the California Institute of Technology and the executive director of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, or LIGO.

Daniel Holz, an astrophysicist at the University of Chicago and a member of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, a larger group that studies gravitational waves, said, “I can’t think of a similar situation in the field of science in my lifetime, where a single event provides so many staggering insights about our universe.”

The key to the discovery was the detection of gravitational waves, emanating like ripples in a pond vibrating the cosmic fabric, from the distant galaxy. It was a century ago that Albert Einstein predicted that space and time could shake like a bowl of jelly when massive things like black holes moved around. But such waves were finally confirmed only in 2016, when LIGO recorded the sound of two giant black holes colliding, causing a sensation that eventually led this month to a Nobel Prize.

For the researchers, this is in some ways an even bigger bonanza than the original discovery. This is the first time they have discovered anything that regular astronomers could see and study. All of LIGO’s previous discoveries have involved colliding black holes, which are composed of empty tortured space-time — there is nothing for the eye or the telescope to see.

But neutron stars are full of stuff, matter packed at the density of Mount Everest in a teaspoon. When neutron stars slam together, all kinds of things burst out: gamma rays, X-rays, radio waves. Something for everyone who has a window on the sky.

“Joy for all,” said David Shoemaker, a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who is the spokesman for the LIGO Scientific Collaboration.

This is the story of a gold rush in the sky.

It began on the morning of Aug. 17, Eastern time. Dr. Shoemaker was on a Skype call when alarms went off. One of the LIGO antennas, in Hanford, Wash., had recorded an auspicious signal and sent out an automatic alert. Twin antennas, in Washington and Livingston, Louisiana, monitor the distance between a pair of mirrors to detect the submicroscopic stretching and squeezing of space caused by a passing gravitational wave. Transformed into sound, the Hanford signal was a long 100-second chirp, that ended in a sudden whoop to 1000 cycles per second, two octaves above middle C. Such a high frequency indicated that whatever was zooming around was lighter than a black hole.

Checking the data from Livingston to find out why it had not also phoned in an alert, Dr. Shoemaker and his colleagues found a big glitch partly obscuring the same chirp.

Meanwhile, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope, which orbits Earth looking at the highest-energy radiation in the universe, recorded a brief flash of gamma rays just two seconds after the LIGO chirp. Fermi sent out its own alert. The gamma-ray burst lasted about two seconds, which put it in a category of short gamma ray bursts, which astronomers suspect are neutron stars colliding.

“When we saw that,” Dr. Shoemaker said, “the adrenaline hit.”

Dr. Kalogera, who was in Utah hiking and getting ready for August’s total solar eclipse when she got the alarm, recalled thinking: “Oh my God, this is it. This 50-year-old mystery, the holy grail, is solved.”

Together the two signals told a tale of a pair of neutron stars spiraling around each other like the blades of a kitchen blender.

But where?

Luckily the European Virgo antenna had joined the gravitational wave network only two weeks before, and it also showed a faint chirp at the same time. The fact that it was so weak allowed the group to localize the signal to a small region of the sky in the Hydra constellation that was in Virgo’s blind spot.

The hunt was on. By then Hydra was setting in the southern sky. It would be 11 hours before astronomers in Chile could take up the chase.

One of them was Ryan Foley, who was working with a team on the Swope telescope run by the Carnegie Institution on Cerro Las Campanas in Chile. His team made a list of the biggest galaxies in that region and set off to photograph them all systematically.

The fireball showed up in the ninth galaxy photographed, as a new bluish pinprick of light in the outer regions of NGC 4993, a swirl of stars about 130 million light-years from here. “These are the first optical photons from a kilonova humankind has ever collected,” Dr. Foley said.

Within 10 minutes, another group of astronomers, led by Marcelle Soares-Santos of Brandeis University and using the Dark Energy Camera, which could photograph large parts of the sky with a telescope at the nearby Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory, had also spotted the same speck of light.

Emails went flying about in the Chilean night.

When it was first identified, the fireball of 8,000-degree gas was about the size of Neptune’s orbit and radiating about 200 million times as much energy as the sun.

Nine days later, the orbiting Chandra X-ray Observatory detected X-rays coming from the location of the burst, and a week after that, the Very Large Array in New Mexico recorded radio emissions. By then the fireball faded from blue to red.

From all this, scientists have begun patching together a tentative story of what happened in the NGC 4993 galaxy.

“It’s actually surprising how well we were able to anticipate what we’re seeing,” said Brian David Metzger, a theorist at Columbia University who coined the term kilonova back in 2010.

As they tell it, the merging objects were probably survivors of stars that had been orbiting each other and had each puffed up and then died in the supernova explosions in which massive stars end their luminous lives some 11 billion years ago, according to an analysis by Dr. Kalogera. Making reasonable assumptions about their spins, these neutron stars were about 1.1 and 1.6 times as massive as the sun, smack in the known range of neutron stars.

As they approached each other swirling a thousand times a second, tidal forces bulged their surfaces outward. Quite a bit of what Dr. Metzger called “neutron star guts” were ejected and formed a fat doughnut around the merging stars.

At the moment they touched , a shock wave squeezed more material out of their polar regions, but the doughnut and extreme magnetic fields confined the material into an ultra-high-speed jet emitting a blitzkrieg of radiation, the gamma rays.",LIGO Detects Fierce Collision of Neutron Stars for the First Time,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/science/ligo-neutron-stars-collision.html

LOS ANGELES — Hollywood’s top horror factory did it again.

“Happy Death Day,” the latest microbudget movie from Blumhouse Productions, the Universal Pictures-affiliated studio behind runaway original hits like “Split” and “Get Out,” arrived to a strong $26.5 million in ticket sales in North America. That total was easily enough for No. 1.

In keeping with the Blumhouse model — find gifted but undervalued directors, give them little money but lots of creative control — “Happy Death Day” cost about $4.5 million to make and was directed by Christopher Landon. It received mostly positive reviews, amounting to a comeback for Mr. Landon, who wrote most of the “Paranormal Activity” films but had a misfire as a director in 2015 with “Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse.”

A horror comedy that mixes hints of the “Scream” movies with “Groundhog Day”-style repetition, “Happy Death Day” managed to turn out younger audiences. Universal, which distributed the film, said on Sunday that 63 percent of ticket buyers were under the age of 25.

The gay managers of that era were forthright about their sexuality, if only among friends and colleagues.
“As gay men, we have to remake ourselves in order to survive,” he said.
“It’s not like a gay man at the time could marry or enjoy a family,” Mr. Cooper said.
In the case of Mr. Epstein, Mr. Tiwary believes the message went beyond sex.","That understanding played out in memorable Rolling Stone images like David Cassidy showing off his naked torso down to his pubic hair, in a Playboy-style centerfold, and Jim Morrison smoldering next to the cover line “He’s Hot, He’s Sexy, He’s Dead.”

Jock McLean, who worked as an assistant to George Harrison 50 years ago, noticed the depth of the relationship between the Beatles and Mr. Epstein one August day not long before the manager’s death. Mr. McLean’s job was to pick up the singer-songwriter Harry Nilsson, a promising new artist in those days, and drive him to a meeting with Mr. Harrison at the house he was renting on Blue Jay Way in the Hollywood Hills, Calif.

There was talk of Mr. Nilsson perhaps joining the Beatles’ nascent company. That’s when things went sour, Mr. McLean said.

“George was talking about how wonderful the whole thing was going to be, trying to convince Harry to join the company,” Mr. McLean recalled. “It was all great until Harry said, ‘The only thing is, I don’t think I could be managed by a gay man.’” (Mr. Epstein’s sexuality was known by many in the industry at the time.)

Incensed, Mr. Harrison gave his assistant a nod.

“In a heartbeat, Harry was out of the house,” Mr. McLean said. “George, like all the Beatles, was extremely supportive of Brian. To them, Brian was the man.” (After Mr. Epstein died, Mr. Nilsson had a rapprochement with the band and worked closely with John Lennon.)

Roger Daltrey, the lead singer of the Who, had a similar respect for Mr. Lambert, who had an upper-class background at a time when those of his tier rarely interacted with working-class ruffians like Mr. Daltrey.

“Kit was the only ‘posh’ guy I ever met who wouldn’t talk down to me,” Mr. Daltrey said in “Lambert & Stamp.” “Kit had this fearless quality.”

At the time, men like Mr. Lambert had to. Up until 1967, being gay was illegal in Britain, and long after that law changed, gay men remained a target of police entrapment, blackmail and beatings. Mr. Epstein was assaulted and was the target of blackmail before he died in 1967 from an accidental overdose of sleeping pills and alcohol.

At the same time, many of these men had great power within their circle. As managers of some of the era’s most potent British rock bands, they stood at the forefront of sounds, sensibilities and styles that would demolish and remake pop culture.

The gay managers of that era were forthright about their sexuality, if only among friends and colleagues. Besides Mr. Epstein and Mr. Lambert, those men included Robert Stigwood (manager of Cream and the Bee Gees), Simon Napier-Bell (the Yardbirds, Marc Bolan), Billy Gaff (Rod Stewart), Ken Pitt (David Bowie), Barry Krost (Cat Stevens) and Larry Parnes (who molded pre-Beatles British rockers, including Tommy Steele and Billy Fury).

Photo

Their sexual orientation was mirrored by Americans including Nat Weiss (who oversaw the Beatles’ business interests and later managed James Taylor), Danny Fields (who managed Iggy Pop and the Stooges and, later, the Ramones), as well as music moguls including David Geffen and Clive Davis (who identifies as bisexual).

According to Mr. Napier-Bell, part of the reason British gay men of his era gravitated to the music business was because it was one of the few areas “where you could be out amongst yourselves. It was like a private club,” he said. “It was such a good life. You’d go to Robert Stigwood’s house and it was like a gay pub.”

Jim Fouratt, who has worked in the music industry since the 1960s, believes the men in Mr. Napier-Bell’s circle brought to the emerging rock scene a special understanding of image. “As gay men, we have to remake ourselves in order to survive,” he said. “That matches perfectly with the masquerade of rock ’n’ roll, with the fantasy.”

Martin Aston, the author of “Breaking Down the Walls of Heartache: How Music Came Out,” said the connection between rock’s gay managers and image molding stems from the fact that “gay men at the time would be judged almost entirely on how they looked. It wasn’t like there were lots of nice places to go and have lovely conversations. It was all communicated through cruising.”

As a result, Mr. Aston said, gay men developed a comfort with the art of being seen, “as opposed to straight men, who, before the phenomenon of the ‘metrosexual,’ were threatened by the notion of being looked at, of becoming an object.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Vivek Tiwary, the author of the “The Fifth Beatle,” argues that Mr. Epstein’s sexual orientation had a strong influence on the Beatles’ public image.

“Brian Epstein’s attraction to all of the Beatles, and in particular to John, allowed him to create an image for the band that was appealing not just to girls, but also to boys,” Mr. Tiwary said. “Brian knew what it was like to be a boy, as well as how to attract them. A straight manager might just think, ‘Here’s a bunch of cute boys that girls will love.’ He might make them so girl-friendly that they seem too weak for guys to get into them.”

One of Mr. Epstein’s pivotal decisions was to change the Beatles’ outfits, from denim and leather to natty suits. Using the best local tailors, he got the band into single-breasted, three-button mohair suits, with narrow lapels and even narrower pants, according to Mark Lewisohn in his book on the band, “Tune In.”

Photo

By honing such looks, the managers did more than influence the presentation of musicians. They advanced the image of a new kind of man. As the ’60s progressed, androgyny became central to male display, with long hair, brightly colored clothing, and, in the case of the mods of the mid-’60s, flashy tailored suits.

“The mods loved nothing more than to be seen walking down the street, sharp dressed with sharkskin pants and makeup,” said James Cooper, the director of “Lambert & Stamp.” “These tough guys wore eyeliner.”

Mr. Fouratt thinks that much of the permission for the gender blurring came from the spreading drug culture. “Drugs allowed men and boys to discover their beauty and femininity,” he said. “The foppishness of rock stars is like the peacock, where the male is the beautiful one, not the female. That became the forefront in rock ’n’ roll, encouraged by the gay managers.”

It played out most clearly in a star like Mick Jagger, who adopted a campy and preening persona, affects shared by the Rolling Stones’ first manager, Andrew Loog Oldham.

“Mick was attractive for that preening,” Mr. Oldham said. “Many men might say to their mates, ‘Oh, he’s a poof!’ So they didn’t mind their wives or girlfriends enjoying him.”

Straight rock stars also found that appropriating the sensual awareness of gay men paid off in sexual opportunities. “David Bowie had to force the working-class guys in his band the Spiders from Mars to wear those glam clothes,” Mr. Aston said. “But as soon as they saw the impact it had on women, they were like, ‘Pass me the blush!’”

Still, given the vilification of homosexuality at the time, one might expect the rockers to have some discomfort with the gay men who advised them. In the case of the Who, Mr. Cooper believes the members bonded with Mr. Lambert not in spite of his sexual identity but in some ways because of it. The unlikeliness, and mutual risk, of the connection between Mr. Lambert (an upper-class, privileged gay man) and his partner in management, Chris Stamp (a straight street kid) impressed them deeply.

“The unconditional bond their managers had gave them an aura of invincibility,” Mr. Cooper said. “It also gave them a mystery: Who were these guys? If these guys were capable of bonding, they could be capable of anything.”

Mr. Lambert played that aspect up, stoking the Who’s budding interest in cultural disruption and advising the band’s leader, Pete Townshend. “Kit was telling the press that the Who were a new form of social crime,” Mr. Cooper said. “He told Pete, ‘When you give an interview, leave a wound. Oh, and by the way, smash your instruments.’”

Mr. Napier-Bell sees the entire notion of rock ’n’ roll rebellion as an extension of “gay anger.” “We were against the establishment, the government and the law, which was against us,” he said. “It was an attitude felt by the managers that was expressed through their groups.”

At the same time, many of the gay men came from more refined backgrounds than the rockers, an experience they transferred to their charges. “Brian came from a world of classical music and jazz,” Mr. Tiwary said. “He envisioned that the Beatles would be like the great classical composers and be remembered long after they were gone.”

Mr. Lambert, whose father was a prominent classical composer, pushed Mr. Townshend to write a rock opera, resulting in “Tommy.” “Kit molded me as a composer,” Mr. Townshend said in “Lambert & Stamp.”

If the young rockers benefited from the taste and ambition of their gay advisers, in turn the managers got a sense of connection they otherwise couldn’t achieve. “It’s not like a gay man at the time could marry or enjoy a family,” Mr. Cooper said. “With a band, there’s a sense of an extended family. They could raise and nurture the musicians and put all the complexity of their experience into something of worth.”

At the same time, the gay men involved with the bands found a route to power. “Where else could they get that feeling of being primary?” Mr. Cooper said. “It was a way to have impact and relevance.”

And in an era when gay sexual expression was brutally suppressed, the men were able to express themselves through the most influential sex symbols of the day, creating a kind of erotic ventriloquism.

“Whatever thoughts, feelings and longings they had in themselves could be played out in a band — and in front of an entire arena full of people,” Mr. Cooper said.

In the case of Mr. Epstein, Mr. Tiwary believes the message went beyond sex.

“It’s the great tragedy of the Brian Epstein story that he died lonely, never having a proper boyfriend,” Mr. Tiwary said. “I believe the fact that Brian couldn’t love openly made him dedicate himself to spreading a message of love with the Beatles. Through them, he had the chance to spread that love all over the world.”",The Gay Architects of Classic Rock,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/style/the-gay-architects-of-classic-rock.html

This episode is just one example of the challenges scientists like Mr. Betchkal face working to document and preserve the climate and soundscapes in national parks. Clashes between bears and equipment are not that uncommon. Mr. Betchkal gets about three or four a year.

Three types of curious bears find and approach the equipment — especially after hibernation in austere environments, Mr. Betchkal said.

The cautious bears smell it and immediately leave. The hungry ones taste test and claw at it. They leave when they realize it’s not food. And the scared bears charge. You can hear the speed of their steps as they run toward the station, flatten it and unplug the mic.

“It’s kind of an unknown creature on the landscape that is not moving,” Mr. Betchkal said. And in bear language, that steadfastness is a sign of dominance. The equipment says, try me, and the bear says O.K. This interaction is rare, and most fall into the first category.

But Mr. Betchkal thinks the Karupa Lake bear was a type two, and judging by the sound of its lungs and the location, it was a grizzly.

In setting up the equipment, Mr. Betchkal was interested in learning how unexpected, human-made background noise might shrink your ability to perceive sound across the vast landscape.

Diane Cook and Len Jenshel present some answers in their new book, “Wise Trees,” which will be published by Abrams in October.
They were in Japan documenting a nighttime cherry tree ritual when Ms. Cook learned that her father was dying.
“Taking that strength from the trees, we had this idea of looking at wise trees around the world,” said Ms. Cook.
I need to go back to that tree,’” Ms. Cook recalled.","Trees can live without us, but we cannot live without trees.

With a history dating back to the dinosaurs, trees are the planet’s documentarians, watching us cycle through life while providing oxygen, shade and shelter. Trees, the oldest of which, according to Peter Wohlleben’s “The Hidden Life of Trees,” has 9,500 years, are a critical part of the human experience. We rely on them, from their deep roots to fluttering leaves.

But — at least when we’re not cutting them down — how do we influence trees? Diane Cook and Len Jenshel present some answers in their new book, “Wise Trees,” which will be published by Abrams in October. Traveling to more than 70 locations, they found trees that represent “landscapes of complexity where nature and humanity converge.” In other words, trees with stories, like the young sycamore that witnessed the Civil War, or the elm that survived the Oklahoma City bombing. These photos show how events have shaped trees, their energy, and sometimes, literally, the shape of their limbs.

“Forty-million trees are being lost every day,” said Mr. Jenshel. “We love the environment and wanted to do something that would make people think differently about trees.”

Though Mr. Jenshel and Ms. Cook — who are married, collaborate on all their projects and frequently finish each other’s sentences — have a long history of photographing trees, a much more personal seed for their project was planted in the spring of 2012. They were in Japan documenting a nighttime cherry tree ritual when Ms. Cook learned that her father was dying. Struggling to process the information, she found herself watching the fragile petals of the cherry blossoms slowly drift to the ground, one by one.

“We did what the Japanese have been doing for centuries,” said Ms. Cook. “To take in that beauty, appreciate its ephemeral nature, and know that life does go on.”

Her father died soon after, but a new project was born, influenced by the cherry blossoms and a National Geographic magazine commission. “Taking that strength from the trees, we had this idea of looking at wise trees around the world,” said Ms. Cook. “And the importance trees have had throughout history in so many cultures.”

After the Sept. 11 attacks, search and rescue workers were looking for human remains among the rubble, when they found part of a Callery pear tree, which traditionally is the first tree to bloom in spring and the last to change leaves in autumn. Though its trunk was scorched and many branches missing, the tree had survived the attacks. Now a symbol of strength and survival, the pear tree was nursed back to health at a Bronx nursery and, nearly a decade later, replanted at the World Trade Center memorial.

Other trees have been a part of unspeakable cruelties. From 1846 to 1870, in Goliad, Tex., an oak known as “The Hanging Tree,” provided shade for court sessions and branches for lynching.

“It’s not always a happy story,” said Ms. Cook.

One of the rain or monkeypod trees in Cambodia (imported from South or Central America), was isolated from the others as “The Killing Tree.” In 1975 when Pol Pot’s murderous rule started, the tree was used to bash children’s heads while their mothers were forced to watch.

“It took us days to recover from that experience of photographing that tree,” said Ms. Cook. “That left the deepest scar on us.”

Other trees seem to travel, and quite far. It is not clear how the adansonia gregorii (or boab) tree got to Western Australia. Perhaps it was the result of seeds dropped from the fruits by early migrants. It was a good thing, though, for the local aboriginals who used the tree as a spiritual home and lifeline, since it can hold up to 26 gallons of water.

In India, from the ancient tree deities to current bodhis of enlightenment, most trees are seen as sacred. In a Varanasi sweet shop, they found a neem tree, said to cure all ailments. Long after they shot the photo, Ms. Cook noticed her spouse’s anxiety.

“Len kept saying, ‘I don’t think we got the picture. I need to go back to that tree,’” Ms. Cook recalled. “I totally knew it was about the sweets.”

“If you look at President Obama and other presidents, most of them didn’t make calls, a lot of them didn’t make calls,” he said, absolutely falsely. “I like to call when it’s appropriate, when I think I’m able to do it.”

Trump admitted under further questioning at a news conference in the White House Rose Garden that he didn’t actually know what Barack Obama’s practice was. “I don’t know if he did it,” Trump said. “I was told that he didn’t often.” In fact, Obama frequently made calls, always wrote letters and regularly met with Gold Star families.

The issue here, as Trump likes to say about the playing of the national anthem at football games, is one of respect and honor. In the culture of the military, a job in which the possibility of dying is ever-present, the proper way to treat death is with dignity and respect. And the commander in chief should take personal responsibility.

Ronald Reagan, for example, attended the memorial service for the 241 Marines and other service members killed in the bombing of a barracks in Beirut in 1983.

President George W. Bush tried to hide the casualties of war from the American public by barring the media from Dover Air Force Base when flag-draped coffins returned from Iraq. He did not attend the funerals of the fallen.

Trump, by contrast, sat joking with Sean Hannity at an event in Harrisburg, Pa., last week, while the military color guard was lowering the flag to the playing of “Retreat” — a deeply solemn daily ritual.

“What a nice sound that is,” Trump said. “Are they playing that for you or for me?”

I don’t mean to suggest that Trump is so lacking in basic empathy that he doesn’t care about the war dead. But he is careless, in exactly the way that F. Scott Fitzgerald described two of the main characters in “The Great Gatsby”:

First: The bipartisan health care deal in the Senate, announced yesterday, is a very good deal.

It undoes two of President Trump’s attempts to sabotage the law, by reinstating reimbursement payments to insurers and by encouraging people to sign up for insurance. It also gives states some more flexibility, a longtime conservative priority. Perhaps above all, it’s a sign that some leading Republicans are finally serious about trying to improve the health care system.

The deal, John McCain said, “shows that good faith, bipartisan negotiations can achieve consensus on lasting reform.” Democratic-leaning experts were full of praise for it too, saying that, while it didn’t void all of Trump’s mischief, it was major progress. Jacob Leibenluft, a former Obama adviser, called the deal the “first concession” from Republicans that “they will own health care markets in 2018 and 2020.”

The biggest caveat: The deal — between Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat, and Lamar Alexander, a Tennessee Republican — is still just a framework. It must pass both houses of Congress and be signed by Trump.

Mr. Trump, whose administration has been taking steps to undermine operation of the health law, declared last week that he would stop the payments.
Mr. Alexander said that he spoke with Mr. Trump over the weekend, and that the president encouraged his efforts with Ms. Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate health committee.

“It’ll get us over this intermediate hump,” the president said at a Rose Garden news conference, describing it as “a short-term solution so that we don’t have this very dangerous little period.”

Passage of the deal negotiated by Mr. Alexander and Ms. Murray is still far from assured. If approved, the agreement could provide a reprieve for the Affordable Care Act that would prevent 2018 premiums from increasing as much as they might otherwise have gone up. But consumers in many states will still face double-digit rate increases, and in many counties, health plans will be available from only one insurance company.

Moreover, Mr. Trump and other Republicans are still intent on repealing much of the Affordable Care Act, and an executive order issued last week by Mr. Trump could destabilize markets in 2019 and later years by encouraging sales of health plans that skirt the coverage requirements of the health care law.

“For a period of one year, two years, we will have a very good solution,” Mr. Trump said. “But we’re going to have a great solution, ultimately, for health care.”

Mr. Alexander, the chairman of the Senate health committee, said that in addition to funding the payments to insurers, the deal would also give states “more flexibility in the variety of choices they can give to consumers” — a change that should appeal to Republicans eager to give states more say over health care.

“This takes care of the next two years,” Mr. Alexander said. “After that, we can have a full-fledged debate on where we go long-term on health care.”

The agreement bears the hallmarks of bipartisanship. For Republicans, state governments would find it easier to obtain waivers from certain requirements of the Affordable Care Act. But there would be explicit protections for low-income people and people with serious illnesses.

Consumers of any age would be allowed to obtain catastrophic insurance plans that typically have low monthly premiums but high deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs. Catastrophic plans provide protection against serious illnesses and injuries, but consumers must pay most routine medical expenses themselves.

Under current law, catastrophic plans are available only to people who are under the age of 30 or have received an exemption from the federal coverage requirement because they cannot afford other insurance.

For Democrats, not only would the cost-sharing reductions be brought back, but millions of dollars would be restored for advertising and outreach activities that publicize insurance options available in the health law’s open enrollment period, which starts next month. The Trump administration had slashed that funding.

“We will spend about twice as much or more than President Trump wanted to expend,” Mr. Alexander promised.

Accusing Mr. Trump of taking steps to “sabotage health care in our country,” Ms. Murray said, “I’m really glad that Democrats and Republicans agree it’s unacceptable, and that the uncertainty and dysfunction cannot continue.”

Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, hailed the agreement as a model for how the two parties could work together on other issues, such as taxes.

“I don’t expect the Republicans to give up their goal of repealing A.C.A.,” Mr. Schumer said. “But in the meantime, stabilizing the system, preventing chaos and stopping the sabotage is in everybody’s interest.”

The fate of the cost-sharing subsidies has been in doubt since a federal district judge ruled in 2016 that the payments to insurers were unconstitutional, because Congress had never appropriated money for them. Mr. Trump, whose administration has been taking steps to undermine operation of the health law, declared last week that he would stop the payments.

If the cost-sharing payments were cut off and premiums increased, many low-income people would receive more financial assistance, in the form of larger tax credits, to help pay the higher premiums. But many middle-income people who do not receive such assistance would have to bear the additional cost on their own.

A coalition of state attorneys general filed suit on Friday, and Congress immediately came under pressure to take action to ensure that the payments would continue. Doctors, hospitals and insurers, as well as the National Governors Association and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, urged lawmakers to provide the funding.

Mr. Alexander said that he spoke with Mr. Trump over the weekend, and that the president encouraged his efforts with Ms. Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate health committee. But it remains to be seen whether conservative-leaning Republicans will get on board with the agreement, and whether the House will accept it.

It is not clear how the agreement might move through Congress. Supporters of funding the subsidies could push to have the deal included in a measure to keep the government open past Dec. 8. Democratic votes will be needed to fund the government, and the health care deal could come to fruition when Democratic leverage is particularly strong.

Some Republicans have already said they do not wish to provide what they describe as a bailout to insurers.

“I think it would be a mistake for Congress to provide billions in bailouts to insurance companies without providing meaningful relief to the millions of Americans who have been hurt by Obamacare,” Senator Ted Cruz of Texas said Tuesday before the deal was announced.

Mr. Alexander said the agreement would include “the strongest possible language” to guarantee that money provided for cost-sharing payments goes to the benefit of consumers, not insurance companies. “I want that, Senator Murray wants that, the president wants that,” he said.

The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, gave no indication on Tuesday about when — or whether — the chamber might move ahead with the plan drawn up by Mr. Alexander and Ms. Murray.

Senator John Thune of South Dakota, a member of the Senate Republican leadership, said there would be “a sense of urgency to move a bill,” since Mr. Trump intended to stop the payments right away.

The House is away for a weeklong recess, and a spokesman for Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin declined to comment.

A leading conservative in the House, Representative Mark Walker of North Carolina, the chairman of the Republican Study Committee, immediately declared the deal to be “unacceptable.”

“Obamacare is in a ‘death spiral,’ ” Mr. Walker said. “Anything propping it up is only saving what Republicans promised to dismantle.”

Another leading conservative, Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina, the chairman of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus, described the agreement as a “good start,” but said “much more work needs to be done.”

“Most importantly,” he added, “it bears repeating: Republicans cannot allow short-term solutions to become a distraction to repealing and replacing Obamacare — something we’ve promised to do for seven years.”",2 Senators Strike Deal on Health Subsidies That Trump Cut Off,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/us/politics/alexander-murray-deal-obamacare-subsidies.html

tl;dr: Mondays are the easiest and they get harder as the week goes on.

This is probably a beginning solver’s most common mistake.

You know what it’s like: You have some downtime on a Saturday and you look around for something to pass the time. Your officemate keeps bragging about his ability to finish The New York Times Crossword. You hate your officemate.

So, not to be outdone, you pick up the paper or download our app and turn to the Saturday puzzle. How hard could it be?

Fun Fact: The Saturday crossword is actually the hardest puzzle of the week. Contrary to popular belief, the Sunday puzzles are midweek difficulty, not the hardest. Mondays have the most straightforward clues and Saturday clues are the most vague or involve the most wordplay. Some later-week puzzle clues may require specialized knowledge.

Just to drive the point home, let’s take a look at the difference between a Monday clue and a late-week clue for a popular crossword entry. OREO cookies (answers in puzzles are generally written in all capital letters) are such a popular entry in crosswords that they have been dubbed by some as the “official” cookie of the crossword. A typical Monday clue for OREO will be very straightforward and drive you almost directly to the answer.

“Nabisco cookie”

“Cookie with creme filling”

“‘Twist, Lick, Dunk’ cookie”

And here are some late-week clues, which might require more specialized knowledge about these delicious treats:

“Snack since 1912”

“It has 12 flowers on each side”

“Sandwich often given a twist”

We weren’t kidding you. There is a big difference between a Monday puzzle and a Saturday puzzle.

That doesn’t mean that you can’t work your way toward solving a late-week puzzle – and we recommend that you do, because they’re fun – but it takes experience and patience.

If you’re just getting started, though, make your life easy and solve as many Monday puzzles as you can. Eventually, you’ll be ready for more of a challenge, and that’s when you move on to Tuesday puzzles.

For decades, Mr. Soros funded the Open Society Foundations through annual donations of around $800 million or $900 million per year.
Open Society already spends about $900 million annually on programs and grants, more than it is legally required to.
Soros Fund Management, the entity that manages the billionaire’s personal fortune, is also responsible for overseeing the Open Society endowment’s investments.
“Since its inception, the Open Society Foundations has worked with leaders in civil society, whether they are the Roma in Eastern Europe or African-Americans in Cleveland, Ohio, who continue to be subject to a second-class form of justice,” he said.","His political focus — including large donations to Hillary Clinton and other Democratic politicians — has made Mr. Soros a target of criticism from both the Republican establishment and fringe elements of the far right. The conservative website Breitbart, for example, has accused Mr. Soros of attempting to make Ireland a “pro-abortion country” and undermining the control of European countries over their borders.

“Given America’s place in the world right now, I think he’s making an enormous statement,” said Eileen Heisman, chief executive of the National Philanthropic Trust, a nonprofit that works with foundations. “He has a very clear point of view and he’s not trying to hide it.”

Patrick Gaspard, the vice president of the Open Society Foundations, who will take over as president at the end of the year, said the election of President Trump had given the organization’s work a new sense of urgency.

Mr. Gaspard specifically cited Mr. Trump’s commission on voter fraud, a panel that has faced much criticism from Democrats and that Mr. Gaspard said “utterly lacks integrity.” “Our work on equal access and protection is more vital than it’s ever been,” he said.

Mr. Soros’s philanthropy is rooted in his past.

He lived in Nazi-occupied Hungary as a boy. With Budapest under Communist rule in 1947, he left for London and then the United States, where he found success on Wall Street.

In 1992, Mr. Soros made a $1 billion bet against the British pound, a trade that famously earned him the nickname “the man who broke the Bank of England” when his aggressive selling of the currency pushed the government to devalue the pound.

As his fortune grew, Mr. Soros began funding efforts to promote democracy and human rights, establishing the first Open Society foundation in Hungary in 1984. Mr. Soros took the name from a book by the philosopher Karl Popper, “Open Society and Its Enemies,” in which he argued for democratic governance, free expression and respect for individual rights.

Mr. Soros eventually became one of the biggest donors to Democrats, including Mrs. Clinton. During the last election cycle, Mr. Soros gave millions to super PACs that opposed Mr. Trump and supported other Democratic candidates and causes. He also bet big in the markets that Mr. Trump would lose the election, a wager that cost him about $1 billion.

For decades, Mr. Soros funded the Open Society Foundations through annual donations of around $800 million or $900 million per year. But beginning a few years ago, he increased his contributions as part of his estate planning, bringing the organization’s endowment to about $18 billion this year. The total donation figure was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.

Mr. Soros is expected to contribute at least another $2 billion in the coming years.

“There is no foundation in the world, including the Ford Foundation, that has had more impact around the world than the Open Society Foundations in the last two decades,” said Darren Walker, president of the Ford Foundation. “Because there is no part of the world that they have not been. Their footprint is deeper, wider and more impactful than any other social justice foundation in the world.”

Despite the infusion by Mr. Soros, the foundation said it did not plan to increase the amount that it hands out in grants or via programs in the near future. Open Society already spends about $900 million annually on programs and grants, more than it is legally required to.

And Mr. Soros’s fortune will still be managed by familiar hands. Soros Fund Management, the entity that manages the billionaire’s personal fortune, is also responsible for overseeing the Open Society endowment’s investments.

Mr. Soros remains closely involved in the foundation’s work.

“I talk to George constantly, regularly,” said Mr. Gaspard, the foundation’s incoming president. “George is incredibly engaged on these issues.”

This year, Mr. Soros has fended off attacks by the prime minister of Hungary, who has been displeased with a university that the Open Society Foundations funded there.

Mr. Gaspard said the public pressure did not bother the foundation’s leadership.

“Since its inception, the Open Society Foundations has worked with leaders in civil society, whether they are the Roma in Eastern Europe or African-Americans in Cleveland, Ohio, who continue to be subject to a second-class form of justice,” he said.

Stacy Palmer, editor of the Chronicle of Philanthropy, said that no matter how the billions were spent, the gift by Mr. Soros would keep him in the center of social and political debates for years to come.

That doesn’t mean a return to the glory days of private offices, but it does mean workers have more space and more places to seek solitude than in the neo-Dickensian workbench settings. The new designs often include “isolation rooms,” soundproof phone booths, and even lounges where technology is forbidden.

And it’s meant to be tweaked as needs change. “This continues to be iterated,” said Frank Cuevas, who is working on a major redesign at IBM — and whose use of the word “iterated” hints at the kind of start-up mentality the changes are intended to evoke.

“It’s not something we’re going stop and say, ‘This is it,’” he said.

The corporations setting the new standard are not young Silicon Valley companies known for free food, slides and foosball tables at work — or for carefree spending, as at Apple, whose new corporate mothership cost a reported $5 billion. Nor are the designs one-of-a-kind projects that veer toward eccentricity. Salesforce’s new skyscraper campus in San Francisco, for example, has areas on every floor for meditation, partly inspired by the teachings of Thich Nhat Hanh, a Buddhist monk.

Instead, the companies behind the emerging new norm in workplace design are a lineup of more staid companies across a range of industries, and they may spend heavily but also systematically. They include Microsoft, IBM and General Electric. Certain workspace innovations may surface first at Google or Facebook, but the older stalwarts are combining and refining them for mainstream businesses.

“These workplace ideas are beginning to be adopted across all industries,” said Arlyn Vogelmann, a principal at Gensler, an architecture and design firm whose clients include Facebook and G.E.

The new designs are not about looks. They are an attempt to adapt to the spread of internet-era digital technology — and its hurry-up ways — into every industry. Space drives behavior, experts say, and the goal of the new designs is to hasten the pace of sharing ideas, making decisions and creating new products. They are also meant to appeal to millennial recruits, many of whom are more comfortable working in a Starbucks than in a traditional office.

The new model eschews the common dogmas of work life: Everybody gets an office, or everyone gets a cubicle, or everybody gets a seat on a workbench. A diversity of spaces, experts say, is more productive, and the new concept is called “activity-based workplace design,” tailoring spaces for the kind of work done.

“Office geography matters, and it can be a key managerial lever to increase communication and the cross-fertilization of ideas,” said Christopher Liu, an assistant professor at the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto.

One of the most aggressive makeovers is happening at Microsoft, a change forced by business necessity. The company faces a new wave of technology, as the market has shifted to software delivered and constantly updated as a service over the internet cloud, as opposed to being loaded onto individual computers, with the code often stored on compact discs and sold as a product every few years. To compete, Microsoft has had to adopt a faster pace.

“You have to collaborate more,” said Michael Ford, Microsoft’s general manager of global real estate. “We absolutely have to change.”

For decades, the company, based outside Seattle, housed its software engineers in secluded offices, thinking that the privacy helped employees focus while writing computer code. But in 2010, Microsoft started testing open designs with a quarter of a floor, and then expanded. Since 2014, it has opened 10 renovated buildings without offices, including four this year.

Microsoft, Mr. Ford said, has taken a test-and-learn approach. It learned, for example, that its early designs were too open plan, with 16 to 24 engineers in team-based spaces. Engineers found those spaces noisy and distracting, and concentration suffered. Too much openness can cause workers to “do a turtle,” researchers say, and retrench and communicate less — colleagues who retreat into their headphones all day, for example

Today, there are more private spaces, and the team areas hold only eight to 12 engineers. “That’s the sweet spot for Microsoft,” Mr. Ford said.

The company thinks it is working. Microsoft’s Azure cloud software business has surged in the last few years, as has the company’s stock price. Mr. Ford said about 20 percent of the workplaces have been redone on Microsoft’s campus in Redmond, Wash., and the surrounding area. Within five years, he said, he expects the renovated share to reach 80 percent.

Offices, he said, will not disappear entirely, but they will be reserved mainly for people who regularly have confidential conversations, like lawyers and top executives.",Don’t Get Too Comfortable at That Desk,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/business/the-office-gets-remade-again.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Professional stylists often discuss goals, priorities and other issues in order to develop a client’s personal style. It’s a long process that can take months of working one on one with someone.

“Working with a stylist is more about figuring out who you are, and then dressing yourself accordingly,” Ms. Messiah added. “You really get to understand how things are supposed to fit so you can maximize its use in your closet.”

Don’t expect to get the same level of service in a box, Ms. Messiah says. She suggests having specific action items ready for your online stylist because, unlike an in-person stylist, they won’t ask you questions about your priorities and goals. It’s crucial to have an idea of what you want beforehand. Instead of “I want a better wardrobe,” you might tell your stylist, “I need nicer dresses to wear to company cocktail parties” or “I need casual clothes that also look professional for my remote job.”

As long as you keep your expectations realistic, however, these services can be useful, and there are a number of ways to ensure you have the best possible experience with them.

Pick the right box to start

There are two different categories of clothing box services: subscription-only and try-and-buy. Subscription-only services, like Threads Monthly or Five Four Club, don’t send clothes that are intended to be sent back. (In fact, some don’t even offer refunds.) These subscription boxes work just like Birchbox or Blue Apron: you sign up for a box and keep what you get.

By comparison, Stitch Fix and Trunk Club are try-and-buy services, meaning you try on the clothes and only buy the items you keep. You can order a box regularly and set up your own subscription, but they’re ultimately designed to allow you to try on clothes in the comfort of your home. This also means you need to trust yourself to reliably send back the items that don’t fit or that you don’t like.

If you know what kind of clothing you like and simply want a regular shipment of new threads every month, subscription-only services are probably your best bet. However, if you’re looking to try new styles, address specific clothing needs for your body, or just need the help of a professional to pick out pieces, you’ll probably want to stick with the flexibility of try-and-buy.

Our favorite pick, Stitch Fix, offers that flexibility. It also offers a variety of sizing, from petite to tall to plus-size, which is another factor you want to consider when picking the right box. Most, but not all, boxes have clothes that fit a variety of body types, and you can typically find this information in the FAQ section of their website. For more on what made Stitch Fix the winning choice — and for details on other options — check out our full comparison and test at Wirecutter, a New York Times company.

Give your stylist specific feedback

Once you sign up for a service, take the time to fill out your profile thoroughly. Stitch Fix and Bombfell, two of the most popular options, take you through a series of detailed questions about your measurements and preferences.

This can be time-consuming, but the more time you spend offering accurate answers, the better chance you have of getting a box you like. With Trunk Club, another popular option, you’ll answer a few basic questions, too, but then a stylist will contact you, either via email or chat, to get more insight and feedback from you.

“I would take the time because that really informs what you’re getting,” said Jon Shanahan of the YouTube style channel The Kavalier. “When I first used Trunk Club, I just wrote a couple of things to my stylist, and looking back it wasn’t very helpful. If you take the time to say why things fit what you like, it’s in their best interest to get you right as a customer.”

Mr. Shanahan even suggests getting feedback about your style from friends and family to help you with the process. Many of these services also include a section where you can leave a message for your stylist. Don’t leave that field blank. Give your stylist as much information as possible so they know what to work with.

If you want specific items in your wardrobe, let them know. If you have specific goals for your style, like more clothes for networking events, tell them. Search for some styles you like on Pinterest, pin them to a board, and send the link to your stylist. Most services will directly ask for a Pinterest board link.

Learn some style basics

It doesn’t hurt to learn the basics of personal style, either. This way, you know you’re requesting the right types of clothing, and clothing that you like and that looks good on you.

“I think there’s something fundamentally wrong with how we think about style. “You don’t know why you’re wearing something, so it just ends up being another thing in the back of your closet. Get to the reasons why you want something,” Ms. Messiah suggested.

Personal styling is often a self-discovery process that explores your desires beyond the clothing. The process helps you determine why you want to look better in the first place, and then encourages you to align your personal goals, career goals, and even relationship goals with your style. If you want to excel in your corporate career, for example, you’ll do well to focus on choosing professional clothing that supports that goal. That means leaving out shorts and T-shirts when you place your order.

Try a second box

Your online stylist might not get it right the first time around. “You need to give it two cycles for them to really nail everything,” Mr. Shanahan added. “That’s when you really start to say, ‘Yes you got this.’”

The idea is that the more you work with your stylist, the better a grasp they’ll have on what you’re looking for, specifically. In fact, when you send items back, most services allow you to briefly explain why you’re sending that particular item back. Maybe the shoulders are too big or you just have too many of that type of item in your wardrobe already. Your stylist will see these notes and know not to send you similar pieces next time.

Thus at $20 to $25 a box, it may be worth a second or third chance if you’re unhappy with the first box. And some boxes, like Bombfell, don’t have a styling fee at all. As Mr. Shanahan put it, “You might as well give it a couple of shots because there’s a very low barrier to entry.”

Finally, it’s worth noting that shopping for clothing can also be a stressful experience, namely when you don’t find anything that fits you quite right. Try to have fun, and remember to exercise some self-compassion along the way.

“It’s not you, it’s the clothes,” Ms. Messiah said. “There’s vanity sizing. No one designs the clothes with you in mind.” She advises her own clients to keep an open mind when it comes to trying on new things and remember: “it’s all part of a journey, but at the end of the day, it’s just clothes.”",How to Use Clothing Subscription Boxes to Find Your Personal Style,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/smarter-living/clothing-box-services-stitch-fix-trunk-club.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

I thought about his words often as I drove for five days, sometimes for as long as eight hours at a stretch, both in terms of the architecture I saw as well as in trying to convince myself that his overarching plan described how I was feeling. In fact, my state of mind about the trip could be described as shaky at best. A friend in Oslo warned me that bad weather often cropped up unexpectedly in October, especially in the north: torrential rain storms or early snow storms that leave cars stranded on a mountain pass or by a lonely fjord.

I was slowly becoming a more daring driver but I was not used to being without a passenger in a country where I didn’t speak a word of the language. On top of that, I already felt emotionally quite alone from my marital breakup, a melancholy sensation that only intensified during intervals when an hour passed without seeing another car, even on major highways.

After a couple of days though, the peace and diversity of the countryside became meditational, a panorama that seemed dreamlike through my windscreen. Traditional country cottages built into mounds of earth with grass-topped roofs and green weathered doors looked as if they were out of “The Hobbit.” Dark thick forest alternated with bucolic sun-dappled farmland and bare, desolate mountains overlooking quaint lakeside towns. One late afternoon as I drove into a village, the sun appeared to drop like a fireball into the fjord. Spectacular modern installations appeared on remote corners in the most far-fetched of places, that they sometimes seemed like a figment of my imagination.

I have never seen a place so multifaceted in its geography and so unpopulated, except perhaps on the other side of the earth, in Patagonia.

Above Trollstigen, another project conceived along these routes is the Juvet Landscape Hotel, designed by the architects Jensen & Skodvin, and the creepy, if incredibly appropriate aesthetically, setting for the 2015 film “Ex Machina.”

From the exterior, the compound, in a nature reserve called Reinheimen, looks almost like a hippie campsite with its low-slung, wood-encased cabins on stilts. But as I was shown into my room, the rustic vision was completely turned on its head — the natural wood or in some instances stone that covers the rear of the structures hides glass walls and raw cement cubes facing front — with views onto the gentle valley, and onto the surrounding peaks and meandering river that cut through the landscape behind.

The perspective created the effect that I was both inside and outside the hotel, part of the natural surroundings, both the voyeur and the inhabitant.

After a dip in the outdoor hot tub, I joined other travelers and guests around a candlelit communal dining room, an intimate warm environment where locally hunted venison was served alongside foraged mountain vegetables that were like strange fairy-tale versions of carrots and beets with curly tendrils and odd shapes. A roaring fire and candles were our only light.

Around the dinner table, we traded stories about what brought us up the mountain and where we came from. The Chinese-American college student recounted his adventures while taking a gap year. The Norwegian honeymooners were in need of a wilderness break from Oslo, the capital. The glossy magazine reading hikers from Britain wanted a sleek hotel after rugged trails. I shared my journey in broad strokes, the American expatriate in Tuscany, my road trip, my love of nature, and I left out the impending change in my marriage and my sense of loss.

When I look back now, my Norwegian road trip seems like one of the most surreal and meaningful of any I have ever taken, even after many years of absorbing trips. The memory turns in my head like a film trailer, so cinematic and surprising that I still almost can’t believe it was real. The pristine beauty, the sense of drama. Perhaps it was the network of beautiful art and architecture that made me feel, daring and courageous by journey’s end. And for that, I am grateful.

TUESDAY PUZZLE — Jeff Chen is back with a surprisingly straightforward puzzle, which made me wonder if he was secretly taking us for a ride. His puzzles have had some pretty neat gimmicks in them, so when I see a list theme from him, my first thought is that perhaps he is pulling the old bluff on us.

Today’s Theme

It’s actually a list theme, but it’s a tight one. A total of four, two-word phrases each have a synonym for “victim” as their first word, and the CON MEN who target them are hiding away at 43D. For example, at 30A, the answer to “A mere pittance” is CHUMP CHANGE and, at 40A, the answer to the clue “Unexpected hit” is SUCKER PUNCH.

Tricky Clues

21A: A “Person setting the stage?” could be a narrator, but today it’s a ROADIE setting up for a concert.

57A: This puzzle was one of the entries in the Westchester Crossword Puzzle Tournament, and quite a few of the solvers were bamboozled by the spelling of MARK ANTONY with a ‘K.’ Many contestants thought that his name was spelled with a ‘C,’ but it’s not. And you have that easy crossing of PORKY’S to confirm.

23D: My first reaction to IBANKER was “What? No!” but it’s a thing.

37D: UNDEROOS were haute couture when The Boy was a wee one. He preferred the Batman ones.

Constructor Notes

My mother-in-law’s name is Patsy and I’m a big fan of Patsy Cline — “Walkin’ After Midnight” is one of my favorites. Not hard to see where I got the idea for the puzzle. What is hard to see is PATSY CLINE in the grid. She could have gone where PIGEON COOP is, but my mother-in-law in a crossword where PATSY is associated with CHUMP, SUCKER, and MARK ... hmm.

Probably not good for your marriage, Mr. Chen. Or your life.

Earlier this year, the Ryerson Image Center in Toronto received a donation of 24,804 images from a collector, Chris Bratty, who had purchased the collection with the intention of donating it. Selected by a team led by two gallerists, Steven Kasher and Stephen Bulger, the pictures range from World War I to the late 1990s, from hockey players to lumberjacks. A selection is currently on view in an exhibition at the center and in a book, both entitled “The Faraway Nearby.”

“When I heard of the collection, I immediately wanted to acquire it,” said Paul Roth, an American who is the center’s director. “For all the strengths of our holdings — including the Black Star and the Berenice Abbott archives — we don’t have a tremendous amount of Canadian photojournalism. This helps us fill that gap. And, since it comes from a major U.S. newspaper, it brings up the question of how one country covers another, which fits within our mandate of interrogating different aspects of the medium.”

The expected tropes are there: Canada as a winter wonderland; as a safe, polite neighbor who reveres hockey. But there are also images that challenge them: Canada the diplomat having lighthearted meetings with America’s foes. In one photo, Nikita S. Khrushchev laughs at a joke told by Mr. Pearson — the opposite of the famous “Kitchen Debate” moment by Elliott Erwitt, in which then-Vice President Richard Nixon castigates the Soviet leader. In another, Fidel Castro holds Prime Minister Pierre-Elliott Trudeau’s youngest son, Michel Charles-Émile, during a four-day state visit. Or, Canada the troubled young nation deploying the Army to confront Quebec’s sometimes-violent calls for independence.

“The type of coverage we see speaks of a dual fascination between how familiar Canada feels, and yet how unfamiliar it sometimes appears,” Mr. Roth surmised. “I suspect that The New York Times had to ponder how to cover a country that was so close. Should they concentrate on the differences or highlight the similarities? When stories involved people or goods crossing the border, which was often the case, were they to be considered national or international news?”

Besides snow and hockey, evidence of Canada’s subordination to the British monarchy seemed of particular interest. The New York Times dedicated space daily to Princess Elizabeth’s first tour of Canada in 1951 (Slide 9) and continued to chronicle the royal family’s subsequent visits.

Mr. Trudeau also drew a lot of attention, more than any of his predecessors and successors, that is, until his son Justin ran for the same office and won in 2015. A reproduction of a spread published during the 1972 election is revealing. Within “The World” section, the article isn’t under a rubric with the country’s name, as is customary, but simply “Trudeau,” and a headline declaring “A Swinger Shows His Sober Side.” A full column is dedicated to a collage of images showing the candidate dancing, riding a motorcycle, playing hockey and pedaling a unicycle before concluding with a somber close-up portrait.

Mounting the exhibition, Denise Birkhofer — an American who recently settled in Toronto and co-curated the show with Gerald McMaster, an Indigenous Canadian of Plains Cree and Blackfoot descent — pondered how The New York Times’s fondness for certain subjects and visual archetypes might have shaped a national identity. That’s hard to answer, partly because of the variety of photographers who contributed to the paper’s Canadian coverage.

“There’s a multiplicity of voices that came together to shape the perception of Canada that The New York Times then shared with its readers,” she said. “Not all were Americans. Sometimes staff photographers were sent to cover a story, but other times it came from local publications or freelancers. There were also images made by Canadian agencies or corporations, such as the National Film Board and the Canadian Pacific Railway.”

Most surprisingly, during World War I, the images the paper used to showcase Canada’s participation in the war effort were supplied by Canadian entities, whose work had to be vetted by the nation’s official censors. Its goal was to avoid criticism of military endeavors by showing the conflict in a romanticized light. In other words, said Gaëlle Morel, the Ryerson Image Center exhibitions curator, “The New York Times — a private commercial enterprise — obeyed the censorship requirements of a foreign country.” In other words, the country’s image, as seen in The Times, reflected an official, sanitized perspective.

Mr. Roth said the collection has greater meaning given Canada’s sesquicentennial this year. “More than a time for celebration and patriotism, it is an occasion to think about complicated questions relating to the identity of the nation,” he said. “All countries should be interested in how they’re viewed by other states. We should strive to get past the mythologies that are created to promote tourism or to reinforce patriotic values, especially nowadays. Doing so requires unpacking widely held cultural assumptions. And that’s exactly what we can do thanks to this archive. While it doesn’t tell a single story, it does help us understand what the Canadian mythologies are.”

On her website, the graphic novelist Julia Wertz offers an artist statement in the form of a short, looping video. A large, complacent-looking cat in a tightfitting bee costume looks blankly into the camera. Then it falls off the couch.

Wertz has become a cult favorite for her graphic memoirs “Drinking at the Movies” (2010) and “The Infinite Wait and Other Stories” (2012). She takes on serious themes — her alcoholism and chronic illness — but always makes time for silly stoner humor. To some lasting rue, she titled her first collections “The Fart Party” (2007) and “The Fart Party Vol. 2.” (2009) and is now trying to rebrand them as “Museum of Mistakes.” Futilely, I fear.

Her new book, “Tenements, Towers & Trash,” is a departure. The focus isn’t on her life but on her great love, New York. It’s a passionate anatomy of the city, a book of dramatic streetscapes and hidden histories — mostly of infamous women, like the 19th-century celebrity abortionist Madame Restell, who catered to socialites and built her Fifth Avenue mansion a block away from a Catholic church, supposedly to taunt the faithful.

But we’re still in Wertzworld: the velvety black and white illustrations, the crisp lines of the landscapes and the rounded, expressive faces of the characters who look straight out of a Tintin comic. The artist herself is still the tousled and anxious creature of the previous books, very much a large cat in a bee costume — awkward, unlucky, straining for dignity and supremely lovable.

I used it to explore a neighborhood where I used to be a local (Astoria, Queens) to see if it could deliver. The fact that it included a wide assortment of suggestions in a borough not named Manhattan was impressive enough, compared to the other apps I tested, but the recommendations themselves were also spot on.

For example, Astoria’s popular Bohemian Hall and Beer Garden was rightfully featured, but so was SingleCut Brewery, a lesser-known, but worthwhile, beer spot.

The advice for each location is the perfect length — detailed but not overwhelming, and the “Nearby” tab on the map makes it easy to scope out places wherever you are.

Cool Cousin

This app scored points for originality as well as its practicality, and is perfect for travelers who don’t have any cool cousins of their own.

Cool Cousin gives you access to contributors in 40 large cities around the world. Each “cousin” has a profile, with name, age, photo, occupation and a lot more information. The idea is to add those to your network who seem to have similar tastes to your own. After each add, the cousin’s recommendations are added to your map and broken down into eight different categories, such as food, coffee, night life and outdoors.

The app seems geared toward younger travelers — it feels like a cross between Facebook, Tinder and Foursquare — and most of the cousins themselves have an appropriately hipster look. For New York, this leads to a higher concentration of recommendations below 14th Street in Manhattan and several in Brooklyn (very few in Queens), and heavy in the food and night life areas.

But the app itself is easy to figure out, and the map includes the option to download and use offline (for free). No matter where you are, just hit the location arrow to see what’s nearby.

The recommendations themselves are solid and are written casually — think Yelp, minus the negativity. I added 26 of 55 available cousins in New York and was impressed with what was revealed, including free public gardens and lesser-known art galleries, as well as a wide variety of intriguing bars and restaurants.

Your new cousins will even message you through the app to say hello, and you have the option of writing them back to ask for more tips. You will also get a push notification every time you receive a new message, which you can turn off by adjusting your settings. After asking two of my paired cousins, I received additional restaurant recommendations.

Like a Local

Well-designed and easy to navigate, Like a Local has fewer contributors than the other apps (28, providing 197 tips for New York at the time of writing) but it is in more cities than the others (over 300) and best functions as a complementary tool.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The recommendations are detailed yet concise, giving an excellent general overview and a “special tip” for each location. For example, at the Brazilian restaurant Beco in Brooklyn, Kelly advises: “Come early because the restaurant’s seating space is limited. CA$H ONLY.”

You don’t have to sign up to use the app, so you can dig right in and explore — though if you want to use the app offline, you have to pay $1.99 per city.

There’s also an option to “ask locals,” which works like a message board. I asked for Upper East Side restaurant recommendations (it is a neighborhood not represented well on any of the apps) and after a week had yet to get a response.

The recommendations included mainstream spots like St. Patrick’s Cathedral and the Central Park more often than the other apps did.

Dennis Overbye, The New York Times’s cosmic affairs correspondent, has never owned a telescope. They were of little use in the cloudy environs of Mercer Island, Wash., where he grew up.

Instead, his interest in science began, as it did for many who came of age immersed in the starward ambitions of the space age, with science fiction. There were the paperbacks by Arthur C. Clarke, Isaac Asimov and Robert Heinlein — “that whole crew who had imagined the future of the human race as I saw it now being played out by Sputnik and Apollo,” Mr. Overbye said.

In the nearly 20 years he has worked for The Times, Mr. Overbye has similarly tried to nourish the imaginations of others. “My job as I see it is to relate people to the universe they live in,” he said. “It’s kind of everybody’s business what the universe is and what it means to be here.”

He has covered the discovery of planets beyond our sun; the detection of fundamental particles and the gravitational waves created by colliding black holes; and dark energy, the mysterious and inscrutable substance that makes up 70 percent of the universe and may very well determine its destiny. Earlier this week, Mr. Overbye wrote about the first collision of neutron stars ever observed. “I don’t look at page views,” he said. “Very little of what I write about moves the markets.”

Still, Mr. Overbye’s stories often live where the earthly meets the cosmic. His first book, “Lonely Hearts of the Cosmos,” recounts the birth of cosmology through the personal dramas of its founders and was nominated for the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1991. And in 2014, he was named a Pulitzer Prize finalist for his reporting on the race to discover the Higgs boson, which focused on the lives of just a handful of the thousands of scientists swept up in the search for “the God particle.”",How Dennis Overbye Makes Space-Time Relatable,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/insider/dennis-overbye-science-reporting.html

It is unclear what possessed Woody Allen, of all people, to comment on the accusations of sexual predation against Harvey Weinstein, when he could have just not said anything, not expressed sympathy for an alleged serial rapist, not accused long-silenced women who said they were sexually assaulted of contributing to “a witch hunt atmosphere” and not felt compelled to issue a pouty follow-up statement in which he didn’t apologize but, in fact, reiterated how “sad” he feels for Weinstein because Weinstein is “sick.”

I’m kidding! It’s totally clear why Allen would issue such a statement — why he wouldn’t hesitate to include the astonishing confession that “no one ever came to me or told me horror stories with any real seriousness,” implying that people did tell him about Weinstein but he, with that odd omniscience native to the very rich, deemed them insufficiently serious. It’s also totally clear why Allen felt untouchable enough to add that even if he had believed the “horror stories,” he wouldn’t have been interested, let alone concerned, because he is a serious man busy making serious man-art. He said people wouldn’t bother coming to him anyway, because, as he described it: “You’re not interested in it. You are interested in making your movie.” (That last bit is fair, actually. If I’d been sexually assaulted by Harvey Weinstein, literally my last instinct would be to go to Woody Allen for help.)

It’s clear because the cultural malfunction that allows Allen to feel comfortable issuing that statement is the same malfunction that gave us Allen and Weinstein in the first place: the smothering, delusional, galactic entitlement of powerful men.

When Allen and other men warn of “a witch hunt atmosphere, a Salem atmosphere” what they mean is an atmosphere in which they’re expected to comport themselves with the care, consideration and fear of consequences that the rest of us call basic professionalism and respect for shared humanity. On some level, to some men — and you can call me a hysteric but I am done mincing words on this — there is no injustice quite so unnaturally, viscerally grotesque as a white man being fired.

Google declined to explain the specifics of how the fake news ads appeared on the fact-checking sites. The accounts that advertised on Snopes and PolitiFact were terminated from Google’s ad platform after The Times asked about them, according to a person with knowledge of the sites who asked to remain anonymous because the details were confidential.

“As always, when we find deceptive ad practices on our platforms we move swiftly to take action, including suspending the advertiser account if appropriate,” Chi Hea Cho, a Google spokeswoman, said in a statement. “In addition, we give publishers controls so they can block specific types of ads and advertisers.”

When alerted to the ads promoting untrue stories on their sites, Snopes and PolitiFact said there was little they could do. Google’s AdSense, which is used by web publishers to sell display advertising on their sites, works through automated tools. Often, advertisers are unsure where their ads are running — sometimes next to inappropriate or offensive content — and site owners don’t know which ads will appear on their pages.

Vinny Green, Snopes’s co-owner and vice president, said it had tried to filter out misleading advertisements from the 150 million ads it displayed on its site last month. But that goes only so far.

“We have little direct oversight or control over what is being done to filter out fake news ads being served on our site,” he said in an email. He added that the online ad ecosystem was complicit in disseminating and profiting off of misinformation, and that “these ad quality problems are systemic.”

Aaron Sharockman, executive director of PolitiFact, said it was working with Google to remove the “questionable text ads” from its site.

“The revenue those advertisements provide is critical to funding a website like ours, but it’s equally important that we do everything we can to make sure the advertisements appearing on our site are not deceptive or intentionally misleading,” he said.

Google, which sells more online advertising than any other technology firm, has struggled to prevent fraudulent websites from making money off the spread of false stories. Earlier this year, it touted its efforts to crack down on misinformation sites by kicking 340 websites and 200 publishers off its AdSense platform. Most of those publishers had created websites to peddle eye-catching but untrue political stories, and loaded up the pages to get a cut of advertising revenue from Google.

But the websites that advertised on Snopes and PolitiFact took a different approach. Those publishers paid Google to promote their content on legitimate websites to draw traffic for an ad pretending to be a news story, often carrying the banner of a mainstream news publication.

Google has called the process “tabloid cloaking.” It has said these types of scammers use timely topics and ads made to look like new website headlines. Google said it suspended more than 1,300 advertiser accounts in 2016 for tabloid cloaking. This month, Google said it had introduced additional controls to help publishers filter out sensational or tabloid ads.

The ad heralding the untrue story about Mrs. Trump’s decision to leave Washington and the White House appeared at the top of PolitiFact last Friday. The display ad led to a fake Vogue news article claiming that the story was also featured on Yahoo, Vanity Fair and Time, among other publications.

On another PolitiFact page, there was another display ad promoting a false story about Mr. Osteen, the leader of Lakewood Church, a Houston-based megachurch, leaving his wife because she had said too much on TV. When clicked, the ad went to a fake Us Weekly page about how Mrs. Osteen was leaving the church to focus on her skin cream company.

The publisher of the fake Us Weekly site also bought a Google search ad, so that a query for the headline of the story “Sad News For Lakewood Church” linked to that same fake story.

In the case of the HGTV stars Joanna and Chip Gaines, the ad about the couple that ran on Snopes last week promoted a report that had been refuted already by the fact-checking site in an article a month earlier.

PolitiFact and Snopes are among the most influential and most popular fact-checking websites. Snopes was created in 1994 to debunk urban legends but has since evolved into a 16-person operation that also assesses political spin. PolitiFact, launched in 2007 as a service of the Tampa Bay Times, won a Pulitzer Prize for its work during the 2008 presidential election and has 14 state chapters in addition to a national operation.

Both PolitiFact and Snopes partnered with Facebook last December, after the social network was criticized for abetting the spread of fake news during the 2016 presidential election. Their experiment — in which viral and popular posts debunked by the fact checkers are marked as “disputed,” and cannot be promoted in News Feeds — expanded and became more aggressive in August.

Google, too, has attempted to dispel misinformation. Jigsaw, its tech incubator, developed a “Share the Facts” tool alongside the Duke University Reporters’ Lab.

David Carroll, an associate professor at the Parsons School of Design who has researched advertising technology and fake news, said Google and Facebook ultimately don’t know enough about their customers — advertisers — making it too easy to game the system without serious repercussions.

“This is where it happened,” my Russian guide declared. It was 1979 and I was a graduate student in Moscow for the summer. A side trip to Leningrad was a must for me, a first time traveler to the country. “Czar Alexander II was riding down this road when the assassins struck,” she said. Almost under her breath, she added, “He was a reformer.” Any hope for the liberalization of Russia seemed to die with the czar who had freed the serfs and attempted to modernize the country. Alexander II’s death brought to power his hard-line successor Alexander III, who initiated a harsh crackdown (among those soon executed was the older brother of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin). This would only sharpen the conflict in the country. Peasants had no bread. Workers’ lives were miserable and often endangered. And soldiers were forced into battle in the Great War, a fight they could not win. Alexander III’s son and successor, the hapless Nicholas II, would abdicate in 1917. The parliamentary government of Alexander Kerensky would survive less than a year.

From the Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood it was just a short walk across the square to the Winter Palace, where workers’ militias seized power and laid the foundation for the Bolshevik Revolution and more than seven decades of Communist rule. “Peace, Land and Bread,” they promised.

“Ten Days That Shook the World” captures the excitement of that moment. The author, John Reed, was an American who made no secret of his Bolshevik sympathies. He nevertheless provided a riveting and vivid — if not impartial — account of the most pivotal phase of the revolution, as viewed from the ground.

From his vantage point, Reed could only tell a part of the story, however. To fully understand the Bolshevik Revolution, one must also appreciate the long trajectory of Russian history.

It’s also totally clear why Allen felt untouchable enough to add that even if he had believed the “horror stories,” he wouldn’t have been interested, let alone concerned, because he is a serious man busy making serious man-art. He said people wouldn’t bother coming to him anyway, because, as he described it: “You’re not interested in it. You are interested in making your movie.” (That last bit is fair, actually. If I’d been sexually assaulted by Harvey Weinstein, literally my last instinct would be to go to Woody Allen for help.)

It’s clear because the cultural malfunction that allows Allen to feel comfortable issuing that statement is the same malfunction that gave us Allen and Weinstein in the first place: the smothering, delusional, galactic entitlement of powerful men.

When Allen and other men warn of “a witch hunt atmosphere, a Salem atmosphere” what they mean is an atmosphere in which they’re expected to comport themselves with the care, consideration and fear of consequences that the rest of us call basic professionalism and respect for shared humanity. On some level, to some men — and you can call me a hysteric but I am done mincing words on this — there is no injustice quite so unnaturally, viscerally grotesque as a white man being fired.

Donald Trump, our predator in chief, seems to view the election of Barack Obama as a white man being fired. He and his supporters are willing to burn the world in revenge. This whole catastrophic cultural moment was born of that same entitlement, of Trump’s paws and Weinstein’s unbelted bathrobe, of the ancient cycles of abuse that ghostwrote the Trump campaign’s real slogan: If I can’t have you, no one will.","Yes, This Is a Witch Hunt.

And the change will cost taxpayers more money — perhaps $21 billion more in 2018 alone. But, in the end, most customers will be unharmed by the president’s decision, and a substantial fraction will be better off, able to buy plans for about the same price they pay now, yet with lower deductibles.

The president’s move was to cut off a form of Obamacare funding known as the cost-sharing reduction subsidies. Those were payments the government made to health insurers to compensate them for lowering the deductibles and co-payments for low-income customers.

But he didn’t cut off another, more important form of subsidy. The Affordable Care Act also includes tax credits that help low- and middle-income Americans pay their insurance premiums. Those tax credits increase in value along with the price of a certain midlevel insurance plan, known as silver. If you qualify for a subsidy, you can never be asked to pay more for that plan than a set fraction of your income.

Insurers in more than 40 states have decided to compensate for the missing cost-sharing subsidies by making hefty increases to the prices of this silver plan — but small or no increases to their other plans. Consumers who qualify for subsidies are still asked to pay the same fraction of their income toward a health plan, and the federal government pays the insurers the rest of the higher silver-plan premium. So consumers are no worse off, and insurers make up for the loss of the cost-sharing subsidies canceled by Mr. Trump.

And for many Obamacare consumers, there’s also a silver lining in these pricier silver plans. There are other kinds of plans being sold on the marketplace: high-deductible plans called bronze and low-deductible plans called gold and platinum. Consumers can use their subsidy to buy any color plan they like. And, with the price of silver plans rising faster than the other categories, most consumers with subsidies will now be able to buy a lower-deductible health plan for the same price as the silver plans that are currently most popular on the exchanges. (They can also choose to buy high-deductible bronze plans for very low prices, or in some cases get them free.)

“This was a backdoor, unintended way of increasing premium subsidies for some people,” said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health research group.

The new pricing structure is the worst for people who earn too much to qualify for a subsidy — those earning more than four times the federal poverty level, or about $100,000 a year for a family of four. But most of them will also be protected from the cost increases. If they avoid silver plans sold on the Obamacare marketplaces in most states, they can find plans that don’t have the special, Trump-prompted increases. That means that unsubsidized customers who want to buy silver plans will probably need to shop outside of HealthCare.gov, through a human or online broker. Or they can buy a bronze, gold or platinum plan.

“It’s a convoluted kludge of a workaround,” said David Anderson, a research associate at the Duke University Margolis Center for Health Policy, who has looked closely at how carriers are pricing their plans. But Mr. Anderson said he thought the upside was strong enough that Congress should abandon its efforts to restore the canceled subsidies. “A lot of people are going to see during open enrollment that they are going to be able to afford a better plan with lower deductibles and lower premiums than they could this year,” he said.

There are still downsides. It is possible that insurers, worried about the lost payments and thin on trust for the federal government, will flee the markets before the enrollment period starts at the beginning of next month. But no major insurer departures have been announced since the president announced his decision on Thursday.

There are a few states where insurance regulators didn’t allow insurers to increase only their silver plan prices. In those states, subsidized customers will be held harmless — but no one will get a cheaper gold plan, and unsubsidized customers will face price increases. There are some states where there is no individual market outside the Obamacare marketplace, and in those places, unsubsidized customers won’t be able to get a good deal on a silver plan (though they can still buy another color plan).

Perhaps the biggest problem: Shopping for a plan is going to be harder. Many Obamacare customers who just renew this year’s plan will be passing up a better deal, and many scared of initial sticker shock may not realize there are cheaper options. In addition to eliminating the cost-sharing reduction subsidies, President Trump’s administration has also cut back on funds for advertising about the marketplaces and on professionals who help customers sign up. (The Alexander-Murray deal would restore much of that funding, but probably not soon enough to make a big difference.)

“It’s hard,” said Lori Lodes, a former Obama administration official and co-founder of a new nonprofit group, Get America Covered, focused on helping spread the word about Obamacare enrollment. She says she worries about growing consumer confusion: “My biggest concern is really I do not believe that the administration will educate people about this, and so there is going to be an information gap.”

But the Congressional Budget Office, when considering the effects of ending the cost-sharing subsidies a few months ago, concluded that, over time, the strategy of raising the price of only silver plans would become widespread, and that consumers would figure it out. It estimated that, by 2020, a world with no cost-sharing reductions would be a world with fewer uninsured Americans. The increased subsidies “would make purchasing nongroup insurance more attractive for some people,” increasing sign-ups, the report said.

Mr. Alexander and Ms. Murray’s newly announced proposal would fund the payments for two years, increase advertising for the marketplaces and make it easier for states to experiment on how they run their insurance markets. Mr. Trump has indicated that he might sign such a bill. But the deal, even if it does pass Congress, comes too late to affect insurance prices for next year. In 2018, at least, we will be living in a world of high-priced silver plans. Luckily for those who need insurance, that may not turn out as badly as many people had feared.",Trump’s Attack on Insurer ‘Gravy Train’ Could Actually Help a Lot of Consumers,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/upshot/trumps-attack-on-insurer-gravy-train-could-actually-help-a-lot-of-consumers.html

First: The bipartisan health care deal in the Senate, announced yesterday, is a very good deal.

It undoes two of President Trump’s attempts to sabotage the law, by reinstating reimbursement payments to insurers and by encouraging people to sign up for insurance. It also gives states some more flexibility, a longtime conservative priority. Perhaps above all, it’s a sign that some leading Republicans are finally serious about trying to improve the health care system.

The deal, John McCain said, “shows that good faith, bipartisan negotiations can achieve consensus on lasting reform.” Democratic-leaning experts were full of praise for it too, saying that, while it didn’t void all of Trump’s mischief, it was major progress. Jacob Leibenluft, a former Obama adviser, called the deal the “first concession” from Republicans that “they will own health care markets in 2018 and 2020.”

The biggest caveat: The deal — between Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat, and Lamar Alexander, a Tennessee Republican — is still just a framework. It must pass both houses of Congress and be signed by Trump.

MONDAY PUZZLES — If you make odd connections between things as I do, the crossword might bring out different things for you. Jennifer Nutt, who wrote today’s lovely Monday crossword, probably did not have this in mind when she created it, but her puzzle brought this up for me, so I’m going to tell you a story.

The first time I visited Cape Town, I took the ferry to Robben Island to see the prison — now a museum — where former South African president Nelson Mandela and many others who resisted the National Party during the apartheid era were held. It’s the kind of thing that is expected of first-time visitors (“Oh, you must go!”) and I’m a student of history, so I climbed aboard the boat and off I went.

Cape Town is a very windy city because of its location between the mountains and the sea, and on that day, the wind was working against the ferry as it made its way across the water. With no warning, a pod of humpback whales appeared in the water at the front of the boat, and skimmed over the water toward the island, almost as if to lead us in. When we slowed down, they would loop back and continue to guide us. It was a very touching sight, almost as if they were saying, “Follow us. There are secrets to be told here.” Once we were close to the shore, they dispersed and made their way back out to sea.

The tour, which is more a heartbreaking example of man’s inhumanity to man than a tourist trap curiosity, lasted about an hour and included talks by both former prisoners and the Afrikaaner guards who had held them captive. They had returned to educate mostly foreign visitors about a relatively recent period in history (1948 — 1994) where a nationalist government had succeeded in discriminating despicably against black Africans and criminalizing interaction between the races. There were also a surprising number of white South Africans in our group.

Yet for much of the last century, until 1994, photography in the city’s rapid transit system was illegal (though it was a spottily enforced offense). In the late 1930s — soon after the city imposed its ban — Helen Levitt, a young Bensonhurst native, apprenticed with Walker Evans as he photographed unsuspecting commuters.

Mr. Evans hoped to capture the “parade of unselfconscious captive sitters,” so to avoid being caught, he painted his 35 mm camera black, tucked it into his coat with the lens poking out from between buttons, and triggered the shutter with a cable release that snaked down his sleeve.

Ms. Levitt’s task? She distracted the passengers.

Not surprisingly, Ms. Levitt was soon taking her own subway portraits, first with Mr. Evans’s gear, and then with her own camera, possibly using the same technique. Though Ms. Levitt moved into cinematography and was eventually nominated for an Academy Award, she would, three years after Mr. Evans died in 1975, return underground to photograph passengers. A new book called, “Manhattan Transit: The Subway Photographs of Helen Levitt,” released by Walther Konig Verlag, compiles photographs from both decades.

It is clear which photographs were taken when, with those from the 1930s featuring art deco posters, elaborate furs, and jauntily-tilted hats, while those from the 1970s had equally elegant sitters, but against the backdrop of graffiti. In some photos, the subjects appear to be looking right at Ms. Levitt, adding further mystery about her technique.

It’s hard to know how she operated, since Ms. Levitt, who died at age 95 in 2009, spoke little of her work. “If it were easy to talk about, I’d be a writer,” she said. “Since I’m inarticulate, I express myself with images.”

employee, who resigned from the agency,” Mr. Marino said, suggesting that “his assertions may be motivated by financial self interest.”","Mr. Trump said he spoke with Mr. Marino and praised him as “a fine man” who “feels very strongly about the opioid problem.” Speaking on Fox News Radio, the president said, “If there’s even a perception that he has a conflict of interest, he doesn’t want anything to do with it.”

Mr. Trump has said he will formally declare the opioid crisis a national emergency next week in an effort to draw more attention to the problem and free up resources to fight it. He has not disclosed other elements of his plan. And critics said that Mr. Trump would have made the problem worse had Congress passed his proposal to repeal the Affordable Care Act, under which lower-income Americans get treatment.

“The fact that he was nominated in the first place is further evidence that when it comes to the opioid crisis, the Trump administration talks the talk, but refuses to walk the walk,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said on the Senate floor after Mr. Marino’s withdrawal. “The bottom line is, this congressman supported President Trump, but is the wrong person for the job.”

But the congressman’s fall also presented tough questions for Democrats, who supported without dissent the same industry-friendly legislation that Mr. Marino championed. The bill passed both houses of Congress last year with unanimous consent and then was signed into law by Mr. Obama.

“Lest we forget, President Obama signed the bill into law on the advice of his own D.E.A. administrator,” said Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah who pushed the legislation with Mr. Marino.

The legislation and Mr. Marino’s role were featured in a joint investigation by CBS News’s “60 Minutes” and The Washington Post on drug industry influence in Washington. The law changed the standard required before the Drug Enforcement Administration could freeze suspicious sales of painkillers to cut the flow of opioids into the black market.

Instead of requiring a finding that shipments posed an “imminent danger” to the community, the D.E.A. now has to conclude that they represent “a substantial likelihood of an immediate threat,” according to the Post.

The drug and medical industries complained that D.E.A. enforcement efforts were curbing the availability of legal painkillers for patients who legitimately need them. In his statement on Tuesday, Mr. Marino called the legislation “a balanced solution for ensuring those who genuinely needed access to certain medications were able to do while also empowering” law enforcement efforts.

The D.E.A. and the Justice Department accepted the change after beating back what they considered more problematic versions. Law enforcement officials were worried about a proposal to require the D.E.A. to find evidence of intent before it could freeze suspicious shipments, a provision that would have made it much harder to take action. That was kept out of the final version.

Once the D.E.A. and the Justice Department signaled they could live with the legislation, lawmakers from both parties went along. When it was sent to Mr. Obama, the White House drug policy office conferred with the Justice Department and D.E.A. “They indicated that they did not see this bill as substantially diminishing any legal authority to pursue investigations,” said Michael Botticelli, the drug czar at the time. “As a result, we deferred to D.E.A. as is common practice.”

Mr. Obama’s office referred questions to Mr. Botticelli on Tuesday, but there was a division among former officials of the last administration. Some argued the change was not especially meaningful and that they were not aware of any instances when it prevented the D.E.A. from taking action that it would have taken before the law.

But a draft article by the D.E.A. chief administrative law judge concluded otherwise and some Obama administration veterans expressed chagrin that the legislation had not been flagged. In hindsight, they said the D.E.A.’s acceptance of the legislation underscored concerns that the agency was not aggressive enough in tackling the spread of opioids.

Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, said she was introducing legislation to overturn the law. Mr. Trump did not say whether he would support such a move.

The law was a priority of the drug industry, which spent more than $100 million lobbying Congress between 2014 and 2016, according to The Post. Mr. Marino received $100,000 in campaign contributions from political action committees affiliated with the industry. But the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America said in a statement that it “did not support or lobby in favor” of the bill and later on Tuesday evening called for it to be repealed.

Fueling the dispute was a personality clash involving Mr. Marino and a former top D.E.A. official, Joseph T. Rannazzisi. Known as a hard charger who pushed for tougher enforcement against drug distributors, Mr. Rannazzisi was admired by some for his zeal but criticized by others for being unwilling even to meet with drug companies before taking enforcement action.

During consideration of an earlier version of the legislation, Mr. Rannazzisi told congressional aides that lawmakers who supported it would have “blood on their hands,” according to former officials briefed on the conversation. Mr. Marino heard about that and grew furious. During a hearing, he complained that Mr. Rannazzisi had accused bill sponsors of “supporting criminals,” adding, “This offends me immensely.”

Mr. Rannazzisi, who left the agency in 2015 and could not be reached on Tuesday, denied to The Post that he said that. “I said that this bill is going to protect defendants that we have under investigation,” he told The Post. “And if they don’t like the truth, well, I don’t know what to tell ‘em.”

The former officials said the episode spurred Mr. Marino’s efforts to pass at least some version of the bill. In his statement on Tuesday, Mr. Marino lashed out at Mr. Rannazzisi. “Specifically, I cannot allow false allegations made by a former D.E.A. employee, who resigned from the agency,” Mr. Marino said, suggesting that “his assertions may be motivated by financial self interest.”","Tom Marino, Drug Czar Nominee, Withdraws in Latest Setback for Trump’s Opioid Fight",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/us/politics/trump-says-drug-czar-nominee-tom-marino-withdraws-from-consideration.html

President Trump has made a habit of filling important jobs with people dedicated to undermining the laws they’re supposed to administer while pampering the industries they’re supposed to regulate. His nominee for the Environmental Protection Agency’s top clean air post, William Wehrum, is a retread from the George W. Bush administration with a deep doctrinal dislike of clean air regulations. His choice to run the White House Council on Environmental Quality is borderline comical: Kathleen Hartnett White, a former Texas official who believes that the main greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, is harmless. Yet no nomination has been as brazen, as dangerous to public health and as deserving of Senate rejection as that of Michael Dourson to run the E.P.A. office in charge of reviewing chemicals used in agriculture, industry and household products.

Mr. Dourson is a scientist for hire. A toxicologist and a professor at the University of Cincinnati, he has a long history of consulting for chemical companies and conducting studies paid for with industry money. He frequently decided that the compounds he was evaluating were safe at exposure levels that are far more dangerous to public health than levels recommended by the E.P.A., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other agencies. His nomination is enthusiastically endorsed by the chemical industry. It horrifies environmental groups, public health advocates, firefighters and scientists and has inspired many letters in opposition to the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which may vote as early as Wednesday.

Among the chemicals that received a favorable nod from Mr. Dourson is 1,4-dioxane, which is used by paint and coating manufacturers and is also found in shampoos and other personal care products. His analysis recommended a safe level that was 1,000 times higher than the E.P.A.’s recommended level; the agency considers the chemical “a likely carcinogen.”

Another is PFOA, a chemical used by DuPont to make nonstick surfaces. The compound has been linked to cancers, thyroid diseases and other health problems. Working for West Virginia on the recommendation of DuPont, Mr. Dourson in 2002 helped establish a safety threshold of 150 parts per billion for PFOA in drinking water. That is substantially higher than the standard of 1 part per billion that DuPont’s own scientists had recommended more than a decade earlier, and higher still than the health advisory level of 0.07 parts per billion set by the E.P.A. last year.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

More broadly troubling is that Mr. Dourson, if approved, will set back an arduous, yearslong effort to improve the regulation of chemicals. Last year, after many false starts, Congress passed a bipartisan bill that updated the Toxic Substances Control Act, a 1976 law that had made it very hard for regulators to ban or regulate chemicals by requiring the E.P.A. to meet a very high burden of proof before taking action. The law also made it easy for companies to keep data about their products hidden from the public by claiming the information was a “trade secret.” The new law simplified the task by streamlining it, directing the E.P.A. to review at least 20 substances at a time, giving priority to the riskiest chemicals. The money to do this work will come from up to $25 million in annual fees paid by chemical manufacturers and processors.

Experts fear that if confirmed Mr. Dourson will put a much greater emphasis on pleasing the chemical industry than on protecting public health. He could, for instance, order his staff to cherry-pick studies and data that in turn would lead to lax standards or even allow the continued use of chemicals that ought to be banned outright. In March, the E.P.A. administrator, Scott Pruitt, rejected a staff recommendation to ban the pesticide chlorpyrifos, which scientists believe has harmed farm workers and children. Any decisions Mr. Dourson would make would most likely remain in place for years or even decades.

In a statement issued shortly after Lieutenant Kelly’s death, Mr. Kelly and his wife noted that “the nation he served has honored us with promoting him posthumously to first lieutenant of Marines.”

Other military commanders noted that neither Mr. Obama nor President George W. Bush routinely called the families of fallen soldiers because that would have been logistically impossible. It could also raise questions about why one family merited a call but another did not.

“It’s been my observation in all the years I’ve been in the military that all presidents, as commander in chief, feel an enormous sense of loss and compassion and pain about those who are killed under their command,” said Jack Keane, a retired four-star Army general. “How they express that is entirely up to them, and I think we should respect that.”

Referring to Mr. Trump’s predecessors, Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said on Twitter: “POTUS 43 & 44 and first ladies cared deeply, worked tirelessly for the serving, the fallen, and their families. Not politics. Sacred Trust.”

Other former Obama officials castigated Mr. Trump for what they said was a cynical mischaracterization of Mr. Obama’s record, which included regular visits to Dover Air Force Base to greet the coffins of returning forces, pilgrimages to Arlington National Cemetery and visits to wounded troops at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.

“Stop the damn lying — you’re the President,” former Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. wrote on Twitter. “I went to Dover AFB with 44 and saw him comfort the families of both the fallen military & DEA.”

When Mr. Trump made the comparison to Mr. Obama and other former presidents at a news conference on Monday, he dialed back his initial assertion that Mr. Obama did not call the families of fallen service members when a reporter asked him about it again.

“President Obama, I think, probably did sometimes and maybe sometimes he didn’t,” Mr. Trump said, standing in the Rose Garden alongside Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader. “That’s what I was told. All I can do is ask my generals.”

On Tuesday, it became clear that Mr. Trump’s source was Mr. Kelly, a former commander of the military’s Southern Command, whom he recruited in July from the Department of Homeland Security to serve as chief of staff. Officials credit Mr. Kelly with imposing discipline on an unruly West Wing staff and on how information is given to the president.

As a wartime commander, Mr. Kelly led troops in intense combat in western Iraq. In 2003, he became the first Marine colonel since 1951 to be promoted to brigadier general while in active combat.

The death of Mr. Kelly’s son may have played a role in his selection to the cabinet. During the transition, people close to Mr. Trump said he wanted people on his national security team who understood personally the hazards of sending Americans into battle.

But Mr. Kelly has been reluctant to discuss his son. He asked the hosts of the eulogy he gave, in St. Louis in 2010, not to mention Lieutenant Kelly when they introduced him.

Asked about his son on Memorial Day in an interview on Fox & Friends, Mr. Kelly, his voice choking, replied, “Finest guy.”

“Wonderful guy. Wonderful husband. Wonderful son. Wonderful brother. Brave beyond all get out,” he added. “His men still correspond with us. They still mourn him as we do.”",Top General’s Grief Becomes Political Talking Point for Trump,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/us/politics/john-kelly-trump-fallen-troops.html

That doesn’t mean a return to the glory days of private offices, but it does mean workers have more space and more places to seek solitude than in the neo-Dickensian workbench settings. The new designs often include “isolation rooms,” soundproof phone booths, and even lounges where technology is forbidden.

And it’s meant to be tweaked as needs change. “This continues to be iterated,” said Frank Cuevas, who is working on a major redesign at IBM — and whose use of the word “iterated” hints at the kind of start-up mentality the changes are intended to evoke.

“It’s not something we’re going stop and say, ‘This is it,’” he said.

The corporations setting the new standard are not young Silicon Valley companies known for free food, slides and foosball tables at work — or for carefree spending, as at Apple, whose new corporate mothership cost a reported $5 billion. Nor are the designs one-of-a-kind projects that veer toward eccentricity. Salesforce’s new skyscraper campus in San Francisco, for example, has areas on every floor for meditation, partly inspired by the teachings of Thich Nhat Hanh, a Buddhist monk.

Instead, the companies behind the emerging new norm in workplace design are a lineup of more staid companies across a range of industries, and they may spend heavily but also systematically. They include Microsoft, IBM and General Electric. Certain workspace innovations may surface first at Google or Facebook, but the older stalwarts are combining and refining them for mainstream businesses.

“These workplace ideas are beginning to be adopted across all industries,” said Arlyn Vogelmann, a principal at Gensler, an architecture and design firm whose clients include Facebook and G.E.

The new designs are not about looks. They are an attempt to adapt to the spread of internet-era digital technology — and its hurry-up ways — into every industry. Space drives behavior, experts say, and the goal of the new designs is to hasten the pace of sharing ideas, making decisions and creating new products. They are also meant to appeal to millennial recruits, many of whom are more comfortable working in a Starbucks than in a traditional office.

The new model eschews the common dogmas of work life: Everybody gets an office, or everyone gets a cubicle, or everybody gets a seat on a workbench. A diversity of spaces, experts say, is more productive, and the new concept is called “activity-based workplace design,” tailoring spaces for the kind of work done.

“Office geography matters, and it can be a key managerial lever to increase communication and the cross-fertilization of ideas,” said Christopher Liu, an assistant professor at the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto.

One of the most aggressive makeovers is happening at Microsoft, a change forced by business necessity. The company faces a new wave of technology, as the market has shifted to software delivered and constantly updated as a service over the internet cloud, as opposed to being loaded onto individual computers, with the code often stored on compact discs and sold as a product every few years. To compete, Microsoft has had to adopt a faster pace.

“You have to collaborate more,” said Michael Ford, Microsoft’s general manager of global real estate. “We absolutely have to change.”

For decades, the company, based outside Seattle, housed its software engineers in secluded offices, thinking that the privacy helped employees focus while writing computer code. But in 2010, Microsoft started testing open designs with a quarter of a floor, and then expanded. Since 2014, it has opened 10 renovated buildings without offices, including four this year.

Microsoft, Mr. Ford said, has taken a test-and-learn approach. It learned, for example, that its early designs were too open plan, with 16 to 24 engineers in team-based spaces. Engineers found those spaces noisy and distracting, and concentration suffered. Too much openness can cause workers to “do a turtle,” researchers say, and retrench and communicate less — colleagues who retreat into their headphones all day, for example

Today, there are more private spaces, and the team areas hold only eight to 12 engineers. “That’s the sweet spot for Microsoft,” Mr. Ford said.

The company thinks it is working. Microsoft’s Azure cloud software business has surged in the last few years, as has the company’s stock price. Mr. Ford said about 20 percent of the workplaces have been redone on Microsoft’s campus in Redmond, Wash., and the surrounding area. Within five years, he said, he expects the renovated share to reach 80 percent.

Offices, he said, will not disappear entirely, but they will be reserved mainly for people who regularly have confidential conversations, like lawyers and top executives.",Don’t Get Too Comfortable at That Desk,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/business/the-office-gets-remade-again.html

A mutual friend of Cuddy and Simmons’s from graduate school, Kenworthey Bilz, a professor of law at the University of Illinois, tried to reassure Cuddy.
On Sept. 26, 2016, Amy Cuddy woke up and checked her phone to find a chilling text from a friend.
It’s not good.”If Amy Cuddy is a victim, she may not seem an obvious one: She has real power, a best-selling book, a thriving speaking career.
“Science isn’t about consensus.” Cuddy was entitled to her position; the evidence in favor or against power posing would speak for itself.","The video is now TED’s second-most popular, having been seen, to date, by some 43 million viewers. In the years after the talk, Cuddy became a sought-after speaker, a quasi celebrity and, eventually, the author of a best-selling book, “Presence,” in 2015. The power pose became the sun salutation for the professional woman on the cusp of leaning in. Countless hopefuls, male and female, locked themselves in bathroom stalls before job interviews to make victory V’s with their arms; media trainers had their speakers dutifully practice the pose before approaching the stage. Cuddy has gone on to give talks on power and the body (including power posing) and stereotyping to women’s groups in Australia, at youth homeless shelters, to skin-care workers by the thousands, to employees at Target and agents at State Farm Insurance. Cuddy’s fans approach her in airports, on ski slopes in Telluride, in long lines after her talks, to hug or to thank her, filled with their own power-posing stories — sharing how bold body language helped them get their jobs or win some match or confront a bully at work.

But since 2015, even as she continued to stride onstage and tell the audiences to face down their fears, Cuddy has been fighting her own anxieties, as fellow academics have subjected her research to exceptionally high levels of public scrutiny. She is far from alone in facing challenges to her work: Since 2011, a methodological reform movement has been rattling the field, raising the possibility that vast amounts of research, even entire subfields, might be unreliable. Up-and-coming social psychologists, armed with new statistical sophistication, picked up the cause of replications, openly questioning the work their colleagues conducted under a now-outdated set of assumptions. The culture in the field, once cordial and collaborative, became openly combative, as scientists adjusted to new norms of public critique while still struggling to adust to new standards of evidence.

Cuddy, in particular, has emerged from this upheaval as a unique object of social psychology’s new, enthusiastic spirit of self-flagellation — as if only in punishing one of its most public stars could it fully break from its past. At conferences, in classrooms and on social media, fellow academics (or commenters on their sites) have savaged not just Cuddy’s work but also her career, her income, her ambition, even her intelligence, sometimes with evident malice. Last spring, she quietly left her tenure-track job at Harvard.

Some say that she has gained fame with an excess of confidence in fragile results, that she prized her platform over scientific certainty. But many of her colleagues, and even some who are critical of her choices, believe that the attacks on her have been excessive and overly personal. What seems undeniable is that the rancor of the critiques reflects the emotional toll among scientists forced to confront the fear that what they were doing all those years may not have been entirely scientific.

One of the seminal social-psychology studies, at the turn of the 20th century, asked a question that at the time was a novel one: How does the presence of other people change an individual’s behavior? Norman Triplett, a psychologist at Indiana University, found that when he asked children to execute a simple task (winding line on a fishing rod), they performed better in the company of other children than they did when alone in a room. Over the following decades, a new discipline grew up within psychology to further interrogate group dynamics: how social groups react in certain circumstances, how the many can affect the one.

The questions grew even more profound, using experiments to tease out universal susceptibilities, raising the possibility that behavior was more easily swayed by outside forces than personality researchers previously believed. The field reached a moment of unusual visibility in the mid-20th century, as practitioners, many of them Jewish refugees or first-generation immigrants from Europe, explored, post-World War II, the way group pressures or authority figures could influence human behavior. In one simple study on conformity in 1951, the social psychologist Solomon Asch found that people would agree that one drawn line matched the length of another — even if it clearly did not — if others around them all agreed that it did. In subsequent years, researchers like Stanley Milgram (who tested how people weighed their consciences against the demands of authority) and Philip Zimbardo (who observed the effect of power on students assigned as either prison guards or prisoners) rejected the traditional confines of the lab for more theatrical displays of human nature. “They felt the urgency of history,” says Rebecca Lemov, a professor of the history of science at Harvard. “They really wanted to make people look.”

Since the late 1960s, the field’s psychologists have tried to elevate the scientific rigor of their work, introducing controls and carefully designed experiments like the ones found in medicine. Increasingly complex ideas about the workings of the unconscious yielded research with the charm of mesmerists’ shows, revealing unlikely forces that seem to guide our behavior: that simply having people wash their hands could change their sense of culpability; that people’s evaluations of risk could easily be rendered irrational; that once people have made a decision, they curiously give more weight to information in its favor. Humans, the research often suggested, were reliably mercurial, highly suggestible, profoundly irrational, tricksters better at fooling ourselves than anyone else.

Already relatively accessible to the public, the field became even more influential with the rise of behavioral economics in the 1980s and 1990s, as visionaries like Richard Thaler, (who won the Nobel Prize in economics this month) found applications for counterintuitive social-psychology insights that could be used to guide policy. In 2000, Malcolm Gladwell, the author of the best-selling “Tipping Point,” applied irresistible storytelling to the science, sending countless journalists to investigate similar terrain and inspiring social psychologists to write books of their own. In 2006, Daniel Gilbert, a professor of psychology at Harvard, published the best seller “Stumbling on Happiness” — a book that tried to explain why we plan so poorly for our own future. That same year, TED started airing its first videos, offering a new stage for social psychologists with compelling findings, ideally surprising ones. The field was experiencing a visibility unknown since the midcentury; business schools, eager for social psychologists’ insights into leadership and decision-making, started pursuing social psychologists, with better pay and more funding than psychology graduate schools could offer.

This moment of fizziness for the discipline was already underway when Cuddy arrived at Princeton’s graduate program in 2000, transferring there to follow her adviser, Susan Fiske, with whom she first worked at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. She moved to Princeton with her husband at the time — they later divorced — and in her second year there, she had a child. Her academic work continued to thrive as she collaborated with Fiske on research on stereotyping, which found that groups of people (for example of a particular ethnicity) who were judged as nice were assumed to be less competent and vice versa. (“Just Because I’m Nice Don’t Assume I’m Dumb,” was the headline of a Harvard Business Review by Cuddy.) Fiske and Cuddy’s resulting papers are still heavily cited, formulating a framework for stereotyping that proved hugely influential on the field.

And yet, especially early on at Princeton, Cuddy felt uncertain of her place there. She feared that her brain simply could not function at a high-enough level to power her through the program. Cuddy suffered a traumatic brain injury in a car accident the summer after her sophomore year in college, when a friend of hers fell asleep at the wheel while Cuddy was asleep in the back seat. In the months after the accident, Cuddy was told she should not expect to finish college; her fog was so deep that she remembers being retaught how to shop for groceries. Even after Cuddy recovered, her friends told her that she had changed, that she was not the same person — but she could not remember who she had been before. It took her four years and multiple false starts before she could return to college. Even after she was accepted to graduate school at University of Massachusetts, she confessed to Fiske that she feared she would not be able to keep up with the work.

Cuddy was trained as a ballet dancer — in between her stints at college, she danced as an apprentice with the Colorado Ballet — but her interest in studying the body and its relationship to power did not begin until 2009, her first year as a teacher at Harvard Business School. At the invitation of her department chair, she joined a small circle of academics meeting with Joe Navarro, a former F.B.I. agent who had written a book about body language. The invited parties, which included Dana Carney, a professor at Columbia University who studied body language and power, all spoke briefly about their work. In the conversation that followed, Navarro pointed out that Cuddy’s own body language, during her presentation, signaled insecurity: She was fiddling with her necklace, wrapping her arms around her torso.

Carney and Cuddy had been noticing the same kinds of body language in their female students, who performed well on written materials but lost points, compared with their male counterparts, on class participation. Their body language was constricted; they raised their hands with their elbows cradled in their other hands; they made themselves physically small; they spoke less often.

The two researchers wondered whether people whose physical cues looked like their female students’ — self-protective, insecure — would feel more powerful or even change their behavior if they simply adopted more expansive body positions.

Carney and Cuddy brainstormed a research project to test this question. At Columbia, Carney recruited students, telling them that they were part of a study intended to measure the effects of placing an electrocardiograph’s electrodes either above or below the heart. In the study of 42 subjects that they eventually published, experimenters arranged half the students into positions associated with high power (leaning back in a chair with feet crossed on a desk, for example) and half the students into positions associated with low power (like crossing arms in front of the body). Before and after the poses, experimenters took saliva swabs from the students to measure how the positions affected cortisol and testosterone levels. They also asked the students to report (before and after the poses) how in charge and powerful they felt on a scale of one to four (a measurement known as “self-reported feelings of power”). And they measured whether that feeling had what researchers call a “downstream effect” — a resulting behavior. People who feel power, the literature suggests, are more likely to engage in a range of certain behaviors, including risk-taking; so the experiment also measured the subjects’ willingness to bet on a roll of the dice.

“I remember how happy we were when Dana called me with the results,” Cuddy says. “Everything went in the direction it was supposed to.” The abstract that they eventually wrote — that their editors approved — reflects the incautious enthusiasm that characterized the era: “That a person can, by assuming two simple 1-min poses, embody power and instantly become more powerful, has real-world, actionable implications.”

In 2014, on a podcast called “Story Collider,” Cuddy connects the study that made her so famous with the accident that subtly shifted her identity. After the crash, she recalled, she felt as if she were merely passing for herself, an inauthentic version of who she used to be. It made sense, then, that she ended up “studying how people can become their aspirational selves,” she said. “How can you become a self that you are not now?”

The year that Amy Cuddy published her power-posing paper, Joseph Simmons, who attended graduate school at Princeton with Cuddy, was starting to think about his own seminal paper, one that would, unknown to either of them, have as much influence on her life as it would on his own; it would, in fact, change not just their lives but the field as they knew it, with wildly differing consequences for each of them.

Cuddy and Simmons, each of whom came from working-class backgrounds, had been fond of each other at Princeton, even if they did not socialize often: Cuddy was a new mother, and Simmons was five years younger and heavily committed to his softball team. Simmons considered Cuddy a friend, someone he was always happy to see at a party, despite their obvious differences: Cuddy, who used to follow the Grateful Dead, would have been the one dancing at the party, while Simmons would have been the one laughing with his close friend, a fellow graduate student named Leif Nelson, about the latest buzzy journal article that seemed, to them, ridiculous.

Having arrived at Princeton wide-eyed, straight from Mount St. Mary’s College in Maryland, Simmons, within a few years, appeared to some of his classmates to have lost some of his idealism about academia; maybe he exhibited his idealism about science in a way that could be mistaken for cynicism. Simmons had an unusual interest in statistics, the way its airtight logic could neatly prove, or disprove, the worth of an extravagant idea. He and Nelson were endlessly critical of other studies’ findings, an intellectual exercise they enjoyed and considered essential. The two of them, Nelson says, were “into thinking about subtleties in data collection and analysis.”

After finishing a postdoctoral program at Princeton, Simmons lost touch with Cuddy, who was by then teaching at Northwestern. He remained close to Nelson, who had befriended a behavioral scientist, also a skeptic, Uri Simonsohn. Nelson and Simonsohn kept up an email correspondence for years. They, along with Simmons, took particular umbrage when a prestigious journal accepted a paper from an emeritus professor of psychology at Cornell, Daryl Bem, who claimed that he had strong evidence for the existence of extrasensory perception. The paper struck them as the ultimate in bad-faith science. “How can something not be possible to cause something else?” Nelson says. “Oh, you reverse time, then it can’t.” And yet the methodology was supposedly sound. After years of debating among themselves, the three of them resolved to figure out how so many researchers were coming up with such unlikely results.

Over the course of several months of conference calls and computer simulations, the three researchers eventually determined that the enemy of science — subjectivity — had burrowed its way into the field’s methodology more deeply than had been recognized. Typically, when researchers analyzed data, they were free to make various decisions, based on their judgment, about what data to maintain: whether it was wise, for example, to include experimental subjects whose results were really unusual or whether to exclude them; to add subjects to the sample or exclude additional subjects because of some experimental glitch. More often than not, those decisions — always seemingly justified as a way of eliminating noise — conveniently strengthened the findings’ results. The field (hardly unique in this regard) had approved those kinds of tinkering for years, underappreciating just how powerfully they skewed the results in favor of false positives, particularly if two or three analyses were underway at the same time. The three eventually wrote about this phenomenon in a paper called “False-Positive Psychology,” published in 2011. “Everyone knew it was wrong, but they thought it was wrong the way it’s wrong to jaywalk,” Simmons recently wrote in a paper taking stock of the field. “We decided to write ‘False-Positive Psychology’ when simulations revealed it was wrong the way it’s wrong to rob a bank.”

Simmons called those questionable research practices P-hacking, because researchers used them to lower a crucial measure of statistical significance known as the P-value. The P stands for probable, as in: How probable is it that researchers would happen to get the results they achieved — or even more extreme ones — if there were no phenomena, in truth, to observe? (And no systematic error.) For decades, the standard of so-called statistical significance — also the hurdle to considering a study publishable — has been a P-value of less than 5 percent.

To examine how easily the science could be manipulated, Simmons and Simonsohn ran a study in which they asked 20 participants their ages (and their fathers’ birthdays). Half the group listened to the Beatles song “When I’m Sixty-Four”; the other listened to a control (the instrumental music “Kalimba”). Using totally standard methodology common to the field, they were able to prove that the participants who listened to the Beatles song were magically a year and a half younger than they were before they had heard the music. The subject heading of the explanation: “How Bad Can It Be? A Demonstration of Chronological Rejuvenation.” It was witty, it was relatable — everyone understood that it was a critique of the fundamental soundness of the field.

“We realized entire literatures could be false positives,” Simmons says. They had collaborated with enough other researchers to recognize that the practice was widespread and counted themselves among the guilty. “I P-hacked like crazy all through my time at Princeton, and I still couldn’t get interesting results,” Simmons says.

The paper generated its fair share of attention, but it was not until January 2012, at a tense conference of the Society of Personality and Social Psychology in San Diego, that social psychologists began to glimpse the iceberg looming ahead — the sliding furniture, the recriminations, the crises of conscience and finger-pointing and side-taking that would follow. At the conference, several hundred academics crowded into the room to hear Simmons and his colleagues challenge the methodology of their field. First, Leslie John, then a graduate student, now an associate professor at the Harvard School of Business, presented a survey of 2,000 social psychologists that suggested that P-hacking, as well as other questionable research practices, were common. In his presentation, Simonsohn introduced a new concept, a graph that could be used to evaluate bodies of research, using the P-values of those studies (the lower the overall P-values, the better). He called it a P-curve and suggested that it could be used, for example, to evaluate the research that a prospective job candidate submitted. To some, the implication of the combined presentations seemed clear: The field was rotten with the practice, and egregious P-hackers should not get away with it.

Journal-paper presentations on statistics are usually unremarkable affairs, but this one precipitated a sequence of exchanges so public that the field had to take notice. The first took place during that event, with Norbert Schwarz, an eminent social psychologist, in the audience. Schwarz, as he listened, grew furious: He believed that the methodology of the survey was flawed, and he indignantly objected to the idea of the P-curve as a kind of litmus test aimed at individuals. He would not let these ideas go uncontested; he interrupted loudly from the front row, violating standard academic etiquette. “The whole room was like, ‘Oh, my God, what just happened?’ ” recalls Brian Nosek, a social psychologist who now runs the Center for Open Science, intended to encourage and normalize replications. Others quietly thanked Schwarz for bravely speaking up.

Not content to stop there, Schwarz followed up four days later with an open letter to 5,000 members of the society’s listserv, explaining in further detail, and with some condescension, his reservations. Although Simonsohn was angry, he still hoped to cool down the conversation. He emailed Schwarz asking if they could talk, so that they could come to a sort of understanding, in the name of science, and release a joint statement. Schwarz agreed but told Simonsohn, over the course of several email exchanges, that he needed more time. Simonsohn lost patience after three weeks: He posted large parts of the email exchange on his personal website, then posted a blistering attack on Schwarz on the society’s listserv, filled with bold caps and underlines, in which he said, among other things, that he knew firsthand that Schwarz had engaged in P-hacking.

“I regret it,” Simonsohn says now about posting the emails. Since then, Simmons, Simonsohn and Nelson say they have given a lot of thought to codes of conduct for communicating responsibly when conveying concerns about a scientist’s work. But the academic blowup between Simonsohn, then a relative unknown in social psychology, and Schwarz, the standard-bearer, signaled from the beginning that leaders on each side would ignore the norms of scientific discourse in an effort to discredit the other. One imminent shift in methods would bring another shift — one of tone — that would affect the field almost as drastically.

After 2012, questions of methodology started dominating every social-psychology conference, as did the topic of replications. Across disciplines, a basic scientific principle is that multiple teams should independently verify a result before it is accepted as true. But for the majority of social-psychology results, even the most influential ones, this hadn’t happened. Bryan Nosek, who started the Reproducibility Project (now called the Center for Open Science), an effort to test 100 important social-psychology papers, said that recognition of potential flawed methodology only fueled interest in his project. “The paper shone a light on how easily things could go wrong,” Nosek says. “Knowing that possibility in concept made the Reproducibility Project a test case in some people’s mind of ‘Does it?’ ”

For years, researchers treated journal articles, and their authors, with a genteel respect; even in the rare cases where a new study explicitly contradicted an old one, the community assumed that a lab error must account for the discrepancy. There was no incentive to replicate, in any case: Journals were largely not interested in studies that had already been done, and failed replications made people (maybe even your adviser) uncomfortable.

But in the years after that Society of Personality and Social Psychology conference, a sense of urgency propelled a generation of researchers, most of them under 40, to re-examine the work of other, more established researchers. And politeness was no longer a priority. “All of a sudden you have people emailing other people, asking for their data and then writing blog posts accusing them of shoddy practices,” says Eli Finkel, a social psychologist at Northwestern. “That was unheard-of. Now it was happening all the time.” Some blog posts took on the impact of journal articles, as interested parties weighed in with an impromptu peer review. In 2014, Psychological Science started giving electronic badges, an extra seal of approval, to studies that made their data and methodologies publicly available and preregistered their design and analysis ahead of time, so that researchers could not fish around for a new hypothesis if they turned up some unexpected findings.

Not surprisingly, replicators sometimes encountered the kind of outraged resistance that Simmons and Simonsohn initially did. The same month that Simmons and Simonsohn gave their talk, Stéphane Doyen, a social psychologist in Belgium, published a paper challenging a classic study in the field of priming, which holds that small cues, like exposure to certain words, can subconsciously trigger behaviors. The original study found that research subjects walked more slowly after being exposed to words associated with old age; the replicators found no such effect and titled their journal article “Behavioral Priming: It’s All in the Mind; but Whose Mind?” John Bargh, a professor at Yale, a luminary who published the original study, responded with a combative post on Psychology Today’s blog, claiming that discrepancies in the experiment design accounted for the difference and calling the researchers “incompetent or ill informed.” When other priming studies failed to replicate later that year, the Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman, who discussed priming in his book “Thinking Fast and Slow,” wrote a letter to social psychologists who studied the effect, urging them to turn their attitude around. “To deal effectively with the doubts, you should acknowledge their existence and confront them straight on,” he wrote.

The intention of replicators was now unassailably noble — who could argue with better science? — but there was also, for the first time, status to be found in topplings, as journals started publishing more replications, many of which received lavish press attention. It was also inevitable that those being challenged would read envy into their attackers’ motivations. (In a tweet, Gilbert described those he deemed the worst offenders as “shameless little bullies.”)

Jay Van Bavel, a social psychologist at New York University, has tweeted openly about a published nonreplication of one of his studies and believes, as any scientist would, that replications are an essential part of the process; nonetheless, he found the experience of being replicated painful. “It is terrifying, even if it’s fair and within normal scientific bounds,” he says. “Because of social media and how it travels — you get pile-ons when the critique comes out, and 50 people share it in the view of thousands. That’s horrifying for anyone who’s critiqued, even if it’s legitimate.”

The field, clearly, was not moving forward as one. “In the beginning, I thought it was all ridiculous,” says Finkel, who told me it took him a few years before he appreciated the importance of what became known as the replication movement. “It was like we had been having a big party — what big, new, fun, cool stuff can we discover? And we forgot to double-check ourselves. And then the reformers were annoyed, because they felt like they had to come in after the fact and clean up after us. And it was true.”

In August 2014, the day before her second marriage, Amy Cuddy learned that a replication of her 2010 study led by a 34-year-old economist at the University of Zurich named Eva Ranehill had failed to yield the same results. “I remember thinking, Oh, bummer,” Cuddy says. But she was not distraught; often there was some perfectly good reason for a discrepancy in two studies of the same concept.

There were several key differences — Ranehill’s sample size, at 200, was much bigger, and she had designed a double-blind setup. Ranehill had her subjects hold two poses for three minutes each. She did not find an increase in either risk-taking behavior or the expected hormone changes.

Cuddy thought it was likely that the difference in time — six minutes of standing versus two — was a crucial one and probably accounted for the disparity in the results. “It’s not a crazy thing to test,” Cuddy says. “I guess under the theory that more is better? But it could go the other way — three minutes is a really, really long time to be holding a pose like that. It seems likely to me that it would be really uncomfortable, but sure, study it, and let’s see.”

She was relieved to see that the “feelings of power” finding had replicated. But Ranehill used language in her write-up that played down that finding’s importance. Although in one study of her own, Cuddy also played down the finding, she has otherwise consistently, in interviews, been enthusiastic about the idea that a body posture could change someone’s feelings. “We’re psychologists,” she says. “We try to change how people feel.” She also, at the time of the Ranehill replication, still anticipated that other research would probably show downstream effects — more risk taking, or more competitiveness, or better performance in job interviews.

By the time Cuddy got word of Ranehill’s replication, she had given her TED talk, developed a significant speaking career and was writing a book. Simmons had received tenure at Wharton and was writing, with Simonsohn, a blog called Data Colada, in which they sometimes tried to replicate other people’s work. By 2014, there was near-unanimous agreement the Data Colada team had profoundly changed the field’s research techniques for the better. But for the average researcher, an email from someone at Data Colada signaled unpleasantness ahead. “It’s like the police knocking on your door in the middle of the night,” one psychologist said.

In the wake of Ranehill’s failed replication, Cuddy and Carney set to work on a response. Carney, who is now a tenured associate professor of management at the University of California, Berkeley, tried to chart a P-curve of all 33 studies they were mentioning in their paper (which was already under review). Carney sent the paper and the P-curve to Nelson for some feedback, but he sent it on to Simmons and Simonsohn, as they were the experts.

The letter Simmons wrote back to Carney was polite, but he argued that her P-curve had not been executed correctly. He and Simonsohn had each executed P-curves of the 33 studies, and each found that it was flat, suggesting that the body of literature it reflected did not count as strong evidence. He did write that “conceptual points raised before that section are useful and contribute to the debate” but that they should take the P-curve out. “Everybody wins in that case.” According to Cuddy, she and Carney thought the P-curve science was not as settled as Simmons believed it to be. But afraid of public recrimination, they did exactly as he said — they took out the P-curve.

A few weeks after the paper was published, Cuddy learned from Simmons and Simonsohn that they were writing a blog post on the paper. A mutual friend of Cuddy and Simmons’s from graduate school, Kenworthey Bilz, a professor of law at the University of Illinois, tried to reassure Cuddy. “He’ll say his piece, and you’ll say yours, and that will be the end of it,” Bilz told Cuddy. “It’s not like you’re going to become the poster girl for this kind of thing.”

Cuddy was at her home office in Boston when she received an email from Simmons and Simonsohn. They showed her a draft of the post they planned to put online criticizing the paper; they invited feedback on anything the authors felt was incorrect or unfair. “We embrace trying to be as civil as possible but understanding that at some point you are going to say, ‘You were wrong,’ ” Simonsohn said. “People won’t like that, no matter how you much you dress it up. It’s not something people want to hear.”

The post criticized the new paper, as well as the 2010 study. It showed Simmons and Simonsohn’s own unfavorable P-curve and essentially argued that the original published findings on hormones and risk-taking were probably a result of chance. They did not include a feelings-of-power measure in the P-curve they showed. But the blog post did mention in its last footnote that there was a significant effect of power posing on “self-reported power,” although the language made it clear that it didn’t count for much: Simmons believes that self-reports of power generally reflect what is called a demand effect — a result that occurs when subjects intuit the point of the study. Cuddy believes that studies can be constructed to minimize that risk and that demand effects are often nuanced.

Cuddy responded to Simonsohn with a few points that they incorporated into the post but said she preferred to write a longer response in a context in which she felt more comfortable.

Cuddy felt ill when Simmons and Simonsohn published the post with the headline: “Reassessing the Evidence Behind the Most Popular TED Talk.” As illustration, they used a picture of Wonder Woman. Cuddy felt as if Simmons had set them up; that they included her TED talk in the headline made it feel personal, as if they were going after her rather than the work.

The post, which Simonsohn distributed to his email list of hundreds, quickly made the rounds. “People were sending me emails like I was dying of cancer,” Cuddy says. “It was like, ‘We send our condolences,’ ‘Holy crap, this is terrible’ and ‘God bless you; we wish we could do something, but obviously we can’t.’ ” She also knew what was coming, a series of events that did, in fact, transpire over time: subsequent scrutiny of other studies she had published, insulting commentary about her work on the field’s Facebook groups, disdainful headlines about the flimsiness of her research. She paced around, distraught, afraid to look at her email, afraid not to. She had just put together a tenure package and worried that the dust-up would be a continuing distraction.

Cuddy did not like seeing her work criticized in a non-peer-reviewed format, but she wrote a bland statement saying, essentially, that she disagreed with their findings and looked forward to more research on “this important topic.” Carney reassured Cuddy in the months after the Data Colada post that their paper would eventually be vindicated — of course the effects were real; someone would prove it eventually.

Eventually, the Data Colada post caught the eye of another influential blogger, Andrew Gelman, a professor of statistics and political science at Columbia University, whose interest in Cuddy’s work would prove durable, exacting and possibly career-changing for Cuddy. Gelman wields his sizable influence on the field from afar, on his popular blog andrewgelman.com, where he posts his thoughts on best statistical practices in the sciences, with a frequent emphasis on what he sees as the absurd and unscientific. Gelman, who studied math and physics at M.I.T. before turning to statistics, does not believe that social psychology is any more guilty of P-hacking than, say, biology or economics. But he has devoted extensive attention to the field, especially in more recent years, in part because of the way the media has glorified social-psychology research. He is respected enough that his posts are well read; he is cutting enough that many of his critiques are enjoyed with a strong sense of schadenfreude.

Four months after the Data Colada post, Gelman, with a co-author, published an article in Slate about Carney and Cuddy’s 2010 study, calling it “tabloid fodder.” Eventually, Cuddy’s name began appearing regularly in the blog, both in his posts and in comments. Gelman’s writing on Cuddy’s study was coolly dismissive; it bothered him that Cuddy remained fairly silent on the replication and the Data Colada post. For all he knew, Cuddy was still selling the hormone effect in her speaking gigs and in her best-selling book, “Presence,” which he had not read. Had he looked, he would have been annoyed to see that Cuddy did not include a mention of the Ranehill replication. But he might have been surprised to see how little of the book focused on power posing (just a few pages).

On his site, Cuddy’s name, far from the only one he repeatedly invoked, became a go-to synecdoche for faulty science writ large. When he saw that Cuddy had been invited to speak at a conference, he wondered why the organizers had not invited a bunch of other famous figures he clearly considered bad for science, including Diederik Stapel, who had been accused of outright fraud.

His site became a home for frequently hostile comments from his followers. “She has no serious conception of ‘science,’ ” one posted. Another compared Cuddy to Elizabeth Holmes, the Theranos chief executive under investigation for misleading investors. Though Gelman did encourage his readers to stick to the science, he rarely reined anyone in. In one exchange in July 2016, a commenter wrote, “I’ve wondered whether some of Amy Cuddy’s mistakes are due to the fact that she suffered severe head trauma as the result of a car accident some years ago.” Gelman replied, “A head injury hardly seems necessary to explain these mistakes,” pointing out that her adviser, Fiske, whom he has also criticized, had no such injury but made similar errors.

Gelman, whom I met in his office in late June, is not scathing in person; he is rather mild, soft-spoken even. Gelman was vague when asked if he felt there was anything unusual about the frequency of his comments on Cuddy (“People send me things, and I respond,” he said). He said it was Cuddy who was unrelenting. He later emailed me to make sure I was aware that she attacked him and Simmons and Simonsohn on a private Facebook page, without backing up her accusations with evidence; he was still waiting for a clear renunciation of the original 2010 paper on the hormonal effects of power posing. “I would like her to say: ‘Jeez, I didn’t know any better. I was doing what they told me to do. I don’t think I’m a bad person, and it didn’t get replicated’ — rather than salvaging as much as she can.”

Gelman considers himself someone who is doing others the favor of pointing out their errors, a service for which he would be grateful, he says. Cuddy considers him a bully, someone who does not believe that she is entitled to her own interpretation of the research that is her field of expertise.

Cuddy has asked herself what motivates Gelman. “Why not help social psychologists instead of attacking them on your blog?” she wondered aloud to me. “Why not come to a conference or hold a seminar?” When I asked Gelman if he would ever consider meeting with Cuddy to hash out their differences, he seemed put off by the idea of trying to persuade her, in person, that there were flaws in her work.

“I don’t like interpersonal conflict,” he said.

On Sept. 26, 2016, Amy Cuddy woke up and checked her phone to find a chilling text from a friend. “I’m so sorry,” it said. “Are you O.K.?” She felt a familiar dread, something closer to panic. For the past year, she had mostly stopped going to social-psychology conferences, feeling a chill from her community. Another social psychologist had told her that a graduate student asked if she really was friends with Cuddy. When she responded, “Yes,” the young woman asked, “Why?”

It was the kind of information Cuddy wished she did not have; her closest friends were told to stop passing on or commenting about that kind of thing, but acquaintances still did it. She felt adrift in her field. She worried about asking peers to collaborate, suspecting that they would not want to set themselves up for intense scrutiny. And she felt betrayed, not just by those who cut her down on social media, in blog posts, even in reviews (one reviewer called her “a profiteer,” not hiding his contempt), but also by some of those who did not publicly defend her. She was not wrong to think that at least in some cases, it was fear, rather than lack of support for her, that kept people from speaking up. Two tenured psychology professors at Ivy League universities acknowledged to me that they would have publicly defended some of Cuddy’s positions were they not worried about making themselves targets on Data Colada and elsewhere.

Two days before Cuddy received that text from a friend, Gelman once again posted about the power-posing research, but this time he issued a challenge to Dana Carney. “When people screw up or cheat in their research, what do their collaborators say?” he wondered in the post. For Carney, he wrote, “it was not too late.” Unknown to Cuddy and Gelman, Carney had already linked, in her C.V., to Simmon and Simonsohn’s critique of that first, influential 2010 study, but she hadn’t made the kind of statement or gesture that Gelman expected from Cuddy.

That morning of the troubling text, Cuddy logged onto her computer and discovered that Carney had posted on her website a document (then quickly published on New York magazine’s site) that seemed intended to distance its author forever, in every way, from power posing. “I do not believe that ‘power pose’ effects are real,” she said. Not only had she stopped studying power poses, “I discourage others from studying power poses.”

She listed a number of methodological concerns she had, in retrospect, about the 2010 paper, most of which, Cuddy says, Carney had never raised with her. In an email a few months earlier, Carney had clearly told Cuddy that she thought the study’s data was flimsy, the sample was tiny, the effects were barely there. But Cuddy said she had never received notice that this kind of renunciation was coming. Carney declined to comment for this article, but Nelson, who is in her department, said she was clearly in a tough position, saddled with all the negatives of the work — the hit to her reputation — with none of the upside: the speaking fees and the positive feedback from teary fans who no doubt fuel Cuddy’s conviction in the research.

For much of the scientific world, Carney’s statement was an act of integrity and bravery. “Whoa! This is how to do it!” tweeted Michael Inzlicht, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of Toronto who had eloquently written about his own crisis of confidence about his field of research, ego depletion.

To Cuddy, Carney’s post seemed so sweeping as to be vague, self-abnegating. Even Simonsohn, who made clear his support for Carney’s decision, thought the letter had a strangely unscientific vehemence to it. “If I do a bad job proving there’s a ninth planet, I probably shouldn’t say there’s a ninth planet,” he says. “But I shouldn’t say there is no ninth planet, either. You should just ignore the bad study and go back to base line.”

Cuddy wrote a lengthy response to Carney that New York magazine published. (New York, Slate and The Atlantic have closely reported on the replication movement.) Then she stopped taking phone calls and went almost completely offline. She found that she couldn’t eat; at 5-foot-5, Cuddy went down to 100 pounds.

Less than two weeks after Carney’s disavowal, Cuddy got on a plane so she could meet her commitment to speak to a crowd of 10,000 in Las Vegas. As frail as she had been since her accident, she headed to an arena in Las Vegas and roused the crowd, a tiny woman on a giant stage, taking up space, making herself big, feeling the relief of feeling powerful.

When I emailed Joe Simmons in July and asked to meet with him, he readily agreed but warned me that he does not check his email often. “I had to take email off my phone,” he explained when we met at a coffee shop across the river from Wharton. A lot of his work these days was stressful — sometimes the emailer was angry, sometimes he was — so if he looked at his phone before bed, “that was it — I wouldn’t sleep all night.”

When Simmons and I met, I asked him why he eventually wrote such a damning blog post, when his initial correspondence with Carney did not seem particularly discouraging. He and Simonsohn, he told me, had clearly explained to Cuddy and Carney that the supporting studies they cited were problematic as a body of work — and yet all the researchers did was drop the visual graph, as if deliberately sidestepping the issue. They left in the body of literature that Simmons and Simonsohn’s P-curve discredited. That apparent disregard for contrary evidence was, Simmons said, partly what prompted them to publish the harsh blog post in the first place.

But the email that Simmons and Simonsohn had sent was, in fact, ambiguous: They had explicitly told her to drop the P-curve and yet left the impression that the paper was otherwise sound. At my request, Simmons looked back at his original email. I watched as he read it over. “Oh, yeah,” he said quietly. He had a pained look on his face. “We did say to drop the graph, didn’t we?” He read it over again, then sat back. “I didn’t remember that. This may be a big misunderstanding about — that email is too polite.”

Cuddy and Carney had taken their advice literally. Simmons stood by his analysis but recognized that there was confusion at play in how they interpreted the events that transpired. Simmons says he harbored no ill will toward Cuddy before criticizing her paper; if anything, he remembered her warmly. “She was great,” he said, smiling at the memory. “We published the blog post despite my history with Amy. Because I realized that once we pulled the trigger on this. … ” He did not finish the sentence. Cuddy had, in fact, become the poster girl for this kind of work, which even he thought was not fair. “The original study wasn’t particularly egregious,” he said. “It was published in 2010 before anyone was thinking about this.”

For a moment, the scientist allowed the human element to factor into how he felt about his email response to that paper. “I wish,” he said, “I’d had the presence of mind to pick up the phone and call Amy.”

The public nature of the attacks against Cuddy have reverberated among social psychologists, raising questions about the effects of harsh discourse on the field and particularly on women. Earlier this year at the conference of the Society of Personality and Social Psychology, there was a presentation of a 2016 survey of 700 social psychologists, assessing their perceptions of the influence of social media on their careers. The subsequent conversation on popular Facebook groups was so combative that Alison Ledgerwood, a social psychologist at the University of California, Davis, felt the need to respond in a blog post. In it, she argued that if scientists keep having hostile conversations on social media, women are more likely to be driven away from the field. (Women in the profession, the survey presented at the conference reported, participated less than their male colleagues in social-media discussions.)

Even people who believe that the methodological reforms are essential say its costs to science are real. “It’s become like politics — we’ve created two camps of people who shouldn’t be in two camps in the first place,” says Jay Van Bavel, the social psychologist at N.Y.U. “It’s perceived slights and defensiveness, and everybody has some history or grievance — and it will never end because there is that history of perceived grievances, of one of your colleagues who has been put through it, or criticized your friend in a public forum. It’s terrible for science. It’s not good.”

If Amy Cuddy is a victim, she may not seem an obvious one: She has real power, a best-selling book, a thriving speaking career. She did not own up fully to problems in her research or try to replicate her own study. (She says there were real hurdles to doing so, not least of which was finding a collaborator to take that on.) But many of her peers told me that she did not deserve the level of widespread and sometimes vicious criticism she has endured. “Amy has been the target of mockery and meanness on Facebook, on Twitter, in blog posts — I feel like, Wow, I have never seen that in science,” Van Bavel says. “I’ve only been in it for 15 years, but I’ve never seen public humiliation like that.”

As a result, the breadth of the accusations — how diffuse they are — could easily be mistaken for the depth of her scientific missteps, which at the outset were no different from those of so many of her peers. “We were all being trained to simplify, to get our message out there — there were conferences and panels on how to do it,” says Richard Petty, a social psychologist at Ohio State. “One of the ironies is that Amy just did it more successfully.”

I was surprised to find that some of the leaders in the replication movement were not Cuddy’s harshest critics but spoke of her right to defend her work in more measured tones. “Why does everyone care so much about what Amy says?” Brian Nosek says. “Science isn’t about consensus.” Cuddy was entitled to her position; the evidence in favor or against power posing would speak for itself. Leif Nelson, one of the three pioneers of the movement, says Cuddy is no different from most other scientists in her loyalty to her data. “Authors love their findings,” he says. “And you can defend almost anything — that’s the norm of science, not just in psychology.” He still considers Cuddy a “very serious psychologist”; he also believes the 2010 paper “is a bunch of nonsense.” But he says, “It does not strike me as at all notable that Amy would defend her work. Most people do.”

Every researcher has a threshold at which he or she is convinced of the evidence; in social psychology, especially, there is no such thing as absolute proof, only measures of probability. In recent months, Cuddy reached the threshold needed to alter her thinking on the effect of hormones. She mentioned, at a psychology conference where she was presenting her work, that a study had recently been conducted on power posing. “They found no hormonal effects,” she said before taking a breath. “That study is done very well, and I trust those results.” Although 11 new papers have recently been published that do not show the downstream effects of power posing on behaviors, Cuddy is still fighting for power posing. The research, she says, still shows its effect on feelings of power: At the conference, she presented a comprehensive meta-analysis, a version of which, she says, she will soon publish, with a strong P-curve supporting that, and she also presented a P-curve suggesting that power posing had a robust effect on self-evaluations, emotions and moods.

Cuddy now seems ready to move on to a new phase. We met near her home in Newton, Mass., in August. Cuddy, smiling, fresh from physical therapy for a torn ACL, was in a tennis skirt, looking young and more lighthearted than I had ever seen her. She had abandoned the dream of tenure. She was planning a new project, a new book, she told me. It was coming together in her mind: “Bullies, Bystanders and Bravehearts.” It would be personal; there would be research; she would write, and she would talk, and she would interview people who had suffered fates worse than her own and bounced back. She would tell their stories and hers, and because she is a good talker, people would listen.",When the Revolution Came for Amy Cuddy,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/magazine/when-the-revolution-came-for-amy-cuddy.html

OAKLAND, Calif. — Discussing her work at Apple at an event last week about fighting racial injustice, Denise Young Smith, the company’s vice president of diversity and inclusion, said, “There can be 12 white, blue-eyed, blond men in a room and they’re going to be diverse, too, because they’re going to bring a different life experience and life perspective to the conversation.”

That’s right: a dozen white men, so long as they were not raised in the same household and don’t think identical thoughts, could be considered diverse. After a furor erupted, Ms. Smith clarified her comments in an email to her team that was obtained and published by TechCrunch. It reads in part, “Understanding that diversity includes women, people of color, L.G.B.T.Q. people, and all underrepresented minorities is at the heart of our work to create an environment that is inclusive of everyone,” and “I regret the choice of words I used to make this point.”

But Ms. Smith wasn’t the first to endorse the view in her initial statement. Those of us in the tech industry know that the idea of “cognitive diversity” is gaining traction among leaders in our field. In too many cases, this means that, in the minds of those with influence over hiring, the concept of diversity is watered down and reinterpreted to encompass what Silicon Valley has never had a shortage of — individual white men, each with their unique thoughts and ideas. This shift creates a distraction from efforts to increase the race and gender diversity the tech industry is sorely lacking.

This overlaps with the sentiments expressed in a screed by a Google software engineer that critiqued the company’s race and gender diversity efforts and ascribed the unequal representation of women in tech to “biological causes.” It included the line, “Viewpoint diversity is arguably the most important type of diversity.”

The measure is creating friction. Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, reflecting his most conservative members, came out against the deal on Wednesday.

“The speaker does not see anything that changes his view that the Senate should keep its focus on repeal and replace of Obamacare,” said Doug Andres, a spokesman for Mr. Ryan.

But the authors of the measure may be gaining support for the moment that they have the most leverage. In December, the government will run out of money, and no bill to keep it funded can pass without Democratic votes. At that point, supporters of the Alexander-Murray measure can insist on its inclusion in any spending bill and threaten to shut down the government if they do not prevail. Already, several Republicans have backed the agreement, including Senators John McCain of Arizona, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.

Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana and the co-author with Senator Lindsey Graham of the most recent legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act, offered his qualified support: “If combined with greater flexibility to allow states to lower costs, this will set the stage for replace through a mechanism such as Graham-Cassidy. I will study this proposal to see if it accomplishes these goals.”

Mr. Alexander, speaking Wednesday at a forum convened by Axios, a news website, said: “The president engineered the bipartisan agreement by calling me and asking me to work with Senator Murray to do it. I’ve talked with him three times in the last 10 days about it.”

Mr. Alexander predicted that the plan would “pass in some form before the end of the year.” And he said the deal included several victories for conservatives, making it easier for states to revamp their insurance markets and allowing people of any age to buy low-cost, high-deductible health plans providing catastrophic coverage.

A federal judge ruled in 2016 that the federal payments to insurance companies, known as cost-sharing reductions, violated the Constitution because Congress never provided money for them. Citing that ruling, Mr. Trump announced last week that he would stop the payments.

Mr. Trump says he still supports longer-range efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with block grants to the states.

Such big changes would not take effect until 2020 or 2021, Mr. Alexander said. “What do you do in the meantime?” he asked. “What you don’t want to do in the meantime is create chaos and hurt millions of Americans.”

“What does chaos do?” Mr. Alexander asked. “It’s a four-lane highway to a single-payer solution. It’s a birthday present for Bernie Sanders,” the independent Vermont senator and leading advocate for a single-payer “Medicare for all” health care system.

The Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, quickly pushed back on the president’s Twitter post, expressing exasperation in remarks on the Senate floor.

“Frankly, the president doesn’t know what he’s talking about in the compromise,” Mr. Schumer said. “It doesn’t bail out insurance companies. It helps people who are sick and who need health care.”

Mr. Schumer said the president “keeps zigging and zagging, so it’s impossible to govern.”

“Our only hope is maybe tomorrow he’ll be for this again,” he added.

At a news conference at the White House on Tuesday afternoon, virtually as the deal was being announced at the Capitol, Mr. Trump voiced support for the plan. He vowed to try again to repeal the Affordable Care Act but said the emerging bipartisan deal would “get us over this intermediate hump” in the meantime.

The president described the Senate plan as a “short-term solution so that we don’t have this very dangerous little period.”

Hours later, in a speech to the conservative Heritage Foundation, Mr. Trump commended the work of Mr. Alexander and Ms. Murray, but he said that Congress needed to “find a solution to the Obamacare mess instead of providing bailouts to insurance companies.”

And with his Twitter post on Wednesday morning, he stepped back even further from the support he had offered just a day earlier.",Trump Qualifies Support for Senate Deal to Fund Health Subsidies,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/us/politics/trump-obamacare-subsidies-tweet-opposition.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

The citation for a Bronze Star that Mr. Rodriguez received for valor says he killed 10 enemy fighters that day.","Both Mr. Rodriguez and Mr. Sahib are trying to move on from lives upended by war, and both want justice. But they have different ideas of what that means.

Mr. Rodriguez, who is white, was raised by a Nigerian stepfather, married a Guatemalan woman, and for years relied on an Iraqi next-door neighbor to help his family when he was fighting overseas. He does not consider himself prejudiced.

“How can they say I hate Iraqis? I gave my soul for Iraq,” he said.

But friends and family say four deployments to war zones left him changed, especially the first one. In 2004 he went to Ramadi, Iraq, as a 27-year-old platoonsergeant. The tour with the Second Battalion, Fourth Marine Regiment is widely thought to be one of the deadliest six months of any American unit in either Iraq or Afghanistan. Thirty-four Marines were killed and more than 255 were wounded.

Several moments from those months still commandeer Mr. Rodriguez’s thoughts, but none more so than the morning of April 6, 2004, when he was leading a dozen Marines down an urban boulevard and rooftops erupted with the flash of gunfire. Hundreds of enemy fighters had launched a coordinated ambush all over the city. By sundown, 12 Marines in the battalion were dead.

In an interview, Mr. Rodriguez tried to describe the fight, but stammered and fell silent several times before beginning to cry.

According to other Marines from the squad, the ambush split their group in two, and Mr. Rodriguez ordered his half into a house to assess a grim situation. A pair of Marines lay dead in the street. Two more a block away had been hit by a grenade. Reinforcements were bogged down. Enemy fighters were trying to scale the walls into the courtyard of the house. Ammunition was running low.

Pieces of the battle are clear to him more than a decade later: the frantic crackle of the platoon radio, the feeble thumbs-up from a 21-year-old private who had been shot in the neck. The anger he felt after recovering the fly-covered body of a 19-year-old Marine after the battle — a kid who had written a letter to his church saying faith in God would keep him safe.

Other parts are a blur. The citation for a Bronze Star that Mr. Rodriguez received for valor says he killed 10 enemy fighters that day. He doesn’t remember clearly.

“I went to zone black. No conscience, no fear, no nothing,” he said in a phone interview late one night. “I didn’t care if I was going to die. I just did my job as an infantry man.”

“You come home, you have to live with yourself,” he added. “I’m a bad person now, I went against all I had ever been taught.”

When he returned home, friends said, Mr. Rodriguez seemed drained. He spoke little about what had happened, but couldn’t sleep and drank heavily. He began having visions at night of dead Marines. On anniversaries he visited their graves and weathered the blame from their families. He put in paperwork to award the men Bronze Stars, and hung the citations on his wall.

Many in the battalion were also haunted by the experience, but it was early in the war, and formal PTSD diagnoses were rare, said Winston Jaugan, who was Mr. Rodriguez’s friend and, as a gunnery sergeant, his boss. “No one had a diagnosis. They would just give us pills for everything — Valium, Ambien. And we would drink,” he said.

As a leader, other Marines said, Mr. Rodriguez carried a particularly heavy burden.

“He was like the father of the squad,” said Joe Hays, who was hit by a grenade during the battle. “And he saw everything that went wrong as his fault.”

In Ms. Bauman’s production, which mixes professional actors and college students, Rosalind (Helen Cespedes), the daughter of a banished duke and Celia (Liba Vaynberg), her cousin, still flee a French duchy for the Forest of Arden. But don’t expect a dewy pastoral. This forest is a refugee camp, a tumble of wooden pallets and cracked cinderblocks. Its inhabitants busy themselves filling plastic jugs at a water pump and checking a bulletin board in the hope that some new country has accepted them. The uses of adversity are not so sweet.

After the intermission, several actors in the ensemble step forward and briefly detail how they arrived in America. “When I got here as a little kid, I was so nervous, I could only eat Wonder Bread and drink water,” a young man says. “I feel blessed,” a young woman says. “I am here because of the sacrifices of my mom and my ancestors.”

These brief speeches are the most affecting in the show and their consequence hints at some of the project’s problems. In effect, “As You Like It” isn’t a great fit for the tale that Ms. Bauman wants to tell. The substance of the plot — the political machinations, the romantic entanglements — doesn’t seem to interest her. Neither does the verse. And the comedy is a non-starter.

What does interest her is the refugee setting, but aside from some inspired details — the character of Corin is now a bilking shopkeeper — this vision of the Forest of Arden is unproductively at odds with the play. Yes, Shakespeare’s Arden is a weird place — there are lions and snakes and wandering monks. But it’s not intended as a bleak or unwelcoming one. It’s a shelter from the world, not a further hurt.

Ms. Bauman has altered a few words in the play’s last scene so that instead of nearly everyone returning happily to court, only the nobility get visas. The adjustment comes too late to really resonate. Unlike the joyous “As You Like It” produced by Public Works this summer, “Arden/Everywhere” sticks staunchly to Shakespeare’s text even when the words and plots just weigh it down. If it had been more daring, the play might have found its own language to tell its own stories — the strange, eventful histories its own cast members supply.

Textual fidelity does not seem to have kept the authors of the highly adulterated “Desperate Measures” up nights. Unlike the Elevator Repair Service production playing downtown, almost nothing remains of the “Measure for Measure” text — not the names, not the setting, not even much in the way of moral argument. About the only thing “Desperate Measures” hangs onto is the premise behind a nun’s being asked to bed a tyrant in order to free her brother.

It’s sometime in the 1800s in the Arizona territory when fiery Johnny Blood (Conor Ryan) shoots a mustached creep, probably in self-defense, and is sentenced to be hanged. His sister, Susanna (Emma Degerstedt), is about to make her devotions. But the good-hearted sheriff (Peter Saide) convinces her to appeal for her brother’s life. Governor von Richterhenkenpflichtgetruber (Nick Wyman, and see what I mean about the bad jokes?) sees how cute she looks in a wimple and tries to grab her by the rosary.

Reluctant to agree to her own rape, Susanna and the sheriff inveigle Bella Rose (Lauren Molina), a stripper and occasional prostitute, to fluff the governor’s pillows instead. Gary Marachek’s nihilist preacher rounds out the winning cast.

The songs, with music by David Friedman and book and lyrics by Peter Kellogg, are enthusiastically ordinary, except for the opening number, “The Ballad of Johnny Blood,” which is worse. Not even Tex Ritter could have saved it. The book is in rhyming couplets. The gags are hoary. (And whore-y.) Under Bill Castellino’s direction, somehow it’s a delight.

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — The Emmy-award winning actor John Lithgow does not have a favorite word, he says, because he loves too many of them to narrow the choice down to a single one.

Mr. Lithgow himself is anything but eldritch, despite his dazzling and dark portrayal of the serial killer Arthur Mitchell on the Showtime series “Dexter,” for which he won a Golden Globe and a Primetime Emmy. A sunny and enthusiastic personality, Mr. Lithgow calls his crossword puzzle collaboration with the veteran New York Times constructor Brendan Emmett Quigley an “exhilarating experience.”

As part of the 75th anniversary of The New York Times Crossword, our editor Will Shortz is running a series of crossword collaborations between people of note and popular Times constructors, and today it is Mr. Lithgow’s turn to make a different kind of debut. Rather than walk onto the stage of a theater, step onto a television or film set, or put pen to paper to write one of his books for children, Mr. Lithgow scaled a very steep learning curve with Mr. Quigley, and the result is an entertaining puzzle that definitely has his signature on it.

In a ruling on Monday, Judge Bryson criticized Allergan’s deal with the tribe and said such arrangements could ultimately damage the country’s patent process.

In a statement, Allergan said it was “carefully reviewing the court’s decision.”

The patent office is still reviewing the case, including the Mohawks’ argument that the patents are protected by the tribe’s sovereign immunity. The two legal processes operate independently of each other, although decisions in federal court typically supersede the administrative review, experts said.

“If a court overturns the patent, then that is game over for the patent,” said Michael Carrier, a professor at Rutgers Law School who studies patent law.

Brendan F. White, a spokesman for the tribe, said it was “in the process of reviewing the decision and its impact on our patent business.” Under the deal, Allergan paid the tribe $13.75 million, with the promise of $15 million in annual royalties as long as the patents remained valid.

Allergan’s arrangement with the Mohawk tribe had been greeted with outrage by members of Congress and consumer groups, who said it was just the latest tactic by drug makers to foil generic competitors and protect their profits.

The tribe had countered that it was within its rights and that further deals could serve as an added source of revenue for its community of more than 15,000 people in a rural, economically depressed region near the Canadian border.

Allergan has said it entered into the deal with the tribe to avoid what it described as the double jeopardy of having its patents challenged in both federal court and through the administrative review. Many patent holders have argued that the administrative process is unfair and unnecessary because patents already can be challenged in federal courts.

In nontheme news, I have to say that the long Downs made me smile. I loved SHOT TO HELL for its unexpectedness, and “FROST/NIXON” is a nice, Scrabbly entry to write into the grid.

Tricky Clues

49A: “Strands in a cell?” looks like it refers either to the microscopic type of cell or a jail cell, although strands in a jail cell doesn’t make much sense. The answer refers to microscopic cells and the strands of genetic material within. If you are not sure whether the answer is RNA or DNA, fill in the “NA” and work that first crossing. 40D is AUDI, so the answer is DNA. See? You don’t have to be a scientist to do the crossword.

59D: I thought this one might bring out some of my fellow vegetable gardeners, because I’m sure I’m not the only one who believed that yams were tubers, not ROOTs. Apparently, “all tubers are root crops, but not all root crops are tubers,” and there are many ways to distinguish the part of a plant that grows underground. The main point you should take away from all this is that they’re good for you and you should eat your vegetables.

Constructor Notes

This idea for this theme came from thinking about Schrödinger puzzles, and wondering if I could potentially create one so that entries that contain more than one distinct stand-alone letter, for example, VITAMIN which can be followed by A, B, C, D, E, or K, intersect another such entry. Ideally, the shared possible letters for each pair of theme entries would be some combination of A, B, C and D, so that the revealer MULTIPLE CHOICE could be used. This didn’t end up panning out, but it did lead me, through a somewhat stream-of-consciousness manner of contemplating crossword themes, to come up with the one you see here. The first version of this puzzle had the theme entries VITAMINS, MUSICAL NOTES, CHEMICAL SYMBOLS, GREEK LETTERS and ALPHABET, and was rejected on the basis that ALPHABET was too obvious, and GREEK LETTERS was inconsistent. It was tough to find a new set of symmetrical theme entries, but I’m pleased with the current set. In each case, the category contains other members besides the ones that are composed of a single letter, and the letters are the members of the category themselves rather than being abbreviations, unlike something such as L M S for SHIRT SIZES. I spent a decent amount of time trying to remove the black square between TILE and GREEK and its symmetrical partner to allow for two pairs of long parallel downs, but I didn’t like the compromises on the fill, so I decided to stick to 78 words. Given that this ended up as a Monday (I had expected it to be a Tuesday) and the importance of smooth fill for Monday puzzles, I stand by this decision, and though there aren’t a ton of bonuses here, I’m fond of SHOT TO HELL and some of the mid-length fill like U.S. NEWS and HANSEL (he’s so hot right now). I don’t have a lot to say as far as the clues go, but a few of mine I’m glad to see survive the edit are 49-Across, 9-Down, 31-Down and 56-Down. Though I’m not sure it will be particularly applicable to this puzzle, I like the inside nod in the clue that Will and Joel came up with for AHA. In any case it’s great to be back, and I hope (fingers crossed) that my puzzle will be a pleasant start to everyone’s week.

After that, “whenever I was going out to work I’d always see him,” she recalled in Spanish. “I’d take a different street and I’d always bump into him. He’d say, ‘Hi, how are you?’ And I’d say, ‘I’m fine.’ Wherever I’d go I’d see him. And that was that,” she added, laughing.

At the time, Mr. Bernandez was in good health, aside from high blood pressure. Ms. Valentín and Jashua were financially dependent on his steady job at a shipping and packaging company in Mount Vernon, N.Y., just north of the Bronx, to pay the bills and to meet the $1,070 monthly rent for their one-bedroom apartment in the Soundview section of the borough.

Ms. Valentín continued working as a home attendant throughout her partner’s decline, a job she has held for eight years. But her $11-an-hour wage, once used to supplement food, clothes and school supplies, could not cover even their rent. She tried to get additional work hours but was limited by Jashua’s school schedule and his long commute. She quickly fell behind on payments.

To save money, they used natural light and turned on the air-conditioning only at night, but their electric bill was $78 a month. By March 2017, Ms. Valentín owed $4,398 in rent arrears and faced eviction. She had gone to New York City’s Human Resources Administration for help, but her claim was denied at first. Then, Jashua’s bed broke. Unable to afford another one, his mother shared hers.

One day, waiting for Jashua outside school and overwhelmed by loss, Ms. Valentín broke down in tears. Jashua’s teacher saw her crying and referred her to Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New York, one of eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.

Ms. Valentín came to Catholic Charities with her eviction notice in March, and the organization’s HomeBase staff represented her in housing court. That month, the Human Resources Administration forgave $3,205.60 of the debt, and Catholic Charities covered the remainder, allowing Ms. Valentín to keep the apartment. Catholic Charities then used $325 from the Neediest Cases Fund this summer to buy a single bed for Jashua.

Sitting across from a portrait of Mr. Bernandez — mustachioed, his arms by his side — Ms. Valentín’s voice trailed off as she remembered him. “He was like a father to my son,” she said, bowing her head and pinching her eyes as tears came.

Mr. Bernandez’s absence is still felt more than a year later. Jashua spends little time with his birth father, who also lives in the Bronx. He called Mr. Bernandez “Dad” or “Uncle,” and they played soccer together in the afternoons at a nearby park.

With the family dynamic greatly altered, Jashua clung to the normalcy of his school routine. “When I’d go to school, I’d forget about everything else,” he said.

Always a good student, Jashua lost himself in his studies, particularly his favorite subject, math. His grades gained him admission to Bronx Mathematics Preparatory School, where he started sixth grade in September. With funds from Catholic Charities, he was able to get a new red backpack, a blue lunch box and most of his school supplies. “I’m set for school,” Jashua said, smiling.

Looking to her own future, Ms. Valentín imagines greater independence, perhaps going to college or finding a better job. But all of that will wait, she said.

Dr. Nassar is in jail, facing 22 counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct involving at least seven victims. “This guy is a monster,” Bill Schuette, the attorney general of Michigan, said in February.

Jamie Dantzscher, a 2000 Olympian, is among the gymnasts who has accused Dr. Nassar. Although the charges relate to seven gymnasts, lawyers say dozens of others have come forward, and many have joined a lawsuit against U.S.A. Gymnastics.

Dr. Nassar has denied accusations against him in the past. A lawyer who has represented him, Matt Newburg, did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

Ms. Maroney’s accusation comes a day after another gold medalist, Tatiana Gutsu of Ukraine, accused a star gymnast of raping her when she was 15. Ms. Gutsu won the all-around title at the 1992 Barcelona Games as part of the Unified Team of former Soviet athletes.

Ms. Maroney said she chose to speak out publicly because of the “Me Too” movement in which women post the phrase on social media to show that they, too, have been victims of sexual assault or harassment.

Ms. Maroney was part of the 2012 American gymnastics team that won a team gold medal. She also won an individual silver on her specialty, the vault.

She drew extra attention that year for a look of disappointment she displayed on the medal stand after winning her silver.

According to ChargePoint, 80 percent of vehicle charging is currently done at home, and industry executives argue that it’s wrong to think about charging electric cars in the way they envision filling up a gasoline or diesel vehicle.
“Electric vehicles are more like horses than gasoline cars,” said Mr. Romano of ChargePoint.","Two levels of charging are typically available in residential settings. Level 1 is a standard AC outlet that provides between 1 and 1.5 kilowatts of electricity. It takes a Level 1 charger about 30 hours to fully charge the electric version of the Ford Focus, which has a range of 115 miles. Level 2 uses a professionally installed charger connected to a 240-volt AC outlet — the kind used by some large appliances — and delivers between 7 and 9 kilowatts, lowering the charge time to about 5.5 hours.

Some commercial charging locations offer more advanced technology, employing so-called fast chargers. These offer about 50 kilowatts of DC power, enabling the same Ford Focus to reach 90 miles of range in 30 minutes (battery chemistry causes charging to go more slowly after a battery is 80 percent full). The electric carmaker Tesla has a proprietary “supercharger” for its vehicles that provides 120 kilowatts of power, adding 300 miles of range in 75 minutes.

A new generation of charging points, the first of which are being installed in Europe this year, offer 350 kilowatts of power. Such a jump would slash charging times to 10 to 15 minutes, depending on the vehicle’s range, according to Charlie Yankitis, director of business development for the German manufacturer Bosch’s electric vehicle unit. Elon Musk, Tesla’s founder, has hinted that charging at even faster rates was being studied.

Several companies are making big bets on the technology.

Electrify America, the Volkswagen subsidiary, is planning on installing such high-capacity chargers along highway corridors throughout the United States. It is investing $2 billion in electric vehicle charging infrastructure and education nationwide, $800 million of which is earmarked for California alone.

By the end of 2020, Electrify America plans to have built 350 Level 2 charging sites in urban areas in California, like workplaces and apartment buildings. It will also build an unspecified number of fast chargers along roadways, each of which will have several charge units. A further 540 are to be built elsewhere in the country in that time.

ChargePoint, the largest installer of vehicle charging stations in the United States, plans to install 400-kilowatt sites in the coming months. But its chief executive, Pasquale Romano, did not specify how many.

Similar pushes are being made elsewhere. In Europe, the German automotive giants BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen have joined with Ford in a joint venture to install 350-kilowatt chargers across the Continent. They will start installing them this year, initially planning to get 400 fast-charging sites up and running, with “thousands” in place by 2020.

“We’re looking for similar solutions across the globe,” said Mike Tinskey, Ford’s global director of electrification and infrastructure.

There are, however, hurdles that need to be overcome.

For one, standards differ across manufacturers and regions. Today’s commercial chargers use three different kinds of plugs that are not entirely compatible. In practice, a Chevrolet, Nissan or Volkswagen cannot be charged at a Tesla charger. A Tesla, however, can use an adapter plug to charge at standard commercial stations, and Electrify America says its charging stations will be compatible with a variety of plugs.

Another issue: No vehicle on the road today is able to use the 350-kilowatt fast-charging stations. It is not a simple upgrade: High-speed charging requires thicker cables that won’t get too hot.

No automakers have indicated when they will sell cars equipped to accept such fast charges. Porsche’s Mission E electric vehicle is expected to be available by 2020, and will be able to charge to a 250-mile range in 15 minutes, according to the carmaker. Electrify America and ChargePoint say they expect vehicles capable of accepting 350-killowatt chargers to be available by 2019.

Utilities will also have to upgrade their infrastructure, a change for which California is already preparing.

Under the state’s zero emission regulations, every manufacturer must sell a certain number of emission-free vehicles, calculated as a proportion of overall sales. Consequently, California has become the hub for the mass installation of fast charging points. One of the state’s utility companies, Southern California Edison, estimates that 25 percent of its network must be upgraded to support new chargers.

“We hope we’ll be ready for fast charging when Electrify America is ready to install it,” said Caroline Choi, the utility’s senior vice president of regulatory affairs.

For now, the number of charging stations remains relatively low. According to the Department of Energy, there are just over 16,000 public electric vehicle charging points in the United States, offering about 44,000 individual outlets of varying charging speeds. By comparison, there are 120,000 gas stations nationwide, many of which have 10 or more pumps.

Fifty years later, it is worth remembering the place of draft resisters in the American tradition of dissent.","If the president had been better briefed, he would have known that the week’s theme of moving “from protest to resistance” came in large part from the expectation that thousands of draft-age men would deliberately defy draft laws. And he knew enough about the draft that he should have seen these protests coming.

By 1967, it made sense for protesters to target the Selective Service System. Nearly everyone agreed that the draft did not operate fairly. Since the 1950s, the government faced a fundamental problem administering a peacetime system of conscription: The baby boom produced too many draft-age men. Even during the Vietnam War, the military enlisted or drafted fewer than 11 million draft-age men out of a pool of nearly 27 million. Under the direction of Gen. Lewis Hershey, the Selective Service fashioned a system of deferments and exemptions that local draft boards awarded to registrants for pursuing certain activities outside the military, such as going to college or medical, dental or divinity school; serving in the reserves; or working for a defense contractor.

By 1966, as draft calls increased dramatically, the system of deferments came under intense criticism. In response, President Johnson appointed a commission that confirmed the inequities of the system. In effect, the draft turned the Vietnam War into a “working-class war,” as the historian Christian Appy has labeled it, with disproportionate numbers of the poor and working-class sent to Vietnam while everyone else seemed to go off to college.

Meanwhile, revelations from a 1965 Selective Service training kit exposed the draft not only as unfair, but as a vast social engineering project. In the so-called “channeling memo,” first published in New Left Notes in January 1967, General Hershey wrote to draft board officials that the process of delivering a few thousand men to induction centers “is not much of an administrative challenge,” Rather, General Hershey declared, “it is in dealing with the other millions of registrants that the System is heavily occupied, developing more effective human beings in the national interest.” Too bad no one told the American public that the real point of the draft was to develop “more effective human beings.”

Yet, through the use of “channeling” — of wielding the threat of induction to push young men into activities the Selective Service saw as advancing the “national interest” — the draft produced a “psychology of granting wide choice under pressure.” This, General Hershey claimed, was “the American or indirect way of achieving what is done by direction in foreign countries where choice is not permitted.”

The channeling memo exposed a coercive draft system that took a generation of men and threw them into an arena to compete with one another, in a competition few of them would have chosen for themselves. Getting a deferment meant survival. For the men who became draft resisters and for their supporters, the realization that they were compelled to play an undemocratic game that privileged some Americans over others only reinforced their sense that the United States had strayed from its most cherished values.

They did not take their decision to resist the draft lightly. As children of the Second World War generation, they had thought of their country as a leader of nations: The United States had defeated fascism abroad, prosecuted Nazi war criminals and brought the United Nations to New York.

As they came of age, however, they saw Lyndon Johnson escalate the war in Vietnam almost unilaterally, killing hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese civilians and tens of thousands of Americans. Instead of being a model nation, the United States now faced international condemnation, even from allies, over its use of overwhelming military power. After years of signing petitions, writing to their congressmen and turning out for large-scale demonstrations, to no avail, draft resisters now upped the ante.

A loose coalition of “Resistance” organizers planned the national draft card turn-in. They were inspired by the civil rights movement, the Berkeley Free Speech Movement (during which one of its leaders, Mario Savio, described having to “put your bodies upon the gears, and upon the wheels, and upon the levers” in order to stop the operation of an odious “machine”) and the precedent of resisters such as Muhammad Ali. By risking indictment, they thought that they could put the Johnson administration — and the war itself — on trial in court proceedings all over the country.

Tens of thousands of Americans supported draft resisters by signing their names to complicity statements. The most prominent of these, “The Call to Resist Illegitimate Authority,” was written by intellectuals and first published in The New York Review of Books and The New Republic. The “Call” emphasized documented incidents of American war crimes in Vietnam, and called on Americans to support draft resisters, whom signers saw as “courageous and justified.”

Few were radicals. Boston draft resisters, for example, were mostly middle to upper -middle class, the children of Democrats who presumably voted for Johnson in 1964. Most important, 82 percent of them held deferments that protected them from being drafted. By breaking the law, they willfully made themselves vulnerable to prosecution and to being called for induction. These were hardly the acts of cowards.

“There was something of the flying trapeze in these maneuvers now,” Norman Mailer reported when the draft cards were returned to the Justice Department. The commitment to an uncertain future that might involve a prison sentence was like a “moral leap which the acrobat must know when he flies off into space,” he wrote. “One has to have faith in one’s ability to react with grace en route, one has,” he concluded, “to believe in some kind of grace.”

Neither President Johnson nor General Hershey saw any grace in draft resistance. Hershey responded enthusiastically to the president’s order to act on draft resistance by instructing draft boards to reclassify and call for induction anyone who turned in their draft cards — actions that the Supreme Court later ruled (in the case of James Oestereich, among others) unconstitutional.

And although draft resisters expected to be arrested and prosecuted, Attorney General Ramsey Clark surprised them by indicting only a handful of ringleaders, including the famed pediatrician Dr. Benjamin Spock. (The convictions in that trial were overturned on appeal.)

The draft resisters’ mass civil disobedience strategy did not work out the way they planned; they did not get the chance to put the war on trial in hundreds of federal court proceedings all over the nation. But Johnson administration papers show that the president did not grant General William Westmoreland’s request for 206,000 additional troops in part because so many administration officials predicted more draft resistance, on an unprecedented scale.

Fifty years later, it is worth remembering the place of draft resisters in the American tradition of dissent.

In an interview with the BBC published early Sunday, the director Woody Allen addressed the wave of allegations against Harvey Weinstein, calling it “tragic for the poor women” but also warning against a “witch hunt atmosphere.”

Those comments drew harsh criticism on social media, and on Sunday night Mr. Allen released a statement calling Mr. Weinstein “a sad, sick man.”

But her teenage discovery that her grandmother’s town was once home to thousands of Jews who perished in the Holocaust set her on a different path: a 30-year journey documenting persecuted religious minorities around the world.

Her research has led her to photograph Sufis in northern Africa, Christians in the Middle East, Tibetan Buddhist monks, Old Believers in Eastern Europe, Voudou practitioners in Haiti and Hasids in Galilee. Photographs from her work since 2001 are now featured in a book, “Where Gods Whisper,” published by Contrasto Books.

She has documented the unspeakable cruelties committed in the name of religion as well as uplifting moments of fellowship among Jews, Christians and Muslims. Her mission, to photograph oppressed religious minorities, she said, is a “kind of moral and ethical necessity.”

As a teenager, she had photographed Russian Orthodox churches where she felt seduced by the mysticism and the smells, colors and sounds that washed over her. At 19, she wandered along the borders of eastern Poland searching for remnants of communities and interviewing Byzantine Christians, Jews and Muslim Tatars. She has continued this work in pilgrimages to holy sites across five continents — teaching herself photography along the way.

Her grandparents’ house in Warka was a veritable shrine. “In one corner stood Our Lady of Perpetual Help, in another Our Lady of Sorrows,” she said and on Good Friday the townsfolk gathered in a Baroque church overlooking the river, where they knelt in prayer.

She was 6 when she learned that this had not always been the case.

“Beyond the bridge there was a sand hill that reared up steep as a mountain to our young eyes,” she wrote in “God’s People: A Travel Into Another Europe,” an earlier book. “In winter, our favourite sport was sledding down it and breaking the ice around the willows on the riverbank. One day around Christmas, my sled hit a rock and when I looked closely, I could see strange signs under the snow. Digging with my hands, I unearthed a sculpted lion. This lion buried in the snow, with arcane signs like hieroglyphics, left me breathless with astonishment. I felt as if I had discovered something fabulous, like those great sea captains and explorers, Ahab, Fridtjof Nansen and Eric the Red, that I had read about in the books my grandfather kept for us on his bookshelf.”

Ms. Bulaj had stumbled upon remains of a vibrant Jewish culture that had once flourished in her grandmother’s town, but had withered under centuries of virulent anti-Semitism and had ultimately been destroyed during the Holocaust. It was the town’s “total silence” about their former neighbors that led Ms. Bulaj to dedicate her life to documenting religious minorities.

Ms. Bulaj’s photographs bring us into the lives of endangered and oppressed communities while revealing the enduring power of spiritual experiences. Her work is a spiritual experience, too.

“I photograph instinctively,” she said. “I am close to them, I am touching them, I am crying for them.”

Wine With Cheese The final fusty belief is that cheese goes best with red wine.
It seems to me that many people now understand that white wine usually is a better match.","Sweet white wines ranging from barely sweet to luscious can be glorious with food. The key is balance: The residual sugar in the wine, often caused by incomplete fermentation, must be countered by lively acidity. In successful bottles, the result is a thrilling tightrope walk as the wine treads the line between sweet and dry. These wines are indisputably sweet, but the acidity cleans away any cloying sensation, leaving a dry, refreshing feeling after swallowing.

Good examples are certain German rieslings (another myth is that all German rieslings are sweet — not remotely true!) and demi-sec Vouvrays. For a course of foie gras and guinea hen terrine, Josh MacGregor of DB Bistro Moderne picked two Mosel rieslings from the Wehlener Sonnenuhr vineyard, a 2015 Dr. Loosen spätlese and a 2007 J.J. Prüm kabinett.

This stacked the deck a bit. Traditionally, foie gras is served with unctuously sweet wines like Sauternes. Even so, many of the diners seemed unpersuaded.

“People are stuck on the fact that they don’t like sweet wines,” Mr. Johnnes said after the dinner. “I don’t understand that. We’re such a sweet culture.”

Serving Temperatures It’s sadly an article of faith that many restaurants, and homes for that matter, will serve white wines too cold and red wines too warm.

It’s easy to see where this comes from. White wines are generally served cooler than reds, and in an era of refrigerators and ice, this has come to mean ice-cold. Reds, meanwhile, are to be served at “room temperature,” a term derived at a time when many rooms had thick stone walls, and the indoor temperature may have hovered around 60 degrees.

Serving whites too cold seriously compromises good bottles, muffling nuances and complexities. Conversely, mediocre whites ought to be served ice-cold; the temperature masks any flaws.

If you are knocking back the house pinot grigio at the corner bar, make sure the bottle comes directly from the refrigerator. For a fine white, though, take it out of the fridge a good half-hour before serving, and in restaurants, do not reflexively allow the bottle to be put on ice. Take its temperature first.

Reds are a bit trickier, depending on the age and texture of the wine. Ideally, a bottle should be slightly cool to the touch. Modern room temperature can often leave a good red seeming flabby or fatiguing. A slight chill is bracing to the wine. Tannic wines served too cold can seem tough and unpleasant. If a bottle seems too warm, 15 minutes in the fridge — or, at a restaurant, 10 minutes in an ice bucket — can work wonders.

For a complicated dish of potato gnocchi with sweetbreads, chanterelles and runner beans, Joe Robitaille of Bar Boulud and Boulud Sud picked two unusual wines: a rich, textured, amber-colored 2009 from Domaine Economou in Crete, made of the obscure vilana and thrapsathiri grapes, and a pinot noir from the Jura, the 2015 Arbois Les Gaudrettes from Domaine de Saint Pierre. These were excellent examples, and each benefited greatly from the correct serving temperature.

Unconventional Food Pairings Few wine issues cause so much anxiety as putting together food and wine. For this reason, I’ve always believed that the conventional wisdom — white wine with fish and poultry, red wine with meat — is not a bad place to start.

But as people become more confident, they quickly find the exceptions. Northern Rhône syrahs are beautiful with chicken, as is pinot noir or cabernet franc with duck. Seafood is another matter, and certain meatier specimens like salmon, tuna or octopus go well with light reds like pinot noir.

For a dish of salmon with figs and fennel in a red-wine sauce, Aaron Fusco of Café Boulud picked two less-conventional reds, a 2014 cabernet sauvignon and a 2014 merlot from the Carneros region of Sonoma County, both from Inconnu Wine.

Mr. Fusco’s underlying motive may have been to demonstrate that not all California reds are big and powerful. These were both delightfully fresh, the cabernet snappy and the merlot soft. They went well with the salmon, and though I might have preferred a pinot noir, the wines made their points.

Fine Vintage Fixations I have met too many people who will buy fine wines only from vintages that critics deem great. This may be a fine strategy for investors — those who buy great wines with the intent of reselling for a profit — but for people who simply want to enjoy good wines, it is a mistake, and sometimes a costly one.

Burgundy lovers who bought the 2005s and refused the 2007s have missed out on a lot of pleasure as they have waited, and perhaps lost patience, with the ’05s. Bordeaux drinkers who favored the 2000 and 2010 vintages over the ’01s and ’11s may have had similar experiences. If you buy wines with long-term aging in mind (20 years or more), then by all means focus on the best vintages. Keep in mind that what constitutes a great vintage is often a matter of opinion.

This was borne out in a course of squab with currants. Mr. Johnnes and Raj Vaidya of Daniel picked two Côte-Rôties, a Domaine Ogier from 2010, an excellent vintage, and a Domaine Jamet from 2011, not a bad vintage though not as good as 2010.

Even accounting for the different styles of the producers, the 2011 was far more giving, offering a chorus of savory flavors, while the 2010 was tight and reticent. I’m not sure how both of these wines will fare in another decade. At this tasting, one was a wine of pleasure, the other a wine of potential.

Wine With Cheese The final fusty belief is that cheese goes best with red wine. Does anyone still follow this? It seems to me that many people now understand that white wine usually is a better match. People have become so dogmatic about this that I wrote a column a few years ago making the case that once in a while, red wine is still a good choice.

Apparently, this battle is still being fought at the Boulud restaurants. So, with two goat cheeses, one from France and one from Vermont, Ian Smedley, who had been sommelier at DBGB until it closed in August, chose a 2013 L’Etoile from Domaine de Montbourgeau in the Jura, made of chardonnay and savagnin, and an unusual sour ale, Sakura from Carton Brewing in Atlantic Highlands, N.J.

Now, I love sour ales and the combination of beer and cheese. Yet this particular ale was a little too odd for my comfort, blending sour, salty and fruity. The white, on the other hand, was beautiful with the cheeses. I’m not sure it was a revelation to the group, but if anyone needed reminding, this was a good way to do it.

What other myths could have been addressed? The issue of aging, rosés included. The effect of oak barrels on wine. Vineyard practices and soil composition. As I said, the feast could have gone on for days.

“I wept the whole time,” Ms. Edmondson recalled. “I disassociated out of my body.”

Since the late 1990s, an estimated 16,000 people have enrolled in courses offered by Nxivm (pronounced Nex-e-um), which it says are designed to bring about greater self-fulfillment by eliminating psychological and emotional barriers. Most participants take some workshops, like the group’s “Executive Success Programs,” and resume their lives. But other people have become drawn more deeply into Nxivm, giving up careers, friends and families to become followers of its leader, Keith Raniere, who is known within the group as “Vanguard.”

Both Nxivm and Mr. Raniere, 57, have long attracted controversy. Former members have depicted him as a man who manipulated his adherents, had sex with them and urged women to follow near-starvation diets to achieve the type of physique he found appealing.

Now, as talk about the secret sisterhood and branding has circulated within Nxivm, scores of members are leaving. Interviews with a dozen of them portray a group spinning more deeply into disturbing practices. Many members said they feared that confessions about indiscretions would be used to blackmail them.

Mark Vicente, a filmmaker and former top Nxivm official, said that after hearing about the secret society, he confronted Mr. Raniere.

“I said, ‘Whatever you are doing, you are heading for a blowup,’” Mr. Vicente said.

Several former members have asked state authorities to investigate the group’s practices, but officials have declined to pursue action.

In July, Ms. Edmondson filed a complaint with the New York State Department of Health against Danielle Roberts, a licensed osteopath and follower of Mr. Raniere, who performed the branding, according to Ms. Edmondson and another woman. In a letter, the agency said it would not look into Dr. Roberts because she was not acting as Ms. Edmondson’s doctor when the branding is said to have happened.

Separately, a state police investigator told Ms. Edmondson and two other women that officials would not pursue their criminal complaint against Nxivm because their actions had been consensual, a text message shows.

State medical regulators also declined to act on a complaint filed against another Nxivm-affilated physician, Brandon Porter. Dr. Porter, as part of an “experiment,” showed women graphically violent film clips while a brain-wave machine and video camera recorded their reactions, according to two women who took part.

The women said they were not warned that some of the clips were violent, including footage of four women being murdered and dismembered.

“Please look into this ASAP,” a former Nxivm member, Jennifer Kobelt, stated in her complaint. “This man needs to be stopped.”

In September, regulators told Ms. Kobelt they concluded that the allegations against Dr. Porter did not meet the agency’s definition of “medical misconduct,” their letter shows.

Mr. Raniere and other top Nxivm officials, including Lauren Salzman, did not respond to repeated emails, letters or text messages seeking comment. Dr. Roberts and Dr. Porter also did not respond to inquiries.

Former members said that, inside Nxivm, they are being portrayed as defectors who want to destroy the group.

It is not clear how many women were branded or which Nxivm officials were aware of the practice.

A copy of a text message Mr. Raniere sent to a female follower indicates that he knew women were being branded and that the symbol’s design incorporated his initials.

“Not initially intended as my initials but they rearranged it slightly for tribute,” Mr. Raniere wrote, (“if it were abraham lincolns or bill gates initials no one would care.)”

From the Message Below is an excerpt of a text message Mr. Raniere sent to a female follower, which suggested that he knew women were being branded and that the symbol’s design incorporated his initials. “... Not intended initially as my initials but they rearranged it slightly for tribute (if it were abraham lincolns or bill gates initials no one would care). The primary meaning and design of the brand symbol has nothing to do with my initials ...”

Joining the Sisterhood

Ms. Edmondson, who lives in Vancouver and helped start Nxivm’s chapter there, was thrilled when Lauren Salzman arrived in January to teach workshops.

The women, both in their early 40s, were close and Ms. Edmondson regarded Ms. Salzman as a confidante and mentor.

“Lauren was someone I really looked up to as a rock star within the company,” said Ms. Edmondson, an actress who joined Nxivm about a decade ago.

During her visit, Ms. Salzman said she had something “really amazing” she wanted to share. “It is kind of strange and top secret and in order for me to tell you about it you need to give me something as collateral to make sure you don’t speak about it,” Ms. Edmondson recalled her saying.

The proposition seemed like a test of trust. After Ms. Edmondson wrote a letter detailing past indiscretions, Ms. Salzman told her about the secret sorority.

She said it had been formed as a force for good, one that could grow into a network that could influence events like elections. To become effective, members had to overcome weaknesses that Mr. Raniere taught were common to women — an overemotional nature, a failure to keep promises and an embrace of the role of victim, according to Ms. Edmondson and other members.

Submission and obedience would be used as tools to achieve those goals, several women said. The sisterhood would comprise circles, each led by a “master” who would recruit six “slaves,” according to two women. In time, they would recruit slaves of their own.

“She made it sound like a bad-ass bitch boot camp,” Ms. Edmondson said.

Ms. Edmondson and others said that during training, the women were required to send their master texts that read “Morning M” and “Night M.” During drills, a master texted her slaves “?” and they had 60 seconds to reply “Ready M.”

Trainees who failed had to pay penalties, including fasting, or could face physical punishments, two women said.

In March, Ms. Edmondson arrived for an initiation ceremony at Ms. Salzman’s home in Clifton Park, N.Y., a town about 20 miles north of Albany where Mr. Raniere and some followers live. After undressing, she was led to a candlelit ceremony, where she removed a blindfold and saw Ms. Salzman’s other slaves for the first time. The women were then driven to a nearby house, where the branding took place.

In the spring, the sorority grew as women joined different circles. Slaves added compromising collateral every month to Dropbox accounts, and a Google Document was used to list a timetable for recruiting new slaves, several women said.

Around the same time, an actress, Catherine Oxenberg, said she learned her daughter had been initiated into the sorority.

“I felt sick to my stomach,” said Ms. Oxenberg, who starred in the 1980s television series “Dynasty.”

Ms. Oxenberg had become increasingly concerned about her 26-year-old daughter, India, who looked emaciated from dieting. She told her mother that she had not had a menstrual period for a year and that her hair was falling out.

Ms. Oxenberg said she invited her daughter home in late May to try to get her away from the group.

When Ms. Oxenberg confronted her about the sorority, her daughter defended its practices.

“She said it was a character-building experience,” Ms. Oxenberg said.

‘Humans Can Be Noble’

By the time the secret group was taking shape, Mark Vicente, the filmmaker, had been a faithful follower of Mr. Raniere for more than a decade.

Mr. Vicente said he had been contacted by Ms. Salzman’s mother, Nancy, a co-founder of Nxivm who is known as “Prefect,” after the 2004 release of a documentary he co-directed that explored spirituality and physics.

Soon, Mr. Vicente was taking courses that he said helped him expose his fears and learn strategies that made him feel more resolute.

He also made a documentary called “Encender el Corazón,” or “Ignite the Heart,” which lionized Mr. Raniere’s work in Mexico.

“Keith Raniere is an activist, scientist, philosopher and, above all, humanitarian,” Mr. Vicente says in the film.

Mr. Raniere has used those words to describe himself. On his website, he said he spoke in full sentences by age 1, mastered high school mathematics by 12 and taught himself to play “concert level” piano. At 16, he entered Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y.

Before Nxivm, he helped run a company called Consumers’ Buyline Inc., which offered discounts to members on groceries and other products.

In the mid-1990s, several state attorneys general investigated it as a suspected pyramid scheme; Mr. Raniere and his associates agreed to shut it down.

Through Nxivm, Mr. Raniere transformed himself into a New Age teacher with long hair and a guru-like manner of speaking.

“Humans can be noble,” he says on his website. “The question is: will we put forth what is necessary?”

By many accounts, Mr. Raniere sleeps during the day and goes out at night to play volleyball or take female followers for long walks. Several women described him as warm, funny and eager to talk about subjects that interested them.

Others saw a different side. Nxivm sued several former members, accusing them of stealing its trade secrets, among other things.

Mr. Vicente said he was aware of the negative publicity, including a 2012 series by The Albany Times-Union that described alleged abuses inside Nxivm.

Mr. Vicente’s views began to change this year after his wife was ostracized when she left Nxivm and he heard rumors about the secret sorority.

Photo

Mr. Vicente said he got evasive answers when he asked Mr. Raniere about the group. Mr. Raniere acknowledged giving “five women permission to do something,” but did not elaborate, other than to say he would investigate, Mr. Vicente said.

Mr. Vicente said he suspected Mr. Raniere was lying to him and might have done so before. Suddenly, self-awareness techniques he had learned felt like tools that had been used to control him.

“No one goes in looking to have their personality stripped away,” he said. “You just don’t realize what is happening.”

Followers Start to Flee

In May, Sarah Edmondson began to recoil from her embrace of the secret society.

Her husband, Anthony Ames, who was also a Nxivm member, learned about her branding and the couple both wanted out.

Before quitting, Mr. Ames went to Nxivm’s offices in Albany to collect money he said the group owed him.

He had his cellphone in his pocket and turned on its recorder.

On the recording, Mr. Ames tells another member that Ms. Edmondson was branded and that other women told him about handing over collateral. “This is criminal,” Mr. Ames says.

The voice of a woman — who Mr. Ames said is Lauren Salzman — is heard trying to calm him. “I don’t think you are open to having a conversation,” she said.

“You are absolutely right, I’m not open to having a conversation,” he replied. “My wife got branded.”

A few days later, many of Mr. Raniere’s followers learned of the secret society from a website run by a Buffalo-area businessman, Frank R. Parlato Jr. Mr. Parlato had been locked in a long legal battle with two sisters, Sara and Clare Bronfman, who are members of Nxivm and the daughters of Edgar Bronfman, the deceased chairman of Seagram Company.

In 2011, the Bronfman sisters sued Mr. Parlato, whom they had hired as a consultant, alleging he had defrauded them of $1 million.

Four years later, in 2015, the Justice Department indicted him on charges of fraud and other crimes arising from alleged activities, including defrauding the Bronfmans. Mr. Parlato has denied the claims and the case is pending.

Mr. Parlato started a website, The Frank Report, which he uses to lambaste prosecutors, Mr. Raniere and the Bronfmans. In early June, Mr. Parlato published the first in a torrent of salacious posts under the headline, “Branded Slaves and Master Raniere.”

A Nxivm follower, Soukaina Mehdaoui, said she reached out to Mr. Raniere after reading the post. Ms. Mehdaoui, 25, was a newcomer to Nxivm, but the two had grown close.

She said Mr. Raniere told her the secret sorority began after three women offered damaging collateral to seal lifetime vows of obedience to him.

While Ms. Mehdaoui had joined the sorority, the women in her circle were not branded. She was appalled.

“There are things I didn’t know that I didn’t sign up for, and I’m not even hearing about it from you,” she texted Mr. Raniere.

Mr. Raniere texted back about his initials and the brand.

By then, panic was spreading inside Nxivm. Slaves were ordered to delete encrypted messages between them and erase Google documents, two women said. To those considering breaking away, it was not clear whom they could trust and who were Nxivm loyalists.

Late one night, Ms. Mehdaoui met secretly with another Nxivm member. They took out their cellphones to show they were not recording the conversation.

Both decided to leave Nxivm, despite concerns that the group would retaliate by releasing their “collateral” or suing them.

Ms. Mehdaoui said that when she went to say goodbye to Mr. Raniere, he urged her to stay.

“Do you think, I’m bad, I don’t agree with abuses,” she recalled him saying. He said the group “gives women tools to be powerful, to regain their power for the sake of building love.”

Nxivm recently filed criminal complaints with the Vancouver police against Ms. Edmondson and two other women accusing them of mischief and other crimes in connection with the firm’s now-closed center there, according to Ms. Edmondson. The women have denied the allegations. A spokesman for the Vancouver police declined to comment.

Ms. Edmondson and other former followers of Mr. Raniere said they were focusing on recovering.

“There is no playbook for leaving a cult,” she said.",Inside a Secretive Group Where Women Are Branded,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/nyregion/nxivm-women-branded-albany.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

“It’s kind of an unknown creature on the landscape that is not moving,” Mr. Betchkal said. And in bear language, that steadfastness is a sign of dominance. The equipment says, try me, and the bear says O.K. This interaction is rare, and most fall into the first category.

But Mr. Betchkal thinks the Karupa Lake bear was a type two, and judging by the sound of its lungs and the location, it was a grizzly.

In setting up the equipment, Mr. Betchkal was interested in learning how unexpected, human-made background noise might shrink your ability to perceive sound across the vast landscape.

In the United States, legislation will expire in July that gives the Trump administration more extensive authority to negotiate trade deals and then submit them to Congress for a simple up or down vote, without amendments.

“If we lose T.P.A., I don’t think you’ll ever see a deal done here,” Mr. Ross said. “In general terms, once you get much into next year, nobody is going to be able to get as big and complicated of a deal as this done.”

Speaking to reporters on Tuesday after the fourth round of talks, Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States chief trade negotiator, said the “end of the year was never a hard target” and that the previous timeline was putting too much pressure on the process, which requires consultation with Congress, labor unions and industry associations.

Mr. Lighthizer described the hard process of renegotiating a substantially altered trade agreement that, he hoped, would capture support from businesses, labor groups, the president and both political parties in Congress.

“It is important for the trading system that we end up establishing a solid majority for the kind of things we’re doing, and we not keep operating right on the fringe,” he said. “If we can do that, then this will truly be a historic agreement.”

Negotiators for Mexico and Canada expressed frustration after the talks concluded.

Chrystia Freeland, Canada’s minister of foreign affairs, said her country had seen “a series of unconventional proposals in critical areas of the negotiations that make our work much more challenging.”

“We have seen proposals that would turn back the clock on 23 years of predictability, openness and collaboration under Nafta,” Ms. Freeland said. “This is troubling.”

Ildefonso Guajardo, the Mexican secretary of the economy, said his country was still striving to bring constructive solutions and not end up “in a lose-lose-lose situation.”

The demise of Nafta, a deal that has knit together the North American economy over the last quarter century, would be a heavy blow to all three economies. A new study by Impactecon, an American consulting firm, found that the United States would lose 256,000 net jobs if it withdrew from Nafta, with the most severe impact on low-wage employment. Mexico would lose 951,000 net jobs, and Canada 125,000, the report projected.

The outcome could also damage the North American security relationship, straining cooperation to combat money-laundering, terrorism, the drug trade and undocumented migrants coming through Central America, the report said.

The Trump administration came into office promising to scrap or overhaul trade deals like Nafta and the Trans-Pacific Partnership and forge new bilateral deals in their stead. But the Nafta talks illustrate that the Trump administration has found it easier to criticize trade deals than forge politically popular ways to amend them.

The delay in talks into next year will give the United States government time to try to resuscitate the 1994 trade pact. But it is still unclear how the United States will move forward with provisions that foreign partners and the business community in the United States consider to be non-starters.

Those provisions include a five-year sunset clause that would cause Nafta to automatically expire unless the three countries voted to continue it — a proposal that businesses say would inject so much uncertainty into the deal as to effectively nullify it.

The Trump administration is also pushing for drastic revisions to the mechanisms that help to resolve disputes under Nafta. Its proposals would allow countries to reject the ruling of independent panels on state-to-state disputes, as well as change the investor-state dispute settlement provision to an opt-in basis, and substantially curtail the ability of investors to bring such cases.

In his remarks, Mr. Lighthizer said he considered these provisions to be a kind of “political risk insurance” and a market distortion that encouraged businesses to invest abroad.

The Trump administration is pushing for higher thresholds for the amount of products that must be manufactured in North America to qualify for Nafta’s zero tariffs — for instance, 85 percent for automobiles, up from 62.5 percent previously. The United States has also proposed that cars manufactured in Canada and Mexico be made with 50 percent American content, effective immediately.

Other sticking points center on agriculture, which makes up a large part of commerce between the three nations. The United States is pushing to eliminate a program that lowers prices for certain Canadian dairy products, and also create a faster channel for American produce growers to bring trade cases against low-price imports of Mexican produce like tomatoes and avocados.

Many businesses in Mexico appear to be planning ahead for life without Nafta. Jorge Guajardo, Mexico’s ambassador to China (no relation to the economy minister), said he no longer got the sense while speaking with Mexican chief executives “that there was any hesitation that Nafta is dead.”

The clash over Nafta, including the tough talk and threats by Mr. Trump, are making countries more hesitant to jump into talks with the United States.

Speaking Tuesday morning, Jyrki Katainen, a vice president at the European Commission, said that the United States trade posture had benefited Europe. About eight or nine months ago, other countries started to call European leaders, asking to move more quickly in their trade negotiations.

Mr. Spencer is the president of the National Policy Institute, which describes itself as “an independent research and educational foundation,” and has produced papers on issues like racial differences in intelligence and the crime rate among Hispanic immigrants.

He is credited with coining the term “alternative right,” or “alt-right,” almost a decade ago. He is the American editor of the website Altright.com.

The Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors hate groups, has called him “a suit-and-tie version of the white supremacists of old, a kind of professional racist in khakis,” though Mr. Spencer has denied that he is a white supremacist.

After the presidential election, he saluted an audience of more than 200 at the National Policy Institute’s annual conference in Washington with the cry “Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory!” In response, a number of his supporters gave the Nazi salute.

In May Mr. Spencer, a University of Virginia graduate, led a torch-bearing group in Charlottesville to a statue of Robert E. Lee, the confederate general, that the city wanted to remove. They chanted, “You will not replace us,” and “Blood and soil.” That dispute led to a bigger “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville in August, which erupted into street violence, leaving one woman dead when a car driven by a man associated with white supremacist groups plowed into a crowd.

Mr. Spencer appeared again in Charlottesville on Oct. 7 at a small torch-lit rally. He did not return a phone call seeking comment on his visit to the University of Florida.

Why will the college let him speak?

After the university denied Mr. Spencer’s original request, a local lawyer, Gary Edinger, threatened to sue on First Amendment grounds. Mr. Edinger, a First Amendment lawyer, said in an interview Tuesday that he had taken the case pro bono. His views do not match Mr. Spencer’s, he said, adding that he had voted for Bernie Sanders because he wanted a socialist for president.

The university responded to the lawsuit threat by saying that the ban was not supposed to be permanent, and then negotiated conditions of Mr. Spencer’s appearance with Mr. Edinger, said Janine Sikes, a spokeswoman for the university.

“Essentially the university opted to agree on a future date that gave us time to plan for safety and security, and certainly have some say in other factors leading to the event, making it during the daytime, for example,” Ms. Sikes said. Some colleges ask polarizing speakers to appear during the day to make crowd control easier.

As a public institution, the University of Florida cannot choose speakers based on their point of view, First Amendment experts say.

“The University of Florida can’t say we like country music, but we don’t like alternative music — or in this case, we like diversity, but we don’t like Richard Spencer’s message,” Clay Calvert, a journalism professor and First Amendment expert at the university, said.

The university is obligated to protect Mr. Spencer from demonstrators exercising what is called “the heckler’s veto,” Mr. Calvert said. “That’s the idea that the First Amendment does not allow an audience of hostile reaction to silence the speaker.”

The university said that security was expected to cost $500,000, far more than the $10,500 it is receiving from Mr. Spencer’s group to rent space on campus. But the university said it could not legally pass the security costs on to the National Policy Institute.

What about protests?

Far-right activists and counterprotesters have clashed in or around other campuses, including the University of California, Berkeley, Evergreen State College in Washington State and the University of Virginia. The counterprotesters have often been led by Antifa, or anti-fascists, wearing black masks and sometimes wielding pepper spray and other weapons.

The Orlando Antifa has alerted followers to Mr. Spencer’s appearance at the University of Florida. It reacted to the announcement that the National Guard was being mobilized with a tweet, “Remember the last time the national guard was invited to a university campus? #NoNazisAtUF.” The message was accompanied by the famous photo of an anguished woman kneeling over the body of a Kent State University student shot dead by the National Guard during a protest against the Vietnam War in 1970.

A group called No Nazis at UF has formed, consisting of students, community members and others, and about 90 of them marched to the administration building on Monday to protest Mr. Spencer’s appearance.

“Peaceful protests are certainly welcome,” Ms. Sikes, the university spokeswoman, said. In a provision that may be aimed at Antifa as well as Antifa’s opponents, the police are banning torches, masks and anything that can be used as a weapon at the speech.

Mr. Spencer will be appearing at the school’s Phillips Center for the Performing Arts. A security checkpoint will be set up, and 700 tickets will be handed out there on a first-come, first-serve basis, according to altright.com, raising the possibility that many of those attending will be there to heckle him.

What are other universities doing?

Mr. Spencer’s requests to speak have been rejected by Pennsylvania State University, Michigan State, Louisiana State and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Soon after the Charlottesville violence, Texas A&M canceled his planned Sept. 11 appearance there. But the University of Cincinnati last week said that it would grant Mr. Spencer a venue, with the date to be determined.

A lawsuit was filed on Mr. Spencer’s behalf against Michigan State. A similar lawsuit, against Auburn University, resulted in a federal judge’s ruling that he be allowed to speak there this past spring.

Some universities have rules requiring that speakers be invited by a student or student group. But the University of Florida has no such requirement.

Although universities are now dealing with protests and violence surrounding speakers on the right, there have been other eras when speakers on the left were the target.

There were protests against the University of Florida for allowing Abbie Hoffman, the Yippie leader and member of the Chicago Seven, to appear in 1970, Mr. Calvert said, and for letting a lieutenant of Louis Farrakhan, leader of the Nation of Islam, speak in the 1990s.

Mr. Stefanko — who was introduced to Mr. Springsteen through a mutual friend, the punk poet and rocker Patti Smith — also did the cover image for the Boss’s 1980 double album, “The River,” as well as other projects over the years.
The photographs will be on view in an exhibit at Morrison Hotel Gallery, New York, from Nov. 9, 2017.","When “Born to Run” transformed Bruce Springsteen into a star in 1975, he celebrated by following the title track’s advice: He got his own “chrome wheeled, fuel-injected” dream car.

Three years later, he drove that 1960 Corvette convertible to the photographer Frank Stefanko’s home in Haddonfield, N.J., for photo sessions that he hoped would produce cover art for his much anticipated follow-up album, 1978’s “Darkness on the Edge of Town.” The result was the opposite of the kind of glossy, self-celebratory portraits that had graced the album covers of freshly-minted rock stars since Elvis moved to Graceland and parked a new Cadillac out front.

The chosen cover photo — done not in a studio, but in a window alcove of Mr. Stefanko’s modest home — portrayed Mr. Springsteen as neither air-nor-hair brushed. He wore a white V-neck undershirt and looked more like one of the hard-luck road warriors that populate his songs than the rock and roll savior hailed on magazine covers.

“Frank’s photographs were stark,” Mr. Springsteen wrote in his 2016 memoir, “Born to Run,” whose cover featured a haggard portrait of the author posed with his ’Vette in Haddonfield in 1978. “[H]e managed to strip away your celebrity, your artifice, and get to the raw you. … His pictures captured the people I was writing about in my songs and showed me the part of me that was still one of them.”

Photo

The weekslong “Darkness” photo sessions were the first in 40-plus years of collaborations between Mr. Springsteen and Mr. Stefanko, who has collected his portraits and outtakes in “Bruce Springsteen, Further Up the Road,” a pricey ($380-$630) limited edition book to be published by Wall of Sound Editions in November.

Mr. Stefanko — who was introduced to Mr. Springsteen through a mutual friend, the punk poet and rocker Patti Smith — also did the cover image for the Boss’s 1980 double album, “The River,” as well as other projects over the years.

But it is the outtakes from the “Darkness” sessions, shot in and around Haddonfield when Mr. Springsteen turned 29, that strikingly capture the same kind of behind-the-rock-star persona that the now 68-year-old rocker presented in his autobiography and that he draws from in his one-man “Springsteen on Broadway” shows at the Walter Kerr Theater. In the solo show, noted the New York Times reviewer Jesse Green, he “comes off as the kind of character he often writes about: a pink-slipped worker in a shuttered factory in a dying industry.”

As Eric Meola, who shot the famous “Born to Run” album cover photo, writes in an introduction to Mr. Stefanko’s book, “In some of the outtakes from the “Darkness” sessions, Bruce simply stares at the camera with the dazed look of someone who has just shaken off blows from an unseen adversary.”

In one such black and white tramps-like-me portrait, Mr. Stefanko shot Mr. Springsteen — dressed in jeans, motorcycle boots, a checked shirt and leather jacket — as he sat on the two-step brick porch of a home not a lot different from the one where he grew up on the poorer side of Freehold, N.J. Not to mention looking like he didn’t know what — a night on the town or rock superstardom — hit him.

Other photos, including the book’s cover, find him in the same checked shirt, hulking down a grim brick alleyway and crammed into a booth with his E Street Band mates, looking like a street gang of off-duty drag racers, at Shellow’s, an ice cream shop in nearby East Camden, N.J.

Photo

Despite the downbeat mood of most of the photos, Mr. Springsteen was in good spirits throughout the Darkness sessions, Mr. Stefanko said in a 2010 interview with the music website Pitchfork. “Especially when the E Street Band was in the house,” he said. “Bruce kept everyone from getting bored by telling these wild stories. And I learned that Clarence Clemons was a great chess player. Some of the guys even set up a craps table on my dining room table between shots, just to pass the time.”

Mr. Stefanko said some of his color photos were done in an attempt to recreate the feel of “an old Kodacolor snapshot” that might have been found while rummaging “in somebody’s drawer.”

Consider this simple image (Slide 3): Mr. Springsteen sits on the bed of an otherwise nondescript motel room cradling an acoustic guitar. Mounted on the wall is an amateur but eye-catching painting of a woman in a white wedding gown with pink sash, floating like an angel in the sky.

The painting is similar to an image that hung in Mr. Springsteen’s boyhood home and that, he wrote in his autobiography, haunted him all his life. It was a photo of a girl in a white dress, his father’s sister, killed by a truck at age 5 while riding her tricycle. The death changed his family’s dynamic, causing long-lasting rifts that ultimately led him to get out while he was young — and to that motel room with the means of his escape in hand. And a reminder on the wall of a dead aunt whose “seemingly benign gaze” warned, he wrote, “‘Watch out!’”

Mr. Stefanko’s book is itself a kind of drawer full of forgotten snapshots, some offering clues to what it was that made their subject know that like his characters, he too was born to run.



The photographs will be on view in an exhibit at Morrison Hotel Gallery, New York, from Nov. 9, 2017.

Question: We’re told by our secretary of state that he’s been engaged in some secret contacts with North Korea, exploring the possibility of a diplomatic solution that might dramatically reduce North Korea’s nuclear arsenal in return for U.S. promises of regime security. If, at the same time, Trump unilaterally pulls out of the deal we’ve already signed with Iran to prevent it from developing nukes — and Trump moves to reimpose sanctions — how does that not send only one message to the North Koreans: No deal with the U.S. is worth the paper it’s written on, so you’d be wise to hold on to all your nukes?

Question: Iran controls tens of thousands of Shiite militiamen in Iraq and Syria who were our tacit allies in defeating ISIS. Tehran also has huge influence over Iraq’s government and over certain regions of Afghanistan as well. Can we stabilize Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan — post-ISIS — and keep our troop presence low and safe, without Iran’s help — and will that help be coming after Trump rips up the nuclear deal? If you think so, please raise your hand.

And since our European allies as well as Russia and China have indicated that they will not follow us in backing out of the Iran deal or reimposing sanctions, Iran would have all the moral high ground and money it needs, and the U.S. would be isolated. Are we going to sanction E.U. banks if they deal with Iran?

Trump came into office vowing to end the trade imbalance with China — a worthy goal. And what was his first move? To tear up the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the trade deal that would have put the U.S. at the helm of a 12-nation trading bloc built around U.S. interests and values, potentially eliminating some 18,000 tariffs on U.S. goods and controlling 40 percent of global G.D.P. And China was not in the group. That’s called leverage.

Trump just ripped up the TPP to “satisfy the base” and is now left begging China for trade crumbs, with little leverage. And because he needs China’s help in dealing with North Korea, he has even less leverage on trade.

Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate accord and, at the same time, restricted U.S. government funding for birth control both at home and abroad. Question: What is driving so many immigrants and refugees in Africa, the Middle East and Central America to try to get out of their world of disorder and into America and Europe and the world order?

Answer: It is a cocktail of climate change, environmental degradation, population explosions and misgovernance in these countries. So Trump’s policy is to throw away every tool we have to mitigate climate change and population growth and try to build a wall instead, while also trying to bully Mexico’s unpopular president into trade concessions, which could help elect a radical populist in next year’s Mexican election — a successor who would be anti-American — and destabilize its economy as well.

At a time when China has decided to go full-bore into clean tech and electric cars, at a time when all of the tech giants are building data centers that they want powered by clean energy, at a time when solar and wind power are growing increasingly competitive with fossil fuels (and America still has a technological lead in many of these areas), at a time when climate change may be stimulating bigger hurricanes and forest fires that are costing us hundreds of billions of dollars, Trump’s central energy initiative is to reverse Obama’s and bring back coal-fired power.

The Google Assistant was the most adept of all the digital assistants, easily beating Siri and Amazon’s Alexa.
Still, after a few days, I was rather attached to the Pixel 2 XL.","Now comes the Pixel 2. After testing the gadget for nearly a week, I found I prefer it to the iPhone — though this is mostly because I have always carried Android phones. Android is what I’m used to, and all my digital data is stored with Google, even though my daughters think I’m silly for not buying an iPhone.

Compared with other Android devices, the Pixel 2 XL, the model I tested and the larger of the two versions of the device, was also a big improvement. I own a Samsung Galaxy S7, widely considered the best Android phone on the market a year ago when it went on sale.

I liked that the Pixel 2 XL’s fingerprint reader, which instantly unlocks the phone, sat on the back of the device, not far from where my finger typically sits. I liked that the phone arrived with only a small number of essential apps, rather than the sea of flotsam that typically ships with Samsung phones. And I liked that, as my 13-year-old Snapchat-astic daughter said, “the camera is definitely better.”

(Incidentally, she meant it was not just better than my Samsung but also better than her iPhone. And that is not sacrilege. The detail and the colors are far sharper, even to an untrained eye like mine.)

The Pixel also charged quickly; a few minutes plugged into the wall gets you hours of battery life. Google said the device is water-resistant. And the screen, 6.2 inches along the diagonal, was enormous — though not so huge that I couldn’t comfortably hold the phone in one hand. It was nice that, for those rare occasions when I watched extended YouTube videos, the image stretched to the edge of the phone.

Photo

Yet is any of this all that different from other top-of-the-line phones? Not really. And Google knows this. Even the steep $849 pricing for the Pixel 2 XL was in line with rivals.

In pitching the new Pixel, the company focused on the Google Assistant — Android’s answer to Siri — and other services that lean on what is commonly called artificial intelligence. This included Google Lens, a service that instantly identifies landmarks, books, movies and other stuff you capture in photos, as well as a service that, in similar fashion, automatically identifies songs playing on a nearby radio or television.

These were certainly the most impressive parts of the new phone. And they showed how recent advances in machine learning are producing consumer devices, cars and robots that can read, analyze and respond to their environment in ways that were not possible just a few years ago. Drawing on work by DeepMind, an A.I. lab in Britain that Google acquired in 2014, for instance, the Google Assistant now speaks with a voice that’s closer to your own.

“It sounds more normal,” my 13-year-old said. Still, she added that the improvement was small.

That sums up all these services. Many are technically impressive, and some are useful. But they took the Pixel only so far past the status quo.

Google Lens gave my 9-year-old several minutes of fun over the weekend. But it’s not something she — or I — would use on a regular basis. (And it mistook a picture in my bedroom of New York’s Flatiron Building for the Empire State Building.)

The service that identifies songs was even more fun and more useful. But it will never be anything more than a tiny part of our daily lives. And it mistakenly identified the musical score at the end of “The Spy Who Came In From the Cold” as the song “Chained” by the pop group the xx.

The Google Assistant was the most adept of all the digital assistants, easily beating Siri and Amazon’s Alexa. My younger daughter loved it. (At one point, she said it was more fun than me.)

But like those other assistants, it could not deal with more than just a handful of simple tasks, typically delivering web pages or preset answers in response to questions. When I asked the Assistant whether $824 was expensive for a smartphone, it gave me a YouTube video of a guy unboxing some sort of $20,000 monstrosity.

In most cases, it can recognize what you say. But it cannot necessarily understand what you say and respond in a completely satisfying way. That is still to come.

Google boasts that you can instantly switch the Assistant into a mode that lets you type questions rather than ask them orally. But as my wife said, these assistants are useful only because they let you handle basic tasks — like sending a text or setting an alarm — without typing. If I wanted to type, I would just visit google.com.

Still, after a few days, I was rather attached to the Pixel 2 XL. On the way to dinner on Saturday night, it correctly identified every song that played on the local 1980s station, from “The Warrior” to “Der Kommissar.”

Even so, I plan to keep the $849 for now.

When she and Mr. Boyle were kidnapped, Ms. Coleman was seven months pregnant; she gave birth four times in captivity.

The C.I.A. declined to comment. Trump administration officials cast the rescue as a win for Pakistan without publicly acknowledging that officials there had to be pressured into conducting the operation.

“This is a positive moment for our country’s relationship with Pakistan,” President Trump said in a statement.

Efforts to free the family had stalled repeatedly, and the family’s time as hostages was harsh. Mr. Boyle has said that his wife was raped and that the Taliban killed one of their children shortly after birth, an allegation the militants have denied.

But the Haqqanis freed no one else. American officials said communications with the Haqqani network had gotten garbled, causing confusion, and the death of the leader of the Taliban, killed by a United States drone strike last year, also set back efforts to rescue the hostages. The diapers that F.B.I. agents in Afghanistan had bought for Ms. Coleman’s children would go unused.

Not only were hostages kept in captivity, the militants were also not done kidnapping. In August 2016, they seized an Australian, Timothy Weeks, and an American, Kevin King, 61, both teachers at the American University of Afghanistan in Kabul. Navy SEALs launched a rescue operation but came up empty; a tip about where the men were being held turned out to be outdated.

But last month, the American intelligence community caught a break. The C.I.A. had positioned the drone over a Haqqani encampment in the Kurram Valley, a region near Pakistan’s border with Afghanistan. It spotted the woman believed to be Ms. Coleman among the armed fighters.

The commandos of SEAL Team 6, tapped to rescue the family, started rehearsing. The raid was to take place not far from where the C.I.A. had originally spotted the family, according to one military official.

But the risky operation planned on Pakistani soil was called off because some in the United States government were not certain that the people spotted by the drones were Ms. Coleman, Mr. Boyle and their children, according to the officials. Others voiced worries about the difficult terrain and the moon — it was too bright for a nighttime airborne raid.

Why the Haqqanis decided to move the family is not clear. But on Oct. 11, as they headed toward Kohat, a city farther inside Pakistan, American intelligence officials realized they could not let the opportunity to save the family slip by — the United States had to act.

American officials formed a plan to press the Pakistani government. Mr. Trump was briefed, and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson both backed the idea that should the Pakistani government decline to try to rescue the family, the Navy SEALs would go in.

Officials said that as Mr. Hale, the ambassador, conveyed the Trump administration’s demands, other senior officials, including Gen. Joseph L. Votel, who oversees American military operations in the Middle East and southwest Asia as head of the United States Central Command, were also applying pressure.

The push worked. American officials said the Pakistanis acted quickly, intercepting the vehicle with Ms. Coleman and her family. According to Pakistani security officials, they were able to shoot out the tires of the vehicle, but the captors manage to flee.

Mr. Boyle has said a gun battle ensued before he and his family were freed, but American officials remained skeptical and a Pakistani military spokesman has said only that the vehicle’s tires were blown out.

In an interview after he was freed, Mr. Boyle praised the Pakistanis: “Our gratitude is boundless.”",Navy SEALs Were Ready if Pakistan Failed to Free Family Held as Hostages,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/world/asia/hostage-rescue-pakistan-navy-seals.html

PhotoBefore a distillery can put an official Empire Rye sticker on its label, its whiskey must meet four criteria.
(By law, at least 51 percent of the grain in rye whiskey must be rye; the rest is usually corn.)
“My hope is that in 20 years people will say, ‘Empire Rye, I know that, too.’”Follow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.","Empire Rye is a potential answer to a problem born of craft distilling’s phenomenal success: Ten years ago there were about 100 companies making spirits in the United States; today there are nearly 1,400, according to the American Distilling Institute. “You have all these distilleries, all going the same way, so there’s no touchstone,” Mr. Williams said. “When you walk up to the craft shelf, you have no idea what to think about, what it means.”

Photo

At the same time, craft distillers, like chefs, are thinking more about the sources of their raw ingredients, the stories behind what they’re making and their relationships to their communities.

That’s why some of the country’s more forward-thinking distillers are looking toward regionalization, creating new subspecies like Pacific Northwest single malts or mesquite-smoked whiskey in the Southwest.

But no one has gone as far as the people behind Empire Rye.

The idea began three years ago at a craft-spirits conference in Denver. Mr. Williams was up late drinking with a who’s who of New York craft distilling — including Tom Potter, a founder of New York Distilling Company in Brooklyn; Nicole Austin, then a distiller at Kings County Distillery, also in Brooklyn; and Brian McKenzie, an owner of Finger Lakes Distilling in Burdett, N.Y. — when the conversation turned to their state’s exploding whiskey scene.

New York is one of the leading states for craft distilling, thanks to a 2007 law, championed by Ralph Erenzo, the founder and owner of Tuthilltown Spirits in Gardiner, that eased fees and other regulations on new operations that use mostly New York grains and fruits. Today the state has more than 100 distilleries — which is good news for craft spirits fans and the farmers who supply ingredients, but worrisome for a distiller looking at all that undifferentiated competition.

The discussion in Denver soon settled on the need for a distinguishing set of standards, a way to define New York rye and an incentive for other distillers to follow suit. “We shook hands, bleary-eyed, and decided to do something,” Mr. Potter said.

Photo

Before a distillery can put an official Empire Rye sticker on its label, its whiskey must meet four criteria. At least 75 percent of its grain must be New York-grown rye. It must be distilled to no more than 160 proof; put into a barrel at no more than 115 proof (which is below the industry standard of 125 proof); and aged at least two years in charred, new oak barrels.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

That may sound strict, but it leaves a lot of room to play around. This month, each of the original six members of the Empire Rye consortium — Coppersea, Tuthilltown, Black Button Distilling, New York Distilling, Kings County Distillery and Finger Lakes Distilling — will release a different take. Coppersea’s, for example, is made with 100 percent malted rye; Black Button’s contains 95 percent unmalted rye and 5 percent malted barley. (Three more distilleries have since signed on.)

“Every distillery has a chance to hit the standards,” Mr. Potter said, “but also to experiment.”

To get out the word on Empire Rye, the distilleries have declared this week New York Rye Week, and are staging numerous events in New York City. It doesn’t hurt that William Grant & Sons, the company that makes Glenfiddich and the Balvenie single malt whiskies in Scotland, just bought Tuthilltown — and is eager to promote Empire Rye as well.

Why rye? The distillers say that, for all its current cachet among bartenders and whiskey fans, rye remains largely unappreciated by most Americans, and thus especially ripe for innovation.

Photo

Rye was once a dominant American spirit, especially on the East Coast, where the hardy grain grew better than corn or barley, and where many drinkers knew regional styles like Maryland Rye or Old Monongahela, from Pennsylvania, by name.

But during Prohibition, Americans lost their taste for the spirit’s robust, spicy notes, and until recently almost all rye was made in Kentucky, with barely enough of the grain to qualify. (By law, at least 51 percent of the grain in rye whiskey must be rye; the rest is usually corn.)

“A lot of knowledge was lost in Prohibition,” said Jason Barrett, the head distiller and president of Black Button. “It set American whiskey back a hundred years.”

Over the last decade, American palates have once again embraced rye’s strength, but the lack of variety in craft ryes leaves a door open for initiatives like Empire Rye.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Empire Rye is a rare effort to define a regional identity for a whiskey, but New York is far from the only place with an emerging whiskey style. There is increasing talk about a Pacific Northwest style of single malt made with malted barley, from producers like Westland Distillery in Seattle and House Spirits Distillery in Portland, Ore.

Photo

Matt Hofmann, the master distiller at Westland, has been working with university agriculture departments to identify barley varietals that will flourish in the Northwestern climate; he has also used a regional variety of oak, the Garry or Oregon white oak, to make barrels for aging.

“We live in a time when you can make a good copy of anything anywhere,” Mr. Hofmann said. “But the places I get excited about are the ones that aren’t just copying, but taking the influence of what’s around them and applying it to what they’re doing.”

In some cases, it’s less a matter of innovating than excavating. Herman Mihalich, the founder of Mountain Laurel Spirits in Bristol, Pa., spent years researching the history of Old Monongahela, a style of rye once popular in the Mid-Atlantic states that largely disappeared after Prohibition.

“It was made with rye and malted barley, no corn, with a sweet mash on a pot still,” Mr. Mihalich said. He has recreated that style with Dad’s Hat, a sweet and supple rye that he sells in the United States and Europe.

“That sort of regionalization is going to be the future,” said Steven Baird, an owner of Cardiff Giant, a Brooklyn bar that specializes in New York food and drink. “They’re taking hints from the wine industry and giving consumers a sense of place.”

It remains to be seen whether consumers will take to the new regional styles. But the fact that regionalization is part of the conversation among craft distillers shows how far, and how rapidly, the industry has moved — and how far it wants to go.

“Bourbon means something the world over,” said Mr. Barrett, of Black Button. “My hope is that in 20 years people will say, ‘Empire Rye, I know that, too.’”

The Five run server clouds, app stores, ad networks and venture firms, altars to which the smaller guys must pay a sizable tax just for existing. For the Five, the start-up economy has turned into a heads-I-win-tails-you-lose proposition — they love start-ups, but in the same way that orcas love baby seals.

There is perhaps no better example of this dynamic than what has happened to Snap, the company that makes the disappearing messaging app Snapchat. Although it is one of the most innovative consumer-focused internet companies — Snap created a whole new paradigm in social networking, and pioneered the idea that the camera is the future of human communication — it has been battered by the giants.

After failing to buy Snap several years ago, Facebook repeatedly tried to copy its key innovations. This year, when Facebook lifted Snapchat’s Stories feature for Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook’s main app, it seemed to deliver a death blow.

But Facebook isn’t the only behemoth trying to feed off Snap’s carcass. In January, Snap signed a cloud hosting deal with Google. It agreed to pay Google $400 million a year for the next five years. Note that Snap booked only about $330 million in ad revenue in the first half of this year. In other words, it’s paying more than half of its revenue to Google.

Oh, and do you know who its largest competitors in the internet ad market are? Surprise! Facebook and Google.

The small guys won’t concede any this, of course. Unbridled optimism fuels start-up world, and many investors and start-up executives I talked to in recent weeks argued that with the insane amounts of money pouring into start-ups, the Five don’t have the whole game won.

They said the Five’s platforms had made starting companies cheaper and easier, and pointed to several successful start-ups that managed to elude the Five’s clutches in the last few years: Netflix, Uber and Airbnb. And when you look at business-focused companies that aren’t household names, you come up with dozens more, from Slack to Stripe to Square.

“In a lot of ways I’d say it hasn’t changed,” said Joey Levin, the chief executive of IAC, an internet and media company based in New York. “I’ve been around the internet long enough, and the first thing we used to ask in every meeting when I started was, ‘Why won’t Microsoft do your business?’ Then six years later it was, ‘Why doesn’t Google do it?’ Now it’s a combination of why can’t Facebook, Google, Apple or Amazon do this?”

Mr. Levin’s position is interesting. Even if you may not have heard of it, IAC has been battling giants online for a long time. The company grew out of the media tycoon Barry Diller’s television holdings of the 1990s; over the last two decades, IAC created a string of digital brands that tried to find some foothold outside the fiefs of the giants. Among them are Expedia, Match.com, Tinder, Ask.com and Vimeo.

Some of these companies became the biggest brands in their categories, while others were also-rans that came up short against the day’s tech giants. In many cases, though, IAC made money by shrewdly navigating the giants. Sometimes it worked with the behemoths, other times it competed with them, and always it looked for opportunities above and beneath and between the giants, like a clever pigeon picking up crumbs around a picnic table.

IAC’s latest gambit is Angi Homeservices, a company that combines two big brands aimed at home repair and refurbishing, Angie’s List and HomeAdvisor. That company competes directly with some of the Five — both Google and Amazon have services meant to help you find people to install things your house.

Chris Terrill, the chief executive, told me that Angi Homeservices had a dedicated team working on providing a service that’s superior to anything the giants can build. But he also said his company was eager to team up with one of the big guys — for instance, on one of their voice-assistant platforms — because working with one of the Five could ease its path into the big leagues.

“We think that a smart voice provider will say, ‘If I want to win at all costs, we’ll go get the very best partner’ — and that’s us,” Mr. Terrill said.

In some ways, IAC could be a model for the internet company of tomorrow. It clearly aims big and isn’t going for second place. But it has also internalized a kind of working method that recognizes the Five as more-or-less permanent fixtures of the internet. It’s not betting on their demise; rather, it’s betting on their continued success. If Angi is to win, so will one or more of the Five.

IAC’s executives recognize the danger of a digital marketplace that is so heavily dependent on big guys. “I think the opportunities are still there, but I do worry that some of the biggest players are going to stifle that competition by trying to do and own too much themselves,” Mr. Terrill said.

I asked another IAC veteran, Dara Khosrowshahi — who until recently was the chief executive of Expedia — whether he believed the internet was still an open field for innovation, or whether the Five were closing it off.

“I’m mixed as it relates to that,” he said. “I fundamentally think innovative ideas can still survive and thrive, but the Googles and Facebooks of the world have so much more intelligence as to mass consumer behavior that they probably have an unfair advantage in identifying these early fast movers — and are willing to pay prices that are extraordinary for them.”

In August, Mr. Khosrowshahi was appointed chief executive of Uber, where he will have to deal with the giants more directly. Though his company is the most highly valued start-up of our age, its success seems far from assured. Many of its problems are of its own making, and Mr. Khosrowshahi is determined to fix them.

But like Snap, Uber is at the mercy of the Five. Alphabet, Google’s parent company, is an investor in Uber. But Alphabet’s autonomous-car company, Waymo, is also a competitor to Uber. On top of that, Waymo has sued Uber, alleging theft of trade secrets.

The future of Uber, of ride-hailing and of autonomous vehicles in America is hazy.

What’s the matter with the Republican Party?","The success of Donald Trump’s populist candidacy seemed like a partial repudiation of this Randian turn, and a possible return to the middle-class-focused politics that had made Reagan and Bush successful — albeit in a more aggressively nationalist and mercantilist form. But as president, Trump has essentially become the Frankian caricature in full, draping the rhetoric of populism over an agenda that so far offers little or nothing to the middle class, making appeals to the religious right that are notable in their cynicism, and rallying his base through culture-war controversies distinguished mostly by their ginned-up phoniness.

So “What’s the Matter With Kansas?” was a poor guide to the party of Reagan and George W. Bush, but thus far it is a very useful guide to the Trump administration. And two possible takeaways from this shift seem worth considering.

The first is that, for all its failures, not everything about the Bush era was disastrous, and there were ways in which the Bush White House had a clearer sense of what conservatism should offer to the common man than any its would-be successors have come up with since.

This doesn’t excuse the disaster of Iraq or the various problems with Bush’s domestic agenda, including the way that one of his middle-class-friendly policies, the push for homeownership, contributed to the housing bubble and the crash. But it is still a mistake for the right to dismiss the Bush agenda as merely “a failure and a fraud,” as my friend Peter Suderman did recently in these pages, and also a mistake for liberals to suggest that Trump is just returning to the Bush playbook, as New York’s Jonathan Chait did in a recent piece.

Because he’s not really returning to it; indeed, as things stand in key respects Trump would benefit from imitating Bush. His tax plan offers much less to working Americans than did the Bush tax cuts. His larger agenda is much less thought-through than what Bush attempted in his first term. And if Trump wants to make his populism something more than just a con, he probably has to start with an issue — the child tax credit — that was part of both the Bush agenda and the Contract With America.

Appreciating Bush a little more, in this specific way, could offer some reason for optimism about the right. After all his administration was not that long ago, its record suggests that conservatism doesn’t have to be a mix of Randianism and racial resentment, and there’s no necessary reason that Republicans couldn’t learn important lessons from Bush’s failures (don’t try to build democracies in the Middle East, don’t pass an immigration increase your base doesn’t want, etc.) while also returning to his politically effective focus on the middle class.

But if you prefer pessimism, you’ll dwell instead on the second takeaway from Thomas Frank’s Trump-era vindication — namely, that a depressing percentage of American conservatives seem perfectly happy with the bargain that Frank claimed defined their party, with a president who ignores their economic interests and public policy more generally and offers instead the perpetual distraction of Twitter feuds and pseudo-patriotic grandstanding.

This dispiriting contentment is the sentiment you see from some of Trump’s blue-collar supporters, who love his uncouth rhetorical war on his fellow coastal elites so much that they’re willing to forgive him his threadbare policy agenda or else trust that gridlock and inertia will protect them from Republican bills whose actual contents they might probably oppose.

It’s also what you see from a segment of religious conservatives, like those gathered at last week’s Values Voters Summit, who cheered rapturously for an empty, strutting nationalism and a president who makes a mockery of the remoralized culture that they claim to seek.

Note that I don’t mean the religious conservatives who supported Trump reluctantly and in a transactional spirit, and who welcome his conservative judicial nominees. I mean those who plainly prefer his brutish braggart’s style to the sort of public decency that Bush or, in a different way, Mitt Romney offered — and who either spin elaborate fantasies about Trump the Christian or laud him as a Conan-esque warlord they think will drive their enemies before them.

For these Trump-besotted believers, you get the sense that the Bush administration’s attempts to devise a substantial socially conservative agenda, from bioethics to marriage promotion to faith-based initiatives and more, are remembered not for being timorous, limited or flawed (all of which they were) but for being simply boring. Far better to have a president who really sticks it to those overpaid babies in the N.F.L. and makes the liberals howl with outrage — that’s what a real and fighting conservatism should be all about!

What’s the matter with the Republican Party? Many things, but right now above all this: Far too many Trump supporters, far too many conservatives, have seen the then-inaccurate caricature that Frank painted 13 years ago brought to blaring, Technicolor life by Trump — and they’ve decided to become part of the caricature themselves, become exactly what their enemies and critics said they were, become a movement of plutocrats and grievance-mongers with an ever-weaker understanding of the common good.

The path out of caricature requires a different moral vision. It requires new ideas and new thinking and new models of leadership. But it also requires looking backward, to Bush and Reagan, to a Republicanism that had a thousand flaws but also understood a few important things Trump’s party has deliberately forgotten.",What’s the Matter With Republicans?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/opinion/whats-the-matter-with-republicans.html

It was founded by Chris Sheldrick, a bassoonist who went into the live music events business after suffering a hand injury. Sheldrick was frustrated by equipment going astray, suppliers coming to the wrong place and musicians failing to find the venue. (Note: That may not be the only reason bands show up late.) He started looking for a better way to communicate location.

What3words isn’t a navigation or route optimization program; it provides a precise, easy-to-convey location you can type or speak into navigation or route optimization software.

Sheldrick and his colleagues laid an imaginary 10-foot-by-10-foot grid over the entire planet, creating 57 trillion squares. Every location, of course, already has a unique address — its longitude and latitude. These are represented by a set of Global Positioning System coordinates, a string of numbers up to 18 digits long. (A GPS device is something else, a machine that uses the Global Positioning System to lead you to an address you input.) What3words simply assigns each grid square’s GPS coordinates a unique three-word address that’s easier to remember, type and say.

Using this map or a phone app, you can find the three-word address of any location, or the exact location of any three-word address, in 14 languages — including Mongolian, Arabic, Swahili, and Russian.

Every 10-foot-by-10-foot place on earth has three-word addresses in all 14 languages, with 14 more in the works. Each language is coded independently; the same place that’s collar.senda.aire in Spanish is expect.twitchy.hazelnuts in English, which is very much not a translation. In each language, what3words tries to put a lot of distance between similar addresses — monkey.fork.coconut is in Japan, while monkey.forks.coconut is in Switzerland, for example. That way if you make a mistake, you realize it right away.

So what good is this?

Well, precise addressing is incredibly useful for delivery companies. One big client (and investor) is Aramex, a Dubai-based global transport and delivery company. Aramex recently did a test in two well-addressed neighborhoods in Dubai. It gave 100 packages each to two teams. One set of drivers, who knew the areas, used normal addresses. The other team, unfamiliar with the neighborhoods, used what3words addresses. The what3words drivers took 42 percent less time, drove a 22 percent shorter route and needed no phone calls; the street-address drivers had to make 25 calls to ascertain locations.

What3words was faster because the locations were precise, but also because that precision allowed Aramex to use route optimization software, which tells the driver the best way to sequence a string of deliveries.

“A standard geocoder off-the-shelf is not accurate enough,” said Jack Levis, a senior director of engineering at UPS, which uses a route optimization system Levis designed, called Orion. “Your navigation system says you’ve arrived, but you’re not there,” he said. “For you and your personal vehicle, that inaccuracy is just an annoyance. But you feed it into an algorithm like Orion and it becomes a disaster.” If every driver adds one mile to his or her daily route, that costs UPS $50 million a year. And then there are the environmental costs of fuel and idling.

UPS uses package delivery history to pinpoint exactly where a driver should go. “We know the difference between where the driver parks and where the driver delivers,” he said. “We ended up creating the most accurate maps in the world.”

Levis said that its data efforts since 2004 have saved the company 185 million miles per year.

The value of what3words is that it can be used by anyone, anywhere: a driver in Los Angeles who wants to get a kidney to a recipient at the right hospital wing and entrance. Earthquake rescue teams in Mexico City. Attendees at Burning Man trying to find one another’s tents. Ground crews of the Red Cross in the Philippines telling headquarters exactly where help is needed. Mongolia’s postal service, which has trouble reaching slum dwellers and nomads. All those people do, in fact, use it. (Eight postal services are using or preparing to use what3words, including Nigeria’s.)

The system works only if people are aware of these addresses and know or can find the one marking their location. Also, the person or institution trying to reach a destination must be able to handle and make sense of a three-word address.

This will be slow work. But here’s why it could be worthwhile:

Dr. Coenie Louw leads South Africa’s Gateway Health Institute. Gateway works in informal settlements (sometimes known as slums), using technology to improve health, nutrition and human rights.

A recent challenge, Louw said, was devising a way to transport pregnant women to the hospital if labor became complicated. Louw said that 34,000 babies die each year in South Africa before they get to the hospital. One reason is that an ambulance can take hours to arrive. And one reason for that is that 1.7 million dwellings in South Africa have no addresses, according to Louw.

“I could never really locate them accurately,” he said. “People will say: ‘I live three doors away from the blue shebeen across from the green crèche.’” (That’s the blue pub and the green child-care center.) “Ambulances don’t find that. The idea is to give them a proper location so they can drive right there and there’s no issue.”

Last year, he read an article about what3words and contacted them to see if the system might be able to save some babies. (What3words charges businesses but provides its software free to humanitarian or disaster efforts.)

Gateway first chose an area to work in, an informal settlement in the city of Durban called KwaNdengezi. The organization hired 11 young people to go door to door, helping residents find their addresses and writing them down on cards to be posted on the door or just kept somewhere safe. The Gateway workers also registered the name, phone number and if the resident was willing, her official identification number, at every house.

When someone calls an ambulance, she gives the three-word address to the dispatcher, who tells it to the driver, who plugs it into a navigation app that accepts such addresses (Navmii is one) or uses what3words’s navigation app.

KwaNdengezi has 11,500 dwellings. Registering them is a slow process, as people must work in teams for safety. The group has almost reached 4,000, Louw said — enough to start testing whether ambulances get there faster with the three-word address system.

Precise addresses could improve health in other ways. Only about half of new mothers in South Africa are still taking their H.I.V. medicines correctly a year after delivery. This could change if community health workers were able to track down people who stop coming into the clinic. Gateway just won a prize from Viiv, a pharmaceutical company that specializes in H.I.V., for a project to help women take their meds more successfully — including using what3words to allow health workers to find them.

Gateway is also mapping liquor outlets, and mapping incidents of rape and other violence against women, and overlapping the two. The group plans to identify hot spots for violence, allowing the government to focus its scarce resources on the most dangerous places.

If these pilot projects work, Louw hopes to take the evidence to the South African and other African governments, to persuade them to recognize what3words addresses — an enormous administrative challenge.

“You can’t get a SIM card activated in South Africa without proof of residence,” Louw said. “Employers want to be able to find you. If you don’t have a proper address, you’re seen as not stable. Even to vote you have to have proof of residence. This is much more than just emergency services.”","Beyond the GPS, Mapping Every Place, Everywhere",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/opinion/global-mapping-address.html

Tricky Clues

1A: “Agcy. for Kennedy and Reagan” is TSA because the clue is referring to the airports, not the presidents after which they are named.

28A: PREGGERS makes its New York Times crossword debut today, clued as “With child, informally.”

122A: This was too good to pass up. At first, I thought these were the kind of chocolate cups you make using a balloon and melted chocolate, but it turns out that we’re talking about the universe’s gift to personkind, the REESE’s peanut butter cup. And the man who first got peanut butter in his chocolate was H.B. REESE. I made sure to indulge in a few of these cups, just to make absolutely sure they were still a thing. No need to thank me. I’m happy to do the research so you don’t have to.

11D: A pun that rhymes. “Divine bovine?” is a SACRED COW.

39D: I think this clue is a nod to Brendan Emmett Quigley’s 2001 debut of the entry “WHY, YOU LITTLE ...” and it’s a great one. The answer, “SON OF A ...,” is also fairly unique, as it was used once in a 1965 puzzle as a fill-in-the-blank clue referring to a biblical quote.

43D: Clue of the Day, in my opinion. “Several quarter turns?” does not refer to actually turning something manually or screwing something in. It refers to the action of a COIN TOSS, when a quarter is turning in the air. I love visually evocative clues like that.

80D: A “System of roots?” sounds on the surface like it refers to a plant. Today it refers to ETYMOLOGY, the study of the origins of words, their roots, and how language has changed over time.

President Trump has made a habit of filling important jobs with people dedicated to undermining the laws they’re supposed to administer while pampering the industries they’re supposed to regulate. His nominee for the Environmental Protection Agency’s top clean air post, William Wehrum, is a retread from the George W. Bush administration with a deep doctrinal dislike of clean air regulations. His choice to run the White House Council on Environmental Quality is borderline comical: Kathleen Hartnett White, a former Texas official who believes that the main greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, is harmless. Yet no nomination has been as brazen, as dangerous to public health and as deserving of Senate rejection as that of Michael Dourson to run the E.P.A. office in charge of reviewing chemicals used in agriculture, industry and household products.

Mr. Dourson is a scientist for hire. A toxicologist and a professor at the University of Cincinnati, he has a long history of consulting for chemical companies and conducting studies paid for with industry money. He frequently decided that the compounds he was evaluating were safe at exposure levels that are far more dangerous to public health than levels recommended by the E.P.A., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other agencies. His nomination is enthusiastically endorsed by the chemical industry. It horrifies environmental groups, public health advocates, firefighters and scientists and has inspired many letters in opposition to the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which may vote as early as Wednesday.

Among the chemicals that received a favorable nod from Mr. Dourson is 1,4-dioxane, which is used by paint and coating manufacturers and is also found in shampoos and other personal care products. His analysis recommended a safe level that was 1,000 times higher than the E.P.A.’s recommended level; the agency considers the chemical “a likely carcinogen.”

Another is PFOA, a chemical used by DuPont to make nonstick surfaces. The compound has been linked to cancers, thyroid diseases and other health problems. Working for West Virginia on the recommendation of DuPont, Mr. Dourson in 2002 helped establish a safety threshold of 150 parts per billion for PFOA in drinking water. That is substantially higher than the standard of 1 part per billion that DuPont’s own scientists had recommended more than a decade earlier, and higher still than the health advisory level of 0.07 parts per billion set by the E.P.A. last year.

More broadly troubling is that Mr. Dourson, if approved, will set back an arduous, yearslong effort to improve the regulation of chemicals. Last year, after many false starts, Congress passed a bipartisan bill that updated the Toxic Substances Control Act, a 1976 law that had made it very hard for regulators to ban or regulate chemicals by requiring the E.P.A. to meet a very high burden of proof before taking action. The law also made it easy for companies to keep data about their products hidden from the public by claiming the information was a “trade secret.” The new law simplified the task by streamlining it, directing the E.P.A. to review at least 20 substances at a time, giving priority to the riskiest chemicals. The money to do this work will come from up to $25 million in annual fees paid by chemical manufacturers and processors.

Experts fear that if confirmed Mr. Dourson will put a much greater emphasis on pleasing the chemical industry than on protecting public health.

FRIDAY PUZZLE — People don’t believe me when I tell them that there is always a way into a puzzle, even the late week ones, but it’s true. What seems to happen is that some solvers quickly scan the list of clues on, say, a Friday puzzle,, see nothing that they know on the first pass, and decide that they can’t solve it. Many times, they give up and walk away.

But take a moment to think about this logically: What would be the point of making and editing a puzzle that no one can solve? It would be like building a house with no door or windows. It might be an interesting feat, but it’s ultimately unwelcoming. So the constructor and the editors always make sure that a porch light is left on for solvers, even if that light is in a different spot for different people.

Studies have shown, for example, that moms and dads who adopt children also show signs of the condition.

But some mental health experts question whether what fathers experience after birth is truly postpartum depression.

“There’s no question the perinatal time is one of the hardest for both men and women,” said Dr. Samantha Meltzer-Brody, a professor of perinatal psychiatry at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine. “But the process of birthing and the hormonal gymnastics that women experience is on a different planet.” When it comes to depression in dads versus moms, “I see them as utterly apples and oranges,” she said.

Indeed, defining postpartum depression has been a centuries-long pursuit, hobbled by a social stigma that prevents many women from acknowledging they have a problem. Women plagued by the sadness, anxiety and suicidal thoughts associated with the condition — first noted by Hippocrates in 400 B.C. — have long been told it was all in their heads, or blamed themselves for not being good enough moms.

In the past five years, several studies have shown evidence of a long-suspected link between postpartum depression and the hormonal fluctuations common to women after birth, bringing greater medical legitimacy to the diagnosis. Some of the shame and stigma surrounding the condition has also lifted as high-profile mothers like Brooke Shields, Gwyneth Paltrow and, most recently, Ivanka Trump have shared their own stories of postpartum depression.

Yet researchers still can’t say how large a role hormones may play relative to other factors like stress, sleep deprivation and a history of mental illness.

“What I take issue with is the contention that men don’t go through the wild hormonal changes” that women do, said Will Courtenay, a psychologist and author of “Dying to Be Men: Psychosocial, Environmental and Biobehavioral Directions in Promoting the Health of Men and Boys.” “It’s not just testosterone” that fluctuates in new fathers, he noted, “but also other hormones that we know are associated with births in women,” including estradiol and prolactin, he said.

And women are hardly alone in facing the stigma surrounding mental illness. “There is a very powerful myth in this country that men don’t get depressed, or if they do, they shouldn’t express it,” said Dr. Courtenay. “Consequently, men are less likely to get treated for depression.” To wit: Adam Busby, a father who appeared on the TLC reality series “OutDaughtered,” faced criticism in July after he went public with his depression following the birth of his quintuplets.

In 2007, Dr. Courtenay established Postpartummen.com as a gathering place for new dads struggling with mental health issues. Today, the site offers resources for men in search of assistance. Postpartum Support International also hosts a free phone consultation for dads on the first Monday of every month.

What both sides agree is that too little attention has been paid to the role of men in the postpartum discussion. Dr. Jennifer L. Payne, director of the Women’s Mood Disorders Center at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, said the new research helps shed light on the role that spouses and hormones may play in the condition but stopped short of labeling what men experience as postpartum depression. The U.S.C. study, she said, “was about depressive symptoms, and I would not call that postpartum depression. I think that’s a very different ballgame.”

Dr. Saxbe isn’t so sure. “To a certain extent, any postpartum depression is just depression that happens to emerge in the postpartum period,” she said. “It’s not super conclusive that there’s an obvious hormonal reason in women, either.”

Mr. Sandler, now 45, sees things differently. Following his panic attack, he sought help from a psychiatrist, who prescribed medication and helped him see that his son’s “difficult infant phase” wouldn’t last forever.

“After three months, I started coming around,” he said. He credits the medication for helping ease his anxiety — “It helped not having those peaks and valleys” — and his “very supportive wife” for helping him focus on the joys of having a baby.

Since then, fathering “has been a wonderful experience,” he said.

Does he believe he had postpartum depression? “I don’t want my experience to take away from anything a woman goes through,” he said. “This is nowhere in the same category.”",Can Fathers Have Postpartum Depression?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/well/family/can-fathers-have-postpartum-depression.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

The Miami Dolphins’ owner, Stephen Ross, speaking in New York at a business meeting of the 32 owners, said that the league had made no changes to its policy and that players would be free to protest again this weekend.

“I can’t really tell you what people are going to do,” Ross said when asked if players would continue to protest. “The league has a policy. It hasn’t changed.”

The league’s rule book never required players to stand for the anthem but says they must be on the sideline during the song and “should” stand for it.

The ambiguity in the rule has made it difficult for the league to fine players who have either sat or knelt for the anthem, and the owners had discussed clarifying the wording to make standing for the anthem mandatory.

By leaving the rule alone, the league has chosen to avoid more internal strife with its players and to potentially weather more criticism from fans and President Trump, who has repeatedly ridiculed the league for not firing players who demonstrate during the anthem.

“We need to be above petty attacks from anybody, because racial and socioeconomic inequality has existed in this country for too long,” Jed York, the chief executive and co-owner of the San Francisco 49ers, said when asked about the president’s criticism of the league. “You got to block out the noise and go do your job, and that’s what we need to focus on.”

The meeting on Tuesday included the N.F.L.’s commissioner, Roger Goodell; the director of the players’ union, DeMaurice F. Smith; and 11 owners, including Robert K. Kraft of the New England Patriots and Arthur M. Blank of the Atlanta Falcons. They met for almost four hours with a dozen players, including Malcolm Jenkins of the Philadelphia Eagles, Eric Reid of the 49ers and Kenny Stills of the Dolphins, all of whom have protested during the anthem.

“We just talked about how the owners could come alongside us and we could, collectively, collaboratively, work together to actually create some change, real changes,” Jenkins said afterward, flanked by other players. “We feel a real responsibility to our country, to our communities, so we’re working through ways to really have long lasting, real change.”

Jenkins said there had been no discussion during the meeting about prohibiting players from kneeling during the national anthem; whether players continue to do so, he said, would be an individual decision.

He also said that Kaepernick had been invited to the meeting but chose not to attend. Kaepernick’s lawyer, Mark Geragos, later said it was possible that Kaepernick would attend future meetings.

The league’s broadcasters and sponsors have tried to tiptoe past the public spat as pockets of fans have said they would no longer go to games or buy N.F.L. merchandise. Some teams, too, have had to handle a large number of calls from angry fans. Last week, the Jaguars took the unusual step of apologizing to military leaders in the Jacksonville area for demonstrating during the national anthem before their game in London last month.

According to a copy of the letter obtained by The Associated Press, the Jaguars’ president, Mark Lamping, said that the team was “remiss in not fully comprehending the effect of the national anthem demonstration on foreign soil has had on the men and women who have or continue to serve our country.”

To find a way to extinguish the crisis, Goodell has tried to persuade the players’ union to help him to persuade the players to stand for the anthem.

On Monday, Goodell and Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Doug Baldwin sent a letter of support to the congressional sponsors of the Sentencing Reform and Correction Act, a bill designed to increase rehabilitation of people convicted of crimes.

Protesters from the Black Lives Matter movement gathered outside the hotel where the owners were meeting. One demonstrator, Hank Newsome, said Kaepernick was being unfairly treated by the N.F.L. because he brought attention to uncomfortable issues, including racism.

“What I see with the N.F.L. owners is a bunch of good old boys telling the players: Stay in your place,” he said.

Not long after, two protesters confronted the Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones as he walked through the lobby of the hotel, saying that the players were kneeling during the anthem to end white supremacy. Jones listened to the protesters but did not speak to them.

Goodell said late Tuesday that the owners had not asked the players for a pledge to stop protesting during the anthem. He said the league and players would most likely meet again in the next two weeks.

Goodell’s efforts to forge a consensus among the owners come as they are considering whether to extend his current contract by another five years.

Goodell has tried to mollify the players by visiting Philadelphia, Miami and other cities to speak to them and witness their work in the community.

But with the president continuing to harangue the N.F.L. on Twitter, and fans increasingly upset about the league’s handling of the issue, including in Jacksonville, where a fan paid to have a plane fly over the Jaguars’ stadium carrying a message calling for a boycott of the team and the N.F.L., the owners continue to fret over the protests and how they will affect the league’s brand when television ratings have started to slip.

They found that eight of ten large uprisings happened within two years of a volcanic eruption.
“It really gives us pause for the future because volcanic eruptions will continue, and they will come at unpredictable times,” Dr. McCormick said.","As less water is absorbed into the clouds, less rain falls into seas and lakes. And if a volcano erupts in the Northern Hemisphere, especially at high latitudes, the cooling effect may tamper with the summertime heating that controls monsoon winds over Africa.

When rainfall is reduced and monsoons are suppressed, the Nile fails to flood as usual, starving the crops that depend on its water.

“We guess there was a lot of fear when the Egyptians see the Nile not flooding that year,” said Joseph Manning, a historian from Yale and co-author on the study. “There was fear about what’s going to happen. ‘Are we going to starve like last time when there was no flood three years in a row?’”

That fear could have fueled riots. But to establish a connection between volcanoes and revolts in ancient Egypt, the team first had to determine the dates for when the volcanoes erupted.

They did that by looking at ice core data from Greenland and Antarctica, which contain trapped sulfur from ancient volcanic eruptions. The scientists then turned to papyrus records to figure out when the Nile River failed to flood as usual.

But the records from the Ptolemaic period were all qualitative, not quantitative. So the team turned to the Nilometer record, which contains measurements taken by large instruments built during Egypt’s early Islamic period to monitor the Nile River’s annual flood level.

The researchers used the data from the Nilometer record to gain measurements from 622 A.D. to 1902 A.D., and identified 60 eruptions between those years. On average the Nile flood level was nearly nine inches lower during eruption years, the team discovered.

This suggested a pattern that may have existed during the Ptolemaic Period, as well.

After confirming a link between volcanic eruptions and poor Nile flooding, the team then matched the dates of Ptolemaic eruptions with papyrus records of well-known rebellions. They found that eight of ten large uprisings happened within two years of a volcanic eruption.

More Reporting on Archaeology

The biggest of these, the 20-year Theban revolt, began in 207 B.C., followed a large tropical eruption two years earlier. A papyrus report from this time indicated that most of the farmers were killed and the land had gone dry.

In their paper, the researchers were careful to clarify that volcanoes alone were not the cause of Egyptian revolts. Rather, the natural disasters set off a reaction that mixed other ingredients — like heavy taxation, ethnic conflict and disease — to incite social unrest.

“You have all of these things coalescing at a time, and you can image it’s a powder keg,” said Dr. Ludlow. “All of it puts a strain on the social system and can just ignite into revolt against the Ptolemaic Greek elites.”

Not every eruption in that period was linked to a revolt. The river failed to flood in the years following massive eruptions in 46 and 44 B.C. during Cleopatra’s reign, but her food allocation policies may have helped avert uprisings.

Kyle Harper, a professor of classics at the University of Oklahoma who has studied environmental change and the fall of the Roman Empire, said the new paper was compelling and that it showed a strong link between volcanic forces and their effects on the Nile River. He added that he would like to see if the analysis could be extended to Egypt’s Roman and early Islamic periods.

But Kevin Anchukaitis, a paleoclimatologist at the University of Arizona, said that the study had some shortcomings. For instance, he called the variability in the Nile River flooding during eruption years relatively small. The study also did not account for weather effects like El Niño during that period, he said.

Dr. Ludlow responded by saying that the study shows that the flood levels are consistently lower following eruptions, and that larger eruptions produced a correspondingly greater drop in flood levels.

To Michael McCormick, a professor of history at Harvard, the study offers a note of caution as we face climatic changes in the future.

“It really gives us pause for the future because volcanic eruptions will continue, and they will come at unpredictable times,” Dr. McCormick said. “It is sobering to see how this may have had an effect on a very productive economy in the ancient world, and we need to reflect on how it may affect us.”",Volcanoes Helped Violent Revolts Erupt in Ancient Egypt,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/science/volcanoes-ancient-egypt-revolts.html

The party was beset by “laxity and softness” before he took charge, Mr. Xi told the delegates on Wednesday.","Since taking power in 1949, the party has reinvented itself at critical moments to survive — after Mao Zedong’s death and following the Tiananmen massacre, for example. Mr. Xi, 64, contends that it faces one of those moments now, even as it moves closer to surpassing its Soviet brethren as the longest-ruling Communist Party in history.

In his speech, Mr. Xi referred repeatedly to social tensions unleashed by economic inequality, pollution and inadequate access to health care, schools and housing.

“Party leaders always feel peril close at hand, especially Xi, and that has not gone away,” said Deng Yuwen, a former editor with a Communist Party journal who now writes current affairs commentaries. “For him, this hard-line, centralized style of rule is the solution and must be consolidated.”

While Mao promoted class struggle and Deng Xiaoping embraced pragmatic capitalism, Mr. Xi’s vision of the party’s rule centers on restoring China to greatness — what he calls the “China Dream” — and it draws on both the fervent dedication of Mao’s era and the glories of China’s traditional culture that Mao tried to destroy.

In practice, that has meant a campaign to impose greater discipline in the party’s ranks, and political repression outside the party, including a crackdown on activists and more stringent media censorship, including on the internet.

“Under Xi Jinping, the Chinese Communist Party is headed in the direction of strongman rule,” said David M. Lampton, the director of China studies at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies and a longtime analyst of Chinese leaders. “The 19th Party Congress is more likely to look like a coronation than an institutionalized transition to a leader’s second term.”

One big question as the congress got underway was whether Mr. Xi would try to claim an even bigger role than he already has in the nation’s future.

If he follows the script for leadership successions that his predecessors have followed since the 1990s, Mr. Xi will promote some next-generation leaders, who would be waiting in the wings for him to retire in five years.

Such figures could include Chen Min’er, the party secretary of Chongqing in southwest China, who was close to Mr. Xi when they were both provincial officials and enjoyed Mr. Xi’s conspicuous support.

But Mr. Xi may instead open the way for holding onto power in some form beyond his second term, breaking with the practice of his immediate predecessor.

Photo

One way he could do this would be to hold off in appointing any promising younger leaders to the Politburo Standing Committee, the party’s highest rung of power.

Another would be to enable his ally and anti-corruption czar, Wang Qishan, to stay in the Standing Committee.

At age 69, Mr. Wang has exceeded the age, 68, when an informal party rule says top officials should step down once the next party congress comes around. Keeping Mr. Wang on could set a precedent for Mr. Xi to buck the same rule at the end of his second term, when he will be 69 himself.

Mr. Xi also appears likely to use this congress to mark his place in the party’s history by inscribing his ideas, and perhaps even his name, into the party’s constitution, giving his policies a sheen of permanence.

“He’s going to get the ideological canonization,” said Christopher K. Johnson, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former analyst at the Central Intelligence Agency. “If you’re opposing him, that’s no longer just a disagreement with the individual party chief or Xi Jinping personally. Then you’re challenging the party line.”

The weeklong congress in Beijing will be a carefully choreographed celebration of Communist rule, complete with the pageantry of goose-stepping soldiers, fluttering red hammer-and-sickle flags and the playing of “The Internationale.”

Yet despite the triumphant stagecraft, Mr. Xi remains driven by a fear that Communist rule could collapse in China as it did in the Soviet Union unless the party maintains firm control over an increasingly wealthy and diverse society that now has over a third of the world’s billionaires.

To do this, Mr. Xi has tightened his control over possible competing centers of power, including those billionaires and their businesses, the internet, the military and other arms of state power, as well as over the 89 million members of the party itself.

Mr. Xi’s opening address on Wednesday morning was crafted to sound a warning that the party cannot let down its guard, said analysts and party insiders who have followed preparations.

“Treating development and security in tandem, enhancing a sense of peril, remaining vigilant in times of peace — this is a major principle of our party’s governance of the country,” he said.

Mr. Xi has also called for renewed commitment to what he calls “reform” and did so again in his speech to the congress. But his notion of reform is unlikely to look much like previous bouts of economic liberalization that Deng and other leaders unleashed in the 1980s and 1990s.

Back then, the party gradually embraced market forces and then full-throated capitalism, pulling back some of its power over many sectors of the economy.

Mr. Xi’s version of reform is pointed in the opposite direction: to invigorate party control. “Government, military, society and schools, north, south, east and west — the party is the leader of all,” he said on Wednesday.

“He spent his first five years basically dismantling the old system, which he sees as too lax, too corrupt,” said Minxin Pei, a professor at Claremont McKenna College in California who studies Chinese politics.

What Mr. Xi wants to build now, Professor Pei added, is “a disciplinary state.” He continued: “It disciplines everybody. It disciplines the party, it disciplines Chinese society. And to enforce discipline, you have to have a very powerful security state.”

More than any other recent Chinese leader, Mr. Xi has cast himself as the salvation of both party and nation. He has also been dismissive of his recent predecessors, whom he implicitly blames for failing to act forcefully enough to ensure the party’s survival.

For Mr. Xi, the fall of the Soviet Union is a warning of what will go wrong if China’s party succumbs to those dangers.

“Why did the Soviet Union collapse?” Mr. Xi said to officials in 2013. “There was ideological chaos, the party apparatus at every level seemed ineffectual, the military was no longer under the leadership of the party.”

Mr. Xi wants to ensure that the Chinese Communist Party stays in power long after it celebrates the centenary of its founding four years from now, and long after it overtakes the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in length of time in power, a milestone that by some measures it will cross next year.

As the “princeling” son of a revolutionary, Mr. Xi exudes a sense of inherited responsibility for preserving the party. Since he took office, Mr. Xi has removed officials for corruption and disloyalty more senior than previous leaders dared take on, and overseen investigations of more than 200 officials at the vice-minister level or higher.

Mr. Xi has also ordered party members and officials to return to an almost puritan faith in Marxism and Mao, even amid China’s flashy wealth. He introduced draconian rules weaning cadres off fancy meals, heavy drinking and karaoke sessions. He shook up the military and security services, dumping dozens of generals, including two commanders last summer.

The party was beset by “laxity and softness” before he took charge, Mr. Xi told the delegates on Wednesday. Now, he continued, “the overwhelming force of the anti-corruption struggle has coalesced and is being consolidated and developed.”

He has also created a plethora of new leadership groups that allow him to control policy more directly than previous party leaders.

“Xi started off fast,” said Joseph Fewsmith, a professor at Boston University who studies Chinese elite politics. “Now he looks like he’s got all the pieces in place and will start whatever the positive agenda of the Xi Jinping era is.”

The major decisions to be unveiled this week were most likely made in advance by a small circle of senior party leaders.

“The intense interest in this congress is how far Xi can and will go in reshaping the norms of Chinese politics to get his way,” Professor Fewsmith said. “Everyone has been on pins and needles because they sense that something is changing.”","Xi Jinping Opens China’s Party Congress, His Hold Tighter Than Ever",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/world/asia/xi-jinping-communist-party-china.html

THURSDAY PUZZLE — Once again, we have a lesson in paying attention and reading clues or any notes associated with the puzzle carefully. There’s got to be a reason the Across clues are so ... terse.

You did see the note, right? It says “The one-word Across clues all have an unusual relationship with their answers.” No kidding. That unusual relationship is for you to deduce, and when you do, prepare for a fun “Aha!” moment.

Today’s puzzle isn’t all that difficult once you get the hang of the theme, and the crossings are relatively gentle. If you’ve been looking forward to training your brain to think of alternate meanings in clues, this one by Alex Eaton-Salners might be just the Thursday puzzle for you.

Today’s Theme

It took me a while to get the hang of this one, but once I did, the rest of the puzzle fell quickly.

The Across clues in Mr. Eaton-Salners’s puzzle are all homophones, one of two or more words pronounced alike but different in meaning or derivation or spelling. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to figure out which homophone of the Across clue (if there is more than one) is really the clue to be solved, and then you solve it.

Wonderful son.","A spokesman for Mr. Obama declined to comment.

But Mr. Trump’s remarks have drawn angry rebukes from allies of the former president because his claims about Mr. Obama are false — he called or met with relatives of multiple fallen service members. Former military commanders, for their part, said Mr. Trump was politicizing one of the saddest and most sacred duties of the presidency.

Mr. Obama invited Mr. Kelly and his wife, Karen, to a breakfast for Gold Star families — those who have lost children in combat — at the White House in May 2011. The couple were seated at a table with the first lady, Michelle Obama. At the time, Mr. Kelly was the senior military assistant to Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta.

Mr. Kelly has not addressed the dispute. But colleagues who worked with him at the Pentagon during that period said they did not recall him expressing unhappiness with the way Mr. Obama handled the death of his son. In a statement issued shortly after Lieutenant Kelly’s death, Mr. Kelly and his wife noted that “the nation he served has honored us with promoting him posthumously to first lieutenant of Marines.”

Other military commanders noted that neither Mr. Obama nor President George W. Bush routinely called the families of fallen soldiers because that would have been logistically impossible. It could also raise questions about why one family merited a call but another did not.

“It’s been my observation in all the years I’ve been in the military that all presidents, as commander in chief, feel an enormous sense of loss and compassion and pain about those who are killed under their command,” said Jack Keane, a retired four-star Army general. “How they express that is entirely up to them, and I think we should respect that.”

Referring to Mr. Trump’s predecessors, Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said on Twitter: “POTUS 43 & 44 and first ladies cared deeply, worked tirelessly for the serving, the fallen, and their families. Not politics. Sacred Trust.”

Other former Obama officials castigated Mr. Trump for what they said was a cynical mischaracterization of Mr. Obama’s record, which included regular visits to Dover Air Force Base to greet the coffins of returning forces, pilgrimages to Arlington National Cemetery and visits to wounded troops at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.

“Stop the damn lying — you’re the President,” former Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. wrote on Twitter. “I went to Dover AFB with 44 and saw him comfort the families of both the fallen military & DEA.”

When Mr. Trump made the comparison to Mr. Obama and other former presidents at a news conference on Monday, he dialed back his initial assertion that Mr. Obama did not call the families of fallen service members when a reporter asked him about it again.

“President Obama, I think, probably did sometimes and maybe sometimes he didn’t,” Mr. Trump said, standing in the Rose Garden alongside Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader. “That’s what I was told. All I can do is ask my generals.”

On Tuesday, it became clear that Mr. Trump’s source was Mr. Kelly, a former commander of the military’s Southern Command, whom he recruited in July from the Department of Homeland Security to serve as chief of staff. Officials credit Mr. Kelly with imposing discipline on an unruly West Wing staff and on how information is given to the president.

As a wartime commander, Mr. Kelly led troops in intense combat in western Iraq. In 2003, he became the first Marine colonel since 1951 to be promoted to brigadier general while in active combat.

The death of Mr. Kelly’s son may have played a role in his selection to the cabinet. During the transition, people close to Mr. Trump said he wanted people on his national security team who understood personally the hazards of sending Americans into battle.

But Mr. Kelly has been reluctant to discuss his son. He asked the hosts of the eulogy he gave, in St. Louis in 2010, not to mention Lieutenant Kelly when they introduced him.

Asked about his son on Memorial Day in an interview on Fox & Friends, Mr. Kelly, his voice choking, replied, “Finest guy.”

“Wonderful guy. Wonderful husband. Wonderful son. Wonderful brother. Brave beyond all get out,” he added. “His men still correspond with us. They still mourn him as we do.”",Top General’s Grief Becomes Political Talking Point for Trump,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/us/politics/john-kelly-trump-fallen-troops.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

That is a problem with our command.” My own experience and those I’ve learned about from other women support this statistic.

I witnessed misogyny at all levels of my six years in the military. On Monday mornings, while working in the motor pool to clean and maintain our Humvees, male soldiers would gather around a single cellphone to watch porn and talk in detail of their sexual escapades. I quickly learned and got accustomed to hearing terms for violent sexual activity too graphic to detail here. This language and the images of sexual violence they represented quickly became part of my psychological reality. I myself began to objectify women, and found myself troubled and confused by my own gender identity.

Misogyny was present in the smallest of things, like the nude pinups of women that the chain of command allowed in work shelters, but bigger things, too, like the frequent accounts of male-on-female assault and rape. One of my friends, on a deployment to Afghanistan, was so brutally raped by a male soldier that she is now physically unable to carry and give birth to a child. (She was recently medically discharged after 19 years of active duty and in is in rehabilitation for post-traumatic stress disorder, including daily thoughts of suicide.) Another friend, while stationed in South Korea, was tied up in her bedroom, raped and beaten by several male soldiers, then found in a bloody bath four days later.

In the United States, sexual assault is reported to be declining (dropping 58 percent between 1995 and 2010). But in the military it’s increasing enormously, so much so that the United Nations has gotten involved and the Pentagon reported that the military received a record number of sexual assault reports in 2016. This year we saw the persistence of this culture in the Marines United photo scandal, in which hundreds of Marines circulated intimate photos of women to a secret Facebook group without their consent. Despite the historical advances of women into combat and leadership roles, not a whole lot is being done to change this culture.

Misogyny, of course, is present in every other sector of society, but there is an important distinction in the military. Michael Kimmel, author of “Angry White Men” and a professor of sociology at Stony Brook University, told me, “The military is the same as every other organization, in that these informal cultural barriers have shown up everywhere.” But the military is different because of transparent hierarchy. “If the top of the military wanted this to stop, it would stop. Period.”

The military, more than any other American institution, runs on an unwavering chain of command. It is entirely based on the taking and giving of orders. But there remain entrenched problems with the system of military justice. It is the chain of command that is responsible for investigation and punishment of sexual assaults.

In 2013, Senator Gillibrand introduced legislation to remove the chain of command from handling these cases. It narrowly failed to meet the 60-vote threshold required to avoid a filibuster. In 2014, Senator Gillibrand fought and lost again. In 2016, she tried to reintroduce the bill, but the Republican leadership would not allow the bill onto the floor because the Department of Defense said taking away commanders’ authority would “undermine good order and discipline.” As a result, reports from the department’s Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office show that year after year, almost no progress has been made toward ending sexual assault in the military, despite its repeated promises to do so.

Lawrence Korb, a former assistant secretary of defense and senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, told me, “The chain of command cannot be involved in issues of sexual assault because the issue gets diluted and distorted.” A military lawyer I deployed with agrees. He estimated that in his eight years of service, “95 percent of crimes prosecuted were crimes caught, or reported, by an outside agency, not internal to the unit.” This was because those crimes being reported by an outside agency had to be prosecuted. Otherwise, commanders would bury allegations because having harassment or assault cases reflects poorly on them. As a manager, it’s simply easier to squash the problem by transferring the accused perpetrator or the victim out of the unit.

Many of our closest allies’ militaries, including those of Britain, Canada, Israel, Germany, Norway and Australia, have already moved reporting and prosecution of violent sex crimes outside of the chain of command. But why haven’t we?

Some in the military have decided on their own that it will stop, with them.

When I was moved into a different platoon in South Korea, I fell under the leadership of the man who would become my mentor. With his guidance, I pushed myself physically, getting near-perfect scores on my fitness and marksmanship tests. He helped me study for Soldier of the Month competitions, which I won numerous times. This led to my promotion to sergeant, just shy of my second anniversary of being in the Army. When rumors spread that I was promoted because I must have slept around, my mentor sat down with the rest of my platoon and set them straight. He told them forcefully that it was not true and to cease the rumor spreading immediately.

Because someone defended me at that critical moment, and because of guidance from other true leaders, I was able to sharpen my mental and physical acumen and attain positions in the United States Embassy in Iraq and as a member of the personal staff for Lt. Gen. Frank Helmick, the former commanding general of the XVIII Airborne Corps. General Helmick nurtured my passion for writing and planted the seed for me to later pursue it professionally. These positive experiences with men greatly enhanced my self-worth and have helped me succeed, both in and out of the military.

I wish I could say my military career ended well, but it didn’t. As my career progressed, I was confronted with more poor treatment by my superiors. It became all too clear to me that despite the many devoted, professional men who hold up the honor of military service, the atmosphere toward women in general had not changed.

The military is morally obligated to stop the systemwide mistreatment of women in its ranks, but that change will not be made until it is enforced from the top leadership on down. It is too big and important a job to be left to a few good men.","Military Women, Too, Should Serve Unmolested",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/opinion/military-women-molested.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

While it is a great way “to jump-start your career, it is not the only way,” she said.","Thirty years ago, Tim Rasmussen wore a mullet to the photojournalism version of Woodstock on a small upstate New York farm. He had traveled from his small town in Utah to the Catskill Mountains, to a celebration of photography where he studied with such masters of photojournalism as Mary Ellen Mark, Greg Heisler and Jodi Cobb.

A local high school band in Jeffersonville was playing a thunderous welcome as he entered a large, partly built barn. Inside he was greeted by the festival’s mastermind: Eddie Adams, the Pulitzer Prize-winning war photographer.

“Everybody who was anybody was there and I didn’t even know they existed,” said Mr. Rasmussen, now the director of photography for digital and print media at ESPN. “I went to this small agricultural college in Utah and didn’t know anybody, but in less than a week I left there with four or five lifelong friends. Sometimes you spend your whole life seeking your community and for me that was the moment that I found it.”

Mr. Rasmussen will return to Jeffersonville this weekend for the 30th Eddie Adams Workshop, which has since become one of the most important stops for up-and-coming photojournalists.

Mr. Adams died in 2004, but the workshop continues under the aegis of his wife, Alyssa Adams, and the assistance of around 150 volunteers. Some things have changed since the first session — Kodak slide film gave way to digital imagery in the late 1990s and audio and video have been added. Some sponsors have fallen away as the industry has withered, and while tuition is still free, students pay $375 for lodging.

The workshop is structured much as it was 30 years ago, with 10 groups of 10 students managed by a well-known photographer as team leader, a photo editor and a producer. This year, all the teams are led by photographers who were once students in the workshop.

For Jimmy Colton, a well-traveled photo editor who will be attending his 27th consecutive session this week, the workshop is about family. He calls himself Uncle Jimmy, and considers all 2,700 students he has worked with to be his nieces and nephews. The barn is also a place of family ghosts for Mr. Colton, whose brother Jay, and father, Sandy, both volunteered as photo editors before their deaths.

The core values of the workshop continue to be “a level of ethics beyond reproach, having great concern for your subjects and treating everyone as you would like to be treated,” Mr. Colton said.

Mr. Adams purchased the 64-acre farm in Jeffersonville in 1976 intending to convert it into a center for photography. But progress on rebuilding the ramshackle structures was slow as assignment work kept him busy. It was after he met Alyssa in 1983 that the plans for a free, merit-based workshop came together. They married shortly after the first workshop.

“This workshop is not a ‘how to,’ it’s more inspirational and aspirational,” Ms. Adams said. “This is a place where you can let your hair down and experiment a little as a student.”

The workshop does not romanticize photojournalism, and it acknowledges the price many photojournalists have paid while covering conflict. An annual memorial service for photographers who have died during war recognizes friends of Mr. Adams who were killed in Vietnam, like Henri Huet and Larry Burrows, as well as more recent casualties like Chris Hondros, who attended the 1993 workshop. An annual Award is given to a student by the Chris Hondros Foundation.

Recognizing colleagues who have been killed emphasizes that “the truth matters, pictures matter, and you can make a difference with your pictures not just in war,” said Nancy Andrews, who attended the first workshop in 1988 and has volunteered as a photo editor and will be a team leader this year. She returns for the sense of community and generosity, she said.

“I’m actually improved when you, my colleague, or you, my student, make a great picture” said Ms. Andrews, who was a Washington Post staff photographer and director of photography at The Detroit Free Press. “It’s not like there are finite numbers of great pictures out there and you stole one of them so now I can’t get one. It elevates the profession and I might be better as a result.”

Admission to the workshop, for students and professionals with less than three years’ experience is through portfolios judged by a panel of photo editors.

Not being included can be a difficult blow.

Ruth Fremson was among those young photographers who did not make the cut in the late 1980s. She remembers the rejection well, though she has since been part of three Pulitzer Prize-winning teams as a staff photographer for The Associated Press and starting in 2000 at The New York Times. While it is a great way “to jump-start your career, it is not the only way,” she said.

She has been a team leader at the workshop the last two years and is returning this weekend as a kitchen volunteer to help prepare food for the students.

“It’s such a gift to be able to participate in it because the team leaders and volunteers get as much out of the workshop as the students,” she said. “I’ve had the benefit of many great mentors who have championed my career and this is a great place to pay it forward.”

A turning point for Evans was his decision — like many young men of means — to go to Paris in 1926 to study for a year at the Sorbonne. His stay filled his head with ideas gleaned from Flaubert and Baudelaire, but it was another Frenchman — Eugène Atget — whose work affected him the most, leading to the dry, observational style that became his visual signature.

Clément Chéroux, a French curator, organized a massive Walker Evans retrospective at the Centre Pompidou in Paris, which recently traveled to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, (where he is now the head of the photography department). He said Evans tried to emulate in America what Atget did in Paris.

And Evans has done exactly the same with America,” Mr. Chéroux said. “What is so interesting for me, in this exchange between American and French culture, is that he has tried to define the American vernacular culture, but with the method and style of French culture.”

Evans embodied a paradox: a member of the American elite drawn to unfussy places, urban workers and desperate farmers, becoming best known for his seminal project with James Agee, “Let Us Now Praise Famous Men,” about America’s poor and downtrodden during the Great Depression.

For Mr. Chéroux, this paradox was an interesting way to understand Evans. The curator has done scholarly research into the vernacular, which he defines as “useful, domestic and popular” in an essay in the exhibition catalog. “Maybe one of the reasons why I’m fascinated with Evans is because there is so much paradox in his work,” he said. “There is this dialectical tension between Europe and the U.S., and there is also this very strong dialectical tension between an aristocratic or elite point of view, and a subject which is definitely popular culture, and workers.”

The specific nature of the Atget-Evans vision, with its emphasis on large format, razor sharp, perfectly observed, almost preternaturally quiet moments, allows the photographs to impress viewers nearly a century later. Evans had a simple explanation: Atget’s photographs had a transcendent quality, which he tried to emulate.

In an interview with Lincoln Kirstein, who wrote an essay for Evans’s 1938 book “American Photographs,” Evans said, “Take Atget, whose work I now know very well. In his work you do feel what some people call poetry. I do call it that also, but a better word for it, to me, is, well – when Atget does even a tree root, he transcends that thing. And by God somebody else does not.”

By looking at things previously unobserved, or subjects once thought beneath the purview of art, Evans created a vision of America that is still inextricable from our national identity. And while his initial exposure to Atget’s work might have been coincidental — his friend Berenice Abbott showed him a trove of the Frenchman’s work — his subsequent choice of subject matter was not.

In another essay in the exhibition catalog, Evans said his early work was influenced by his feelings about the United States. “I was really anti-American at the time,” he said. “America was a big business and I wanted to escape. It nauseated me. My photography was a semi-conscious reaction against right-thinking and optimism; it was an attack on the establishment. I could just hear my father saying, ‘Why do you want to look at those scenes, they’re depressing. Why don’t you look at the nice things in life?’ Nothing original about that though.”

This might be the key to understanding his role in the history of photography, as he heavily influenced subsequent generations, including the famed “New Topographics” movement of the 1970s. (When asked via email whether Evans’s work had inspired him and his colleagues, Stephen Shore simply replied, “Yes.”)

According to Mr. Chéroux, Evans was able to adopt a neutral stance and let the magic, or inherent tension, of a scene speak for itself. He notably contrasted this style against the showy, artsy technique employed by contemporaries like Alfred Stieglitz and the Modernists.

“He wants to disappear in front of his subject, to let this emotion transfer from the subject to the viewer,” he said of Evans. “I think this is really what he understood. It’s the reason why he is so close to Atget. All the photographers who think that the subject is more important than themselves are in this position.”

The retrospective, while focusing on the past, and including selections from Evans’s personal collection of vernacular art, also allows viewers to appreciate how photography, a slice out of time, relates to the present. In particular, his 1937 photographs showing people displaced by floods in the South are just as relevant today.

“That’s the power of art,” Mr. Chéroux said, “to address some historical questions, but to address them in the present time. To create a kind of effect that is both present and past, and I think this is something photography is really great at.”

How is your job different from that of a designer at a fashion company?

I am in charge of, and help lead, inspire, direct and orchestrate over 1,000 creative designers at Nike. It’s not a line by me for everybody. It’s a shared vision that I have with lots of people. I like to think we’re more of a Bauhaus. We have a clear point of view, it’s distributed to parts of our design world, and we all pursue a common aesthetic.

What is your role in the design process?

With me, it starts up front with my heads of footwear and apparel design, Andy Caine and Kurt Parker. We announce the season, we announce a clear creative direction. And that creative direction is imparted to all 1,000 people with toolboxes and events.

Then I catch up with rough sketches. From there we move into three-dimensional models and design review. We really scrutinize. Is this product right for the marketplace, the price point, the kit, the region and distribution that it’s going to? Then we have a couple rounds of iterations and we see the final samples, which include all the details, all the color, and we get final signoff.

Do egos ever get in the way?

Whenever you deal in the designer creative arts, you are dealing in the realm of ego. Of course egos play a role because we’re passionate and we’re dedicated to seeing our work come to life. I think for the most part our egos get set aside for the greater good.

Are you ever at your desk?

I sit at my desk occasionally, but mostly I’m up and out. We have a handful of studios, and so I spend a lot of time walking, biking, cruising around trying to engage and interact with our creative group.

What is this car model you have here on your shelf?

The car is a Porsche 356 Speedster Cabriolet, one of my all-time favorite cars because the form never changed over multiple decades, but the performance just kept getting better and better and better. And I think it’s a gorgeous model, and I love the shape and I love the stance of the car and I love the details. To me, it just looks like it’s fast, it’s beautiful, it’s luxurious.

What do you see in Nike’s future in terms of design?

I’m intrigued by designers that go deeper and go almost to the level of the atom, where we’re co-creating with data. I’m thinking about materiality and assembly, where products are moving more harmoniously, more symbiotically on your body so that it’s almost like a secondary skin.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

I’m really intrigued by how technology can give us a great head-start. But a head-start is a rough draft. We know data can’t dream. That’s where designers come in. The job of the designer tomorrow is to take that head-start, take that information and then imbue on top of that their intellect, their imagination, their heart and their hand.

What’s an example of your designers running with their imagination?

Our creative community decided to print out three-dimensional prints of grass, and then they duct-taped them to their feet and ran on the street. So we just said, “What if you actually married real grass or fake grass to the bottom of your shoe?” It’s not a real shoe, but it’s a sort of wonder experiment about where we can take cushioning, and how we can give that unique underfoot feel and sensation of running on grass, even in the concrete canyon.

How has new technology affected products that already exist, like the Hyperdunk sneaker?

Some things that we’ve designed were just ahead of their times, that we just couldn’t get to, either materially or construction-wise. And now, with new technologies, new construction, we can actually get to it.

Five seasons ago, the Hyperdunk didn’t have the best in-shoe feel, it didn’t have the best traction. The upper really didn’t lock you down perfectly onto the platform. Between then and now, we’ve improved. We have new ways of creating that wiper effect that creates an even stickier traction on the court. We’ve got new upper materials and new ways to sit into the actual platform that really lock the athlete. So the athlete has better contact with the floor and, I think, can therefore move quicker and pivot side to side and front to back in even better ways.

What is that woven, wooden shoe you have sitting on your shelf?

It’s a Yugoslavian dance shoe. It’s made out of birch bark. Hopefully when it’s done, it goes back to the earth. Zero waste. So I just use that as a way of thinking about using form and shape and being responsive to the planet around us. How can we take things that we might not think about as shoe materials and bring them in to create new forms and new ideas?",Nike’s Chief of Design Doodles All Day,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/fashion/nike-nba-uniform-golden-warriors-hyperdunk.html

To investigate its conservation value, Olaus Murie, the president of the Wilderness Society, and his wife, Mardy, who both had spent years in Alaska, suggested a biological survey to Fairfield Osborn, president of the New York Zoological Society (now the Wildlife Conservation Society). The Sheenjek River Valley and surrounding areas on the southern slopes of the Brooks Range were selected as the focus of the expedition.

In the summer of 1956 the Muries and a team — consisting of the ornithologist Brina Kessel from the University of Alaska, along with graduate students Robert Krear and one of us (Dr. Schaller) — roamed these remote mountains. They made lists of plants and animals and absorbed, in Olaus Murie’s words, “the precious intangible values” of the place.

As early as 1952, Dr. Schaller noted that oil development had already begun in northern Alaska. He wrote the secretary of interior, Fred Seaton, warning that unless the region were shielded from development it “may in future years resemble one of the former Texas oil fields.”

In 1960, the Eisenhower administration established the nearly nine million acre Arctic National Wildlife Range to preserve “the unique wildlife, wilderness and recreational values” of this landscape.

Congress and the Carter administration doubled the size of the refuge, to 18 million acres, in 1980 under the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, renaming the area as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. (With an addition, it is now 19.6 million acres.) Native people retained their hunting rights, and licensed trophy hunters were permitted to kill Dall sheep and caribou.

The refuge also includes the 1.5 million acre “1002 area” adjoining the Arctic Ocean. This swath of coastal plain is thought to be rich in oil and gas, and even though vast portions of the Arctic slope and coastal waters of northern Alaska are open for oil leasing and drilling, the Trump administration, and oil interests and their allies in Congress want to invade and squander this pristine area, which takes up less than 5 percent of the coastal plain.

This part of the Arctic slope extending northward from the Brooks Range to the Arctic Ocean is a critical site for polar bears to make their dens and give birth. It is also the calving ground of America’s largest caribou herd, which migrates widely through the region. The Gwich’in Indians of Arctic Village in the Brooks Range and the Inupiat of Kaktovik on the coastal plain depend on the animal for food and clothing.

The Gwich’in call the calving area that oil companies hope to develop “the sacred place where life begins.” As Trimble Gilbert, chief of Arctic Village, said: “We hurt because we see the land being destroyed,” and added that “we believe we have something to teach the world about living a simple life, about sharing, about protecting the land.”

On the 50th anniversary of the Murie expedition in 2006, the explorer and author Jonathan Waterman organized a return trip to the Arctic refuge. We joined the team, along with graduate students Forrest McCarthy and Betsy Young.

It was exhilarating for Dr. Schaller to return after 50 years and still find no roads, no buildings, no garbage. On the Sheenjek River, even an eagle nest he had seen on a cliff in 1956 was still there. Arctic loons still called near our camp on Last Lake, and caribou continued to meander across the coastal plain as we floated first the Canning and then the Hula Hula Rivers.

On this trip, we visited the famous Prudhoe Bay oil field on the Arctic slope. After a major petroleum discovery in 1968, an 800-mile pipeline was constructed to transport oil to southern Alaska. Oil started flowing in 1977. Look at Prudhoe Bay and all its satellite fields now. Those who treasure the splendor of industrial sprawl must visit this morass of pipe lines, buildings drilling rigs, gravel pits, roads and pools of toxic chemicals.

Prudhoe Bay is the largest oil field in North America and one of the top 20 globally. It has undoubtedly brought wealth and prosperity to Alaska, but spills of oil and chemicals, large and small, take place each year. Various laws require that this region be cleaned up once the oil has been exhausted. But who will pay for that in this pro-development world is anyone’s guess.

The Arctic refuge must continue to be preserved as a symbol of America’s natural heritage. It remains a healthy ecosystem supporting wildlife, and native peoples as they adapt to profound climate-related changes. True wilderness holds a spiritual value that can nourish us. That is why the American public enjoys its national parks, monuments and other protected areas.

There will always be pro-development forces and those with political agendas who are prepared to dismantle, cripple, gut and destroy our natural heritage for short-term gain, heedless of the long-term cost to us as a civilization. In that effort they forget that everything we want, need and have comes from nature.

Congress should stop its headlong rush to open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas exploration and extraction. Surely patriotism encompasses the protection of the most pristine and beautiful representations of America.

Pearson of Canada told a group of American students in 1963. The quote, reprinted in the June 10th issue of The New York Times of that year, still rings true today, especially as a Canadian like myself goes through thousands of images of Canada from the newspaper’s archives.

Earlier this year, the Ryerson Image Center in Toronto received a donation of 24,804 images from a collector, Chris Bratty, who had purchased the collection with the intention of donating it. Selected by a team led by two gallerists, Steven Kasher and Stephen Bulger, the pictures range from World War I to the late 1990s, from hockey players to lumberjacks. A selection is currently on view in an exhibition at the center and in a book, both entitled “The Faraway Nearby.”

“When I heard of the collection, I immediately wanted to acquire it,” said Paul Roth, an American who is the center’s director. “For all the strengths of our holdings — including the Black Star and the Berenice Abbott archives — we don’t have a tremendous amount of Canadian photojournalism. This helps us fill that gap. And, since it comes from a major U.S. newspaper, it brings up the question of how one country covers another, which fits within our mandate of interrogating different aspects of the medium.”

The expected tropes are there: Canada as a winter wonderland; as a safe, polite neighbor who reveres hockey. But there are also images that challenge them: Canada the diplomat having lighthearted meetings with America’s foes. In one photo, Nikita S. Khrushchev laughs at a joke told by Mr. Pearson — the opposite of the famous “Kitchen Debate” moment by Elliott Erwitt, in which then-Vice President Richard Nixon castigates the Soviet leader. In another, Fidel Castro holds Prime Minister Pierre-Elliott Trudeau’s youngest son, Michel Charles-Émile, during a four-day state visit. Or, Canada the troubled young nation deploying the Army to confront Quebec’s sometimes-violent calls for independence.

“The type of coverage we see speaks of a dual fascination between how familiar Canada feels, and yet how unfamiliar it sometimes appears,” Mr. Roth surmised. “I suspect that The New York Times had to ponder how to cover a country that was so close. Should they concentrate on the differences or highlight the similarities? When stories involved people or goods crossing the border, which was often the case, were they to be considered national or international news?”

Besides snow and hockey, evidence of Canada’s subordination to the British monarchy seemed of particular interest. The New York Times dedicated space daily to Princess Elizabeth’s first tour of Canada in 1951 (Slide 9) and continued to chronicle the royal family’s subsequent visits.

Mr. Trudeau also drew a lot of attention, more than any of his predecessors and successors, that is, until his son Justin ran for the same office and won in 2015. A reproduction of a spread published during the 1972 election is revealing. Within “The World” section, the article isn’t under a rubric with the country’s name, as is customary, but simply “Trudeau,” and a headline declaring “A Swinger Shows His Sober Side.” A full column is dedicated to a collage of images showing the candidate dancing, riding a motorcycle, playing hockey and pedaling a unicycle before concluding with a somber close-up portrait.

Mounting the exhibition, Denise Birkhofer — an American who recently settled in Toronto and co-curated the show with Gerald McMaster, an Indigenous Canadian of Plains Cree and Blackfoot descent — pondered how The New York Times’s fondness for certain subjects and visual archetypes might have shaped a national identity. That’s hard to answer, partly because of the variety of photographers who contributed to the paper’s Canadian coverage.

“There’s a multiplicity of voices that came together to shape the perception of Canada that The New York Times then shared with its readers,” she said. “Not all were Americans. Sometimes staff photographers were sent to cover a story, but other times it came from local publications or freelancers. There were also images made by Canadian agencies or corporations, such as the National Film Board and the Canadian Pacific Railway.”

Photo

Most surprisingly, during World War I, the images the paper used to showcase Canada’s participation in the war effort were supplied by Canadian entities, whose work had to be vetted by the nation’s official censors. Its goal was to avoid criticism of military endeavors by showing the conflict in a romanticized light. In other words, said Gaëlle Morel, the Ryerson Image Center exhibitions curator, “The New York Times — a private commercial enterprise — obeyed the censorship requirements of a foreign country.” In other words, the country’s image, as seen in The Times, reflected an official, sanitized perspective.

Mr. Roth said the collection has greater meaning given Canada’s sesquicentennial this year. “More than a time for celebration and patriotism, it is an occasion to think about complicated questions relating to the identity of the nation,” he said. “All countries should be interested in how they’re viewed by other states. We should strive to get past the mythologies that are created to promote tourism or to reinforce patriotic values, especially nowadays. Doing so requires unpacking widely held cultural assumptions. And that’s exactly what we can do thanks to this archive. While it doesn’t tell a single story, it does help us understand what the Canadian mythologies are.”

“It’s kind of an unknown creature on the landscape that is not moving,” Mr. Betchkal said. And in bear language, that steadfastness is a sign of dominance. The equipment says, try me, and the bear says O.K. This interaction is rare, and most fall into the first category.

But Mr. Betchkal thinks the Karupa Lake bear was a type two, and judging by the sound of its lungs and the location, it was a grizzly.

Until recently, British officials assumed that the European Commission was taking a harder line than were the largest countries in the bloc, but Germany has proved tougher still in recent weeks.
However, the hard-line from Europe is already playing into Britain’s poisonous discussion of Brexit, which seems, for some Conservatives, to evoke memories of a dark past.
Analysts expect a bumpy few months, and Mr. Grant, for one, argues that it is essential for Mrs. May to call the bluff of Brexit hard-liners and reassert her authority.
There is more unity among the governments of 27 European Union countries, he added, than there is in one British cabinet.","Jens Geier, who leads Social Democratic lawmakers from Germany in the European Parliament, has a similar perspective. “Looking at the never-ending internal divisions within the Conservative Party, we in Brussels are wondering how much leeway Theresa May has at all,” he said, “and if she is actually able to deliver, or whether she will be undermined by other members of her cabinet.”

So bad is the situation that perhaps the best thing Mrs. May has going for her are worries among European officials of a doomsday feedback loop. The lack of progress in Brussels could strengthen the Brexit hard-liners in Mrs. May’s Conservative Party, who want Britain to crash out without a deal, cutting ties as it heads for the cliff edge.

To avoid that, the European officials say, they need to offer at least glimmers of hope to Mrs. May, if only to make progress on a transition agreement and trade negotiations.

At the heart of the current stumbling block is a Catch-22. The 27 other European Union nations want Britain to commit to paying more than $60 billion as part of a divorce deal, before discussing Mrs. May’s ideas for a two-year transition and for a new trade relationship.

But money is one of Britain’s few negotiating cards, and it could be politically disastrous for Mrs. May to promise such a hefty divorce payment unless she gets a transitional deal and a future trade arrangement in return. So, Britain wants to finalize the financial payment at the end of the deal.

Continental Europeans have an interest in an agreement, too, as a failure to reach a deal would hit their exporters hard. Mrs. May thought she had broken the deadlock in September with a speech in Florence, Italy, in which she took some risks with her party by promising to pay around 20 billion euros, or about $23.5 billon, in 2019 and 2020.

The British have a point when they say that some of the issues that the 27 other members of the bloc want resolved before moving to trade talks — such as the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland — are probably insoluble without a broader agreement on future trade relations.

Yet with the clock ticking to the planned departure, in March 2019, and British businesses threatening to cut off domestic investment and to begin shifting jobs to the Continent, the European Union has all the leverage.

With luck, the 27 will agree on Friday to prepare for a next phase of talks in December, but only providing that the British first offer more concessions.

Continental Europeans see this as a problem created by Britain, and not many are in a charitable mood. That would include Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, who, before dining with Mrs. May on Monday night in Brussels, promised journalists an “autopsy” afterward.

In the end, the post-mortem was limited to a brief joint statement, which suggested that things had gone better than at a previous meeting, in Mrs. May’s Downing Street office in April. An account of that meal had been swiftly leaked to a German newspaper, prompting Mrs. May to claim that European officials were trying to influence the outcome of Britain’s general election and to warn Mr. Juncker that he would find her a “bloody difficult woman.”

Until recently, British officials assumed that the European Commission was taking a harder line than were the largest countries in the bloc, but Germany has proved tougher still in recent weeks.

It wants more concrete detail on the offer Mrs. May made in Florence. Berlin has other priorities, including complex coalition negotiations, but it also worries that, as the biggest net contributor to the European Union, it may end up filling any shortfall in the bloc’s finances left by the British. That prospect has been made more difficult by recent electoral gains by a right-wing, populist and euroskeptic party, Alternative for Germany.

However, the hard-line from Europe is already playing into Britain’s poisonous discussion of Brexit, which seems, for some Conservatives, to evoke memories of a dark past. Last week, the chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, described European Union negotiators as the “enemy.”

Though Mr. Hammond later apologized on Twitter, his slip was all the more striking because he is one of the most pragmatic members of the cabinet, and the leading exponent of a “softer” exit to protect the economy.

Indeed, Mr. Hammond’s refusal to adopt a tone of sunny optimism has led to calls for him to be fired, including from one of his predecessors, Nigel Lawson, a hard-line supporter of Brexit who described the chancellor’s behavior as “very close to sabotage.”

The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, who supports leaving the bloc, has denied that a hard Brexit would result in higher food prices, telling the BBC that farmers would “grow more here.” That prompted the Brexit-backing tabloid The Sun to publish a headline that read “Dig for Brexit” — a reference to the World War II campaign urging Britons to “Dig for Victory.”

On Tuesday, David Davis, the British minister responsible for negotiating the terms of leaving the European Union, dismissed economic “scaremongering” about withdrawal. But the economy has already slowed, and Britain’s inflation rate hit its highest point in more than five years in September, driven in part by a drop in the value of the pound after the Brexit referendum in June 2016.

On Tuesday, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said that reversing the process would be a lift for the British economy, which is growing at the slowest rate of any Group of 7 country.

Analysts expect a bumpy few months, and Mr. Grant, for one, argues that it is essential for Mrs. May to call the bluff of Brexit hard-liners and reassert her authority.

Until she does, it seems likely that her weakness will be exploited by opponents on both sides of the English Channel.

“Sometimes it’s very difficult to see and understand what Britain really wants from these negotiations,” Samuli Virtanen, a deputy minister of Finland, said at a meeting in Luxembourg on Tuesday. There is more unity among the governments of 27 European Union countries, he added, than there is in one British cabinet.","For Theresa May, the Brexit News Only Gets Worse",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/world/europe/uk-brexit-theresa-may.html

The representatives of Fekat I met were incredibly helpful throughout my visit, particularly Eyob Teshome, a Cyr wheel expert and all-around good guy who served as an informal guide for a portion of my stay. He helped acquaint me with the neighborhood, find a local SIM card, answered questions and showed me a few different sights.

He is also, like several Ethiopians I met, incredibly proud of his country. “We are special,” he began, before correcting himself: “We believe we are special,” he said, smiling and looking downward. Mr. Teshome, a devout Christian (most Ethiopians are Christian, either Ethiopian Orthodox or Protestant), talked a bit about Ethiopia and its role in the Bible, and how many Ethiopians view the country — one of the world’s oldest Christian nations — as the promised land.

“And did you know,” asked a smiling Mr. Teshome, as we walked past street hawkers selling mangos and young men offering to clean your sneakers for a few birr, “that we have our own calendar? And that we even have our own time?” Ethiopia works on a 13-month calendar, with 12 30-day months and a 13th intercalary month (a leap month, basically) of five or six days. And instead of working on standard international time, which would put it in the same zone as Moscow, it works on a 12-hour clock determined roughly by sunrise and sunset. What we would call 7 a.m. is simply called “1 o’clock” in Ethiopian time — be careful when making appointments.

After showing me my room — modest, but comfortable, with a bunk bed and shared bathroom down the hallway – Mr. Teshome asked me if there was anything in particular I wanted to do. I said I was up for pretty much anything. “O.K.,” he said. “We’ll go to Merkato.” We hopped on the Chinese-built metro rail at Menilik II Square (right near the beautiful St. George’s Cathedral, where Haile Selassie was crowned emperor in 1930), and rode two stops west to Gojam Berenda (2 birr, less than 10 cents). We exited the station to a completely different world.

I’ve been to markets all over the world but I wasn’t prepared for this. By some accounts, Merkato is the largest open-air market in Africa: It encompasses an entire neighborhood — several square miles of barely controlled chaos. Vendors hawk nearly everything you could possibly imagine. Produce, textiles, car parts, baked goods and massive sacks of colorful incense line the dirt roads packed with honking cars and busy traders trying to avoid getting hit.

Things are roughly divided into sections: All the cookware on one street, towering stacks of colorful plastic containers on another. Against the side of a building under a plastic tarp, I saw a man welding old mechanical gears into weight lifting sets. “Watch your pockets,” Mr. Teshome warned me as we wound our way through the crush of people at the Merkato, passing rows of shoes, colorful T-shirts, bags of spices, slaughtered animals. We stopped to snack on chornake, a dense, doughnut-like fried pastry (2 birr), then each bought a mefakia (also 2 birr), a short stick of wood many Ethiopians use as a natural toothbrush. We continued wandering the market, cleaning our teeth. (Many things in the city cost just a few birr — keep some small change handy.)

Mr. Teshome warned me about pickpockets in the market, but over all, I didn’t find safety to be a problem in the city. I used common sense by limited the amount of walking I did after dark and not mindlessly gazing at my phone while strolling down the street. You may occasionally be gawked and called after — my general sense was that it came from a place of friendliness and curiosity.

But there’s also a serious hustle to many of the locals, primarily young men, who are eager to make a birr or two by cleaning your shoes, selling you knickknacks or escorting you to a destination. I’d generally advise against following strangers anywhere or accepting offers to “show you around.” Decline firmly, but not rudely.

After picking up a local SIM card (with 4G capability) from the Ethio Telecom shop near Minilik Square (bring your passport, a hundred birr or so to top up your phone, and plenty of patience — the wait can be considerable), I was beginning to feel the effect of all my recent travel. It was time for a cup of coffee — lucky for me, Addis Ababa is full of modest streetside coffee stands selling amazing java. No surprise there — coffee is believed to have originated on the Ethiopian highlands.

Photo

The best cup of my trip was at Tomoca Coffee, a small storefront on Wawel Street in the Piazza area near where I bunked at the circus (there are a few locations). The cozy, homey shop was packed, and flooded with the warm, earthy scent of ground coffee. I picked up a cup for 14 birr and a frosted doughnut for 15 birr. The doughnut was mediocre, but that was beside the point: The coffee, a dense, bittersweet shot of only three or four ounces, was some of the best I’ve had. You can buy whole bean coffee, too; I picked up a couple of 500-gram bags to bring home (138 birr).

Food and drink are practically a religion in Ethiopia, and there’s no shortage of places to get tasty, family-style meals. Expect thick stews of vegetables and meat eaten together with injera, a sour, spongy fermented bread made from teff, a native grass. At KG Corner, a neighborhood restaurant that’s been operating since 1960, I tried the fasting ferefer (the Ethiopian Orthodox Church prescribes a number of fasting days during which adherents may not eat animal products) for 43 birr and the shiro tegabino, a pea stew (also 43 birr). The ferefer was essentially a spicy vegetable stew that tasted heavily of the deep, earthy berbere spice that Ethiopia is famous for.

Other highlights of my stay included the Holy Trinity Cathedral, also known as the Haile Selassie church (the former emperor is buried on the premises with his wife). Admission to the church and small museum on the property is a relatively expensive 150 birr. For theater buffs, the Ethiopian National Theater, originally constructed during the Italian occupation, is worth visiting for a look at its massive lobby and gilded interior. I even took in a show, “Finger of God” (40 birr). While I don’t speak Amharic, I found the performance engaging.

The National Museum of Ethiopia is just a 15-minute walk from the Holy Trinity Cathedral and, for just a 10-birr admission fee, it is a must-see. The highlight, naturally, is Lucy — the Australopithecine hominid that made an enormous splash when her partial skeleton was discovered in eastern Ethiopia in 1974 by Donald Johanson and Tom Gray.

When she was discovered, the 3.2-million year old Lucy excited the anthropological world because of her well-preserved remains as well as the fact that she walked upright — shedding possible light on the “missing link” of how humans may have evolved. Seeing the bone fragments up close and in person is fascinating even for casual fans of history and paleontology. While the fossil long predates Ethiopia, of course, it serves as a reminder of how much rich history the country has — and what fascinating discoveries await the curious traveler.","Navigating Sometimes Chaotic, Always Fascinating Addis Ababa",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/travel/addis-ababa-ethiopia-budget-frugal.html

“I don’t know what kind of proof he could be talking about,” Ms. Wilson said on CNN’s “New Day.”

Mr. Trump compared his actions to past presidents and said past presidents have not always contacted families of those killed in action.

Mr. Trump singled out former President Barack Obama, saying he had not made such calls, an assertion that quickly drew angry rebukes from former Obama aides.

In a radio interview on Tuesday, Mr. Trump suggested that Mr. Obama never called John Kelly, a retired Marine Corps general and now the White House chief of staff, when his son died in Afghanistan in 2010.

“You could ask General Kelly, ‘Did he get a call from Obama?’ ” Mr. Trump said in an interview on Fox News Radio. “I believe his policy was somewhat different than my policy. I can tell you my policy is I called every one of them.”

Mr. Trump’s tweet rebutting Ms. Wilson’s account of the phone call was his sixth Twitter post on Wednesday morning and came after Ms. Wilson’s description was discussed on morning news shows. Mr. Trump often takes to Twitter with reactions to what he sees on television.

Mr. Trump’s first Twitter posts were about the former F.B.I. director, James Comey, as well as about his Democratic opponent in the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton, and the ongoing debate about professional football players kneeling during the national anthem.

The Google Assistant was the most adept of all the digital assistants, easily beating Siri and Amazon’s Alexa.
Still, after a few days, I was rather attached to the Pixel 2 XL.","Now comes the Pixel 2. After testing the gadget for nearly a week, I found I prefer it to the iPhone — though this is mostly because I have always carried Android phones. Android is what I’m used to, and all my digital data is stored with Google, even though my daughters think I’m silly for not buying an iPhone.

Compared with other Android devices, the Pixel 2 XL, the model I tested and the larger of the two versions of the device, was also a big improvement. I own a Samsung Galaxy S7, widely considered the best Android phone on the market a year ago when it went on sale.

I liked that the Pixel 2 XL’s fingerprint reader, which instantly unlocks the phone, sat on the back of the device, not far from where my finger typically sits. I liked that the phone arrived with only a small number of essential apps, rather than the sea of flotsam that typically ships with Samsung phones. And I liked that, as my 13-year-old Snapchat-astic daughter said, “the camera is definitely better.”

(Incidentally, she meant it was not just better than my Samsung but also better than her iPhone. And that is not sacrilege. The detail and the colors are far sharper, even to an untrained eye like mine.)

The Pixel also charged quickly; a few minutes plugged into the wall gets you hours of battery life. Google said the device is water-resistant. And the screen, 6.2 inches along the diagonal, was enormous — though not so huge that I couldn’t comfortably hold the phone in one hand. It was nice that, for those rare occasions when I watched extended YouTube videos, the image stretched to the edge of the phone.

Photo

Yet is any of this all that different from other top-of-the-line phones? Not really. And Google knows this. Even the steep $849 pricing for the Pixel 2 XL was in line with rivals.

In pitching the new Pixel, the company focused on the Google Assistant — Android’s answer to Siri — and other services that lean on what is commonly called artificial intelligence. This included Google Lens, a service that instantly identifies landmarks, books, movies and other stuff you capture in photos, as well as a service that, in similar fashion, automatically identifies songs playing on a nearby radio or television.

These were certainly the most impressive parts of the new phone. And they showed how recent advances in machine learning are producing consumer devices, cars and robots that can read, analyze and respond to their environment in ways that were not possible just a few years ago. Drawing on work by DeepMind, an A.I. lab in Britain that Google acquired in 2014, for instance, the Google Assistant now speaks with a voice that’s closer to your own.

“It sounds more normal,” my 13-year-old said. Still, she added that the improvement was small.

That sums up all these services. Many are technically impressive, and some are useful. But they took the Pixel only so far past the status quo.

Google Lens gave my 9-year-old several minutes of fun over the weekend. But it’s not something she — or I — would use on a regular basis. (And it mistook a picture in my bedroom of New York’s Flatiron Building for the Empire State Building.)

The service that identifies songs was even more fun and more useful. But it will never be anything more than a tiny part of our daily lives. And it mistakenly identified the musical score at the end of “The Spy Who Came In From the Cold” as the song “Chained” by the pop group the xx.

The Google Assistant was the most adept of all the digital assistants, easily beating Siri and Amazon’s Alexa. My younger daughter loved it. (At one point, she said it was more fun than me.)

But like those other assistants, it could not deal with more than just a handful of simple tasks, typically delivering web pages or preset answers in response to questions. When I asked the Assistant whether $824 was expensive for a smartphone, it gave me a YouTube video of a guy unboxing some sort of $20,000 monstrosity.

In most cases, it can recognize what you say. But it cannot necessarily understand what you say and respond in a completely satisfying way. That is still to come.

Google boasts that you can instantly switch the Assistant into a mode that lets you type questions rather than ask them orally. But as my wife said, these assistants are useful only because they let you handle basic tasks — like sending a text or setting an alarm — without typing. If I wanted to type, I would just visit google.com.

Still, after a few days, I was rather attached to the Pixel 2 XL. On the way to dinner on Saturday night, it correctly identified every song that played on the local 1980s station, from “The Warrior” to “Der Kommissar.”

Even so, I plan to keep the $849 for now. The smaller version of the new Pixel goes for $649, and I might go for that, when I finally need a new phone.",Google’s Pixel 2 Smartphone Is a Powerful Extravagance,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/technology/personaltech/googles-pixel-2-smartphone-is-a-powerful-extravagance.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Unlike many of Suharto’s former acolytes, Mr. Wanandi admits that the events of 1965-66 spiraled out of control.","“We knew about these things more generally, but it’s great to have this information in black and white so it’s not just based on oral interviews with victims,” said John Roosa, an associate professor of history at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver and author of a book on the events of 1965. “The U.S. was following what was happening very closely, and if it weren’t for its support, you could argue that the army would never have felt the confidence to take power.”

The Indonesian slaughter took place at a time when Southeast Asia, still emerging from colonialism, was energized by socialist ideology.

The United States already had boots on the ground in Vietnam. Indonesia, then led by President Sukarno and home to one of the world’s largest Communist parties, was seen by Washington as the next domino that could fall.

When a group of hard-line generals blamed Communist Party operatives for a failed coup attempt in 1965, with China accused as a mastermind, Washington did little to challenge that narrative.

The United States government largely stayed silent as the death toll mounted at the hands of the Indonesian Army, paramilitaries and religious mobs. The extrajudicial killings spread beyond suspected Communists to target ethnic Chinese, students, union members and anyone who might have personal feuds with the hit men. Tens of thousands of others were thrown into tropical gulags.

Eventually, President Sukarno, with his anti-American talk and socialist sympathies, was replaced by Suharto, a general who held power for 32 years, instituting a policy he called the New Order to reinvigorate the economy through foreign aid and investment.

In some of the cables, American diplomats exulted in the abrupt political transition, even as they noted the rising body count. One file refers to the political changes as a “fantastic switch.”

The Indonesian military, which still wields considerable power today, has tried to blame the orgy of violence on a public furious with the excesses of the Communist Party, absolving itself of direct culpability.

But the cables indicate how members of the American foreign service, at least, held the military directly responsible for some of the deaths. One cable alleges that Suharto gave the orders for certain mass executions.

In 2015, Senator Tom Udall of New Mexico reintroduced a resolution in the Senate calling for Indonesia to face up to its traumatic history. He also held the United States to account for its “military and financial support” there, which included providing lists of possible leftist sympathizers to the Indonesian government and, as one cable released Tuesday showed, pushing to bury foreign news coverage of the killings.

The legacy of the massacre continues to divide Indonesia. For decades, under Suharto’s rule, Indonesians dared not call for justice. Even after he was deposed in 1998, there was little effort to set up an Indonesian form of a truth and reconciliation commission.

But in part after the filmmaker Joshua Oppenheimer released a documentary in 2012 called “The Act of Killing,” chronicling the life of an unrepentant hit man in the purge, members of Indonesian society began to delve into its history.

Joko Widodo, the Indonesian president, has talked about the need to address past human rights violations.

Still, there are limits to how far Indonesia is willing to go. Nursyahbani Katjasungkana, a human rights lawyer, helped convene an international people’s tribunal on the killings at The Hague in 2015. (The court had no real authority beyond an airing of testimony, but it held the Indonesian government responsible for crimes against humanity and accused the United States, Britain and Australia of complicity.)

But in recent months, conservative groups have rekindled anti-Communist sensibilities in Indonesia. Efforts last month to organize screenings of Mr. Oppenheimer’s second documentary, “The Look of Silence,” were restricted by a military directive. A mob gathered around a building where Ms. Katjasungkana and others were believed to be gathering to talk about the violence.

“I just hope these new documents will encourage the Indonesian government to be more open and stop the state denial that the military was involved in these atrocities,” she said. “Hopefully, America will also admit its involvement.”

Jusuf Wanandi is a Chinese-Indonesian who supported Suharto for decades, even if he grew disillusioned with his strongman-like leadership. Unlike many of Suharto’s former acolytes, Mr. Wanandi admits that the events of 1965-66 spiraled out of control.

Yet even he advised patience.

“It is impossible to move forward because emotions are still raw,” Mr. Wanandi said. “We need some more time.”","U.S. Stood by as Indonesia Killed a Half-Million People, Papers Show",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/world/asia/indonesia-cables-communist-massacres.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

“I wept the whole time,” Ms. Edmondson recalled. “I disassociated out of my body.”

Since the late 1990s, an estimated 16,000 people have enrolled in courses offered by Nxivm (pronounced Nex-e-um), which it says are designed to bring about greater self-fulfillment by eliminating psychological and emotional barriers. Most participants take some workshops, like the group’s “Executive Success Programs,” and resume their lives. But other people have become drawn more deeply into Nxivm, giving up careers, friends and families to become followers of its leader, Keith Raniere, who is known within the group as “Vanguard.”

Both Nxivm and Mr. Raniere, 57, have long attracted controversy. Former members have depicted him as a man who manipulated his adherents, had sex with them and urged women to follow near-starvation diets to achieve the type of physique he found appealing.

Now, as talk about the secret sisterhood and branding has circulated within Nxivm, scores of members are leaving. Interviews with a dozen of them portray a group spinning more deeply into disturbing practices. Many members said they feared that confessions about indiscretions would be used to blackmail them.

Mark Vicente, a filmmaker and former top Nxivm official, said that after hearing about the secret society, he confronted Mr. Raniere.

“I said, ‘Whatever you are doing, you are heading for a blowup,’” Mr. Vicente said.

Several former members have asked state authorities to investigate the group’s practices, but officials have declined to pursue action.

In July, Ms. Edmondson filed a complaint with the New York State Department of Health against Danielle Roberts, a licensed osteopath and follower of Mr. Raniere, who performed the branding, according to Ms. Edmondson and another woman. In a letter, the agency said it would not look into Dr. Roberts because she was not acting as Ms. Edmondson’s doctor when the branding is said to have happened.

Separately, a state police investigator told Ms. Edmondson and two other women that officials would not pursue their criminal complaint against Nxivm because their actions had been consensual, a text message shows.

State medical regulators also declined to act on a complaint filed against another Nxivm-affilated physician, Brandon Porter. Dr. Porter, as part of an “experiment,” showed women graphically violent film clips while a brain-wave machine and video camera recorded their reactions, according to two women who took part.

The women said they were not warned that some of the clips were violent, including footage of four women being murdered and dismembered.

“Please look into this ASAP,” a former Nxivm member, Jennifer Kobelt, stated in her complaint. “This man needs to be stopped.”

In September, regulators told Ms. Kobelt they concluded that the allegations against Dr. Porter did not meet the agency’s definition of “medical misconduct,” their letter shows.

Mr. Raniere and other top Nxivm officials, including Lauren Salzman, did not respond to repeated emails, letters or text messages seeking comment. Dr. Roberts and Dr. Porter also did not respond to inquiries.

Former members said that, inside Nxivm, they are being portrayed as defectors who want to destroy the group.

It is not clear how many women were branded or which Nxivm officials were aware of the practice.

A copy of a text message Mr. Raniere sent to a female follower indicates that he knew women were being branded and that the symbol’s design incorporated his initials.

“Not initially intended as my initials but they rearranged it slightly for tribute,” Mr. Raniere wrote, (“if it were abraham lincolns or bill gates initials no one would care.)”

From the Message Below is an excerpt of a text message Mr. Raniere sent to a female follower, which suggested that he knew women were being branded and that the symbol’s design incorporated his initials. “... Not intended initially as my initials but they rearranged it slightly for tribute (if it were abraham lincolns or bill gates initials no one would care). The primary meaning and design of the brand symbol has nothing to do with my initials ...”

Joining the Sisterhood

Ms. Edmondson, who lives in Vancouver and helped start Nxivm’s chapter there, was thrilled when Lauren Salzman arrived in January to teach workshops.

The women, both in their early 40s, were close and Ms. Edmondson regarded Ms. Salzman as a confidante and mentor.

“Lauren was someone I really looked up to as a rock star within the company,” said Ms. Edmondson, an actress who joined Nxivm about a decade ago.

During her visit, Ms. Salzman said she had something “really amazing” she wanted to share. “It is kind of strange and top secret and in order for me to tell you about it you need to give me something as collateral to make sure you don’t speak about it,” Ms. Edmondson recalled her saying.

The proposition seemed like a test of trust. After Ms. Edmondson wrote a letter detailing past indiscretions, Ms. Salzman told her about the secret sorority.

She said it had been formed as a force for good, one that could grow into a network that could influence events like elections. To become effective, members had to overcome weaknesses that Mr. Raniere taught were common to women — an overemotional nature, a failure to keep promises and an embrace of the role of victim, according to Ms. Edmondson and other members.

Submission and obedience would be used as tools to achieve those goals, several women said. The sisterhood would comprise circles, each led by a “master” who would recruit six “slaves,” according to two women. In time, they would recruit slaves of their own.

“She made it sound like a bad-ass bitch boot camp,” Ms. Edmondson said.

Ms. Edmondson and others said that during training, the women were required to send their master texts that read “Morning M” and “Night M.” During drills, a master texted her slaves “?” and they had 60 seconds to reply “Ready M.”

Trainees who failed had to pay penalties, including fasting, or could face physical punishments, two women said.

In March, Ms. Edmondson arrived for an initiation ceremony at Ms. Salzman’s home in Clifton Park, N.Y., a town about 20 miles north of Albany where Mr. Raniere and some followers live. After undressing, she was led to a candlelit ceremony, where she removed a blindfold and saw Ms. Salzman’s other slaves for the first time. The women were then driven to a nearby house, where the branding took place.

In the spring, the sorority grew as women joined different circles. Slaves added compromising collateral every month to Dropbox accounts, and a Google Document was used to list a timetable for recruiting new slaves, several women said.

Around the same time, an actress, Catherine Oxenberg, said she learned her daughter had been initiated into the sorority.

“I felt sick to my stomach,” said Ms. Oxenberg, who starred in the 1980s television series “Dynasty.”

Ms. Oxenberg had become increasingly concerned about her 26-year-old daughter, India, who looked emaciated from dieting. She told her mother that she had not had a menstrual period for a year and that her hair was falling out.

Ms. Oxenberg said she invited her daughter home in late May to try to get her away from the group.

When Ms. Oxenberg confronted her about the sorority, her daughter defended its practices.

“She said it was a character-building experience,” Ms. Oxenberg said.

‘Humans Can Be Noble’

By the time the secret group was taking shape, Mark Vicente, the filmmaker, had been a faithful follower of Mr. Raniere for more than a decade.

Mr. Vicente said he had been contacted by Ms. Salzman’s mother, Nancy, a co-founder of Nxivm who is known as “Prefect,” after the 2004 release of a documentary he co-directed that explored spirituality and physics.

Soon, Mr. Vicente was taking courses that he said helped him expose his fears and learn strategies that made him feel more resolute.

He also made a documentary called “Encender el Corazón,” or “Ignite the Heart,” which lionized Mr. Raniere’s work in Mexico.

“Keith Raniere is an activist, scientist, philosopher and, above all, humanitarian,” Mr. Vicente says in the film.

Mr. Raniere has used those words to describe himself. On his website, he said he spoke in full sentences by age 1, mastered high school mathematics by 12 and taught himself to play “concert level” piano. At 16, he entered Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y.

Before Nxivm, he helped run a company called Consumers’ Buyline Inc., which offered discounts to members on groceries and other products.

In the mid-1990s, several state attorneys general investigated it as a suspected pyramid scheme; Mr. Raniere and his associates agreed to shut it down.

Through Nxivm, Mr. Raniere transformed himself into a New Age teacher with long hair and a guru-like manner of speaking.

“Humans can be noble,” he says on his website. “The question is: will we put forth what is necessary?”

By many accounts, Mr. Raniere sleeps during the day and goes out at night to play volleyball or take female followers for long walks. Several women described him as warm, funny and eager to talk about subjects that interested them.

Others saw a different side. Nxivm sued several former members, accusing them of stealing its trade secrets, among other things.

Mr. Vicente said he was aware of the negative publicity, including a 2012 series by The Albany Times-Union that described alleged abuses inside Nxivm.

Mr. Vicente’s views began to change this year after his wife was ostracized when she left Nxivm and he heard rumors about the secret sorority.

Mr. Vicente said he got evasive answers when he asked Mr. Raniere about the group. Mr. Raniere acknowledged giving “five women permission to do something,” but did not elaborate, other than to say he would investigate, Mr. Vicente said.

Mr. Vicente said he suspected Mr. Raniere was lying to him and might have done so before. Suddenly, self-awareness techniques he had learned felt like tools that had been used to control him.

“No one goes in looking to have their personality stripped away,” he said. “You just don’t realize what is happening.”

Followers Start to Flee

In May, Sarah Edmondson began to recoil from her embrace of the secret society.

Her husband, Anthony Ames, who was also a Nxivm member, learned about her branding and the couple both wanted out.

Before quitting, Mr. Ames went to Nxivm’s offices in Albany to collect money he said the group owed him.

He had his cellphone in his pocket and turned on its recorder.

On the recording, Mr. Ames tells another member that Ms. Edmondson was branded and that other women told him about handing over collateral. “This is criminal,” Mr. Ames says.

The voice of a woman — who Mr. Ames said is Lauren Salzman — is heard trying to calm him. “I don’t think you are open to having a conversation,” she said.

“You are absolutely right, I’m not open to having a conversation,” he replied. “My wife got branded.”

A few days later, many of Mr. Raniere’s followers learned of the secret society from a website run by a Buffalo-area businessman, Frank R. Parlato Jr. Mr. Parlato had been locked in a long legal battle with two sisters, Sara and Clare Bronfman, who are members of Nxivm and the daughters of Edgar Bronfman, the deceased chairman of Seagram Company.

In 2011, the Bronfman sisters sued Mr. Parlato, whom they had hired as a consultant, alleging he had defrauded them of $1 million.

Four years later, in 2015, the Justice Department indicted him on charges of fraud and other crimes arising from alleged activities, including defrauding the Bronfmans. Mr. Parlato has denied the claims and the case is pending.

Mr. Parlato started a website, The Frank Report, which he uses to lambaste prosecutors, Mr. Raniere and the Bronfmans. In early June, Mr. Parlato published the first in a torrent of salacious posts under the headline, “Branded Slaves and Master Raniere.”

A Nxivm follower, Soukaina Mehdaoui, said she reached out to Mr. Raniere after reading the post. Ms. Mehdaoui, 25, was a newcomer to Nxivm, but the two had grown close.

She said Mr. Raniere told her the secret sorority began after three women offered damaging collateral to seal lifetime vows of obedience to him.

While Ms. Mehdaoui had joined the sorority, the women in her circle were not branded. She was appalled.

“There are things I didn’t know that I didn’t sign up for, and I’m not even hearing about it from you,” she texted Mr. Raniere.

Mr. Raniere texted back about his initials and the brand.

By then, panic was spreading inside Nxivm. Slaves were ordered to delete encrypted messages between them and erase Google documents, two women said. To those considering breaking away, it was not clear whom they could trust and who were Nxivm loyalists.

Late one night, Ms. Mehdaoui met secretly with another Nxivm member. They took out their cellphones to show they were not recording the conversation.

Both decided to leave Nxivm, despite concerns that the group would retaliate by releasing their “collateral” or suing them.

Ms. Mehdaoui said that when she went to say goodbye to Mr. Raniere, he urged her to stay.

“Do you think, I’m bad, I don’t agree with abuses,” she recalled him saying. He said the group “gives women tools to be powerful, to regain their power for the sake of building love.”

Nxivm recently filed criminal complaints with the Vancouver police against Ms. Edmondson and two other women accusing them of mischief and other crimes in connection with the firm’s now-closed center there, according to Ms. Edmondson. The women have denied the allegations. A spokesman for the Vancouver police declined to comment.

Ms. Edmondson and other former followers of Mr. Raniere said they were focusing on recovering.

The technology has also been gaining traction in other states. Last week, California announced an expedited timeline to change its rules to allow cars to drive without any human supervision by 2018; the current rules permit some driverless cars, but only with a supervising person in the driver’s seat.

But the movement to allow driverless cars has been limited by several high-profile accidents, including the death last year in Florida of a man who crashed a Tesla vehicle that was on autopilot; it is not yet known if the technology was the cause of the accident.

It is also unclear if the demand for self-driving cars exists; several studies indicate that for the most part, consumers do not yet seem to want them.

Nonetheless, companies like G.M., which purchased Cruise Automation last year to compete in the world of driver-free tech, are moving ahead, and officials there believe that Manhattan’s packed streets make the perfect lab.

“New York City is one of the most densely populated places in the world and provides new opportunities to expose our software to unusual situations,” according to a statement from Cruise’s chief executive officer, Kyle Vogt. “Which means we can improve our software at a much faster rate.”

Failing to embrace the emerging automation could leave the state behind, according to a recent study conducted by the Regional Plan Association, an urban research and advocacy organization. But there are risks, according the report’s findings.

The technology, if not implemented well, the study cautions, has the potential to be yet another disrupter — much like Uber, the ride-hailing app that has sent the taxi industry spiraling and ratcheted up congestion in many places.

“All these drivers, they live here, too,” said Omar Faruq, 41, a yellow cab and Uber driver, as he waited for a fare on West 40th Street on Tuesday. “To have self-driving cars, to have them in the street, what are all these people going to do?” he asked. “The companies, they’re making the money.

The fifth of six children, he was so determined to get to college that he was already budgeting for it as a high school student. (I reproduced his handwritten budget, which he still has, in a 2015 column.)

After successful stints in the paper-shredding and executive compensation industries, Mr. Ranzetta turned to student loan consulting when his older siblings started sending their own children to college and threw up their hands in confusion and despair when trying to borrow to pay for it.

His phone number was on his company website, and every time a tearful call came in, he asked what might have kept the problems from happening in the first place. Inevitably, it came down to people wishing they’d known at the beginning how large their loan payment was going to be relative to their monthly income.

Payback, and the financial literacy work Mr. Ranzetta has been doing for years (which he pays for out of his own savings), is his attempt to open students’ eyes.

Once he persuaded McKinney to help him, he began working with Jenny Nicholson, one of the creators of Spent. Her work on that project was informed by her own childhood, part of which she spent in Tennessee without running water or electricity.

When she entered the University of California, San Diego, she was the first person in her family to go to college. Nobody told her that when the student loan check lands, it can lead to false feelings of being flush with cash, given that a chunk of the money may be needed for months of living expenses. “I was richer, frankly, than I’d ever been in my life,” she said.

She avoided the temptation to spend it all, quickly paid back her loans and entered the social work field before landing in advertising. After the success of Spent, McKinney received lots of proposals from potential clients wanting them to recreate it for some other area of decision-making.

Payback, however, is the first project the firm has accepted like this. A big part of the reason, Ms. Nicholson said, is that the firm recognized that paying for college is not just about debt but also about investment. Every decision — from where you attend to what jobs and activities and classes and majors you choose while you are there — is about trade-offs. How much paid work is enough? How much socializing and spending on fun?

And so the game asks players to consider graduation gifts of cash, laptop purchases, meal plans, dorm supplies, books, hours of paid work, the Greek system, vacations and more. A rapid-fire class registration challenge has dire consequences if you don’t act fast enough.

All the while, you see a running total of your debt. But one of the cleverest things about the game is the constant, cumulative tabulation of focus (which paid work can reduce), connections (is an unpaid internship worth it?) and happiness. That last one comes from Ms. Nicholson’s personal experience, for she eventually realized that focus and happiness were sometimes counterpoints and she might have received a better return on her investment in college if she’d had more fun and more friends.

Veteran financial literacy educators and advocates welcome the additional tool, though some of them were underwhelmed by my notion of a grand, master class on paying for college. After all, not every high school student is college material, and many others are aiming for trade training or military service. Sometimes, all of these teenagers are in the same class, so the course work needs to apply to as many of them as possible.

Still, Brian Page, a high school teacher in Reading, Ohio, said he welcomed an additional teaching tool that is highly experiential. He should know, since he’s the educator I wrote about three years ago who takes his students on a yellow school bus tour of pawnshops and payday-lending stores to do math problems using those businesses’ terms and fine print. “It’s not just what you know,” he said. “It’s what you do with what you know.”

Mr. Page has done some consulting work for Mr. Ranzetta but did not work on Payback and reviewed it at my request. He said he especially liked the various ways that players could lose the game and not even complete college, while still accruing debt. That is the worst of all worlds, he noted, since they need to repay the loans but don’t end up with the sheepskin that will make it much easier to get a decent-paying job and thus afford the monthly payments.

There is one other hurdle that teachers may need to clear to be comfortable with using Payback in the classroom. Talking about paying for college inevitably leads to questions about which families have what, how much they’re willing to pay (if anything) and what teenagers even know about their family’s finances. Ms. Nicholson knew from her own experience as the poor kid in class that this could be a source of tension, so the game doesn’t ask for household income. Instead, it assumes a certain level of family contribution plus scholarships. Then, different shortages (that debt can fill) emerge, depending on the colleges a player chooses.

Still, teachers may quite reasonably fear a delicate dance around personal data when teaching about paying for college generally. “The potential teacher reluctance is with the social aspect, not with the topic,” said Laura Levine, the president and chief executive of the nonprofit group JumpStart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy.

With the right planning, however, educators should be able to sidestep revealing too much in front of students’ peers. Students may well have questions for the teacher after class, and Mr. Ranzetta hopes they bring the questions home, too. “My hope is that this is the beginning of a great discussion,” he said.

There is risk that any such game, with its winners and losers, may result in students not attending college or not borrowing enough to do so successfully. But Ms. Nicholson said she hoped that the elements of fun and connections baked into the game would have an entirely different effect.

“I’ll never get all the details right, and there is always going to be someone who asks if we thought about this or that or living in a cardboard box to save money,” she said. “But I hope everyone who plays will understand the concept that you don’t have to give up everything to succeed.”",A Game to Help Students Pay the Right Price for College,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/29/your-money/paying-for-college/payback-college-loans.html

The sweetness of chilled spot prawns under a few drops of olive oil made me shiver with pleasure. A trio of flash-seared Hokkaido sea scallop, Pacific mackerel whose skin had been peppered and griddled, and raw amberjack under tiny cells of finger lime suggested that Mr. Torrisi could run a stunning sushi restaurant.

My eyes rolled back in my head whenever I ate sea urchin. In one appetizer, it is arranged on griddled pretzel bread with mustard oil and tiny cubes of green apple. In another, lobes of it are layered into an iced bowl to be eaten, with crème fraîche and chives if you like, over blini, hard-cooked eggs, toast or, my favorites, creamy potato halves roasted in duck fat. (Caviar and trout roe are served the same way.)

Mr. Torrisi’s approach is to be lavish with punctiliously cared-for seafood and to outfit it sparingly. A beautiful illustration is the cured king salmon, two long, intensely flavorful strips served with a single potato dressed with mustard, shallots and dill. Another is any of the whole fish. The skin on turbot caught in Portugal is seared to a satisfying crackle on a plancha and served with a simple lemon vinaigrette. Like the Dover sole, it is lifted from its skeleton by a slim captain (they’re all slim) who performs the surgery wearing a Tom Ford suit.

One night five captains in five suits filleted five sole for five diners at a table next to mine. It looked like a scene from “Ocean’s Eleven” that didn’t make the final cut.

But some of the more elaborate dishes are underwhelming. I don’t know how striped bass with banana peppers and “mole spices” can be dull, but it is. Coconut-orange vinaigrette sounds like a terrific sauce for lobster, but it added very little except sweetness, which the lobster didn’t need. Chopped gazpacho ingredients over a puddle of actual gazpacho was both too complicated (why not just serve gazpacho?) and too plain (the cucumbers and tomatoes didn’t shine with flavor).

This is all a huge improvement on what prevailed in the last years of the Four Seasons. But it doesn’t make you feel as if you are in the hands of one of the city’s best chefs, which Mr. Torrisi is, I think. Even at its best, the food rarely rises to the technical brilliance or boldness of, say, the green curry mushroom mille-feuille or the Vietnamese-flavored chicken legs he put on the menu at Dirty French. If his cooking at the Pool had some of that swagger, what’s on the plates could live up to the best parts of the original architecture and help make up for the renovation’s mistakes.

This is exactly what happens when Stephanie Prida’s desserts arrive. Ms. Prida, who until a few months ago was the pastry chef at Manresa in Los Gatos, Calif., has a knack for combining flavors that seem to get more interesting as you go along, like a crème brûlée with shaved plums and bitter almond ice cream under a squiggle of reduced sherry vinegar, or coconut parfait and fluffy pink-grapefruit mousse sandwiched between the thinnest possible layers of matcha sablé.

Bottles of Chateau d’Yquem going back to 1811 are kept in a glass wine room just off the entrance to the Pool, where they cast a beautiful amber glow that the servers are fond of pointing out. Enjoy it as you walk in, because this is as close as you will get to a dessert wine of any kind unless you are ready to spend at least $95, the price of the least expensive glass.

The wine list is full of wonderful bottles, but its most noteworthy feature is its breezy lack of concern for normal budgets. Out of dozens of sparkling wines, more than 30 are priced above $1,000. Just one is under $90. This is quite a pinch to put on customers who are already paying between $39 and $74 for main courses.

The Grill/Pool bifurcation extends to the dining room staff. In the Pool they are reserved, poised, deferential and seem to have been directed not to show any warmth or wit. Compared with the talkative, jokey characters in the Grill, who are ready to flambé something at the drop of a hat, the servers in the Pool are cardboard figures in tailored suits.

Major Food Group has no fear of going over the top. So I’m reluctant to suggest that the Pool needs more personality and drama — these guys are capable of stocking the pool with live sharks if they thought it would help. But the restaurant needs something, because at these prices, what might pass for restraint and simplicity can start to seem like a sophisticated heist.

But her teenage discovery that her grandmother’s town was once home to thousands of Jews who perished in the Holocaust set her on a different path: a 30-year journey documenting persecuted religious minorities around the world.

Today she no longer considers herself religious “in terms of attending church,” but she appreciates the spiritual passion and ecstasy she documents in religious settings in far-flung countries. “My work can be a kind of prayer,” she said. “With time, I understood that what is interesting to me is not God — but God in people.”

Her research has led her to photograph Sufis in northern Africa, Christians in the Middle East, Tibetan Buddhist monks, Old Believers in Eastern Europe, Voudou practitioners in Haiti and Hasids in Galilee. Photographs from her work since 2001 are now featured in a book, “Where Gods Whisper,” published by Contrasto Books.

She has documented the unspeakable cruelties committed in the name of religion as well as uplifting moments of fellowship among Jews, Christians and Muslims. Her mission, to photograph oppressed religious minorities, she said, is a “kind of moral and ethical necessity.”

As a teenager, she had photographed Russian Orthodox churches where she felt seduced by the mysticism and the smells, colors and sounds that washed over her. At 19, she wandered along the borders of eastern Poland searching for remnants of communities and interviewing Byzantine Christians, Jews and Muslim Tatars. She has continued this work in pilgrimages to holy sites across five continents — teaching herself photography along the way.

Her grandparents’ house in Warka was a veritable shrine. “In one corner stood Our Lady of Perpetual Help, in another Our Lady of Sorrows,” she said and on Good Friday the townsfolk gathered in a Baroque church overlooking the river, where they knelt in prayer.

She was 6 when she learned that this had not always been the case.

“Beyond the bridge there was a sand hill that reared up steep as a mountain to our young eyes,” she wrote in “God’s People: A Travel Into Another Europe,” an earlier book. “In winter, our favourite sport was sledding down it and breaking the ice around the willows on the riverbank. One day around Christmas, my sled hit a rock and when I looked closely, I could see strange signs under the snow. Digging with my hands, I unearthed a sculpted lion. This lion buried in the snow, with arcane signs like hieroglyphics, left me breathless with astonishment. I felt as if I had discovered something fabulous, like those great sea captains and explorers, Ahab, Fridtjof Nansen and Eric the Red, that I had read about in the books my grandfather kept for us on his bookshelf.”

Ms. Bulaj had stumbled upon remains of a vibrant Jewish culture that had once flourished in her grandmother’s town, but had withered under centuries of virulent anti-Semitism and had ultimately been destroyed during the Holocaust. It was the town’s “total silence” about their former neighbors that led Ms. Bulaj to dedicate her life to documenting religious minorities.

Ms. Bulaj’s photographs bring us into the lives of endangered and oppressed communities while revealing the enduring power of spiritual experiences. Her work is a spiritual experience, too.

“I photograph instinctively,” she said. “I am close to them, I am touching them, I am crying for them.”

When he testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee in June, Mr. Sessions had refused to answer several questions about his conversations with Mr. Trump regarding the Russia investigation and the president’s firing of James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director. Mr. Sessions told lawmakers that it would be “inappropriate” to detail those discussions because those matters were potentially covered by executive privilege.

The move angered Democrats because Mr. Trump had not invoked the privilege. Last week, all nine Democrats on the committee sent Mr. Sessions a letter saying they either wanted him to answer questions that he refused to answer in June, or that they expected Mr. Trump to formally invoke the privilege to keep those matters secret.

“With respect to potential assertions of executive privilege on behalf of the president, we wish to put you on notice that any reasonable period of abeyance on many of the issues about which you will be asked has long elapsed,” they wrote.

For a time, Mr. Trump regularly denigrated Mr. Sessions in an apparent effort to get him to step aside so he could appoint a new attorney general who would not be recused from matters related to the 2016 election and could seize control of the Russia investigation.

Democrats will seek assurances that Mr. Sessions is providing resources and protection for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, to continue his work undisturbed.

Sessions says the special counsel has not interviewed him

In a testy exchange, Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, pressed Mr. Sessions to say whether he had been interviewed by Mr. Mueller, who is investigating possible links between Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and the Trump campaign, as well as whether Mr. Trump committed obstruction of justice by firing the former F.B.I. director, James B. Comey.

Mr. Sessions responded by telling the senator that he would have to ask Mr. Mueller, prompting Mr. Leahy to growl: “I’m asking you.” Mr. Sessions eventually answered “no,” and when Mr. Leahy pressed him further, he reiterated, “The answer’s no.”

Mr. Sessions also pushed back against Mr. Leahy, who accused Mr. Sessions of misleading Congress when he said during his confirmation process that he did not have contacts with Russians during the 2016 campaign. In fact, Mr. Sessions met several times with the Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak.

Mr. Sessions said that he had interpreted questions about contacts, based on their context, as being about campaign-related conversations. He also asserted that he never had “a meeting with any Russian officials to discuss any kind of coordinating campaign efforts.”

Sessions will not say whether Trump talked to him about the Russia investigation

Mr. Sessions did not shed new light on his role in Mr. Trump’s abrupt firing of Mr. Comey, again invoking the president’s right to private conversations when pressed by Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the committee’s top Democrat.

Instead, Mr. Sessions reiterated that Mr. Trump had asked earlier that both he and Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, make a recommendation about Mr. Comey’s future in writing. He said they had objected to how Mr. Comey had run the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s handling of classified information while secretary of state. Mr. Comey ultimately recommended she not be charged but harshly criticized her behavior, calling her “extremely careless.”

“I don’t think it’s been fully understood the significance of the error Mr. Comey made on the Clinton matter,” Mr. Sessions said. And after Mr. Comey told lawmakers during a hearing that he felt the matter was properly handled and that he would act in the same way again, Mr. Sessions said, it was clear to him that the F.B.I. needed a “fresh start.”

Mr. Sessions said he could neither confirm nor deny that Mr. Trump had raised concerns to him about the Justice Department’s investigation into Russia’s election interference when discussing Mr. Comey.

“That calls for a communication that I have had with the president and I believe it remains confidential,” Mr. Sessions said.

Trump administration opposes warrant requirement to search emails collected by a surveillance program

The law that forms the basis for the government’s warrantless surveillance program, Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act, is set to expire at the end of the year unless Congress extends it. Under questioning from the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, Mr. Sessions emphasized that the Trump administration continued to oppose the primary change proposed to the law: requiring the F.B.I. to get a warrant to search the repository of emails intercepted under that program for something involving an American criminal suspect.

“Mr. Chairman, it is not legally required, in my opinion, to have a warrant requirement,” Mr. Sessions said, noting that the targets of the surveillance under the program were people abroad, who are not protected by the Constitution. “I don’t not believe that we could carry out the responsibilities that we are expected to do with a warrant requirement for any of the 702 type material.”

Mr. Grassley’s counterpart in the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. Bob Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia, has sponsored a bill, the USA Liberty Act, that would impose a warrant requirement for F.B.I. agents, working on ordinary criminal cases, to search for and use Americans’ emails collected without a warrant.

The Justice Department has sharply changed course on civil rights enforcement

Mr. Sessions is also likely to face questions, at least from Democrats, about how the federal government on his watch has curtailed the Obama-era approach to enforcing anti-discrimination laws, especially protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.

On Oct. 6, for example, Mr. Sessions issued sweeping guidance to federal agencies and prosecutors, instructing them to take the position in court that people and organizations may claim broad exemptions from nondiscrimination laws on the basis of religious objections. Critics said the guidance would open the door to justifying a wide range of acts of discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.

A day earlier, the Justice Department reversed the federal government’s stance on whether the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bans workplace discrimination on the basis of sex, provides protections for transgender people. Mr. Sessions issued a memo to the department instructing officials to take the position in court that the act does not bar acts of workplace bias against people based on their gender identity.

In July, the Justice Department, without being asked for its opinion, filed a brief before an appellate court in a private workplace discrimination lawsuit, taking the position that the Civil Rights Act’s ban on sex bias does not cover sexual orientation. By contrast, the Obama-era department tried to avoid taking a position on that question, while welcoming the prospect that the law might continue to evolve in that area.

Sessions defends hard-line approach to immigration

Mr. Sessions, the face of the administration’s tough posture toward immigration enforcement, defended the legal basis for its decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA, saying that the department had determined the program as implemented has not been legally justified.

“The Department of Justice cannot just wipe out whole sections of the American law and just say we will not enforce it after Congress has passed such a law,” Mr. Sessions said of the Obama-era program. It permitted people who grew up in the United States after being brought illegally to the country as children to stay and lawfully work.

Mr. Sessions said he could not discuss whether he had had conversations with the attorney general of Texas, Ken Paxton, a Republican, or other Republican attorneys general who had threatened to sue before the administration said it would end the program.

Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois and a longtime advocate for the young immigrants, known as dreamers, was not pleased and cited Mr. Sessions’s previous role as a senator on the committee and frustration with witnesses who were not as forthcoming as he would have liked.

“This would have been just about the moment when Senator Sessions of Alabama would have blown up,” he said.

The program’s fate is in the lap of Congress, which has until March to come up with a solution for its participants. In exchange, the administration has issued a set of immigration demands that it wants to be a part of any legislative deal, including the construction of a border wall, the hiring of 10,000 immigration agents and tougher asylum laws.",Sessions Refuses to Discuss His Conversations With Trump About Comey or Russia,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/us/politics/sessions-senate-judiciary-committee-hearing.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

This is where Alan Jacobs’s absolutely splendid forthcoming book “How to Think” comes in. If Thaler’s work is essential for understanding how the market can go astray, Jacobs’s emphasis on the relational nature of thinking is essential for understanding why there is so much bad thinking in political life right now.

Jacobs makes good use of C. S. Lewis’s concept of the Inner Ring. In every setting — a school, a company or a society — there is an official hierarchy. But there may also be a separate prestige hierarchy, where the cool kids are. They are the Inner Ring.

There are always going to be people who desperately want to get into the Inner Ring and will cut all sorts of intellectual corners to be accepted. As Lewis put it, “The passion for the Inner Ring is most skillful in making a man who is not yet a very bad man do very bad things.”

People will, for example, identify and attack what Jacobs calls the Repugnant Cultural Other — the group that is opposed to the Inner Ring, which must be assaulted to establish membership in it.

Other people will resent the Inner Ring, and they will cut all sorts of intellectual corners in order to show their resentment. These people are quick to use combat metaphors when they talk about thinking (he shot down my argument, your claims are indefensible). These people will adopt shared vague slurs like “cuckservative” or “whitesplaining” that signal to the others in the outsider groups that they are attacking the ring, even though these slurs are usually impediments to thought.

Jacobs notices that when somebody uses “in other words” to summarize another’s argument, what follows is almost invariably a ridiculous caricature of that argument, in order to win favor with the team. David Foster Wallace once called such people Snoots. Their motto is, “We Are the Few, the Proud, the More or Less Constantly Appalled at Everyone Else.”

Jacobs nicely shows how our thinking processes emerge from emotional life and moral character. If your heart and soul are twisted, your response to the world will be, too. He argues that by diagnosing our own ills, we can begin to combat them. And certainly I can think of individual beacons of intellectual honesty today: George Packer, Tyler Cowen, Scott Alexander and Caitlin Flanagan, among many.

But I’d say that if social life can get us into trouble, social life can get us out. After all, think of how you really persuade people. Do you do it by writing thoughtful essays that carefully marshal facts? That works some of the time. But the real way to persuade people is to create an attractive community that people want to join. If you do that, they’ll bend their opinions to yours. If you want people to be reasonable, create groups where it’s cool to be reasonable.

Jacobs mentions that at the Yale Political Union members are admired if they can point to a time when a debate totally changed their mind on something. That means they take evidence seriously; that means they can enter into another’s mind-set. It means they treat debate as a learning exercise and not just as a means to victory.

How many public institutions celebrate these virtues? The U.S. Senate? Most TV talk shows? Even the universities?

“If you’re Coach, how do you remarket yourself?” Mr. Dilling said. (Besides picking a strangely hippie-sounding name, Tapestry, for your parent company.) “I mean, you make leather handbags. That’s tough. You have to think of something that cuts through the visual clutter, and neon definitely cuts through.”

But even as fashion brands are using neon to showcase their modernity, they’re also hoping to invoke our nostalgia. While installing a cascading neon rainbow in Stella McCartney’s store in the meatpacking district, Mr. Dilling overheard multiple shoppers mention its “retro” quality. (Never mind that they each thought it evoked a different decade.)

Tiffany, too, has taken up neon to try and reclaim some of its midcentury irreverence. In the 1970s, for instance, the company’s celebrated window designer Gene Moore created a neon-lit Chinese food container spilling diamond-encrusted pendants instead of noodles.

Richard Moore, the vice president of creative visual merchandising at Tiffany (no relation to Gene Moore), said that type of creativity “has not necessarily translated to consumer perception of the brand, and that’s why neon feels particularly relevant right now.” This fall, Tiffany’s Fifth Avenue windows display a neon orange “Don’t Walk” hand wearing an engagement ring. The (perhaps obvious) symbolism: A Tiffany ring will stop traffic. Like the Chinese-takeout container, said Mr. Moore, “it’s very urban, very New York, very iconic.”

He said that today’s young people are especially attracted to things that are handcrafted, as most neon is. Signs are created by artisan “tube benders” who heat the glass in 2,000-degree flames, shape it and then fill it with gas.

Argon with a dash of mercury naturally shines blue, while neon is naturally “motel sign” red. These are the classic colors that first arrived in the United States from Paris in the early 1920s and replaced the pointillist incandescent “spectaculars” that dominated city center marquees.

“Whatever you could do with light bulbs, you could do in bigger, better, clearer ways with neon tubes,” said Eric Lynxwiler, 44, a preservationist and historian at the Museum of Neon Art in Glendale, Calif. “Every business in the nation that wanted to be perceived as modern in that Art Deco era had to have neon.”

Neon dimmed briefly during World War II, as chemicals and glass grew scarce, and then proliferated across the American highway afterward, as businesses competed for a car-bound public. But by the late 1960s, spurred in part by Lady Bird Johnson’s national “beautification” campaign, townships began passing anti-neon laws. That, along with the introduction of cheap, backlit plastic signs, ended the medium’s glorious run.

Neon returned briefly in the 1980s, its comeback linked to 1950s nostalgia. Today’s resurgence, though, which Mr. Lynxwiler says we’re riding “in a big, big way,” seems more about hope for the future. “We want the promise that everything is going to be O.K.,” Mr. Lynxwiler said. “We want the joy back. We’ve moved away from the dark Edison bulb toward something bright.”

At DeKalb Market Hall, a new food hall in Downtown Brooklyn, all vendors were instructed to hang a neon sign. “We’re bringing the city back pre-hipster,” said Anna Castellani, 46, DeKalb’s managing partner. “I’m definitely not complaining about missing the ’70s or ’80s in New York. But I love the chaotic nature of a street full of different lights. You feel like you’re in the city.”

Neon has also become central to a handful of urban renewal projects in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, San Francisco and Oklahoma City, whose downtown, from the 1920s to the 1950s, was home to 52 car dealerships, many of them neon lit. After decades of urban decline and the devastation of the 1995 bombing, civic and business leaders sought to develop that old stretch of “Automobile Alley.” This included grants for new businesses to hang neon.

“We felt like it could be a very important movement to help us regenerate the neighborhood,” said Rand Elliott, president of Elliott & Associates Architects and chairman of the Automobile Alley Association’s design committee.

To date, 29 businesses have hung neon on the six-block stretch of Broadway, including a massive 24-by-23-foot reproduction of the original Buick sign, which was installed in 2014. “Each sign is very distinctive,” Mr. Elliott said. “It’s like art hanging on these buildings.”

And yet even as these new signs go up and restoration efforts increase, many of the historic signs have shut off. In New York City, the red, green and yellow P & G Café facade at 73rd and Amsterdam has vanished; so too the luminous purple sign with an excitedly leaping girl in Times Square and the multistory signs for Eagle Clothes and Kentile Floors in Brooklyn.

“There were so many signs here, that nobody thought we should preserve them,” said Mr. Dilling, who works just a few blocks from where Eagle Clothes once towered above the Gowanus Canal. “And now with the development, they’re gone.”

The same developers who are taking over these spaces sometimes hire Mr. Dilling. He is currently making a five-foot-tall record for Henry Hall, an upscale residential complex on the West Side of Manhattan, where Legacy Recording Studios once stood. There will be a trendy restaurant named after the studios, once the East Coast center of film and Broadway recording, and a “Jam” room with Fender Stratocaster guitars and the neon record.

Mr. Dilling is mostly tranquil about these changes. “For years reporters would call and be like, ‘Neon’s a dying industry. How does it feel to be one of the last guys?’” he said. “But it just dies to be reborn.”",Tired of Twee Edison Bulbs? Bring On the Neon,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/13/style/neon-is-back.html

That’s the spirit of the terrible, wonderful “Desperate Measures”: Have iamb, will travel.","In a note in the “Arden/Everywhere” program, the play’s director, Jessica Bauman describes “As You Like It” as “as a play that’s always kind of bugged me.” To make friends with the play, she writes, “I started thinking about it as a refugee story.” Unfortunately, that’s a story that “As You Like It” both encourages and actively resists.

In Ms. Bauman’s production, which mixes professional actors and college students, Rosalind (Helen Cespedes), the daughter of a banished duke and Celia (Liba Vaynberg), her cousin, still flee a French duchy for the Forest of Arden. But don’t expect a dewy pastoral. This forest is a refugee camp, a tumble of wooden pallets and cracked cinderblocks. Its inhabitants busy themselves filling plastic jugs at a water pump and checking a bulletin board in the hope that some new country has accepted them. The uses of adversity are not so sweet.

After the intermission, several actors in the ensemble step forward and briefly detail how they arrived in America. “When I got here as a little kid, I was so nervous, I could only eat Wonder Bread and drink water,” a young man says. “I feel blessed,” a young woman says. “I am here because of the sacrifices of my mom and my ancestors.”

These brief speeches are the most affecting in the show and their consequence hints at some of the project’s problems. In effect, “As You Like It” isn’t a great fit for the tale that Ms. Bauman wants to tell. The substance of the plot — the political machinations, the romantic entanglements — doesn’t seem to interest her. Neither does the verse. And the comedy is a non-starter.

What does interest her is the refugee setting, but aside from some inspired details — the character of Corin is now a bilking shopkeeper — this vision of the Forest of Arden is unproductively at odds with the play. Yes, Shakespeare’s Arden is a weird place — there are lions and snakes and wandering monks. But it’s not intended as a bleak or unwelcoming one. It’s a shelter from the world, not a further hurt.

Ms. Bauman has altered a few words in the play’s last scene so that instead of nearly everyone returning happily to court, only the nobility get visas. The adjustment comes too late to really resonate. Unlike the joyous “As You Like It” produced by Public Works this summer, “Arden/Everywhere” sticks staunchly to Shakespeare’s text even when the words and plots just weigh it down. If it had been more daring, the play might have found its own language to tell its own stories — the strange, eventful histories its own cast members supply.

Textual fidelity does not seem to have kept the authors of the highly adulterated “Desperate Measures” up nights. Unlike the Elevator Repair Service production playing downtown, almost nothing remains of the “Measure for Measure” text — not the names, not the setting, not even much in the way of moral argument. About the only thing “Desperate Measures” hangs onto is the premise behind a nun’s being asked to bed a tyrant in order to free her brother.

It’s sometime in the 1800s in the Arizona territory when fiery Johnny Blood (Conor Ryan) shoots a mustached creep, probably in self-defense, and is sentenced to be hanged. His sister, Susanna (Emma Degerstedt), is about to make her devotions. But the good-hearted sheriff (Peter Saide) convinces her to appeal for her brother’s life. Governor von Richterhenkenpflichtgetruber (Nick Wyman, and see what I mean about the bad jokes?) sees how cute she looks in a wimple and tries to grab her by the rosary.

Reluctant to agree to her own rape, Susanna and the sheriff inveigle Bella Rose (Lauren Molina), a stripper and occasional prostitute, to fluff the governor’s pillows instead. Gary Marachek’s nihilist preacher rounds out the winning cast.

The songs, with music by David Friedman and book and lyrics by Peter Kellogg, are enthusiastically ordinary, except for the opening number, “The Ballad of Johnny Blood,” which is worse. Not even Tex Ritter could have saved it. The book is in rhyming couplets. The gags are hoary. (And whore-y.) Under Bill Castellino’s direction, somehow it’s a delight.

Tricky Clues

10A: It’s midweek, so read those clues carefully. “It’s found by the radius” sounds like it might be a math question, but it’s not; what other kind of “radius” exists? The radius we’re looking for today is a bone in the forearm. It is parallel to the ulna, a fabulous piece of osteocrosswordese (Yes, I made that up).

15A: A clue like “Brought home” evokes the childhood habit some of us might have had for bringing home stray animals and begging our parents to let us keep them. Not me, of course. But some of us. In a midweek puzzle, however, tricks are afoot, and today the clue is referring to how much money you’ve EARNED.

30A: #TIL the word MANUMIT, and it’s very interesting. To manumit is not merely to SET FREE, but to set someone free from slavery. It’s derived from the Latin manus, or hand, and means to “set forth from one’s hand,” or release from control.

2D: I had REFILL before REFUEL.

26D: “Glam rock?” is some nifty misdirection. You were thinking of a bunch of longhaired, bespangled musicians in heavy eyeliner, weren’t you? Not today. Another type of glamorous rock would be a GEM.

Let’s say hello to Evan Manhken:

Constructor Notes

I’m 20 years old, a junior at Brandeis University, majoring in Chemistry and American Studies. I started writing crosswords my freshman year of college. My school newspaper, the Justice, was using some very underwhelming syndicated crosswords, and I said to myself, “I could write better crosswords than that!” I couldn’t. At least, not at first. I still shudder to think of some of my very early crosswords. But, as I got more and more practice, I started to get decent at it. I continue to write a crossword for them each week. But when I write what I think is a really good puzzle, I send it off to The Times instead. This time, it seems Will agreed with me, and I got in. Not without a number of revisions beforehand, though. It’s a real honor to be in The New York Times for the first time, and I hope it won’t be the last! As for this puzzle’s construction, I don’t have all that much to say about it. The idea had been rattling around in my brain for a while before I got around to making it. I ended up brainstorming by thinking of all the spatial words I could muster, seeing which ones had phrases associated with them, and then seeing what I could come up with for words that fit those phrases. BENEATH ME was by far the answer I was most pleased with. I really learned a lot from the revision process, but I know I’ve got a lot left to learn about making crosswords.

Welcome to the party, Mr. Mahnken. I hope we get to see more from you soon, and 100 percent on your debut.

While it is a great way “to jump-start your career, it is not the only way,” she said.","Thirty years ago, Tim Rasmussen wore a mullet to the photojournalism version of Woodstock on a small upstate New York farm. He had traveled from his small town in Utah to the Catskill Mountains, to a celebration of photography where he studied with such masters of photojournalism as Mary Ellen Mark, Greg Heisler and Jodi Cobb.

A local high school band in Jeffersonville was playing a thunderous welcome as he entered a large, partly built barn. Inside he was greeted by the festival’s mastermind: Eddie Adams, the Pulitzer Prize-winning war photographer.

“Everybody who was anybody was there and I didn’t even know they existed,” said Mr. Rasmussen, now the director of photography for digital and print media at ESPN. “I went to this small agricultural college in Utah and didn’t know anybody, but in less than a week I left there with four or five lifelong friends. Sometimes you spend your whole life seeking your community and for me that was the moment that I found it.”

Mr. Rasmussen will return to Jeffersonville this weekend for the 30th Eddie Adams Workshop, which has since become one of the most important stops for up-and-coming photojournalists.

Mr. Adams died in 2004, but the workshop continues under the aegis of his wife, Alyssa Adams, and the assistance of around 150 volunteers. Some things have changed since the first session — Kodak slide film gave way to digital imagery in the late 1990s and audio and video have been added. Some sponsors have fallen away as the industry has withered, and while tuition is still free, students pay $375 for lodging.

The workshop is structured much as it was 30 years ago, with 10 groups of 10 students managed by a well-known photographer as team leader, a photo editor and a producer. This year, all the teams are led by photographers who were once students in the workshop.

For Jimmy Colton, a well-traveled photo editor who will be attending his 27th consecutive session this week, the workshop is about family. He calls himself Uncle Jimmy, and considers all 2,700 students he has worked with to be his nieces and nephews. The barn is also a place of family ghosts for Mr. Colton, whose brother Jay, and father, Sandy, both volunteered as photo editors before their deaths.

The core values of the workshop continue to be “a level of ethics beyond reproach, having great concern for your subjects and treating everyone as you would like to be treated,” Mr. Colton said.

Mr. Adams purchased the 64-acre farm in Jeffersonville in 1976 intending to convert it into a center for photography. But progress on rebuilding the ramshackle structures was slow as assignment work kept him busy. It was after he met Alyssa in 1983 that the plans for a free, merit-based workshop came together. They married shortly after the first workshop.

Photo

“This workshop is not a ‘how to,’ it’s more inspirational and aspirational,” Ms. Adams said. “This is a place where you can let your hair down and experiment a little as a student.”

The workshop does not romanticize photojournalism, and it acknowledges the price many photojournalists have paid while covering conflict. An annual memorial service for photographers who have died during war recognizes friends of Mr. Adams who were killed in Vietnam, like Henri Huet and Larry Burrows, as well as more recent casualties like Chris Hondros, who attended the 1993 workshop. An annual Award is given to a student by the Chris Hondros Foundation.

Recognizing colleagues who have been killed emphasizes that “the truth matters, pictures matter, and you can make a difference with your pictures not just in war,” said Nancy Andrews, who attended the first workshop in 1988 and has volunteered as a photo editor and will be a team leader this year. She returns for the sense of community and generosity, she said.

“I’m actually improved when you, my colleague, or you, my student, make a great picture” said Ms. Andrews, who was a Washington Post staff photographer and director of photography at The Detroit Free Press. “It’s not like there are finite numbers of great pictures out there and you stole one of them so now I can’t get one. It elevates the profession and I might be better as a result.”

Admission to the workshop, for students and professionals with less than three years’ experience is through portfolios judged by a panel of photo editors.

Not being included can be a difficult blow.

Ruth Fremson was among those young photographers who did not make the cut in the late 1980s. She remembers the rejection well, though she has since been part of three Pulitzer Prize-winning teams as a staff photographer for The Associated Press and starting in 2000 at The New York Times. While it is a great way “to jump-start your career, it is not the only way,” she said.

She has been a team leader at the workshop the last two years and is returning this weekend as a kitchen volunteer to help prepare food for the students.

“It’s such a gift to be able to participate in it because the team leaders and volunteers get as much out of the workshop as the students,” she said. “I’ve had the benefit of many great mentors who have championed my career and this is a great place to pay it forward.”

Many older L.G.B.T. Australians have endured decades of discrimination, sexual and physical violence, and forced medical or psychological treatment. Some still have criminal records for homosexuality. (Australia’s final laws against sodomy were repealed in 1997.)

Older gay and transgender people are used to hiding their bodily or sexual differences to protect themselves, said Dr. Catherine Barrett, an elder care researcher and activist. For some older gays, she said, their last experience with the health system may have been a forced visit to an institution decades ago. Those experiences can make it hard for them to feel safe, she said.

At the ball, the guests settled in to watch a night of cabaret, drag and opera over a three-course dinner.

Many were fabulously dressed, such as a man outfitted like Liberace, but Brian Day, 77, said he preferred to wear his “new trackie-daks,” or sweatpants. On his flannel shirt was pinned his Order of Australia medal, awarded for his services during the AIDS crisis and to the gay-rights movement. When the dancing started, he watched and shuffled his feet.

His body, he said, can get sore sometimes.

“I’ve been beaten up three times in my adult life, including once in my flat, my own place,” he said. “For us, the world is violent.”

While he currently lives without care, he understands why some people might return to the closet. The institutions have been “violent to us,” he said, and he still twinges when a police officer walks by.

“The closet was a safe place,” he said. “We haven’t got as much energy as we used to have. And we don’t want to get into brawls. We just want to live peaceful lives now, please.”

He is also concerned that services for the aged are not prepared to deal with the residual grief of older gay men, particularly the trauma of the AIDS epidemic.

“We have lived through 25 years of having our friends die, die, die, die, die, die, die. …” he trailed off. “How will people take me, like with me crying then?”

Later in the evening, Jean Taylor, 73, a writer and activist since the 1970s, took in the night air on a bench outside the hall, watching busy Swanston Street with her companion, Ardy Tibby, 76. Ms. Taylor said she thought that lesbians would always be “cautious” about coming out but that they needed to “be a little brave” and not “buy into the assumption that all nursing homes are unsafe.”

Ms. Taylor, a self-labeled “housewife and mother of two turned radical lesbian feminist,” said the ball was a nice celebration, but she voiced disappointment that much of the local lesbian-feminist history had been “lost.”

“People don’t even know or care enough to find out what we did,” she said.

After the dinner plates were cleared, Mr. Meecham addressed the crowd.

“To the L.G.B.T.I. elders who have led the way, who have shaped our community, who have fought for my right to wear these six-inch heels and gold nail polish: To you, I say thank you. I bow down to you.”

Mr. Meecham then leapt off the stage with the microphone and pulled guests out of their seats one by one, inviting them to share their stories.

“I always say that closets are for clothes and mothballs, and that’s it,” said Gordon Wilson, a gay man in his 80s.

As “I Wanna Dance With Somebody” played, two silver-haired women began a simple waltz. One stood tall and straight, elbows pointed outward, face fixed into a formal expression. They spun in a half circle one way, then another. Her companion leaned into the chest of her partner and smiled, allowing herself to be swept around the fringes of the dance floor.","For Older Gays Who Might Re-enter the Closet, a Ball Invites Them Out",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/world/australia/lgbt-ball-melbourne.html

If voters really hated ties to Wall Street and financial elites, Republicans would not enjoy such a commanding electoral position — or have elected a New York plutocrat president. Most voters’ major problems with President Trump stem from his performance, not from his wealth or connections to Wall Street.

A second reason Democrats should keep ties with Wall Street: Despite what the Democratic left says, America is a center-right, pro-capitalist nation. A January Gallup poll found that moderates and conservatives make up almost 70 percent of the country, while only 25 percent of voters identify as liberal. Even in May 2016, when Senator Sanders made redistribution a central part of his platform, Gallup found that only about 35 percent of Americans had a positive image of socialism, compared with 60 percent with a positive view of capitalism.

Third, it is hypocritical for Democrats to maintain ties to Silicon Valley and then turn their backs on the very people who help finance its work. The financial industry brings to market the world’s most innovate products and platforms that expand the economy and create jobs.

Fourth, demonizing Wall Street does nothing to bridge the widening gaps in our country. Wall Street has its flaws and abuses, which were addressed in part by the Dodd-Frank financial reform law. And yes, the American people are certainly hostile to and suspicious of Wall Street. But using this suspicion and hostility as the organizing principle for a major political party will consign Democrats to permanent minority status.

Here’s what the Democrats need to do instead: develop a set of pro-growth, inclusive economic policies. Democratic leaders must prioritize entrepreneurship, small-business growth and the expansion of job-training and retraining programs.

American leadership in finance will make it possible for our country to invest as much as $1 trillion in infrastructure, extend health care access to every American at an affordable rate and lift the 76 million Americans who are barely surviving financially, as reported in May 2016 by the Federal Reserve, into the middle class.

The Democrats need to partner with the financial community on these issues. Most important, the Democrats have simply had an ineffective, negative and coercive economic message. Advocacy of a $15 minimum wage and further banking regulation does not constitute a positive, proactive agenda.

The Democrats cannot be the party that supports only new, stifling regulations. Reducing regulation allows banks to employ capital and finance investment in our country’s future, making electric cars, renewable energy and internet connectivity across the globe a reality.

This was evident to Democrats in the 1990s. From 1996 to 2000, for example, Democrats led the way on two key economic legislative victories. First, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 deregulated the communications and cable industries, increased growth and enhanced market competition. Second, the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 removed regulations placed on financial institutions by bureaucrats and expanded opportunities for Wall Street to engage in mergers and acquisitions, adding wealth to the retirement accounts and other investment portfolios of millions of middle-class Americans.

If the party is going to have any chance of returning to its position of influence and appeal, Democrats need to work with Wall Street to push policies that create jobs, heal divisions and stimulate the American economy.",Why Democrats Need Wall Street,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/opinion/why-democrats-need-wall-street.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Unity, ‘Derailed’

President Trump’s attempt to show camaraderie with Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, might have backfired on Monday: He spent most of a 45-minute news conference in long-winded exchanges with reporters, while Mr. McConnell looked on awkwardly.

On “The Daily Show,” broadcasting this week from Chicago, Trevor Noah said he was surprised Republicans hadn’t begun to prevent Mr. Trump from public speaking altogether.

“This day was supposed to be about showing off unity. Instead the Trump train derailed what was supposed to be a simple photo opportunity.

Hosts Take Shots at Hosts

David Letterman, who will receive a Mark Twain Prize on Sunday, sat down with Jimmy Kimmel to talk about — what else — hosting late-night TV. They took a few good-natured shots at other hosts: Mr. Letterman talked through his decision to send Conan O’Brien a horse as a gag gift, which he regrets, and he hinted at who his least-favorite late-night host is.

Jefferies Attacks Weinstein, and Critiques Himself

On the weekly “Jim Jefferies Show,” the host took aim at Harvey Weinstein.

“Of course the employees knew. For Christmas, the Weinstein Company gave out gift baskets with a whistle, a Taser and pepper spray — and some delicious macadamia nuts, so something for everyone.” — JIM JEFFERIES

I used it to explore a neighborhood where I used to be a local (Astoria, Queens) to see if it could deliver. The fact that it included a wide assortment of suggestions in a borough not named Manhattan was impressive enough, compared to the other apps I tested, but the recommendations themselves were also spot on.

For example, Astoria’s popular Bohemian Hall and Beer Garden was rightfully featured, but so was SingleCut Brewery, a lesser-known, but worthwhile, beer spot.

The advice for each location is the perfect length — detailed but not overwhelming, and the “Nearby” tab on the map makes it easy to scope out places wherever you are.

Cool Cousin

This app scored points for originality as well as its practicality, and is perfect for travelers who don’t have any cool cousins of their own.

Cool Cousin gives you access to contributors in 40 large cities around the world. Each “cousin” has a profile, with name, age, photo, occupation and a lot more information. The idea is to add those to your network who seem to have similar tastes to your own. After each add, the cousin’s recommendations are added to your map and broken down into eight different categories, such as food, coffee, night life and outdoors.

The app seems geared toward younger travelers — it feels like a cross between Facebook, Tinder and Foursquare — and most of the cousins themselves have an appropriately hipster look. For New York, this leads to a higher concentration of recommendations below 14th Street in Manhattan and several in Brooklyn (very few in Queens), and heavy in the food and night life areas.

But the app itself is easy to figure out, and the map includes the option to download and use offline (for free). No matter where you are, just hit the location arrow to see what’s nearby.

The recommendations themselves are solid and are written casually — think Yelp, minus the negativity. I added 26 of 55 available cousins in New York and was impressed with what was revealed, including free public gardens and lesser-known art galleries, as well as a wide variety of intriguing bars and restaurants.

Your new cousins will even message you through the app to say hello, and you have the option of writing them back to ask for more tips. You will also get a push notification every time you receive a new message, which you can turn off by adjusting your settings. After asking two of my paired cousins, I received additional restaurant recommendations.

Like a Local

Well-designed and easy to navigate, Like a Local has fewer contributors than the other apps (28, providing 197 tips for New York at the time of writing) but it is in more cities than the others (over 300) and best functions as a complementary tool.

The recommendations are detailed yet concise, giving an excellent general overview and a “special tip” for each location. For example, at the Brazilian restaurant Beco in Brooklyn, Kelly advises: “Come early because the restaurant’s seating space is limited. CA$H ONLY.”

You don’t have to sign up to use the app, so you can dig right in and explore — though if you want to use the app offline, you have to pay $1.99 per city.

There’s also an option to “ask locals,” which works like a message board. I asked for Upper East Side restaurant recommendations (it is a neighborhood not represented well on any of the apps) and after a week had yet to get a response.

The recommendations included mainstream spots like St. Patrick’s Cathedral and the Central Park more often than the other apps did.

After Harvey Weinstein was fired on Oct. 8 by his company’s board, which cited “new information about misconduct,” he hired a lawyer, Patricia Glaser, to press a wrongful termination case. It was not immediately clear whether Ms. Glaser would continue to pursue the case. Harvey Weinstein, who owns 23 percent of the company, signed an intricate three-year employment contract in 2015. His team believes that the contract offered at least some insulation from the studio’s code of conduct and that any dismissal must involve arbitration.

Ms. Glaser, who is known for representing clients like Keith Olbermann and Conan O’Brien in contract battles, did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. She attended at least part of the board meeting in person.

Bob Weinstein, who has insisted that he did not know the extent of his brother’s behavior, has been pushing to keep the studio running by renaming it and recruiting women to occupy all of the vacant board seats, according to two people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the conversations were private.

One problem with that plan: Talent agencies have made it clear that many actors, producers and writers have no interest in working either now or in the future for a studio that has become so tainted. A few stars have also expressed concerns about participating in any movie or television project that might enrich Harvey Weinstein, should he remain a part owner.

On Monday, the studio announced that it had reached a preliminary agreement with the investment firm Colony Capital for a cash infusion to stabilize operations. The amount was undisclosed. Several films are still scheduled for release, and production is underway on a cluster of television shows. The studio said the investment was also intended to “provide comfort to our critical distribution, production and talent partners around the world.”

Colony Capital, which rescued Michael Jackson’s Neverland Ranch from foreclosure in 2008, also entered negotiations to buy all or most of the Weinstein Company’s movie and television holdings. Thomas J. Barrack Jr., the founder of Colony Capital, said in a statement on Monday that he believed the sullied studio “has substantial value and growth potential.” A deal is expected to take three weeks or more to complete.","Harvey Weinstein, Fired on Oct. 8, Resigns From Company’s Board",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/business/media/harvey-weinstein-sexual-harassment.html

Then, still true to form, Trump tried to make the claim that he was actually much better at this solemn duty than anyone else, especially Barack Obama.

“If you look at President Obama and other presidents, most of them didn’t make calls, a lot of them didn’t make calls,” he said, absolutely falsely. “I like to call when it’s appropriate, when I think I’m able to do it.”

Trump admitted under further questioning at a news conference in the White House Rose Garden that he didn’t actually know what Barack Obama’s practice was. “I don’t know if he did it,” Trump said. “I was told that he didn’t often.” In fact, Obama frequently made calls, always wrote letters and regularly met with Gold Star families.

Today, in an interview with a Fox radio host, Trump actually dragged in the 2010 battlefield death of Second Lt. Robert Kelly, the son of Trump’s chief of staff, John Kelly. “I mean, you could ask General Kelly did he get a call from Obama,” Trump said.

(By the way, Trump’s endless need to bring up Obama all the time is passing strange. Is this president ever going to become anything than merely the Bizarro Obama?)

The issue here, as Trump likes to say about the playing of the national anthem at football games, is one of respect and honor. In the culture of the military, a job in which the possibility of dying is ever-present, the proper way to treat death is with dignity and respect. And the commander in chief should take personal responsibility.

Ronald Reagan, for example, attended the memorial service for the 241 Marines and other service members killed in the bombing of a barracks in Beirut in 1983.

President George W. Bush tried to hide the casualties of war from the American public by barring the media from Dover Air Force Base when flag-draped coffins returned from Iraq. He did not attend the funerals of the fallen.

Trump, by contrast, sat joking with Sean Hannity at an event in Harrisburg, Pa., last week, while the military color guard was lowering the flag to the playing of “Retreat” — a deeply solemn daily ritual.

“What a nice sound that is,” Trump said. “Are they playing that for you or for me?”

I don’t mean to suggest that Trump is so lacking in basic empathy that he doesn’t care about the war dead. But he is careless, in exactly the way that F. Scott Fitzgerald described two of the main characters in “The Great Gatsby”:

“They were careless people, Tom and Daisy — they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made.”",Trump’s Self-Absorption on War Deaths,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/opinion/columnists/trumps-self-absorption-on-war-deaths.html

The incidence of mouth and throat cancers caused by the human papilloma virus in men has now surpassed the incidence of HPV-related cervical cancers in women, researchers report.

The study, in the Annals of Internal Medicine, found that 11 million men and 3.2 million women in the United States had oral HPV infections. Among them, 7 million men and 1.4 million women had strains that can cause cancers of the throat, tongue and other areas of the head and neck.

The risk of infection was higher for smokers, for people who have had multiple sex partners, and for men who have sex with men. Frequent oral sex also increased the risk. The rate was higher among men who also had genital HPV. (Almost half of men aged 18 to 60 have a genital HPV infection, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.)

Neither age nor income made a difference in high-risk oral infection rates, but rates among non-Hispanic blacks were higher than other races and ethnicities.

HPV vaccination is recommended starting at age 11 or 12 and is effective, said the senior author, Ashish A. Deshmukh, an assistant professor at the University of Florida, and “it’s crucial that parents vaccinate boys as well as girls.”

The lead author, Kalyani Sonawane, also at the University of Florida, said that behavioral change is important, too, particularly smoking cessation. “The difference in oral HPV infection between smokers and nonsmokers is staggering,” she said.",7 Million American Men Carry Cancer-Causing HPV Virus,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/well/live/7-million-american-men-carry-cancer-causing-hpv-virus.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Last year’s ratings were the lowest since Season 3.

Photo

And that was before an off-season in which Mr. Kirkman and several other executive producers sued AMC, charging it with shortchanging them on profits from the show. The complaint follows a similar suit by the other co-creator, Frank Darabont, who was fired during production on Season 2.

So the question going into Season 8 is, are the hiccups simply understandable ebbs within a long-running serial, or the beginning of an aging show’s decline?

The producers and AMC insist that however things look from the outside, everyone involved remains committed to the health of their golden goose. The creators predictably say the next phase of the story is the most exciting yet, and they expect “The Walking Dead” to last another 100 episodes or more.

“We want to keep doing it at least as long as Robert keeps doing it,” Scott M. Gimple, the showrunner, said. “We’re prepared for the long haul.”

Since debuting on Halloween 2010 as a horror curiosity, “The Walking Dead” has become a pop culture institution — earlier this month the series donated a collection of props and costumes to the Smithsonian.

But there’s still plenty of story left to tell. (The events of Season 8 begin in Issue 115 of the comic book; Issue 173 comes out in November.) Charlie Collier, the president of AMC networks, points to recent raucous cast appearances at Comic-Cons and traffic to the Season 8 trailer, which has more than seven million views, as evidence that, for all their kvetching last season, fans remain as engaged as ever.

Another thing in the show’s favor is that it is returning to its roots, creatively, with this season’s “All Out War” arc. A coalition led by the show’s hero Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) will face off against Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and his gang, the Saviors. After testing viewers’ patience by separating fan favorites like Rick, Carol (Melissa McBride) and Daryl (Norman Reedus), the new phase reunites the core group against a colorful villain, a dynamic that animated popular stretches like the Governor and Terminus story lines. And unlike the overhyped arrival of Negan in Season 6, the “All Out War” story line will be resolved within a single season.

“Hopefully the people who said they’d never watch the show again” will come back, Mr. Morgan said. “There are going to be some big payoffs.”

Cast members say viewer criticism of last season was not unexpected. Mr. Gimple warned the show’s stars that the brutal murders of the popular characters Abraham (Michael Cudlitz) and especially Glenn (Steven Yeun) at the hands of Negan would be controversial, said Danai Gurira, who plays the katana-wielding warrior Michonne.

While the fan outrage and dipping ratings received plenty of coverage, that didn’t translate into more pressure during shooting for the new season. “It was not felt on the set at all,” Ms. Gurira said. (The production did, however, endure a tragedy: John Bernecker, a stuntman on the show, died after an accident on the set in July. The premiere episode honors him in the credits.)

Viewing numbers for “The Walking Dead” peaked in Season 5, with an average of 13.3 million viewers in the key 18-49 demographic advertisers covet tuning in each week (20.1 million total), according to Nielsen. By Season 7, that had fallen to 10.3 million in the demo, a decline of roughly 23 percent in the key cohort. (Over all the show drew an average of 16.4 million total viewers, or roughly 18 percent fewer than in Season 5.)

Though “The Walking Dead” still nearly doubled its closest competitors last season among viewers aged 18-49, media analysts, some of whom downgraded AMC Networks stock in response to last season’s “The Walking Dead” numbers, will be watching Season 8 closely for signs of further slippage, said Michael Nathanson of the research firm MoffettNathanson.

“They really have to come out of the gate strong,” said Mr. Nathanson, whose company downgraded AMC in December. (For the record, the stock is up about 7 percent since then.) “Ratings still matter — it’s a driver of ad revenues.”

Mr. Collier, the AMC president, said the falloff in traditional viewing had been offset by increases online. But digital revenue streams are generally not as lucrative as conventional TV ads.

He’s similarly sanguine, at least publicly, about the hiatus’s other big story: The litigation begun by Mr. Kirkman, Gale Ann Hurd and other series producers, which claims that AMC has denied them what could amount to hundreds of millions of dollars by manipulating the show’s reported profits. In a statement, AMC called the suit “baseless and predictably opportunistic,” but both sides have pledged to continue working together to keep “The Walking Dead” and its ancillary properties as successful as possible.

“This is a drama that has continued to reinvent itself and remain relevant, and I think that can happen for a long, long time,” Mr. Collier said.

How long exactly? The smart bet is some version of “as long as it wants to,” and possibly longer.

AMC now thinks of “The Walking Dead” as “not just a show, but really as an incredible piece of content that we engage fans with not just for the 16-week season, but for the remainder of the year,” Mr. Collier said.

Besides “Fear the Walking Dead” — which will have a crossover subplot with the original show, Mr. Kirkman announced at New York Comic-Con — there are the highly rated postshow “Talking Dead,” video games and conventions. AMC just created a fan rewards program that will award points for interacting with the “Walking Dead” universe — watching episodes, posting on social media, creating fan fiction — and will soon debut a quarterly merchandise box subscription, a sort of Trunk Club for “Dead” heads.

As for the show itself, it has officially been renewed only for Season 8. But there are signs that the writers are looking far beyond the current time frame. A moment in the trailer seemed to depict Rick as a much older man, though no one involved will elaborate on whether the scene was a time-shift, a dream sequence or some other storytelling device.

All things considered, the only things that might eventually slow the march of the “The Walking Dead” are the human physiques of the grueling show’s increasingly middle-aged stars.

“I still have a little bendiness left in my body, but it does get harder,” Mr. Lincoln, 44, said with a laugh. “There comes a point, when you’re rolling around in the dirt covered in zombie blood with a fellow middle-aged man, that you think, is there any dignity left in this?”

“I’m excited about this season — we get to get the band back together,” he added, more seriously. “I’m hoping the audience is going to feel the same way.”","‘The Walking Dead’ at 100: Still a Hit, but for How Much Longer?",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/arts/television/the-walking-dead-season-season-8.html

The Indonesian slaughter took place at a time when Southeast Asia, still emerging from colonialism, was energized by socialist ideology.

The United States already had boots on the ground in Vietnam. Indonesia, then led by President Sukarno and home to one of the world’s largest Communist parties, was seen by Washington as the next domino that could fall.

When a group of hard-line generals blamed Communist Party operatives for a failed coup attempt in 1965, with China accused as a mastermind, Washington did little to challenge that narrative.

The United States government largely stayed silent as the death toll mounted at the hands of the Indonesian Army, paramilitaries and religious mobs. The extrajudicial killings spread beyond suspected Communists to target ethnic Chinese, students, union members and anyone who might have personal feuds with the hit men. Tens of thousands of others were thrown into tropical gulags.

Eventually, President Sukarno, with his anti-American talk and socialist sympathies, was replaced by Suharto, a general who held power for 32 years, instituting a policy he called the New Order to reinvigorate the economy through foreign aid and investment.

Another of the newly released cables shows how the American Embassy in Jakarta made clear that any aid from the United States was contingent on Sukarno’s being removed from power. Upon Suharto’s ascension in March 1966, that American aid began to flow.

In some of the cables, American diplomats exulted in the abrupt political transition, even as they noted the rising body count. One file refers to the political changes as a “fantastic switch.”

The Indonesian military, which still wields considerable power today, has tried to blame the orgy of violence on a public furious with the excesses of the Communist Party, absolving itself of direct culpability.

But the cables indicate how members of the American foreign service, at least, held the military directly responsible for some of the deaths. One cable alleges that Suharto gave the orders for certain mass executions.

In 2015, Senator Tom Udall of New Mexico reintroduced a resolution in the Senate calling for Indonesia to face up to its traumatic history. He also held the United States to account for its “military and financial support” there, which included providing lists of possible leftist sympathizers to the Indonesian government and, as one cable released Tuesday showed, pushing to bury foreign news coverage of the killings.

The legacy of the massacre continues to divide Indonesia. For decades, under Suharto’s rule, Indonesians dared not call for justice. Even after he was deposed in 1998, there was little effort to set up an Indonesian form of a truth and reconciliation commission.

But in part after the filmmaker Joshua Oppenheimer released a documentary in 2012 called “The Act of Killing,” chronicling the life of an unrepentant hit man in the purge, members of Indonesian society began to delve into its history.

Joko Widodo, the Indonesian president, has talked about the need to address past human rights violations.

Still, there are limits to how far Indonesia is willing to go. Nursyahbani Katjasungkana, a human rights lawyer, helped convene an international people’s tribunal on the killings at The Hague in 2015. (The court had no real authority beyond an airing of testimony, but it held the Indonesian government responsible for crimes against humanity and accused the United States, Britain and Australia of complicity.)

But in recent months, conservative groups have rekindled anti-Communist sensibilities in Indonesia. Efforts last month to organize screenings of Mr. Oppenheimer’s second documentary, “The Look of Silence,” were restricted by a military directive. A mob gathered around a building where Ms. Katjasungkana and others were believed to be gathering to talk about the violence.

“I just hope these new documents will encourage the Indonesian government to be more open and stop the state denial that the military was involved in these atrocities,” she said. “Hopefully, America will also admit its involvement.”

Jusuf Wanandi is a Chinese-Indonesian who supported Suharto for decades, even if he grew disillusioned with his strongman-like leadership. Unlike many of Suharto’s former acolytes, Mr. Wanandi admits that the events of 1965-66 spiraled out of control.

Yet even he advised patience.

“It is impossible to move forward because emotions are still raw,” Mr. Wanandi said. “We need some more time.”","U.S. Stood by as Indonesia Killed a Half-Million People, Papers Show",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/world/asia/indonesia-cables-communist-massacres.html

In another one-man tour de force, in 1980, Mr. Dotrice starred in Herbert Mitgang’s “Mister Lincoln” at Ford’s Theater in Washington, where Lincoln was slain in 1865, and later on Broadway and on PBS. He had immersed himself for months in Lincoln’s life, and colleagues said his renderings of Lincoln, and especially of the Gettysburg Address, were performances of remarkable subtlety and power. Mr. Mitgang, who wrote the play, was the author of two biographies of Lincoln. He also wrote for The New York Times.

“The role of Lincoln is probably one of the hardest to play of any historical character,” Frankie Hewitt, the play’s executive producer, told The Times. “If you try to humanize him, it can get corny and awkward, and if you try to play him larger than life, he is turned into a Disney World mechanical Lincoln. But Roy is such a superb actor, he succeeds where everyone else has basically failed.”

Roy Louis Dotrice was born on the Island of Guernsey, a British dependency off the French coast, on May 26, 1923, to Louis Dotrice, a Belgian pastry chef, and the former Neva Wilton, an English baker. In 1940, when Nazi troops occupied Guernsey, Roy and his mother escaped to Britain, where he joined the Royal Air Force and became a radio operator and gunner in a bomber.

On a raid in 1942, his plane was shot down over the Baltic. He and a few other survivors floated in a dinghy for days and were washed ashore. They were captured and spent the rest of the war as prisoners in Germany. To keep captive spirits up in the stalag, the prisoners staged makeshift plays. Mr. Dotrice’s first role was the Fairy Godmother in “Cinderella.”

“We didn’t have any real women, unfortunately,” he said.

After the war, he rejected a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and plunged into acting. For 12 years he performed in, and sometimes directed, hundreds of plays in repertory companies, often a new production every week, in a thespian grind of lines, characters, plots and venues: Liverpool, Manchester and, he said, “every dreary North Country town.”

In 1947, he married Katherine Newman, an actress. They had three daughters, Michele, Yvette and Karen, who all became actresses. His wife died in 2007. His daughters survive him, as do seven grandchildren and a great-grandson, The A.P. reported.

In 1957, Mr. Dotrice joined the forerunner of the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford-upon-Avon, and for nine years he appeared as Hamlet, Iago, Falstaff, Julius Caesar and other Shakespearean characters with casts that included future luminaries of the British theater, including Charles Laughton and Albert Finney.

While he kept a home in London, Mr. Dotrice lived in Los Angeles and worked mostly in the United States after 1980. He appeared in New York stage productions of Ibsen’s “An Enemy of the People” (1985) and Harold Pinter’s “The Homecoming” (1991). On film, he portrayed Mozart’s father in Milos Forman’s “Amadeus” (1984) and a skating coach in Paul M. Glaser’s “The Cutting Edge” (1992).

On television, he played Charles Dickens in Masterpiece Theater’s 13-part “Dickens of London” (1976); a British monarch in the mini-series “Shaka Zulu” (1986); the father of the beast on the CBS crime series “Beauty and the Beast” (1987-90); and a priest on the CBS dramatic series “Picket Fences” (1993-96). In recent years he recorded many audiobooks, creating voices for hundreds of characters in the saga adapted for “Game of Thrones.”

Looking back on his career in an interview in 1980, Mr. Dotrice recalled one of his more unusual achievements: introducing baseball — learned from Canadian P.O.W.s during the war — to cricket-playing members of his Shakespeare troupe in 1959. He put together an “all-star” team to challenge Americans at a nearby air base.

“Paul Robeson played first base, Sam Wanamaker second and Laurence Olivier third,” he said. “Peter O’Toole was shortstop, Albert Finney was catcher, I pitched and Charles Laughton was umpire. We wore black tights and white Hamlet blouses.

MARKET OVERVIEW

Greater Melbourne, which has about 4.49 million residents, has seen a surge in home prices over the past few years, largely due to rapid population growth, Mr. Armstrong said. While apartments are plentiful, houses are in high demand.

“We have a noticeable undersupply of good, quality housing,” he said. “Anything with any quality to it sees a lot of competition, particularly in the inner eastern suburbs.”

Melbourne’s home prices jumped 15.1 percent year-over-year in June 2017, to a median price of 865,712 Australian dollars, or about $683,912, according to the property marketing group Domain. The median apartment price was 474,848 Australian dollars, or about $375,130.

Other factors affecting the housing market in Melbourne, which is the capital of Victoria state, are low interest rates, low unemployment and a strengthening economy, said Tim Derham, a director, agent and auctioneer with Abercromby’s Real Estate.

In Toorak, an upscale neighborhood that is often a first stop for foreign home buyers, the median house price is 4,725,000 Australian dollars, or about $3.73 million, Mr. Derham said. Other suburbs popular with foreign buyers include Box Hill and Mount Waverley, he said.

While home prices have grown in a robust way since about 2010, that type of growth may be unrealistic for the future, and price growth will likely level off, Mr. Armstrong said.

WHO BUYS IN MELBOURNE

Melbourne gets many foreign buyers, particularly for homes over 5 million Australian dollars, or about $3.95 million, brokers said.

Buyers from mainland China have been the largest group by far in recent years, Mr. Armstrong said, but the tide has stemmed a bit as the Chinese government has put limits on capital outflows. Besides the Chinese, those from countries like Singapore and Malaysia also buy homes in large numbers, he said. Buyers from Europe and North America are less common.

BUYING BASICS

Foreigners generally must have either residency status or a visa to buy property in Australia, and they must apply to the Federal Investment Review Board to obtain approval. The process takes about 30 days, and the fee is dependent on the type of property and the price, Mr. Armstrong said.

Identify your values before donating

When considering how to give, it’s helpful to start by asking what motivates you.

“You pick the issue with your heart and you pick the organization with your head,” said Jacob Harold, the chief executive of GuideStar, a nonprofit that publishes information about charities in an effort to promote transparency.

People with ties to a region may want to give locally. Animal lovers may want to give to a shelter. Others may want their money directed to certain groups of people, like children, or causes, like public health.

Many opt to leave the decision to the charities themselves, which is sometimes best: “If you’re trusting them with your money, you should trust them to spend it well,” Mr. Harold said.

Decide how to spend your time

Your time is a resource, too, and you should decide how you want to spend it.

Some people prefer to deeply research the charities they support, while others simply want to know they’re giving to a trustworthy group.

For those who prefer the latter, Mr. Harold recommends groups like Global Giving, which collects donations and redistributes the funds to vetted, locally focused organizations.

Do your research before you give

Evaluating a charity is often the most daunting part of donating, but it doesn’t have to be.

In addition to GuideStar and Charity Navigator, the Better Business Bureau’s Wise Giving Alliance and Charity Watch offer helpful resources.

Tax filings and other documents can shed light on a group’s operations, but donors should look beyond the numbers, too, experts said. That includes reviewing an organization’s website, annual report, governing board and mission.

“If the organization is only talking about the problem, but not talking about how the work they do leads to solutions to that problem, that is a red flag,” Mr. Harold said.

Ask questions about the charity, including how much experience it has in disaster relief, how long it’s been around, how it measures accomplishments, and how others in the field talk about it.

He also said that too much focus is often placed on overhead, a measure of administrative and fund-raising costs. While it can signal inefficient spending or, worse, fraud, some overhead is necessary to support a nonprofit’s long-term viability.

Cash is often the best way to help

It may feel impersonal, but money is often the most useful form of donation. Unlike goods, financial gifts have no associated transportation costs.

A $20 pair of jeans, for example, would cost about $165 to ship from Washington, D.C., to the capital of Honduras, according to an online calculator developed by the University of Rhode Island. That money could instead be used locally to buy 24 blankets, nearly 33,000 liters of water or a variety of other supplies, according to the calculator.

There are secondary benefits, too: With cash, relief organizations can support local economies, according to the Center for International Disaster Information, which was created by the United States Agency for International Development.

Follow up later. Recovery takes a long time.

Donations surge in the immediate aftermath of disasters, but recoveries unfold over a much longer timeline.

For that reason, donors should consider sustained involvement with charities, whether that involves checking up on how resources were spent and how needs have changed weeks or months down the line or making automatic monthly contributions.

When he testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee in June, Mr. Sessions had refused to answer several questions about his conversations with Mr. Trump regarding the Russia investigation and the president’s firing of James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director. Mr. Sessions told lawmakers that it would be “inappropriate” to detail those discussions because those matters were potentially covered by executive privilege.

The move angered Democrats because Mr. Trump had not invoked the privilege. Last week, all nine Democrats on the committee sent Mr. Sessions a letter saying they either wanted him to answer questions that he refused to answer in June, or that they expected Mr. Trump to formally invoke the privilege to keep those matters secret.

“With respect to potential assertions of executive privilege on behalf of the president, we wish to put you on notice that any reasonable period of abeyance on many of the issues about which you will be asked has long elapsed,” they wrote.

For a time, Mr. Trump regularly denigrated Mr. Sessions in an apparent effort to get him to step aside so he could appoint a new attorney general who would not be recused from matters related to the 2016 election and could seize control of the Russia investigation.

Democrats will seek assurances that Mr. Sessions is providing resources and protection for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, to continue his work undisturbed.

Sessions says the special counsel has not interviewed him

In a testy exchange, Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, pressed Mr. Sessions to say whether he had been interviewed by Mr. Mueller, who is investigating possible links between Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and the Trump campaign, as well as whether Mr. Trump committed obstruction of justice by firing the former F.B.I. director, James B. Comey.

Mr. Sessions responded by telling the senator that he would have to ask Mr. Mueller, prompting Mr. Leahy to growl: “I’m asking you.” Mr. Sessions eventually answered “no,” and when Mr. Leahy pressed him further, he reiterated, “The answer’s no.”

Mr. Sessions also pushed back against Mr. Leahy, who accused Mr. Sessions of misleading Congress when he said during his confirmation process that he did not have contacts with Russians during the 2016 campaign. In fact, Mr. Sessions met several times with the Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak.

Mr. Sessions said that he had interpreted questions about contacts, based on their context, as being about campaign-related conversations. He also asserted that he never had “a meeting with any Russian officials to discuss any kind of coordinating campaign efforts.”

Sessions will not say whether Trump talked to him about the Russia investigation

Mr. Sessions did not shed new light on his role in Mr. Trump’s abrupt firing of Mr. Comey, again invoking the president’s right to private conversations when pressed by Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the committee’s top Democrat.

Instead, Mr. Sessions reiterated that Mr. Trump had asked earlier that both he and Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, make a recommendation about Mr. Comey’s future in writing. He said they had objected to how Mr. Comey had run the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s handling of classified information while secretary of state. Mr. Comey ultimately recommended she not be charged but harshly criticized her behavior, calling her “extremely careless.”

“I don’t think it’s been fully understood the significance of the error Mr. Comey made on the Clinton matter,” Mr. Sessions said. And after Mr. Comey told lawmakers during a hearing that he felt the matter was properly handled and that he would act in the same way again, Mr. Sessions said, it was clear to him that the F.B.I. needed a “fresh start.”

Mr. Sessions said he could neither confirm nor deny that Mr. Trump had raised concerns to him about the Justice Department’s investigation into Russia’s election interference when discussing Mr. Comey.

“That calls for a communication that I have had with the president and I believe it remains confidential,” Mr. Sessions said.

Trump administration opposes warrant requirement to search emails collected by a surveillance program

The law that forms the basis for the government’s warrantless surveillance program, Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act, is set to expire at the end of the year unless Congress extends it. Under questioning from the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, Mr. Sessions emphasized that the Trump administration continued to oppose the primary change proposed to the law: requiring the F.B.I. to get a warrant to search the repository of emails intercepted under that program for something involving an American criminal suspect.

“Mr. Chairman, it is not legally required, in my opinion, to have a warrant requirement,” Mr. Sessions said, noting that the targets of the surveillance under the program were people abroad, who are not protected by the Constitution. “I don’t not believe that we could carry out the responsibilities that we are expected to do with a warrant requirement for any of the 702 type material.”

Mr. Grassley’s counterpart in the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. Bob Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia, has sponsored a bill, the USA Liberty Act, that would impose a warrant requirement for F.B.I. agents, working on ordinary criminal cases, to search for and use Americans’ emails collected without a warrant.

The Justice Department has sharply changed course on civil rights enforcement

Mr. Sessions is also likely to face questions, at least from Democrats, about how the federal government on his watch has curtailed the Obama-era approach to enforcing anti-discrimination laws, especially protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.

On Oct. 6, for example, Mr. Sessions issued sweeping guidance to federal agencies and prosecutors, instructing them to take the position in court that people and organizations may claim broad exemptions from nondiscrimination laws on the basis of religious objections. Critics said the guidance would open the door to justifying a wide range of acts of discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.

A day earlier, the Justice Department reversed the federal government’s stance on whether the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bans workplace discrimination on the basis of sex, provides protections for transgender people. Mr. Sessions issued a memo to the department instructing officials to take the position in court that the act does not bar acts of workplace bias against people based on their gender identity.

In July, the Justice Department, without being asked for its opinion, filed a brief before an appellate court in a private workplace discrimination lawsuit, taking the position that the Civil Rights Act’s ban on sex bias does not cover sexual orientation. By contrast, the Obama-era department tried to avoid taking a position on that question, while welcoming the prospect that the law might continue to evolve in that area.

Sessions defends hard-line approach to immigration

Mr. Sessions, the face of the administration’s tough posture toward immigration enforcement, defended the legal basis for its decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA, saying that the department had determined the program as implemented has not been legally justified.

“The Department of Justice cannot just wipe out whole sections of the American law and just say we will not enforce it after Congress has passed such a law,” Mr. Sessions said of the Obama-era program. It permitted people who grew up in the United States after being brought illegally to the country as children to stay and lawfully work.

Mr. Sessions said he could not discuss whether he had had conversations with the attorney general of Texas, Ken Paxton, a Republican, or other Republican attorneys general who had threatened to sue before the administration said it would end the program.

Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois and a longtime advocate for the young immigrants, known as dreamers, was not pleased and cited Mr. Sessions’s previous role as a senator on the committee and frustration with witnesses who were not as forthcoming as he would have liked.

“This would have been just about the moment when Senator Sessions of Alabama would have blown up,” he said.

Created and directed by Nabil Al-Raee and Zoe Lafferty, this study of soldiers waiting out the standoff with diminishing supplies and stamina takes a more naturalistic and overtly didactic approach than “Burning Doors.” The characters here include a scene-bridging tour guide, who reminds us of the sacredness of the setting — summoned in crepuscular stateliness by Andy Purves (lighting) and Anna Gisle (set).

But most of the play is devoted to conversation among six soldiers, who debate the existential toll of resistance and the historical value of martyrdom in dialogue that emphasizes exposition and theme over individual character. Despite the intrinsic suspense of the setup and the likability of the performers, “The Siege” often registers as sincere but static, like an animated chapter from a partisan history book.

The astonishment of “Burning Doors” — conceived and staged by the troupe founders and artistic directors (in exile), Nikolai Khalezin and Natalia Koliada — is its ability to translate political rage and impotence into an art of indirection that is often as complex as it is powerful. This is no trumpeting call to arms, or not only that, but an open-ended portrait of both the sociology and psychology of the artist as rebel in Eastern Europe.

At the production’s center are three specific artists of the 21st century: Ms. Alyokhina of Pussy Riot; the Russian political performance artist Petr Pavlensky, whose widely reported acts of civil disobedience have included nailing his scrotum to Red Square; and the Ukranian filmmaker Oleg Sentsov, who is in jail in Russia for alleged acts of terrorism.

Ms. Alyokhina — whose book “Riot Days,” published in English this year, is in part a memoir of incarceration — is here to testify on her own behalf. She becomes a participant in the ensemble’s impressionistic re-creations of an outcast childhood, a brutalizing stint in prison (in which cavity searches were common events) and the bewildering early days of freedom.

She even appears in a drolly self-conscious question-and-answer session, in English, with the audience. (The questions on the night I saw the show included, “What do we do about Trump?” Her answer, delivered tentatively and almost shyly: “I would resist. But it’s you, not me,” who must make the decision.)

The words of Mr. Pavlensky and Mr. Sentsov, who have been highly articulate in state psychiatric exams and court statements and testimony, are spoken — and projected — here as well. (Most of the performance is in Russian and Belarusian, with English supertitles.)

As for the opposition, it is given comic voice by two actors, embodying Russian fat cat apparatchiks (Pavel Haradnitski and Andrei Urazau), who discuss how to deal with the incomprehensible behavior of subversive artists while sitting, face to face, on toilets. (That scene has a triumphant visual punch line, involving women dressed in signature Pussy Riot balaclavas, wielding flashlights and rolls of toilet paper.)

The production also summons the lyricism under duress of the French poet Paul Éluard (whose “Liberty,” a totemic work for the French Resistance during World War II, is recited by Maryia Sazonava in a noose and harness, suspended agonizingly above the stage); and the ruminations of Michel Foucault (delivered by Maryna Yurevich as a circus ringmaster-cum-judge) on subjugation and punishment.

The twisted human forms of the art of Egon Schiele are conjured in haunting ballets of what might be called defensive masochism. The performers coil their bodies increasingly inward, as if to squeeze their own flesh into invisibility.

The punishment of one’s own flesh is notoriously the specialty of Mr. Pavlensky, whose performance pieces of protest include — in addition to the scrotum nailing — setting fire to the doors of the Russian Federal Security Service building, sewing his lips together and wrapping his body in barbed wire.

“Burning Doors,” which has been designed as a sort of prison cell of the mind by Mr. Khalezin, makes the subliminal case that such painful activities are of a piece with a longstanding, specifically Russian sensibility. In the 19th century, Dostoyevsky wrote about the phenomenon of self-laceration, as both a physical and spiritual form of torment, a naturally unnatural response to the divisive absurdities of self and society.

Two of this production’s most haunting vignettes are set to Dostoyevsky’s words. A naked performer slowly dresses himself while reciting Prince Myshkin’s account from “The Idiot” of a man awaiting his execution, counting down what he believes to be the final moments of his life.

The actor here, Kyril Masheka, is steeped in a raw, empathic fear and sorrow that make putting on clothes a fraught and irrelevant-seeming business. And in a scene from “The Brothers Karamazov,” a dialectic debate on viciousness and goodness between Ivan and Alyosha (Mr. Haradnitski and Mr. Urazau) becomes a furniture-upending wrestling match.

Philosophical issues of immortal import assume a mortal — and moral — urgency. And Dostoyevsky’s questions about persisting, and resisting, in the face of institutionalized inhumanity glow with an infectious fever.

SUNDAY PUZZLE — We’re doing some heavy lifting today, so make sure you do some warm-ups. John Guzzetta and Michael Hawkins are back and are asking us to help them move.

Today’s Theme

What we are moving are the Ys at the end of the first word of each of the theme entries, like the original phrase GRAVY TRAIN at 23A. The Ys (or their sound) move to the end of the second word of each theme phrase and are then pluralized to make an entirely different phrase, which is clued in a punny way. That changes the phrase to GRAVE TRAINEES, clued as “Interns at a cemetery?”

Please remember to lift with your knees and set the Ys down gently.

Similarly, the phrase JUICY PARTS (15D) is changed to JUICE PARTIES, which are “Social gatherings where fruit drinks are served?”

In nontheme news, there’s some really nice fill in Mr. Guzzetta’s and Mr. Hawkins’s grid. I liked NOSE JOB, POWER NAP, SO MEAN, MAIN MAN, SOUR MASH, EASY NOW, AWAY GAME, CHEEZIT, EVEN STEVEN, STONE TOOL, MEDIA STORM and TOY GUN.

A lot of our thinking is for bonding, not truth-seeking, so most of us are quite willing to think or say anything that will help us be liked by our group. We’re quite willing to disparage anyone when, as Marilynne Robinson once put it, “the reward is the pleasure of sharing an attitude one knows is socially approved.” And when we don’t really know a subject well enough, in T. S. Eliot’s words, “we tend always to substitute emotions for thoughts,” and go with whatever idea makes us feel popular.

This is where Alan Jacobs’s absolutely splendid forthcoming book “How to Think” comes in. If Thaler’s work is essential for understanding how the market can go astray, Jacobs’s emphasis on the relational nature of thinking is essential for understanding why there is so much bad thinking in political life right now.

Jacobs makes good use of C. S. Lewis’s concept of the Inner Ring. In every setting — a school, a company or a society — there is an official hierarchy. But there may also be a separate prestige hierarchy, where the cool kids are. They are the Inner Ring.

There are always going to be people who desperately want to get into the Inner Ring and will cut all sorts of intellectual corners to be accepted. As Lewis put it, “The passion for the Inner Ring is most skillful in making a man who is not yet a very bad man do very bad things.”

People will, for example, identify and attack what Jacobs calls the Repugnant Cultural Other — the group that is opposed to the Inner Ring, which must be assaulted to establish membership in it.

Other people will resent the Inner Ring, and they will cut all sorts of intellectual corners in order to show their resentment. These people are quick to use combat metaphors when they talk about thinking (he shot down my argument, your claims are indefensible). These people will adopt shared vague slurs like “cuckservative” or “whitesplaining” that signal to the others in the outsider groups that they are attacking the ring, even though these slurs are usually impediments to thought.

Jacobs notices that when somebody uses “in other words” to summarize another’s argument, what follows is almost invariably a ridiculous caricature of that argument, in order to win favor with the team. David Foster Wallace once called such people Snoots. Their motto is, “We Are the Few, the Proud, the More or Less Constantly Appalled at Everyone Else.”

Jacobs nicely shows how our thinking processes emerge from emotional life and moral character. If your heart and soul are twisted, your response to the world will be, too. He argues that by diagnosing our own ills, we can begin to combat them. And certainly I can think of individual beacons of intellectual honesty today: George Packer, Tyler Cowen, Scott Alexander and Caitlin Flanagan, among many.

But I’d say that if social life can get us into trouble, social life can get us out. After all, think of how you really persuade people. Do you do it by writing thoughtful essays that carefully marshal facts? That works some of the time. But the real way to persuade people is to create an attractive community that people want to join. If you do that, they’ll bend their opinions to yours. If you want people to be reasonable, create groups where it’s cool to be reasonable.

Jacobs mentions that at the Yale Political Union members are admired if they can point to a time when a debate totally changed their mind on something. That means they take evidence seriously; that means they can enter into another’s mind-set. It means they treat debate as a learning exercise and not just as a means to victory.

How many public institutions celebrate these virtues? The U.S. Senate? Most TV talk shows? Even the universities?

Intel said its intent “was to convey the performance capabilities of our processors through the visual metaphor of a sprinter,” but acknowledged, “Unfortunately, our execution did not deliver our intended message and in fact proved to be insensitive and insulting.”

Dove, May 2011

In 2011, Dove was criticized for another ad: this one showing three women standing side by side, each with lighter skin than the woman next to her. Behind them were signs reading “before” and “after”; the “before” sign, positioned behind an African-American woman, showed cracked skin, while the “after” sign, behind a white woman, showed smooth skin.

“Visibly more beautiful skin,” the ad read.

Edelman, the public relations company representing Dove, said in a statement to Gawker: “All three women are intended to demonstrate the ‘after’ product benefit. We do not condone any activity or imagery that intentionally insults any audience.”

The fact that the most recent ad was Dove’s second to cause offense was not lost on social media users.

Popchips, May 2012

Popchips drew fire in 2012 for an ad in which Ashton Kutcher played several characters — including a Bollywood producer named Raj, complete with brownface and an Indian accent.

Popchips initially urged viewers to watch the ad in the humorous “spirit it was intended.” Later, its chief executive, Keith Belling, said in a statement: “Our team worked hard to create a lighthearted parody featuring a variety of characters that was meant to provide a few laughs. We did not intend to offend anyone. I take full responsibility and apologize to anyone we offended.”

Qiaobi, May 2016

In a 2016 commercial for the Chinese company Qiaobi’s laundry detergent, an Asian woman shoves a detergent pod into a black man’s mouth and puts him in a washing machine, from which he emerges as a light-skinned Asian.

A spokeswoman for Qiaobi, Xu Chunyan, was unapologetic. “We did this for some sensational effect,” she said at the time. “If we just show laundry like all the other advertisements, ours will not stand out.”

Nivea, April 2017

In April, the skin care company Nivea released a deodorant ad that read, “White is purity.” White supremacists on the internet took note, with one 4chan user writing, “Nivea has chosen our side.”

A representative of Nivea’s parent company, Beiersdorf, said it had “never intended to hurt anybody or to raise any wrong interpretation.”

But, like Dove, Nivea had offended before.

Six years earlier, after apologizing for an ad that showed a black man preparing to throw away his old Afro-wearing head behind the words “Re-civilize yourself,” it promised to review “current development and approval processes” in order to “avoid any kind of future misleading interpretations.”",Dove Drops an Ad Accused of Racism,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/08/business/dove-ad-racist.html

Sondheim: Well, I collaborate with people. My spark often comes from collaborators. You know, I go to John Weidman1 and say, “Let’s write something else, you got any ideas?” Whatever it is. I mean, I’m a collaborative animal.

Miranda: I’m the same way, except my collaborator is Tommy Kail2.

Sondheim: I need the spur. And the spur and the boost comes from somebody else, generally. Rarely, only in the case of “Sweeney”3 did I come across something myself and think, “Oooh.” Oh, no, and “Passion.”4 Those are the two.

Miranda: And “Sweeney” was the one where you were working from the original text and said, “I need a book writer,” right?

Sondheim: Yeah. I’d been working from a little Samuel French-type version.5 I was up to Page 8 in Bond’s script, which is, I guess, the marketplace scene,6 and already it was an hour and a half long. I thought, “This is not going to work because I don’t know how to cut, really.” I mean I do, but I don’t. That’s why I got Hugh Wheeler,7 because he was born in England, he was the son of a bankruptcy judge. So he knew something about class structure. And I’d had a good time with him on “[A Little] Night Music.” Also, he’d been a mystery writer, you know. He was one of the most prolific mystery writers in America. He wrote (and co-wrote) under a pseudonym, Patrick Quentin.

Miranda: My favorite thing is bringing the song into the room to my collaborators. That’s my favorite part of the process. Not the writing of it, not even it being done. It’s the moment when I know my collaborators are going to make it better.

Sondheim: That’s my least favorite part of collaboration. Unless I really like what I’ve written.

Miranda: Oh?

Sondheim: Then I want to share it with a collaborator. But no, I don’t get that excitement that you get out of it, presenting it to collaborators. First of all, I only really do it with a book writer. I don’t with a director. I just don’t want to call in a director till it’s ready to present, and that means me and my collaborator. But you know, Lapine8 was the first one who actually made me give him unfinished songs. I never give unfinished songs.

Miranda: Did you find that valuable?

Sondheim: No, not particularly, but it was valuable to him.

Miranda: Well, it’s like being naked.

Miranda: You’re gonna show up naked sometimes.

Sondheim: You’ve got to have somebody who’ll surprise you and, you know, it’s the old lesson, you’ve got to work on something dangerous. You have to work on something that makes you uncertain. Something that makes you doubt yourself.

Miranda: Talk a bit about that danger and uncertainty.

Sondheim: Well, because it stimulates you to do things you haven’t done before. The whole thing is if you know where you’re going, you’ve gone, as the poet says. And that’s death. That leads to stultified writing and stultified shows.

Miranda: Since “Hamilton,” I have been pitched every historical era.

Sondheim: Of course! And so that’s the one thing you don’t want to do. After “Gypsy” I got nothing but backstage stories and I said, “The only thing I don’t want to write is anything to do with show business.” That’s the only thing.

SONDHEIM HAS CERTAINLY followed his own advice in this regard: His choice of subject matter over the last half-century of work demolishes any notions of the kinds of stories musical theater can tell. From a violent barber (“Sweeney Todd” with Hugh Wheeler) to ancient Roman farce (1962’s “A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,” with librettists Burt Shevelove and Larry Gelbart) to fractured fairy tales (“Into the Woods” with James Lapine). Within this vast terrain, he and his collaborators have also radically experimented with the musical theater form: See the diptych structure of “Sunday in the Park With George,” also with Lapine, in which each act takes place a century apart, or the unprecedented “Company” (1970), with a book by George Furth, a meditation on commitment and monogamy, which Sondheim describes as a “non-plot” musical.” Here he is, arriving at the form of “Follies,” his legendary 1971 musical with librettist James Goldman about a reunion of retired performers from a 1930s Ziegfeldesque revue: “You start with the subject matter and some content and it takes form. If you’re going to say, ‘O.K., it’s a reunion party,’ well, hello, don’t try to give it a plot. And if you don’t give it a plot, what’s going to hold it together? Uh-oh. That’s what’s dangerous and that’s what’s scary about it.”

We gravitate toward the subject of surprise, both for the audience and for the playwright.

Sondheim: That was a big lesson from Peter Shaffer.9 We went to see a play once about the mad queen of Spain and in the first act there were two rapes, an evisceration, a fire and something horrifying with a child, I don’t remember. And at the end of the first act I said, “This is so much my kind of thing. Why am I bored?” He said, “There’s no surprise.” And I thought, “Put that on your bathroom mirror.” Surprise: if it’s in the lyric, the unexpected word, the unexpected note, the unexpected incident. The unexpected, the unexpected, that’s what theater is about. If you had to patent one thing in the theater, it’s surprise.

Miranda: Can you think of any times you’ve surprised yourself in the writing process?

Sondheim: Oh, come on, as a writer you’re always surprised when you think of the right note or the right word. You think, “Oh, I didn’t know I could — oh, that’s good!” You know, writing’s full of surprises for oneself. It comes with the territory, but this is a different kind of thing. This is surprising the audience —

Sondheim bats the question away. He’s either uninterested in recounting a specific time that he surprised himself while writing, or there have been so many that it’s impossible to pick: It comes with the territory.

Video

Two years ago, I interviewed Sondheim and John Weidman together for a PBS documentary, but my favorite moment from the interview never aired. We were on the subject of “Finishing the Hat” from “Sunday in the Park With George,” one of Sondheim’s most celebrated songs, and maybe the greatest song ever written about the self-induced spell of the creative process.10 In this excerpt from that interview, just as in his work, Sondheim’s collaborator brought out the best in him:

Weidman: Do you remember you called me the night you finished that song?

Sondheim (smiling): Was I excited?

Weidman: You were ... beyond excited. I mean, it’s like you needed to call somebody. I may have been number 17 on the list, but I could hear it in your voice, you said, “I just wrote this song.”

Sondheim: Yeah, I remember, I wanted to tell everybody. [Laughs.] I wanted to tell everybody. I was really pleased.

Miranda: I love the story you told about the making of it in your book, about being inspired by a party game you were creating for Phyllis Newman’s party,11 and realizing you’d spent the entire night in a sort of trance —

Sondheim: I started planning that game at 8 o’clock in the evening, and when I looked up, it was 7 o’clock in the morning. I’m exaggerating, but not by much. Time had disappeared. That’s what happens — you must know that yourself. You must know that the great thing about writing and creating is, time disappears. You are in the moment, and the moment can go for eight hours or for two minutes, or whatever, until the phone rings, or you know, you have to go get something to eat.

PRESENT DAY again — I’m trying to give Sondheim credit for expanding the scope of the American musical, and he is passing on the credit to his mentor Oscar Hammerstein instead.

Miranda: Something that’s so essential about your work is that I think you have expanded the terrain of what musical theater can be. The notion of, “This is a musical, that’s not a musical,” is BS. It’s carried entirely by the passion of the creators.

Sondheim: Yeah, but Oscar invented that with “Oklahoma!” He took a play that was about homosexuality in the West and turned it into a sunny musical. Because he saw something in it that was beyond what Lynn Riggs12 had written, about the opening of territories, the promise of America. He saw that which anybody else reading that play would not have seen.

Miranda: O.K. But it gets back to the notion of, “If I can find myself in the work, others will see themselves.” So it’s about not being afraid of specificity.

Sondheim lights up.

Photo

Sondheim: Absolutely! That’s exactly what he taught me, when he criticized my poetic Hammerstein lyrics when I was starting out.13 He said, “That’s not what you feel. Don’t write what I feel. Write what you feel.” Oh! It had never occurred to me to write what I felt. And Oscar was the one who taught everyone to do that.

Write what you feel. Or as George’s muse, Dot, says to him in “Sunday,” “Anything you do,/Let it come from you./Then it will be new.”

And then for a moment you let in the depth and intensity and range of Stephen Sondheim’s feeling for the past half-century. That Tony and Maria of “West Side Story” first fell in love as Sondheim sharpened his Blackwing pencils, finding the words for their doomed romance at age 25. That Mrs. Lovett of “Sweeney Todd” hatched her diabolical plans from this writing couch as Sondheim talked to himself. That within Sondheim, somewhere, is both Georges Seurat and Fosca, Pseudolus and Mama Rose, John Wilkes Booth and Madame Armfeldt, Charley Kringas and Little Red Riding Hood. He has served up vodka stingers for Joanne (“Company”) and chrysanthemum tea for the Shogun (“Pacific Overtures”). Sixty years of iconic theatrical moments, and they exist as a result of the specific way Stephen Sondheim feels. Line by line, note by note, surprise by surprise.

And if you’re Sondheim, there are days like today, when you feel under the weather and the day is full of distractions. But there are also nights when you write “Finishing the Hat,” and you’re so proud of what you’ve made that you have to call a friend and say, “I just wrote this song.”

What’s important is that Sondheim is still here, staring down another deadline. Starting on a hat. Feeling his way toward the moment when time disappears.

Sondheim: You shouldn’t feel safe. You should feel, “I don’t know if I can write this.” That’s what I mean by dangerous, and I think that’s a good thing to do. Sacrifice something safe.

Question: We’re told by our secretary of state that he’s been engaged in some secret contacts with North Korea, exploring the possibility of a diplomatic solution that might dramatically reduce North Korea’s nuclear arsenal in return for U.S. promises of regime security. If, at the same time, Trump unilaterally pulls out of the deal we’ve already signed with Iran to prevent it from developing nukes — and Trump moves to reimpose sanctions — how does that not send only one message to the North Koreans: No deal with the U.S. is worth the paper it’s written on, so you’d be wise to hold on to all your nukes?

Question: Iran controls tens of thousands of Shiite militiamen in Iraq and Syria who were our tacit allies in defeating ISIS. Tehran also has huge influence over Iraq’s government and over certain regions of Afghanistan as well. Can we stabilize Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan — post-ISIS — and keep our troop presence low and safe, without Iran’s help — and will that help be coming after Trump rips up the nuclear deal? If you think so, please raise your hand.

And since our European allies as well as Russia and China have indicated that they will not follow us in backing out of the Iran deal or reimposing sanctions, Iran would have all the moral high ground and money it needs, and the U.S. would be isolated. Are we going to sanction E.U. banks if they deal with Iran?

Trump came into office vowing to end the trade imbalance with China — a worthy goal. And what was his first move? To tear up the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the trade deal that would have put the U.S. at the helm of a 12-nation trading bloc built around U.S. interests and values, potentially eliminating some 18,000 tariffs on U.S. goods and controlling 40 percent of global G.D.P. And China was not in the group. That’s called leverage.

Trump just ripped up the TPP to “satisfy the base” and is now left begging China for trade crumbs, with little leverage. And because he needs China’s help in dealing with North Korea, he has even less leverage on trade.

Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate accord and, at the same time, restricted U.S. government funding for birth control both at home and abroad. Question: What is driving so many immigrants and refugees in Africa, the Middle East and Central America to try to get out of their world of disorder and into America and Europe and the world order?

Answer: It is a cocktail of climate change, environmental degradation, population explosions and misgovernance in these countries. So Trump’s policy is to throw away every tool we have to mitigate climate change and population growth and try to build a wall instead, while also trying to bully Mexico’s unpopular president into trade concessions, which could help elect a radical populist in next year’s Mexican election — a successor who would be anti-American — and destabilize its economy as well.

At a time when China has decided to go full-bore into clean tech and electric cars, at a time when all of the tech giants are building data centers that they want powered by clean energy, at a time when solar and wind power are growing increasingly competitive with fossil fuels (and America still has a technological lead in many of these areas), at a time when climate change may be stimulating bigger hurricanes and forest fires that are costing us hundreds of billions of dollars, Trump’s central energy initiative is to reverse Obama’s and bring back coal-fired power.

Through Nxivm, Mr. Raniere transformed himself into a New Age teacher with long hair and a guru-like manner of speaking.
Mr. Raniere acknowledged giving “five women permission to do something,” but did not elaborate, other than to say he would investigate, Mr. Vicente said.
Mr. Vicente said he suspected Mr. Raniere was lying to him and might have done so before.
On the recording, Mr. Ames tells another member that Ms. Edmondson was branded and that other women told him about handing over collateral.","A female doctor proceeded to use a cauterizing device to sear a two-inch-square symbol below each woman’s hip, a procedure that took 20 to 30 minutes. For hours, muffled screams and the smell of burning tissue filled the room.

“I wept the whole time,” Ms. Edmondson recalled. “I disassociated out of my body.”

Since the late 1990s, an estimated 16,000 people have enrolled in courses offered by Nxivm (pronounced Nex-e-um), which it says are designed to bring about greater self-fulfillment by eliminating psychological and emotional barriers. Most participants take some workshops, like the group’s “Executive Success Programs,” and resume their lives. But other people have become drawn more deeply into Nxivm, giving up careers, friends and families to become followers of its leader, Keith Raniere, who is known within the group as “Vanguard.”

Both Nxivm and Mr. Raniere, 57, have long attracted controversy. Former members have depicted him as a man who manipulated his adherents, had sex with them and urged women to follow near-starvation diets to achieve the type of physique he found appealing.

Now, as talk about the secret sisterhood and branding has circulated within Nxivm, scores of members are leaving. Interviews with a dozen of them portray a group spinning more deeply into disturbing practices. Many members said they feared that confessions about indiscretions would be used to blackmail them.

Mark Vicente, a filmmaker and former top Nxivm official, said that after hearing about the secret society, he confronted Mr. Raniere.

“I said, ‘Whatever you are doing, you are heading for a blowup,’” Mr. Vicente said.

Several former members have asked state authorities to investigate the group’s practices, but officials have declined to pursue action.

In July, Ms. Edmondson filed a complaint with the New York State Department of Health against Danielle Roberts, a licensed osteopath and follower of Mr. Raniere, who performed the branding, according to Ms. Edmondson and another woman. In a letter, the agency said it would not look into Dr. Roberts because she was not acting as Ms. Edmondson’s doctor when the branding is said to have happened.

Separately, a state police investigator told Ms. Edmondson and two other women that officials would not pursue their criminal complaint against Nxivm because their actions had been consensual, a text message shows.

State medical regulators also declined to act on a complaint filed against another Nxivm-affilated physician, Brandon Porter. Dr. Porter, as part of an “experiment,” showed women graphically violent film clips while a brain-wave machine and video camera recorded their reactions, according to two women who took part.

The women said they were not warned that some of the clips were violent, including footage of four women being murdered and dismembered.

“Please look into this ASAP,” a former Nxivm member, Jennifer Kobelt, stated in her complaint. “This man needs to be stopped.”

In September, regulators told Ms. Kobelt they concluded that the allegations against Dr. Porter did not meet the agency’s definition of “medical misconduct,” their letter shows.

Mr. Raniere and other top Nxivm officials, including Lauren Salzman, did not respond to repeated emails, letters or text messages seeking comment. Dr. Roberts and Dr. Porter also did not respond to inquiries.

Former members said that, inside Nxivm, they are being portrayed as defectors who want to destroy the group.

It is not clear how many women were branded or which Nxivm officials were aware of the practice.

A copy of a text message Mr. Raniere sent to a female follower indicates that he knew women were being branded and that the symbol’s design incorporated his initials.

“Not initially intended as my initials but they rearranged it slightly for tribute,” Mr. Raniere wrote, (“if it were abraham lincolns or bill gates initials no one would care.)”

From the Message Below is an excerpt of a text message Mr. Raniere sent to a female follower, which suggested that he knew women were being branded and that the symbol’s design incorporated his initials. “... Not intended initially as my initials but they rearranged it slightly for tribute (if it were abraham lincolns or bill gates initials no one would care). The primary meaning and design of the brand symbol has nothing to do with my initials ...”

Joining the Sisterhood

Ms. Edmondson, who lives in Vancouver and helped start Nxivm’s chapter there, was thrilled when Lauren Salzman arrived in January to teach workshops.

The women, both in their early 40s, were close and Ms. Edmondson regarded Ms. Salzman as a confidante and mentor.

“Lauren was someone I really looked up to as a rock star within the company,” said Ms. Edmondson, an actress who joined Nxivm about a decade ago.

During her visit, Ms. Salzman said she had something “really amazing” she wanted to share. “It is kind of strange and top secret and in order for me to tell you about it you need to give me something as collateral to make sure you don’t speak about it,” Ms. Edmondson recalled her saying.

The proposition seemed like a test of trust. After Ms. Edmondson wrote a letter detailing past indiscretions, Ms. Salzman told her about the secret sorority.

She said it had been formed as a force for good, one that could grow into a network that could influence events like elections. To become effective, members had to overcome weaknesses that Mr. Raniere taught were common to women — an overemotional nature, a failure to keep promises and an embrace of the role of victim, according to Ms. Edmondson and other members.

Submission and obedience would be used as tools to achieve those goals, several women said. The sisterhood would comprise circles, each led by a “master” who would recruit six “slaves,” according to two women. In time, they would recruit slaves of their own.

“She made it sound like a bad-ass bitch boot camp,” Ms. Edmondson said.

Ms. Edmondson and others said that during training, the women were required to send their master texts that read “Morning M” and “Night M.” During drills, a master texted her slaves “?” and they had 60 seconds to reply “Ready M.”

Trainees who failed had to pay penalties, including fasting, or could face physical punishments, two women said.

In March, Ms. Edmondson arrived for an initiation ceremony at Ms. Salzman’s home in Clifton Park, N.Y., a town about 20 miles north of Albany where Mr. Raniere and some followers live. After undressing, she was led to a candlelit ceremony, where she removed a blindfold and saw Ms. Salzman’s other slaves for the first time. The women were then driven to a nearby house, where the branding took place.

In the spring, the sorority grew as women joined different circles. Slaves added compromising collateral every month to Dropbox accounts, and a Google Document was used to list a timetable for recruiting new slaves, several women said.

Around the same time, an actress, Catherine Oxenberg, said she learned her daughter had been initiated into the sorority.

“I felt sick to my stomach,” said Ms. Oxenberg, who starred in the 1980s television series “Dynasty.”

Ms. Oxenberg had become increasingly concerned about her 26-year-old daughter, India, who looked emaciated from dieting. She told her mother that she had not had a menstrual period for a year and that her hair was falling out.

Ms. Oxenberg said she invited her daughter home in late May to try to get her away from the group.

When Ms. Oxenberg confronted her about the sorority, her daughter defended its practices.

“She said it was a character-building experience,” Ms. Oxenberg said.

‘Humans Can Be Noble’

By the time the secret group was taking shape, Mark Vicente, the filmmaker, had been a faithful follower of Mr. Raniere for more than a decade.

Mr. Vicente said he had been contacted by Ms. Salzman’s mother, Nancy, a co-founder of Nxivm who is known as “Prefect,” after the 2004 release of a documentary he co-directed that explored spirituality and physics.

Soon, Mr. Vicente was taking courses that he said helped him expose his fears and learn strategies that made him feel more resolute.

He also made a documentary called “Encender el Corazón,” or “Ignite the Heart,” which lionized Mr. Raniere’s work in Mexico.

“Keith Raniere is an activist, scientist, philosopher and, above all, humanitarian,” Mr. Vicente says in the film.

Mr. Raniere has used those words to describe himself. On his website, he said he spoke in full sentences by age 1, mastered high school mathematics by 12 and taught himself to play “concert level” piano. At 16, he entered Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y.

Before Nxivm, he helped run a company called Consumers’ Buyline Inc., which offered discounts to members on groceries and other products.

In the mid-1990s, several state attorneys general investigated it as a suspected pyramid scheme; Mr. Raniere and his associates agreed to shut it down.

Through Nxivm, Mr. Raniere transformed himself into a New Age teacher with long hair and a guru-like manner of speaking.

“Humans can be noble,” he says on his website. “The question is: will we put forth what is necessary?”

By many accounts, Mr. Raniere sleeps during the day and goes out at night to play volleyball or take female followers for long walks. Several women described him as warm, funny and eager to talk about subjects that interested them.

Others saw a different side. Nxivm sued several former members, accusing them of stealing its trade secrets, among other things.

Mr. Vicente said he was aware of the negative publicity, including a 2012 series by The Albany Times-Union that described alleged abuses inside Nxivm.

Mr. Vicente’s views began to change this year after his wife was ostracized when she left Nxivm and he heard rumors about the secret sorority.

Mr. Vicente said he got evasive answers when he asked Mr. Raniere about the group. Mr. Raniere acknowledged giving “five women permission to do something,” but did not elaborate, other than to say he would investigate, Mr. Vicente said.

Mr. Vicente said he suspected Mr. Raniere was lying to him and might have done so before. Suddenly, self-awareness techniques he had learned felt like tools that had been used to control him.

“No one goes in looking to have their personality stripped away,” he said. “You just don’t realize what is happening.”

Followers Start to Flee

In May, Sarah Edmondson began to recoil from her embrace of the secret society.

Her husband, Anthony Ames, who was also a Nxivm member, learned about her branding and the couple both wanted out.

Before quitting, Mr. Ames went to Nxivm’s offices in Albany to collect money he said the group owed him.

He had his cellphone in his pocket and turned on its recorder.

On the recording, Mr. Ames tells another member that Ms. Edmondson was branded and that other women told him about handing over collateral. “This is criminal,” Mr. Ames says.

The voice of a woman — who Mr. Ames said is Lauren Salzman — is heard trying to calm him. “I don’t think you are open to having a conversation,” she said.

“You are absolutely right, I’m not open to having a conversation,” he replied. “My wife got branded.”

A few days later, many of Mr. Raniere’s followers learned of the secret society from a website run by a Buffalo-area businessman, Frank R. Parlato Jr. Mr. Parlato had been locked in a long legal battle with two sisters, Sara and Clare Bronfman, who are members of Nxivm and the daughters of Edgar Bronfman, the deceased chairman of Seagram Company.

In 2011, the Bronfman sisters sued Mr. Parlato, whom they had hired as a consultant, alleging he had defrauded them of $1 million.

Four years later, in 2015, the Justice Department indicted him on charges of fraud and other crimes arising from alleged activities, including defrauding the Bronfmans. Mr. Parlato has denied the claims and the case is pending.

Mr. Parlato started a website, The Frank Report, which he uses to lambaste prosecutors, Mr. Raniere and the Bronfmans. In early June, Mr. Parlato published the first in a torrent of salacious posts under the headline, “Branded Slaves and Master Raniere.”

A Nxivm follower, Soukaina Mehdaoui, said she reached out to Mr. Raniere after reading the post. Ms. Mehdaoui, 25, was a newcomer to Nxivm, but the two had grown close.

She said Mr. Raniere told her the secret sorority began after three women offered damaging collateral to seal lifetime vows of obedience to him.

While Ms. Mehdaoui had joined the sorority, the women in her circle were not branded. She was appalled.

“There are things I didn’t know that I didn’t sign up for, and I’m not even hearing about it from you,” she texted Mr. Raniere.

Mr. Raniere texted back about his initials and the brand.

By then, panic was spreading inside Nxivm. Slaves were ordered to delete encrypted messages between them and erase Google documents, two women said. To those considering breaking away, it was not clear whom they could trust and who were Nxivm loyalists.

Late one night, Ms. Mehdaoui met secretly with another Nxivm member. They took out their cellphones to show they were not recording the conversation.

Both decided to leave Nxivm, despite concerns that the group would retaliate by releasing their “collateral” or suing them.

Ms. Mehdaoui said that when she went to say goodbye to Mr. Raniere, he urged her to stay.

“Do you think, I’m bad, I don’t agree with abuses,” she recalled him saying. He said the group “gives women tools to be powerful, to regain their power for the sake of building love.”

Nxivm recently filed criminal complaints with the Vancouver police against Ms. Edmondson and two other women accusing them of mischief and other crimes in connection with the firm’s now-closed center there, according to Ms. Edmondson. The women have denied the allegations. A spokesman for the Vancouver police declined to comment.

Ms. Edmondson and other former followers of Mr. Raniere said they were focusing on recovering.

“There is no playbook for leaving a cult,” she said.",Inside a Secretive Group Where Women Are Branded,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/nyregion/nxivm-women-branded-albany.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

Assemblywoman Cristina Garcia, a Democrat who leads the Legislative Women’s Caucus and spoke of her own experiences being grabbed, said there was too much onus on women who lived through the harassment.

“Why does the burden have to be on the victims?” she asked. “There are no guarantees we’re going to be protected. We’re talking about our reputations and our careers. How am I going to prove that you’re holding legislation because you’ve harassed me? People will get called crazy or worse.”

Pamela Lopez, a Sacramento lobbyist who said that a lawmaker trapped her inside a bathroom while he masturbated, said that rather than identifying “one guy who takes the fall,” she was more concerned about changing a “pervasive culture” in the Legislature.

“If we could be less punitive and not make it about one or two people, then we might be able to see some change,” she said. “We need everyone to be able to step in and say something as soon as they hear something is off. We need everyone to say, ‘No, enough, that’s not O.K.’”

Several kingdoms in the National Basketball Association have risen (and fallen) this century. Shaquille O’Neal and Kobe Bryant uncomfortably shared a throne for the Los Angeles Lakers. A sommelier of talent, Gregg Popovich, extracted the best from the San Antonio Spurs’ international smorgasbord. The Miami Heat forged the triumvirate that made LeBron James a champion.

Each of those teams had significant success, winning multiple titles. But none have dominated like the Golden State Warriors.

In the past three seasons, the Warriors have made three finals and won two titles, losing only 39 regular-season games in that span. (The Sacramento Kings have lost at least that many games for 11 consecutive seasons.) They went 47-15 in the postseason against the league’s best competition. Stephen Curry was twice named the most valuable player. Two seasons ago they set an N.B.A. record with 73 wins.

While the competition frantically tried to keep up this off-season by trading for superstars, the Warriors quietly retained their key players: Curry, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson. That dynamic core fell short in Tuesday night’s season opener, a 122-121 loss to the Houston Rockets, but if preseason predictions are any indication, the Warriors’ season will end in victory.

All 21 ESPN analysts picked the Warriors to win their third title in four seasons. So did all 11 writers at The Ringer. And all seven at Sports Illustrated. And all four at USA Today. And all three at NBC Sports.

No pressure.

And he made a fleeting promise to “support the growth of private businesses.”

Foreign Policy and Military Modernization

Throughout his speech, Mr. Xi described China as a “great power” or a “strong power” 26 times, a clear departure from the days when leaders in Beijing depicted their country as a poor, modest player abroad. “China will continue to play its part as a major and responsible country,” Mr. Xi said.

Mr. Xi said China was committed to supporting international cooperation, global economic integration and the developing world. He also highlighted his trademark “One Belt, One Road” initiative to build roads, railways and other infrastructure projects that solidify Chinese economic and political influence.

But Mr. Xi also took a hard line on some issues. Near the start of his report, he called China’s building of artificial islands in the South China Sea a highlight of his first five years, despite the fact that they have raised tensions with other Asian countries, and the United States Navy.

Mr. Xi also warned that China had to gird for possible conflict. Having reorganized China’s military during his first term, Mr. Xi promised more changes in the next five years, including greater professionalization of officers and more innovation in weaponry. By midcentury, he said, China’s military would be first class in every way, though he did not give details of what that meant.

“A military is built to fight,” Mr. Xi said. “Our military must regard combat capability as the criterion to meet in all its work, and focus on how to win when it is called on.”

Taiwan and Hong Kong

Just days ago, soccer fans in Hong Kong angered many in mainland China by turning their backs to the Chinese national flag during the playing of China’s national anthem. The show of disrespect was the latest sign of the deep unhappiness at Beijing’s opposition to full-fledged democracy in the former British colony, where there are even calls for independence from China.

In his speech, Mr. Xi said that Hong Kong and nearby Macau, a former Portuguese colony, can govern themselves, but only “with patriots playing the principal role.” He also called for the return of Taiwan, a self-governing island, to mainland Chinese control, before delivering the line that won the loudest applause of his marathon speech: “We will never allow anyone, any organization, or any political party, at any time or in any form, to separate any part of Chinese territory from China.”

Security at Home, Too

While Mr. Xi’s report described a more confident, engaged China abroad, it also dwelled on the risks from social tensions created by decades of rapid growth. While Mr. Xi has tightened China’s already strict controls on protest, dissent and unrest, he warned that the sources of social discontent were changing in ways that demanded new responses.

“What we now face is the contradiction between unbalanced and inadequate development and the people’s ever-growing needs for a better life,” Mr. Xi said. He said improving people’s lives included reducing pollution, improving schools and health care, and ensuring fairer access to courts and the justice system.

But keeping China under control requires sticks as well as carrots, Mr. Xi told delegates. Mr. Xi has already established a National Security Commission, a secretive body that helps steer domestic security. China would further “improve the national security system, and strengthen national security capacity,” he said.

To do that, Mr. Xi promised more efforts to control the internet, including the use of censorship to “clearly oppose and resist the whole range of erroneous viewpoints.”

Leading China Into a New Era

Among the many slogans used by Mr. Xi, one stood out. Time and again, Mr. Xi said China had entered a “new era” under his stewardship, and the phrase also featured in the long-winded title of his report: “Secure a Decisive Victory in Building a Moderately Prosperous Society in All Respects and Strive for the Great Success of Socialism With Chinese Characteristics for a New Era.”

“It will be an era that sees China moving closer to center stage,” Mr. Xi said.

Mr. Xi also made clear that he was the best leader to guide China into this new era. By using that phrase and others like it, Mr. Xi appeared to be making the case that he was to this new era what iconic Chinese leaders like Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping had been in their times.

Mr. Xi also held out China as a model for the new era, saying his country had developed its economy without imitating Western values. “It offers a new option for other countries and nations who want to speed up their development while preserving their independence,” he said.",Xi Jinping’s Marathon Speech: Five Takeaways,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/world/asia/china-xi-jinping-party-congress.html

Or the flip side: Look what happened after an intense workout. Even without food in my stomach, my blood sugar often, but not always, rose during exercise, which made planning tricky. The device gives me a window to the impact of cortisol, a stress hormone, which prompts a rush of glucose into my bloodstream.

After a year and a half of paying well over $2,000 out of pocket — six sensors every three months along with shipping fees — my condition has improved. My hemoglobin A1C now clocks in around 6.3 to 6.5, down from 7.0, and my doctor is thrilled. (An A1C level of 5.7 percent is considered normal in people without diabetes.)

Jeffrey Brewer, the chief executive of Bigfoot Biomedical, got his hands on a Libre early (on eBay) and plans to use it as a component of the artificial pancreas his company is working to develop. Mr. Brewer, who has a son with Type 1 diabetes and is a former president of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, said it’s the first glucose monitor “that people really love.”

Dr. David Lam, associate director of the Mount Sinai Diabetes Center in New York, currently prescribes a Dexcom CGM, a device similar to the Libre but which requires calibrating with a finger stick twice a day, to his patients with Type 1 diabetes. (Insurance companies typically cover the cost of these devices for people with Type 1 but not Type 2 diabetes) Dr. Lam sees potential benefits in using the Libre or similar devices for anyone with diabetes. “It’s not only a diagnostic tool, it’s an educational tool. You learn how foods affect your body, you can see trends, and you can predict lows and highs,” he said.

Dr. Pratik Choudhary, a senior lecturer and consultant at the diabetes center at King’s College London who previewed the Libre early on, said there are limits to its usefulness. “It is just not cost effective at current prices,” he said. Dozens of studies have shown that continuous glucose monitoring leads to lower hemoglobin A1C results but for someone with tight control (like me), a half point percent change in A1C is a “minimal improvement to quality of life.”

Still, how do we quantify peace of mind?

The treasure trove of data I get from the Libre — days, weeks and months of data — has made it easier for me to manage my life. Learning that it would be available by prescription at major pharmacies in the States late this year seemed like great news.

But here’s one thing that seems a sure bet: Whether Uber wins or loses, Google will end up doing just fine.","Because today’s giants are nimbler and more paranoid about upstart competition than the tech behemoths of yore, they have cleverly created an ecosystem that enriches themselves even when they don’t think of the best ideas first. The Five run server clouds, app stores, ad networks and venture firms, altars to which the smaller guys must pay a sizable tax just for existing. For the Five, the start-up economy has turned into a heads-I-win-tails-you-lose proposition — they love start-ups, but in the same way that orcas love baby seals.

There is perhaps no better example of this dynamic than what has happened to Snap, the company that makes the disappearing messaging app Snapchat. Although it is one of the most innovative consumer-focused internet companies — Snap created a whole new paradigm in social networking, and pioneered the idea that the camera is the future of human communication — it has been battered by the giants.

After failing to buy Snap several years ago, Facebook repeatedly tried to copy its key innovations. This year, when Facebook lifted Snapchat’s Stories feature for Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook’s main app, it seemed to deliver a death blow.

But Facebook isn’t the only behemoth trying to feed off Snap’s carcass. In January, Snap signed a cloud hosting deal with Google. It agreed to pay Google $400 million a year for the next five years. Note that Snap booked only about $330 million in ad revenue in the first half of this year. In other words, it’s paying more than half of its revenue to Google.

Oh, and do you know who its largest competitors in the internet ad market are? Surprise! Facebook and Google.

The small guys won’t concede any this, of course. Unbridled optimism fuels start-up world, and many investors and start-up executives I talked to in recent weeks argued that with the insane amounts of money pouring into start-ups, the Five don’t have the whole game won.

They said the Five’s platforms had made starting companies cheaper and easier, and pointed to several successful start-ups that managed to elude the Five’s clutches in the last few years: Netflix, Uber and Airbnb. And when you look at business-focused companies that aren’t household names, you come up with dozens more, from Slack to Stripe to Square.

“In a lot of ways I’d say it hasn’t changed,” said Joey Levin, the chief executive of IAC, an internet and media company based in New York. “I’ve been around the internet long enough, and the first thing we used to ask in every meeting when I started was, ‘Why won’t Microsoft do your business?’ Then six years later it was, ‘Why doesn’t Google do it?’ Now it’s a combination of why can’t Facebook, Google, Apple or Amazon do this?”

Mr. Levin’s position is interesting. Even if you may not have heard of it, IAC has been battling giants online for a long time. The company grew out of the media tycoon Barry Diller’s television holdings of the 1990s; over the last two decades, IAC created a string of digital brands that tried to find some foothold outside the fiefs of the giants. Among them are Expedia, Match.com, Tinder, Ask.com and Vimeo.

Some of these companies became the biggest brands in their categories, while others were also-rans that came up short against the day’s tech giants. In many cases, though, IAC made money by shrewdly navigating the giants. Sometimes it worked with the behemoths, other times it competed with them, and always it looked for opportunities above and beneath and between the giants, like a clever pigeon picking up crumbs around a picnic table.

IAC’s latest gambit is Angi Homeservices, a company that combines two big brands aimed at home repair and refurbishing, Angie’s List and HomeAdvisor. That company competes directly with some of the Five — both Google and Amazon have services meant to help you find people to install things your house.

Chris Terrill, the chief executive, told me that Angi Homeservices had a dedicated team working on providing a service that’s superior to anything the giants can build. But he also said his company was eager to team up with one of the big guys — for instance, on one of their voice-assistant platforms — because working with one of the Five could ease its path into the big leagues.

“We think that a smart voice provider will say, ‘If I want to win at all costs, we’ll go get the very best partner’ — and that’s us,” Mr. Terrill said.

In some ways, IAC could be a model for the internet company of tomorrow. It clearly aims big and isn’t going for second place. But it has also internalized a kind of working method that recognizes the Five as more-or-less permanent fixtures of the internet. It’s not betting on their demise; rather, it’s betting on their continued success. If Angi is to win, so will one or more of the Five.

IAC’s executives recognize the danger of a digital marketplace that is so heavily dependent on big guys. “I think the opportunities are still there, but I do worry that some of the biggest players are going to stifle that competition by trying to do and own too much themselves,” Mr. Terrill said.

I asked another IAC veteran, Dara Khosrowshahi — who until recently was the chief executive of Expedia — whether he believed the internet was still an open field for innovation, or whether the Five were closing it off.

“I’m mixed as it relates to that,” he said. “I fundamentally think innovative ideas can still survive and thrive, but the Googles and Facebooks of the world have so much more intelligence as to mass consumer behavior that they probably have an unfair advantage in identifying these early fast movers — and are willing to pay prices that are extraordinary for them.”

In August, Mr. Khosrowshahi was appointed chief executive of Uber, where he will have to deal with the giants more directly. Though his company is the most highly valued start-up of our age, its success seems far from assured. Many of its problems are of its own making, and Mr. Khosrowshahi is determined to fix them.

But like Snap, Uber is at the mercy of the Five. Alphabet, Google’s parent company, is an investor in Uber. But Alphabet’s autonomous-car company, Waymo, is also a competitor to Uber. On top of that, Waymo has sued Uber, alleging theft of trade secrets.

That could more than double coal output in Australia, which already produces more coal than any other nation except China, the United States and India. About 88 percent of the 487 million tons of coal mined annually in Australia is exported.

For many environmentalists, what happens in this mining case is a test of the world’s commitment to fighting climate change. Its failure would register as an unmistakable sign of an international shift away from the fossil fuels behind climate change. But if Australia agrees to subsidize the mine — even though several commercial banks have shunned it — the project would demonstrate the lasting allure and influence of the coal industry.

“How it can be constructed — at a time when the whole world is committed to move away from fossil fuels — is madness that most people just can’t understand,” said Geoffrey Cousins, president of the Australian Conservation Foundation.

The project, known as the Carmichael mine, has provoked strong resistance in part because of its proximity to the Great Barrier Reef, a natural wonder that is already dying because of overheated seawater blamed on climate change. Adani plans to deliver most of the coal to India on shipping routes that critics say would further damage the ecosystem of the world’s greatest system of reefs.

The debate over the mine has dominated headlines in Australia for months and fueled one of the most fervent environmental campaigns in the nation’s history. Protests have grown in size and frequency, and polls show Australians who oppose the mine outnumber those who support it by more than two-to-one.

A group of Indigenous Australians is also challenging Adani’s claim to the land.

But Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull supports the project, and it just needs financing to proceed. A government agency established to support private-sector infrastructure investment is reviewing Adani’s loan request, and the company has said it is also lining up money overseas.

“This is a tipping point,” said Maree Dibella, a coordinator of the North Queensland Conservation Council, referring to the mine’s role in the global campaign against coal.

Around the Galilee Basin, where a population of less than 20,000 is scattered across an area the size of Britain, opinion is divided.

Bruce Currie, a cattle farmer who lives near the site and has traveled to India to investigate Adani’s record, said he is worried the mine will drain too much groundwater, calling it “yet another burden our small business has to bear.”

Several hours drive north in Collinsville, one of the area’s oldest mining communities, Roderick Macdonald, 57, a retired miner, said Adani had come to the town promising to build mining camps and employ local people.

“From what I can hear and see, Mr. Adani’s going to do nothing for this town,” Mr. Macdonald said, referring to Gautam Adani, the billionaire founder and chairman of the company.

But others in the region are more hopeful. Mining accounts for as much as 7 percent of the Australian economy, and the northeastern state of Queensland, where the Galilee Basin lies, has suffered a downturn in recent years because of slowing demand for natural resources, especially from China.

“I need jobs for Queenslanders,” said the state’s premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, of the Adani proposal.

Towns along the coast have been vying for potential contracts with the mine for maintenance work, construction and other services. “People are really rooting for this because of the economy,” said Stephen Smyth, a local union leader, who started working in underground mines at 17.

The Carmichael mine, he added, is “offering that thing of hope, hope for a better life, secure employment and better wages so people can live a reasonable life.”

Adani has said the project will create as many as 10,000 jobs in the region. But a consultant hired by Adani said the employment claim was overstated in court testimony given in a case where a conservation group was looking to block the mine. Critics have also noted that other mines in Australia may need to scale back production if Carmichael opens, meaning job losses elsewhere.

A host of Australian celebrities — including the rock band Midnight Oil — and international groups have urged Mr. Turnbull to kill the project, arguing that such a large mine would violate Australia’s commitment in the Paris climate accord to work to prevent temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels.

In April, Mr. Turnbull met with Mr. Adani and later told reporters that the mine “will create tens of thousands of jobs,” adding, “Plainly, there is a huge economic benefit from a big project of this kind, assuming it’s built and it proceeds.”

If Adani and other mines in the Galilee Basin go ahead and reach maximum production, coal from the region would release as much as 700 million tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year, or nearly as much as Germany generates in emissions, according to a study by Greenpeace.

Australia has pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 26 percent to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2030, but the coal it sells to India and other countries would not be counted in its total.

It is unclear if India even needs the extra coal. After years of big increases in coal consumption, the growth rate slowed last year as the nation has improved energy efficiency and shifted to solar, wind and hydropower. India’s coal-fired power plants are running below 60 percent of capacity, a record low, experts say.

That has raised questions about the economics of the Carmichael mine. Australia’s four largest banks have publicly ruled out financing it, and analysts have argued that the mine would face stiff competition from local sources of coal in India and elsewhere.

Globally, coal consumption actually decreased by 1.7 percent in 2016, according to a BP report on energy trends, leading the company to declare that “the fortunes of coal appear to have taken a decisive break from the past.”

Critics worry Adani could default on the government’s loan or flood the market, lowering prices worldwide and allowing coal to make a comeback as an energy source.

The Adani Group’s business record has also drawn scrutiny. The conglomerate, whose interests span natural resources, logistics, energy and agriculture, has faced allegations in India of environmental degradation, money laundering and bribery, but it has denied any illegal activity.

Adani leased about 460 square miles of land in the Galilee Basin nearly a decade ago. It can take two to three days to get to the site from the coast, with the last leg of the trip on unpaved roads. Surveying, soil testing and design work has begun, including on an airstrip, mining camp, access roads and the rail link, said Ron Watson, a spokesman for Adani Australia.

Coal from the mine would be transported by rail about 240 miles through grazing land to Abbot Point, the nation’s most northern deep water coal port, which is already used to ship coal to China, Japan and South Korea. Adani has signed a 99-year lease of the port and plans an expansion that would allow it to double the amount of coal going through.

From the air, the piles of coal and equipment at Abbot Point are a striking contrast with the turquoise waters of the Coral Sea. The closest coral of the Great Barrier Reef is just 12 miles away.

A 30-minute drive southeast from Abbot Point is the seaside town of Bowen, where parts of the Nicole Kidman epic “Australia” was filmed a decade ago during better times. Now, the streets are dotted with “For Sale” signs beyond the main drag.

“We had miners living in the high parts of town,” or the most expensive neighborhoods, said Mike Brunker, who represents Bowen in the Whitsunday regional council and is a supporter of the mine for the jobs it is projected to bring. “That was the boom time. They had to leave, they had to go to other mines, or they’ve just gone broke.”

Further up the coast is Townsville, home to Adani’s headquarters in Australia, where protesters sometimes congregate and residents exemplify the conflicts felt by many in the region.

“You don’t know what’s good for us,” one man snapped at an environmental activist conducting a survey recently.

Not too long after, another resident told the activist, “I oppose the mine even though I applied for a job.”",Australia Debates: Does a Warming Planet Really Need More Coal?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/14/world/australia/australia-adani-carmichael-coal-mine.html

He reveled in family life and photographed his wife and sons incessantly.
He started teaching photo workshops, where his students became part of his extended family, too.
“This book has brought many tears in my eyes in the making,” Mr. Bazan, 58, said.","Ernesto Bazan was teaching a workshop in Brazil in 2013 when he received a call that his father, a surgeon and professor of medicine, had died in Sicily. He rushed home to Palermo, arriving just in time for the viewing, a powerful, if painful moment. Afterward, the body was cremated.

As dark smoke drifted from the funeral home’s chimney into the overcast sky, Mr. Bazan took what he called “the last portrait” of his father — making permanent a moment that underscored the fleeting nature of human existence.

That photograph became the cornerstone of his new book, “Before You Grow Up,” a family album he created for his twin 19-year-old sons, Stefano and Pietro, in which elegant photographs are mixed with drawings, letters, his mother’s journal entries, memorabilia and notebook pages.

Photo

“I made this book as a legacy for my sons, a visual testament that they can carry with them, and share with the people that they love,” he said, “and always love each other as my wife and I have been teaching them to do.”

The book echoes Mr. Bazan’s roles as a son; a husband to his wife, Sissy; and a father. Designed with Kevin Sweeney, it captures the joys and sorrows of 21st-century family life.

Mr. Bazan grew up in Palermo with the expectation that he would follow in his father’s footsteps and become a doctor. He started taking “average” pictures as a teenager, he recalled, and when he was 17 a voice came to him in a dream, whispering, “You’ve got to be a photographer.”

After two years arguing with his father over his career choice, he left for New York City to study photography and soon after began working internationally. He first traveled to Cuba in 1992 and was struck by the generosity of Cubans.

“I felt a very powerful connection with them,” he said. “Like I belonged to that place in another life.”

On a return trip three years later, Mr. Bazan and his friend and printer Mike Levin stumbled upon a scene that seemed out of a 1940s Italian movie, he recalled, as he watched “three beautiful young girls dancing in the streets of Havana.” Mr. Bazan started dancing with a 70-year-old woman while his friend chatted up other, younger, women. When the music ended, Mr. Bazan locked eyes with one of them, Sissy.

They married three years later. Shortly after, they had twins.

Photo

Mr. Bazan worked as an accredited photographer in Havana for an Italian sports newspaper and documented his new home in images infused with the rhythms of Cuba. He reveled in family life and photographed his wife and sons incessantly. He started teaching photo workshops, where his students became part of his extended family, too.

But nothing is ever straightforward in Cuba. When the authorities suspected that the workshops were really journalism classes in disguise, he was forced to stop. The decision was more than he could bear, so he relocated to Veracruz, Mexico, in 2006.

“I had to flee Cuba to continue teaching my workshop and to continue to be who I am,” he said.

But his sojourn was fruitful: He has published three books of his Cuban photographs — “Bazan: Cuba,” “Al Campo” and “Isla” — and moved to New Jersey in order to fulfill his sons’ desire to finish high school in the United States.

Photo

For seven years he struggled to make a book that would be his legacy to his sons, whom he had “photographed from the womb,” he said. It was, at times, a difficult and even painful process.

“This book has brought many tears in my eyes in the making,” Mr. Bazan, 58, said. “It’s a family album that also deals with sickness, sadness, mourning and death, but with an uplifting and positive look at the future, particularly the one of my children, who are beginning their new soulful journey into their adult part of life.”

Ultimately, “Before You Grow Up” is about the importance of family and the fragility of life — what a man leaves behind for his children, as well as grandchildren and great-grandchildren he might never meet.

“I hope my sons remember me as a decent father that was there for them at all times,” he said, “like my father and mother have been for me.”

Wine With Cheese The final fusty belief is that cheese goes best with red wine.
It seems to me that many people now understand that white wine usually is a better match.","Sweet white wines ranging from barely sweet to luscious can be glorious with food. The key is balance: The residual sugar in the wine, often caused by incomplete fermentation, must be countered by lively acidity. In successful bottles, the result is a thrilling tightrope walk as the wine treads the line between sweet and dry. These wines are indisputably sweet, but the acidity cleans away any cloying sensation, leaving a dry, refreshing feeling after swallowing.

Good examples are certain German rieslings (another myth is that all German rieslings are sweet — not remotely true!) and demi-sec Vouvrays. For a course of foie gras and guinea hen terrine, Josh MacGregor of DB Bistro Moderne picked two Mosel rieslings from the Wehlener Sonnenuhr vineyard, a 2015 Dr. Loosen spätlese and a 2007 J.J. Prüm kabinett.

This stacked the deck a bit. Traditionally, foie gras is served with unctuously sweet wines like Sauternes. Even so, many of the diners seemed unpersuaded.

“People are stuck on the fact that they don’t like sweet wines,” Mr. Johnnes said after the dinner. “I don’t understand that. We’re such a sweet culture.”

Serving Temperatures It’s sadly an article of faith that many restaurants, and homes for that matter, will serve white wines too cold and red wines too warm.

It’s easy to see where this comes from. White wines are generally served cooler than reds, and in an era of refrigerators and ice, this has come to mean ice-cold. Reds, meanwhile, are to be served at “room temperature,” a term derived at a time when many rooms had thick stone walls, and the indoor temperature may have hovered around 60 degrees.

Serving whites too cold seriously compromises good bottles, muffling nuances and complexities. Conversely, mediocre whites ought to be served ice-cold; the temperature masks any flaws.

If you are knocking back the house pinot grigio at the corner bar, make sure the bottle comes directly from the refrigerator. For a fine white, though, take it out of the fridge a good half-hour before serving, and in restaurants, do not reflexively allow the bottle to be put on ice. Take its temperature first.

Reds are a bit trickier, depending on the age and texture of the wine. Ideally, a bottle should be slightly cool to the touch. Modern room temperature can often leave a good red seeming flabby or fatiguing. A slight chill is bracing to the wine. Tannic wines served too cold can seem tough and unpleasant. If a bottle seems too warm, 15 minutes in the fridge — or, at a restaurant, 10 minutes in an ice bucket — can work wonders.

For a complicated dish of potato gnocchi with sweetbreads, chanterelles and runner beans, Joe Robitaille of Bar Boulud and Boulud Sud picked two unusual wines: a rich, textured, amber-colored 2009 from Domaine Economou in Crete, made of the obscure vilana and thrapsathiri grapes, and a pinot noir from the Jura, the 2015 Arbois Les Gaudrettes from Domaine de Saint Pierre. These were excellent examples, and each benefited greatly from the correct serving temperature.

Unconventional Food Pairings Few wine issues cause so much anxiety as putting together food and wine. For this reason, I’ve always believed that the conventional wisdom — white wine with fish and poultry, red wine with meat — is not a bad place to start.

But as people become more confident, they quickly find the exceptions. Northern Rhône syrahs are beautiful with chicken, as is pinot noir or cabernet franc with duck. Seafood is another matter, and certain meatier specimens like salmon, tuna or octopus go well with light reds like pinot noir.

For a dish of salmon with figs and fennel in a red-wine sauce, Aaron Fusco of Café Boulud picked two less-conventional reds, a 2014 cabernet sauvignon and a 2014 merlot from the Carneros region of Sonoma County, both from Inconnu Wine.

Mr. Fusco’s underlying motive may have been to demonstrate that not all California reds are big and powerful. These were both delightfully fresh, the cabernet snappy and the merlot soft. They went well with the salmon, and though I might have preferred a pinot noir, the wines made their points.

Fine Vintage Fixations I have met too many people who will buy fine wines only from vintages that critics deem great. This may be a fine strategy for investors — those who buy great wines with the intent of reselling for a profit — but for people who simply want to enjoy good wines, it is a mistake, and sometimes a costly one.

Burgundy lovers who bought the 2005s and refused the 2007s have missed out on a lot of pleasure as they have waited, and perhaps lost patience, with the ’05s. Bordeaux drinkers who favored the 2000 and 2010 vintages over the ’01s and ’11s may have had similar experiences. If you buy wines with long-term aging in mind (20 years or more), then by all means focus on the best vintages. Keep in mind that what constitutes a great vintage is often a matter of opinion.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

This was borne out in a course of squab with currants. Mr. Johnnes and Raj Vaidya of Daniel picked two Côte-Rôties, a Domaine Ogier from 2010, an excellent vintage, and a Domaine Jamet from 2011, not a bad vintage though not as good as 2010.

Even accounting for the different styles of the producers, the 2011 was far more giving, offering a chorus of savory flavors, while the 2010 was tight and reticent. I’m not sure how both of these wines will fare in another decade. At this tasting, one was a wine of pleasure, the other a wine of potential.

Wine With Cheese The final fusty belief is that cheese goes best with red wine. Does anyone still follow this? It seems to me that many people now understand that white wine usually is a better match. People have become so dogmatic about this that I wrote a column a few years ago making the case that once in a while, red wine is still a good choice.

Apparently, this battle is still being fought at the Boulud restaurants. So, with two goat cheeses, one from France and one from Vermont, Ian Smedley, who had been sommelier at DBGB until it closed in August, chose a 2013 L’Etoile from Domaine de Montbourgeau in the Jura, made of chardonnay and savagnin, and an unusual sour ale, Sakura from Carton Brewing in Atlantic Highlands, N.J.

Now, I love sour ales and the combination of beer and cheese. Yet this particular ale was a little too odd for my comfort, blending sour, salty and fruity. The white, on the other hand, was beautiful with the cheeses. I’m not sure it was a revelation to the group, but if anyone needed reminding, this was a good way to do it.

What other myths could have been addressed? The issue of aging, rosés included. The effect of oak barrels on wine. Vineyard practices and soil composition. As I said, the feast could have gone on for days.

279,"['child', 'repeal', 'framework', 'rate', 'families', 'benefit', 'nonrich', 'reform', 'income', 'policies', 'credit', 'key', 'tax']","Tripling the Current Child Tax Credit Would Have a Modest EffectOf the policies explicitly mentioned in the G.O.P.
That’s because the regular child tax credit is nonrefundable, which means that it’s valuable only to families with federal income tax liability (the additional child tax credit does allow some families with three or more children to claim part of the regular child tax credit as a refund, but the benefit is capped and often uneven).
This is why large increases to the current child tax credit do not significantly change the balance of benefits under the framework.
Reforming the Child Tax Credit Could Amplify Its ImpactThere are other ways to make the child tax credit more generous to these families.
There have been several plans over the years to do exactly that with the child tax credit, from both Republicans and Democrats.","The tax reform framework released three weeks ago by the White House and Republican congressional leadership has lofty goals: Simplify the tax code; provide relief for middle-class families; cut taxes for businesses; end many narrowly focused special tax benefits; and keep the reformed tax code “at least as progressive” as the existing one.

Many of the policies proposed in the framework remain ambiguous. Yet it is those policies, in particular the details of the child tax credit expansion, that will determine whether most American families win or lose.

As of Now, G.O.P.’s More Specific Tax Policies Tend to Benefit the Rich

Here’s an estimate of how each policy in the G.O.P. framework could affect families at different income levels on average in 2026, using assumptions similar to those in a recent analysis by the Tax Policy Center. Under these assumptions, the plan as it now stands has a modest benefit on average over all, and a substantial benefit to the top 1 percent.

By everyone’s admission, the plan is a work in progress and could change (possibly including new ideas). But it is specific about the levels of the new standard deduction; the repeal of personal exemptions and the alternative minimum tax; the cut to the corporate income tax rate; and several other policies.

So despite the uncertainty, some families can be more confident of getting tax relief than others. We divided the framework’s policies into two buckets: those policies that are relatively more clear and those that are more ambiguous.

Higher-clarity policies Lower-clarity policies Repeal individual A.M.T. Individual income tax rates of 12, 25, and 35 percent Increase standard deduction Increase child tax credit Dependent credit of $500 Repeal “numerous other exemptions, deductions, and credits” Repeal personal exemptions Partial limit on business deduction for net interest Repeal non-charity/mortgage itemized deductions One-time deemed repatriation Index to chained Consumer Price Index Repeal of non-section 199 business tax provisions Cap passthrough rate at 25 percent Cut corporate rate to 20 percent & repeal corporate A.M.T. Fully expense equipment through 2022 Enact territorial system Repeal section 199 Repeal estate and generation-skipping transfer taxes

Splitting the score in this way shows that the benefits to the top 1 percent are largely explained by the policies on which the framework is most specific. That means increasing the benefit to everyone else requires focusing on the policies that are currently ambiguous.

Three Policies Are a Key to How the Tax Plan May Change

Critics of the Tax Policy Center analysis — like Kevin Hassett, chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers — rightly say that since Congress is still working out the details of tax reform, we should view any evaluation of the framework as preliminary and tentative. (We should likewise be skeptical of any assertions of the plan’s economic benefits at this point.)

Three of the more ambiguous policies have the most potential to change the distribution of benefits: a possible fourth bracket on high-income filers; adjusting the thresholds for the new income tax brackets; and expanding the child tax credit.

A Fourth Bracket Would Raise Revenue, but Wouldn’t Distribute Benefits

The framework sets individual income tax brackets at 12 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent, but leaves open the possibility of a fourth rate higher than 35 percent. This wouldn’t directly benefit middle-class families by itself. But it would taper the benefit to the top 1 percent and could be used to lower the deficit impact of tax reform legislation over all.

Consider as an example a 45 percent top rate on income above $1 million ($1.4 million if married). This rate is 10 percentage points higher than the top marginal rate proposed in the framework, and 5.4 percentage points higher than the current top marginal rate. This idea would lower the benefit to the top 1 percent by about a fifth, and raise about $500 billion over 10 years. It’s a meaningful impact, but it’s not enough on its own to meet the framework’s distributional goals, even before accounting for how the rich might reclassify income in the wake of such a higher rate.

Expanding the Lowest Bracket Would Reach Some but Not All Working Families

Alternatively, the new individual income tax brackets could be adjusted so that more income is subject to the lowest 12 percent rate instead of the 25 percent rate. But in fact, under the Tax Policy Center’s assumption that the current 10 percent and 15 percent brackets are converted to the 12 percent bracket, much of the middle class already gets all the benefit it can from the new 12 percent bracket. If, for example, we expand the 12 percent bracket to also include income currently subject to the 25 percent rate, virtually all of the added benefit flows to families above the 70th percentile (about $87,000 for a family of two in 2017).

So while expanding the 12 percent bracket could provide relief for families in the top quarter, including some who think of themselves as middle class, it isn’t an effective way of reaching working families in the bottom three quarters.

Tripling the Current Child Tax Credit Would Have a Modest Effect

Of the policies explicitly mentioned in the G.O.P. framework, expanding the child tax credit holds the most potential for reaching lower-income families. But simply expanding the current credit delivers only modest benefits. That’s because the regular child tax credit is nonrefundable, which means that it’s valuable only to families with federal income tax liability (the additional child tax credit does allow some families with three or more children to claim part of the regular child tax credit as a refund, but the benefit is capped and often uneven).

This is why large increases to the current child tax credit do not significantly change the balance of benefits under the framework. The Tax Policy Center assumes that the regular credit is expanded by $500 to a maximum of $1,500 per child. But an even more generous expansion of the regular credit — say, tripling it to $3,000 per child — would help lower- and middle-income filers only somewhat more than under the Tax Policy Center’s assumptions.

Reforming the Child Tax Credit Could Amplify Its Impact

There are other ways to make the child tax credit more generous to these families. If the credit were fully refundable, or applicable against both income and payroll taxes — which virtually every working person pays regardless of income — more families would benefit.

There have been several plans over the years to do exactly that with the child tax credit, from both Republicans and Democrats. Below we model an idea based on a 2015 proposal from Senators Marco Rubio and Mike Lee, though it may not reflect their latest thinking. The Rubio-Lee proposal called for an additional $2,500 per child tax credit that would not be refundable but could be used to offset both income and payroll tax liability. If Congress adopted this approach in tax reform legislation, the benefit to lower- and middle-income families would be drastically larger than from other policies in the framework.

This approach has trade-offs, of course; most notably, it would raise the deficit by $1.4 trillion over 10 years, on top of the already $2.5 trillion cost of the framework under the Tax Policy Center’s assumptions. So simply tacking a Rubio-Lee-style approach onto the existing framework might prove to be a deal breaker for too many in Congress without other changes.

Making More Aggressive Assumptions About What Corporate Tax Cuts Do to Wages Doesn’t Change Much

The Tax Policy Center, as well as nonpartisan analysts at the Congressional Budget Office and the Treasury department, assume that the vast majority (around 80 percent) of the benefits of corporate tax cuts are in the form of higher capital income, such as dividends and returns on investment. They see the benefit to wages and salaries as being modest by contrast. The White House argues that wages will grow much more than these agencies assume. But even if capital income only saw, say, 50 percent of the benefit of cutting corporate taxes, the distribution wouldn’t look radically different, as the graph above shows. Since both capital and labor income skew toward the top 1 percent, changing these assumptions can affect the estimate of the absolute benefit for any given family but can only go so far in shifting their share of the benefits in a distributional analysis.

In the end, if Congress wants to prioritize tax relief for lower-income and middle-income Americans, the framework gives it some options, not only in how it fills in the details on the more ambiguous policies, but also in whether it chooses to scale back any of the less ambiguous ones.","For the Non-Rich, the Child Tax Credit Is the Key to Tax Reform",https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/17/upshot/tax-reform-winners-losers-child-tax-credit.html

For decades, Mr. Soros funded the Open Society Foundations through annual donations of around $800 million or $900 million per year.
Open Society already spends about $900 million annually on programs and grants, more than it is legally required to.
Soros Fund Management, the entity that manages the billionaire’s personal fortune, is also responsible for overseeing the Open Society endowment’s investments.
“Since its inception, the Open Society Foundations has worked with leaders in civil society, whether they are the Roma in Eastern Europe or African-Americans in Cleveland, Ohio, who continue to be subject to a second-class form of justice,” he said.","His political focus — including large donations to Hillary Clinton and other Democratic politicians — has made Mr. Soros a target of criticism from both the Republican establishment and fringe elements of the far right. The conservative website Breitbart, for example, has accused Mr. Soros of attempting to make Ireland a “pro-abortion country” and undermining the control of European countries over their borders.

“Given America’s place in the world right now, I think he’s making an enormous statement,” said Eileen Heisman, chief executive of the National Philanthropic Trust, a nonprofit that works with foundations. “He has a very clear point of view and he’s not trying to hide it.”

Patrick Gaspard, the vice president of the Open Society Foundations, who will take over as president at the end of the year, said the election of President Trump had given the organization’s work a new sense of urgency.

Mr. Gaspard specifically cited Mr. Trump’s commission on voter fraud, a panel that has faced much criticism from Democrats and that Mr. Gaspard said “utterly lacks integrity.” “Our work on equal access and protection is more vital than it’s ever been,” he said.

Mr. Soros’s philanthropy is rooted in his past.

He lived in Nazi-occupied Hungary as a boy. With Budapest under Communist rule in 1947, he left for London and then the United States, where he found success on Wall Street.

In 1992, Mr. Soros made a $1 billion bet against the British pound, a trade that famously earned him the nickname “the man who broke the Bank of England” when his aggressive selling of the currency pushed the government to devalue the pound.

As his fortune grew, Mr. Soros began funding efforts to promote democracy and human rights, establishing the first Open Society foundation in Hungary in 1984. Mr. Soros took the name from a book by the philosopher Karl Popper, “Open Society and Its Enemies,” in which he argued for democratic governance, free expression and respect for individual rights.

“He lived through Nazi Hungary,” Ms. Heisman said. “He knows what it’s like to live in a closed society.”

Mr. Soros eventually became one of the biggest donors to Democrats, including Mrs. Clinton. During the last election cycle, Mr. Soros gave millions to super PACs that opposed Mr. Trump and supported other Democratic candidates and causes. He also bet big in the markets that Mr. Trump would lose the election, a wager that cost him about $1 billion.

For decades, Mr. Soros funded the Open Society Foundations through annual donations of around $800 million or $900 million per year. But beginning a few years ago, he increased his contributions as part of his estate planning, bringing the organization’s endowment to about $18 billion this year. The total donation figure was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.

Mr. Soros is expected to contribute at least another $2 billion in the coming years.

“There is no foundation in the world, including the Ford Foundation, that has had more impact around the world than the Open Society Foundations in the last two decades,” said Darren Walker, president of the Ford Foundation. “Because there is no part of the world that they have not been. Their footprint is deeper, wider and more impactful than any other social justice foundation in the world.”

Despite the infusion by Mr. Soros, the foundation said it did not plan to increase the amount that it hands out in grants or via programs in the near future. Open Society already spends about $900 million annually on programs and grants, more than it is legally required to.

And Mr. Soros’s fortune will still be managed by familiar hands. Soros Fund Management, the entity that manages the billionaire’s personal fortune, is also responsible for overseeing the Open Society endowment’s investments.

Mr. Soros remains closely involved in the foundation’s work.

“I talk to George constantly, regularly,” said Mr. Gaspard, the foundation’s incoming president. “George is incredibly engaged on these issues.”

This year, Mr. Soros has fended off attacks by the prime minister of Hungary, who has been displeased with a university that the Open Society Foundations funded there.

Mr. Gaspard said the public pressure did not bother the foundation’s leadership.

“Since its inception, the Open Society Foundations has worked with leaders in civil society, whether they are the Roma in Eastern Europe or African-Americans in Cleveland, Ohio, who continue to be subject to a second-class form of justice,” he said.

Stacy Palmer, editor of the Chronicle of Philanthropy, said that no matter how the billions were spent, the gift by Mr. Soros would keep him in the center of social and political debates for years to come.

Yet for much of the last century, until 1994, photography in the city’s rapid transit system was illegal (though it was a spottily enforced offense). In the late 1930s — soon after the city imposed its ban — Helen Levitt, a young Bensonhurst native, apprenticed with Walker Evans as he photographed unsuspecting commuters.

Mr. Evans hoped to capture the “parade of unselfconscious captive sitters,” so to avoid being caught, he painted his 35 mm camera black, tucked it into his coat with the lens poking out from between buttons, and triggered the shutter with a cable release that snaked down his sleeve.

Ms. Levitt’s task? She distracted the passengers.

Not surprisingly, Ms. Levitt was soon taking her own subway portraits, first with Mr. Evans’s gear, and then with her own camera, possibly using the same technique. Though Ms. Levitt moved into cinematography and was eventually nominated for an Academy Award, she would, three years after Mr. Evans died in 1975, return underground to photograph passengers. A new book called, “Manhattan Transit: The Subway Photographs of Helen Levitt,” released by Walther Konig Verlag, compiles photographs from both decades.

It is clear which photographs were taken when, with those from the 1930s featuring art deco posters, elaborate furs, and jauntily-tilted hats, while those from the 1970s had equally elegant sitters, but against the backdrop of graffiti. In some photos, the subjects appear to be looking right at Ms. Levitt, adding further mystery about her technique.

It’s hard to know how she operated, since Ms. Levitt, who died at age 95 in 2009, spoke little of her work. “If it were easy to talk about, I’d be a writer,” she said. “Since I’m inarticulate, I express myself with images.”

Assemblywoman Cristina Garcia, a Democrat who leads the Legislative Women’s Caucus and spoke of her own experiences being grabbed, said there was too much onus on women who lived through the harassment.

“Why does the burden have to be on the victims?” she asked. “There are no guarantees we’re going to be protected. We’re talking about our reputations and our careers. How am I going to prove that you’re holding legislation because you’ve harassed me? People will get called crazy or worse.”

Several kingdoms in the National Basketball Association have risen (and fallen) this century. Shaquille O’Neal and Kobe Bryant uncomfortably shared a throne for the Los Angeles Lakers. A sommelier of talent, Gregg Popovich, extracted the best from the San Antonio Spurs’ international smorgasbord. The Miami Heat forged the triumvirate that made LeBron James a champion.

Each of those teams had significant success, winning multiple titles. But none have dominated like the Golden State Warriors.

In the past three seasons, the Warriors have made three finals and won two titles, losing only 39 regular-season games in that span. (The Sacramento Kings have lost at least that many games for 11 consecutive seasons.) They went 47-15 in the postseason against the league’s best competition. Stephen Curry was twice named the most valuable player. Two seasons ago they set an N.B.A. record with 73 wins.

While the competition frantically tried to keep up this off-season by trading for superstars, the Warriors quietly retained their key players: Curry, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson. That dynamic core fell short in Tuesday night’s season opener, a 122-121 loss to the Houston Rockets, but if preseason predictions are any indication, the Warriors’ season will end in victory.

All 21 ESPN analysts picked the Warriors to win their third title in four seasons. So did all 11 writers at The Ringer. And all seven at Sports Illustrated. And all four at USA Today. And all three at NBC Sports.

Here’s how that neutron star formed:

For most of their existence, stars emit light through fusion — the merging of hydrogen atoms into helium, which releases gargantuan amounts of energy. When a large star — probably at least six times the mass of the sun — exhausts its hydrogen, it begins to collapse. The collapse accelerates so quickly that it sets off cataclysmic explosion known as a supernova. What’s left over is an extremely dense cinder that is only about six miles wide, but packs in more mass than the sun. The pressure is so great that electrons and protons are squeezed together into neutrons.

A single thimbleful of a neutron star weighs as much as several million elephants.

How does a neutron star differ from a black hole?

A neutron star is a stellar cinder that stopped collapsing. But when even larger stars explode, the remaining core is so dense that the core continues collapsing until it turns into a black hole. Here’s our guide to black holes.

What happens when two neutron stars collide?

In the case of the discovery that was detailed on Monday, the merging objects were probably survivors of massive stars that had been orbiting each other and had each puffed up and then died in spectacular supernova explosions. Making reasonable assumptions about their spins, the astronomers calculated that these neutron stars were about 1.1 and 1.6 times as massive as the sun, smack in the known range of neutron stars.

As they approached each other, swirling a thousand times a second, tidal forces bulged their surfaces outward. Quite a bit of the material was ejected and formed a fat doughnut around the merging stars.

At the moment they touched each other, a shock wave squeezed more material out of their polar regions, but the doughnut and extreme magnetic fields confined the material into an ultra-high-speed jet emitting a blitzkrieg of radiation. That blast set off the gravitational waves detected by LIGO, as well as the light show spotted by a variety of telescopes.

What are gravitational waves?

Watch this video we made in 2016 when LIGO first detected them to learn more about these ripples in space-time that confirmed key aspects of Albert Einstein’s theories.

How do neutron star collisions create gold and platinum?

It is not easy to explain how the universe made heavy elements like uranium. The Big Bang that started the universe created only the lightest elements — hydrogen, helium and a little bit of lithium. Just floating around in space, these light elements do not combine into heavier elements.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The insides of stars can fuse these lighter elements into heavier ones like carbon and oxygen, all the way to iron. That still left the mystery of the origins of elements heavier than iron like gold and platinum.

When two neutron stars collide, they expel neutrons into surrounding space, which slam into free-floating heavy nuclei in their stellar neighborhood. When enough of these collisions occurred, neutrons piled on top of more neutrons and created these heavier elements, notably gold.

These heavier elements drifted around, some accumulating in the gas and dust clouds that formed into new stars and planets including our solar system. The gold in a wedding ring is likely made of the leftovers from a long-ago neutron star collision somewhere in our galaxy.

What are gamma rays and what do they have to do with colliding neutron stars?

A gamma ray is a particle of light, a photon, but it’s a very high energy form of light. It’s more energetic than an X-ray, which in turn is more energetic than ultraviolet light, which is more energetic than the visible light we see.

Photo

For years, astronomers have been fascinated and perplexed by bursts of gamma rays that they were spotting in the skies. These ultra-high-energy particles told of some distant, cataclysmic, unimaginably powerful events.

The detection of this particular gamma-ray burst led astronomers to point a multitude of other telescopes at the same spot, including the LIGO observatory that detects the vibrations in space-time known as gravitational waves. That is what scientists reported on Monday.

LIGO’s gravitational wave measurements helped astronomers pin down what they thought caused at least some of these outbursts: the merger of neutron stars.

What will scientists do with what they’ve just learned?

Collisions of neutron stars are still something novel for scientists. The plethora of data will allow them to test and refine their theories and computer models of what happens. This is another a piece of the puzzle for trying to figure out how the galaxy came to be filled with the elements that became planets, people, plants and everything else.",It Was a Universe-Shaking Announcement.

Class was at 7 p.m., and I came exhausted and slightly wet from rain. I wasn’t in the mood to do sun salutations or anything that took much physical or emotional effort. Luckily, Salty Yoga is basically the equivalent of giving yourself a hug, which we actually did at one point in class.

There were five of us, and we spent the entire hour either sitting or on our backs in mostly restorative poses, like a modified child’s pose with a blanket rolled up under our wrists or gentle twists to the side. Each pose was held for two or three minutes while Masako, the instructor, whispered gentle instructions and encouraged us to breathe and let go.

I was so deeply relaxed that I didn’t notice until after class was over that I was completely covered in salt. A sweatshirt I had thrown off in class looked like an object unearthed from Tatooine, the desert planet in “Star Wars.” My lips stung. The car ride home to Brooklyn felt as itchy and restless as returning from the beach.

At home I took a shower, drank two liters of water, a green juice, applied a liberal amount of Kiehl’s Crème de Corps on my body, Glossier hyaluronic serum to my face, Elizabeth Arden lip balm and still felt parched from the inside out. For the next 36 hours, I continued to chug water and apply copious amounts of moisturizer because of a phantom sense of saltiness.

New technologies like electric and autonomously driven vehicles are forcing major changes while the center of gravity in the car business is shifting toward Asia. “There is a lot of fluidity in the entire industry space, which is what these players see,” Mr. Wells said.

In an interview at a pub called The Grenadier in London, Mr. Ratcliffe explained that terminating the much-loved Defender would create demand for a replacement because it “had left quite a hole in the marketplace.” He criticized the many SUVs still being sold as “jelly molds” that all look alike.

Mr. Ratcliffe owns two versions of the Defender — one from 1955 and a so-called Heritage model made near the end of its production run. He said he wants to preserve the Defender’s boxy, military-style ruggedness.

Toby Ecuyer, a yacht designer, has the job of turning Mr. Ratcliffe’s ideas into drawings. “What we are trying to design is something extremely utilitarian,” not a luxury vehicle, he said.

Mr. Ratcliffe conceded that the new vehicle will need updates to meet global safety and emission standards, including in the United States, where its sales stopped in 1997. He said he planned to make about 25,000 vehicles a year — about the number of Defenders sold in 2015, the year before its production was halted.

Jaguar Land Rover, which is owned by Tata, an India-based conglomerate, has found success with luxury models like the Range Rover. The company said in a statement that it had plans for the Defender and would pay close attention to any actions regarding its “proprietary rights.”

Mr. Ratcliffe built a $40 billion per year petrochemical empire called Ineos by buying chemical plants that other companies wanted to discard and then running them more efficiently. He said he can also find cheaper ways to operate a car company as well.

According to his team, for instance, European manufacturers had already expressed an interest in either building his car on contract or selling him a fully equipped plant. Either way, that would help limit upfront investment and risk. He said he did not want to put in more than 600 million pounds — less than the $1 billion analysts estimate that development and production of a new model typically costs.

Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, director of the CAR center at the University of Duisburg-Essen in Germany, said he doubted that an updated version of an old concept would have appeal beyond a dwindling group of enthusiasts. A few would buy Mr. Ratcliffe’s car, he said, but it would “become a niche which gets smaller over time.”

Mr. Dyson has been much more guarded about his plans. “It’s not a sports car and not a very cheap car,” he told reporters at his company store on London’s bustling Oxford Street in late September. He recounted that in the 1990s he had designed a device for cleaning truck exhaust but received a cool reception from vehicle manufacturers. Instead, he focused his efforts on electric motors and batteries, hoping that one day he could step up to cars.

He has reached that point. Mr. Dyson has purchased a World War II-era airfield near his company’s headquarters in Malmesbury, in southern England, where the development work will continue. He said the new vehicle will offer a “radical” electric motor design that he said would be more efficient than those available on the market now.

Mr. Dyson has proved himself a dogged inventor, designing high-end vacuum cleaners and other products like hair dryers. His technological savvy gives him a chance of scoring a hit in the much more complex and costly global car industry, analysts said. In 2015, he bought Sakti3, an American start-up that is working with solid state batteries. Mr. Dyson said he could be on track to commercializing a so-called solid state battery, which analysts say might be more powerful and safer than the lithium ion devices now used in electric cars and cellphones. He said both the start-up and his own team were working on the project.

“The edge that Dyson have if they do have an edge is to possibly be ahead of the game in solid state batteries,” said Philippe Houchois, an auto analyst at Jefferies, an investment bank.

As nascent as they are, the plans Mr. Dyson has laid out will be expensive, particularly for a medium-size company like Dyson. Mr. Dyson said he would spend £1 billion on the car and another £1 billion on the battery — a lot of money for a company that reported £2.5 billion in revenue last year.

He may need to spend more. Tesla, for instance, has already spent about $6 billion, according to analysts’ estimates.

Mr. Dyson said he planned to develop not only a new motor but a new chassis. “We are starting from scratch,” he said. “There isn’t one that is suitable.”

Electric cars are clearly a high-risk venture. Mr. Houchois said none of the vehicles on the market, including those made by Tesla, which recently reported disappointing production numbers on its new Model 3, are making money for their owners. Dyson may seek to bring costs down by manufacturing in Asia, where it already makes appliances.

Still, whatever his reputation, Mr. Dyson has set himself a formidable task. “It is one thing to design and manufacture a household item,” said R. A. Farrokhnia, a professor at the business and engineering schools at Columbia University. “And quite another to prototype and then build a complex electric vehicle.”",An Electric Car and a Rugged Throwback: The Dreams of 2 Rich Britons,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/automobiles/wheels/startup-car-markers.html

Diane Cook and Len Jenshel present some answers in their new book, “Wise Trees,” which will be published by Abrams in October.
They were in Japan documenting a nighttime cherry tree ritual when Ms. Cook learned that her father was dying.
“Taking that strength from the trees, we had this idea of looking at wise trees around the world,” said Ms. Cook.
I need to go back to that tree,’” Ms. Cook recalled.","Trees can live without us, but we cannot live without trees.

With a history dating back to the dinosaurs, trees are the planet’s documentarians, watching us cycle through life while providing oxygen, shade and shelter. Trees, the oldest of which, according to Peter Wohlleben’s “The Hidden Life of Trees,” has 9,500 years, are a critical part of the human experience. We rely on them, from their deep roots to fluttering leaves.

But — at least when we’re not cutting them down — how do we influence trees? Diane Cook and Len Jenshel present some answers in their new book, “Wise Trees,” which will be published by Abrams in October. Traveling to more than 70 locations, they found trees that represent “landscapes of complexity where nature and humanity converge.” In other words, trees with stories, like the young sycamore that witnessed the Civil War, or the elm that survived the Oklahoma City bombing. These photos show how events have shaped trees, their energy, and sometimes, literally, the shape of their limbs.

“Forty-million trees are being lost every day,” said Mr. Jenshel. “We love the environment and wanted to do something that would make people think differently about trees.”

Though Mr. Jenshel and Ms. Cook — who are married, collaborate on all their projects and frequently finish each other’s sentences — have a long history of photographing trees, a much more personal seed for their project was planted in the spring of 2012. They were in Japan documenting a nighttime cherry tree ritual when Ms. Cook learned that her father was dying. Struggling to process the information, she found herself watching the fragile petals of the cherry blossoms slowly drift to the ground, one by one.

“We did what the Japanese have been doing for centuries,” said Ms. Cook. “To take in that beauty, appreciate its ephemeral nature, and know that life does go on.”

Her father died soon after, but a new project was born, influenced by the cherry blossoms and a National Geographic magazine commission. “Taking that strength from the trees, we had this idea of looking at wise trees around the world,” said Ms. Cook. “And the importance trees have had throughout history in so many cultures.”

After the Sept. 11 attacks, search and rescue workers were looking for human remains among the rubble, when they found part of a Callery pear tree, which traditionally is the first tree to bloom in spring and the last to change leaves in autumn. Though its trunk was scorched and many branches missing, the tree had survived the attacks. Now a symbol of strength and survival, the pear tree was nursed back to health at a Bronx nursery and, nearly a decade later, replanted at the World Trade Center memorial.

Other trees have been a part of unspeakable cruelties. From 1846 to 1870, in Goliad, Tex., an oak known as “The Hanging Tree,” provided shade for court sessions and branches for lynching.

“It’s not always a happy story,” said Ms. Cook.

One of the rain or monkeypod trees in Cambodia (imported from South or Central America), was isolated from the others as “The Killing Tree.” In 1975 when Pol Pot’s murderous rule started, the tree was used to bash children’s heads while their mothers were forced to watch.

“It took us days to recover from that experience of photographing that tree,” said Ms. Cook. “That left the deepest scar on us.”

Other trees seem to travel, and quite far. It is not clear how the adansonia gregorii (or boab) tree got to Western Australia. Perhaps it was the result of seeds dropped from the fruits by early migrants. It was a good thing, though, for the local aboriginals who used the tree as a spiritual home and lifeline, since it can hold up to 26 gallons of water.

In India, from the ancient tree deities to current bodhis of enlightenment, most trees are seen as sacred. In a Varanasi sweet shop, they found a neem tree, said to cure all ailments. Long after they shot the photo, Ms. Cook noticed her spouse’s anxiety.

“Len kept saying, ‘I don’t think we got the picture. I need to go back to that tree,’” Ms. Cook recalled. “I totally knew it was about the sweets.”

Dark side of a self-help group.

Since the late 1990s, an estimated 16,000 people have enrolled in courses offered by Nxivm, an organization that says it offers a chance to achieve fulfillment by eliminating psychological and emotional barriers.

But scores of members are leaving, and interviews portray a group engaged in disturbing practices.

Our reporter in Albany, where the group is based, describes an initiation ritual in which women were required to submit naked photographs or other compromising materials. The women were then branded.

Several former members have asked the New York authorities to investigate the group’s practices, but officials have declined to pursue action.

The “Who Shot J. R.?” season finale of “Dallas” was, for me, the greatest TV cliffhanger of all time.
HEALY Watching the new “Dynasty,” I missed the old “Dynasty.” The new versions of both “Dynasty” and “Dallas” go young with their actors.
But the “Dallas” reboot still had J. R., Sue Ellen and Bobby, and they were up to their old tricks and in fine form.
If only Joan Collins wasreprising her role as Alexis in the “Dynasty” reboot, as a cougar to middle-aged Blake!","JACOBS A fig stuffed with goat cheese and wrapped in prosciutto! As played by Pamela Sue Martin (familiar to me from a terrifying afternoon watching “The Poseidon Adventure”), Fallon was my favorite character on the show: intelligent, free-spirited and sexually liberated.

Yes, she was a spoiled brat with an Elektra complex, but also a feminist who wasn’t about to let any man tell her how to live her life, a working mother who single-handedly turns around Blake’s hotel, La Mirage. The chemistry between her and the staid, dependable Jeff Colby (John James) was intoxicating to my preadolescent self.

HEALY Fallon the working mother … hmmm … there are working mothers and then there are Carrington working mothers. And I’m not sure “feminist” is the first word I’d use for someone who was so demeaning and spiteful (at least at first) to other women.

For me, Fallon represented a central flaw of “Dynasty.” The show was a portrait of wealth, glamour, conspicuous consumption and narcissism — nothing more, really. Everyone wanted Blake’s love and money, and to a lesser extent Cecil Colby’s. The sexual politics became increasingly problematic, too: While the men schemed and sabotaged, the women fought over men in lily ponds and apartments.

“Dallas” felt richer for its focus on family and betrayal. (It was not above a pool fight, but those usually involved men.)

Both shows did have great villains. How would you rate J. R. and Joan Collins’s Alexis?

JACOBS No contest. J. R. felt irritatingly underplayed, with a rushed mumbling delivery. His predilection for the insults “slut,” “loser,” “drunk” and “saddle tramp” got old fast.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

HEALY Alexis called Krystle “you bitch!” a fair amount too. Those lines were juvenile, but I was juvenile, and they made me laugh.

JACOBS And she managed to make “whore” a two-syllable word! Alexis was over the top but she was both always herself and constantly changing — and not just outfits. She rolled with whatever crazy story line the writers came up with (quite literally, in the case of the infamous mud-wrestling scene). And she always committed 100 percent, whether it was to singing a rendition of Frank Loesser’s “The Boys in the Back Room” à la Marlene Dietrich or falling off a balcony with Dex in the last season’s final episode.

Which brings us to cliffhangers. Sashaying down memory lane with you made me realize how much the experience of watching television has changed, from once-a-week treat to isolated bingeing-and-tweeting. Who the heck shot J. R., anyway?

HEALY J. R. took it in the chest from his mistress Kristin Shepard (Mary Crosby), Sue Ellen’s scheming sister. That guy was such a dirty dog, but he was also one of the first prime-time villains that viewers loved to hate. He was a forerunner to antiheroes like Tony Soprano, Walter White and Cersei Lannister.

The “Who Shot J. R.?” season finale of “Dallas” was, for me, the greatest TV cliffhanger of all time. It came in March 1980; it wasn’t until November that Kristin was unmasked as the shooter. During the intervening months, everyone from President Carter to Vegas oddsmakers weighed in on J. R. The watercooler energy was enormous. While other television shows had fan followings, “Dallas” demonstrated that you could keep viewers in thrall for much of a year without any new episodes.

“Dynasty” had its own cliffhangers. I’ll bet you a Dean & DeLuca coffee that we agree on the most memorable one.

JACOBS Well, it has deeply uncomfortable resonance right now, but the Moldavian Massacre was the most memorable to me. That was truly scary: terrorists, shattering glass, bloodied bodies. Better make it a martini.

HEALY Gruesome images — and then, cue the credits.

JACOBS It took place during a royal wedding, with the bride, Amanda Carrington, played by real-life royalty, Catherine Oxenberg. Somehow the “Dy” in “Dynasty” was all bound up in my head with Princess Diana, and her own royal wedding to Prince Charles (never mind that the English pronounced it “Din-asty”). Obviously this was a time of conservatism and convention and backlash to the progressivism of the ’60s and ’70s.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

HEALY The depiction of so many women on “Dallas” as sexual objects and playthings definitely ran counter to progressivism. But “Dynasty” and “Dallas” could be topical, too.

JACOBS “Dynasty” moved the national conversation forward on homosexuality. Steven Carrington is immediately introduced as being attracted to men, and despite tentativeness in how the show presented his orientation, one felt the creators were basically on his side — don’t you think? He was a likable and complex character, not a caricature.

Then, of course, Rock Hudson’s death shortly after appearing on the show provoked national hysteria that he might have infected Linda Evans with H.I.V. by kissing her, which led to important education about how the disease is actually transmitted.

It was dismissed for being superficial but was actually right on top of the issues! And it had a few African-American cast members, notably the great Diahann Carroll as the mega-glam Dominique Deveraux. Did “Dallas” have a single minority?

HEALY “Dallas” was an extraordinarily white show. For a state as racially and ethnically diverse as Texas, the series really failed by reducing people of color to servants and waitresses.

It did strive for some social relevancy, though, with its portrait of alcoholism. Sue Ellen struggled for years to get sober and stay sober: J. R. made serenity impossible, but it was really Sue Ellen’s battle with low self-esteem, betrayal, envy and self-loathing that proved painful to watch through her relapses — but ultimately pretty inspiring as she achieved stretches of sobriety.

With the stabs at realism came the fantastical. I speak, of course, about the Mortal Sin of “Dallas” — the entire season of episodes that was retroactively labeled a “dream” of Pam’s to explain Bobby’s death and subsequent reappearance in her shower. What was the best twist of “Dynasty”?

JACOBS I don’t recall anything as shocking as the gasp-inducing “scar” reveal by Marcia Cross on “Melrose Place,” but the return of regular-guy Matthew Blaisdel at the end of Season 7 was certainly unexpected. It was no surprise whatsoever to me, though, at that point, that he had elected to hold the Carrington family hostage.

And speaking of “Melrose,” that brings us to the current reboot, which stars Grant Show as Blake. How do you think it will stack up against the “Dallas” one a few years ago?

HEALY Watching the new “Dynasty,” I missed the old “Dynasty.” The new versions of both “Dynasty” and “Dallas” go young with their actors. But the “Dallas” reboot still had J. R., Sue Ellen and Bobby, and they were up to their old tricks and in fine form. If only Joan Collins wasreprising her role as Alexis in the “Dynasty” reboot, as a cougar to middle-aged Blake!

He said the Assembly had created a committee in August to establish new rules aimed at cracking down on sexual harassment or intimidation.
“The letter shows that sexual harassment is as prevalent in the Capitol as it is anywhere else in society,” Mr. Rendon said.
She said until now women had routinely engaged on quiet rescue missions to help women caught what she described as predatory situations while working in lawmakers’ offices.
“The kind of sexism and misogynism that is pervasive in our culture is definitely prevalent in Sacramento,” Mr. Wiener said.","“Men have groped and touched us without our consent, made inappropriate comments about our bodies and our abilities,” the letter said, adding: “Why didn’t we speak out? Sometimes out of fear. Sometimes out of shame. Often these men hold our professional fates in their hands.”

The California legislature has set the national agenda on a variety of issues, including the environment, immigration and taxes. Although the state has produced a number of powerful female politicians, about 80 percent of the legislature is male.

Cristina Garcia, a Democratic member of the state Assembly who signed the letter, said Tuesday she has been routinely accosted by men who harassed her and made comments about her appearance while she was trying to discuss legislation.

“Multiple people have grabbed my butt and grabbed my breasts,” she said. “We’re talking about senior lobbyists and lawmakers.”

Ms. Garcia, and the other women who came forward, did not name the lobbyists or lawmakers involved in the encounters. The letter was first published in The Los Angeles Times on Tuesday morning.

Pamela Lopez, a partner at a Sacramento lobbying firm, said that for years she has dealt with inappropriate suggestions from male officials, but the most disturbing episode came early last year, at a social gathering of lawmakers and lobbyists in a Sacramento bar.

As Ms. Lopez walked into the restroom, she said, she felt a large body pressing behind her. When she turned around, she saw that a lawmaker had locked the door behind him, had undone his pants and asked her to touch his genitals.

“He had exposed himself and begun masturbating,” she said. “All I was thinking was what do I do, what do I do. And of course, I didn’t want to cause a scene.”

“I said, ‘No, I am not going to touch you,’ ” she said. “I was firm and clear but I did not want to make a scene and he continued to masturbate and he kind of moved toward me and said, ‘Just put your hand on me.’ I said no.”

Karen Skelton, a political strategist and lawyer in Sacramento who signed the letter, said she experienced harassment firsthand when she was hired by a Fortune 500 company six years ago to run a campaign on behalf of a major legislative initiative. Her job included dealing with an elected California official involved with the issue.

“This guy did things to me like touch my leg under the table at lunch and brush back my hair over my shoulder and sending me texts at 1 in the morning asking where I was,” she said, declining to name him. “I felt creeped out. I’m a big girl. I can deal with it. What if I had been 22, someone new to this, who needed to support their family?”

There has been a long and notorious history of sexual misconduct in state houses and Congress going back over at least the past 50 years. Many state Capitols are famous for being old boys’ clubs. Many, including the one in Sacramento, are in relatively isolated parts of the state, away from family, friends and onlookers, in a culture marked by late-night dinners and drinking.

Albany, the New York capital, has had an outsize reputation for sexual misbehavior, exemplified by an episode in 2012 in which Assemblyman Vito J. Lopez, a powerful Brooklyn Democrat, was found to have sexually harassed female staff members. The leader of the State Assembly at the time, Sheldon Silver, was harshly criticized for keeping Mr. Lopez’s behavior, and financial settlements to victims, secret, perhaps allowing additional women to be abused. Mr. Lopez resigned in 2013, and the Assembly enacted a series of reforms, including mandatory reporting of any complaint of sexual harassment, an independent investigator and a ban on confidential settlements.

Christine Pelosi, a signer of the letter who is the leader of the California Democratic Women’s Caucus, said that legislators “act differently in Sacramento — which is almost fantasy camp — as opposed to how they act as home.”.

Anthony Rendon, the speaker of the California State Assembly, said he did not think the Assembly ethics committee, which handles charges of sexual misconduct, could launch an investigation based on the letter, because it did not mention any names of offenders. He said the Assembly had created a committee in August to establish new rules aimed at cracking down on sexual harassment or intimidation.

“The letter shows that sexual harassment is as prevalent in the Capitol as it is anywhere else in society,” Mr. Rendon said.

Samantha Corbin, a lobbyist and former legislative aide who helped organize the drive, said many of the California women who signed the letter had overcome fears of retaliation, emboldened by the women who related their stories about Mr. Weinstein in stories published by The New York Times and The New Yorker.

She said until now women had routinely engaged on quiet rescue missions to help women caught what she described as predatory situations while working in lawmakers’ offices.

“We give each other tips on how to avoid certain situation – who might exercise predatory behavior,” she said.

“You are talking about power brokers in the largest state in the country,” she said.

Ms. Pelosi, who is the daughter of Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader of the House of Representatives, said it was difficult for many of the women to sign the letter. “I understand the courage of these women – Republicans and Democrats – coming forward. It is very, very, very hard.”

Kevin de Leon, the president of the state Senate, issued a statement saying he applauded “the courage of women working in and around the Capitol who are coming forward and making their voices known.”

Mr. de Leon, who announced this week he was running for the Senate, did not say whether he was aware of these kinds of episodes and did not return a request for comment.

Scott Wiener, a newly elected member of the state Senate, said he had been struck by the culture he had found since coming to Sacramento. “The kind of sexism and misogynism that is pervasive in our culture is definitely prevalent in Sacramento,” Mr. Wiener said.

New allegations of harassment have emerged in other states in recent days, too. Teresa Tanzi, a Democratic state representative in Rhode Island, said on Tuesday that a male lawmaker who outranked her once told her “that if I want to see my bills advance, there was one thing I could do to make that happen.”

“It was stated very matter of factly that if I would have sex with this person, it would increase the likelihood of my bills passing,” Ms. Tanzi said in an interview, although she declined to name the lawmaker or specify when the comment was made.

And even if governments are able to head off organized plots like the Paris attacks of 2015, officials around the globe concede that they have almost no way of stopping lone wolf assaults inspired or enabled by Islamic State propaganda that lives online.

“It is clear that we are contending with an intense U.K. terrorist threat from Islamist extremists,” Andrew Parker, the director of Britain’s MI5 intelligence service, said in a speech on Tuesday. “That threat is multidimensional, evolving rapidly, and operating at a scale and pace we’ve not seen before.”

American and European counterterrorism officials acknowledge that they do not know the exact capabilities the Islamic State retains, or how much the appeal of the group’s ideology has been dented by its string of heavy military defeats.

Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, predicted last month that the loss of territory would precipitate a loss of credibility. “We’ll continue to see reduction in territory, reduction in freedom of movement, reduced resources and less credibility in the narrative,” he told a Senate hearing.

Others are less sanguine. They point to a speech by the Islamic State spokesman Abu Muhammed al-Adnani, before his death in an American drone strike last year, urging the group’s followers to fight on as a lean, agile insurgency instead of the bureaucratic juggernaut it had become.

“True defeat is the loss of willpower and desire to fight,” he said. “We would be defeated and you victorious only if you were able to remove the Quran from the Muslims’ hearts.”","With Loss of Its Caliphate, ISIS May Return to Guerrilla Roots",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/world/middleeast/islamic-state-territory-attacks.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Last year, Paul Beatty became the first American to win when he received the prize for “The Sellout,” a dark satire about race and the legacy of slavery and segregation in America. Mr. Saunders and Mr. Beatty both won for books that wrestle with deeply American themes and painful chapters of the country’s history. This year, three of the six finalists were American, which prompted another round of criticism that emerging British and Commonwealth writers were being overlooked.

Speaking on behalf of the judges, Ms. Young dismissed the notion that Americans have colonized Britain’s most prestigious literary award.

“We don’t look at the nationality of the writer,” she said. “We’re solely concerned with the book, with what that book is telling us.”

Until recently, the Man Booker, which was first awarded in 1969, was restricted to novels written by authors from Britain, Ireland and the Commonwealth nations. In 2014, the contest was opened to any novel written in English and published in Britain. Past winners include Margaret Atwood, Kazuo Ishiguro, V .S. Naipaul and Hilary Mantel.

The expansion of the prize parameters has drawn criticism from some in the literary world, who warned that the Booker would lose its British character with the incursion of American writers. After Mr. Beatty won last year, a group of writers, including Julian Barnes and A. S. Byatt, denounced the decision to let Americans compete. Ron Charles, a book critic for The Washington Post, criticized the list of finalists for being overly American, writing that “for any serious reader of fiction in this country, the Americanization of the Booker Prize is a lost opportunity to learn about great books that haven’t already been widely heralded.”

In addition to Mr. Saunders, the other Americans to make the list of finalists were Paul Auster, who was nominated for “4321,” an epic narrative that tells a Jewish boy’s coming-of-age story in four different versions; and Emily Fridlund, for her debut novel, “History of Wolves,” about a teenage girl growing up in a commune in the Midwest.

The other finalists were the British novelist Fiona Mozley, whose debut novel “Elmet,” centers on a single father raising his teenage children in rural Yorkshire; the British-Pakistani writer Mohsin Hamid, nominated for “Exit West,” a surreal, dystopian story about two refugees fleeing a civil war through magic doors; and the British novelist Ali Smith, whose novel “Autumn,” about the relationship between a middle-aged British woman and an elderly man, explores the rise of British nationalism. Ms. Smith, who has been shortlisted for the Booker four times, was considered a favorite to win this year.

“Lincoln in the Bardo” won near-universal praise from reviewers when it was released in February, and became a No. 1 best seller. In a review in The New York Times, Michiko Kakutani wrote that “Saunders’s extraordinary verbal energy is harnessed, for the most part, in the service of capturing the pathos of everyday life.”

Before he wrote “Lincoln in the Bardo,” Mr. Saunders, 58, was best known for his dark and often funny futuristic, dystopian short stories. Born in Amarillo, Tex., and raised in and near Chicago, Mr. Saunders never imagined growing up that he could one day write for a living. He got a degree in geophysics from the Colorado School of Mines, then worked as a geophysicist in Indonesia, where he read to keep himself occupied at a remote camp. When he returned to the United States, he supported himself with odd jobs, working as a doorman, a roofer, in a convenience store and in a slaughterhouse.

He eventually enrolled in an M.F.A. program at Syracuse University, and in 1996, he published his debut fiction collection, “CivilWarLand in Bad Decline,” which established him as an innovative writer with a dark, demented streak. He went on to publish several other collections and novellas, including his widely celebrated 2013 short story collection, “Tenth of December.”

Mr. Saunders first got the idea for “Lincoln in the Bardo” in the late 1990s, when he was visiting Washington, and his wife’s cousin pointed out the crypt, and told him the story about how Lincoln would visit his son’s body. The story stayed with him for some 20 years, but felt too daunting. Finally, in 2012, he began to work on the novel.

“This is an idea that obsessed him for a long time,” said Andy Ward, Mr. Saunders’s editor and the editor in chief of Random House. “This book was something that I hadn’t seen before.”

Mr. Saunders, a Tibetan Buddhist, drew on the Buddhist notion of the bardo — the phase of existence between death and rebirth — bringing a supernatural layer to the historical setting. With the chorus of ghosts in the cemetery, Mr. Saunders tied Lincoln’s suffering to a universal human plight of mortality and loss, giving it an epic, mythical quality.

“For me, the book was about that terrible conundrum: We seem to be born to love, but everything we love comes to an end,” Mr. Saunders said in an email interview with The New York Times Book Review. “What do we do with that?”",George Saunders Wins the Man Booker Prize for ‘Lincoln in the Bardo’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/books/george-saunders-wins-man-booker-prize-lincoln-in-the-bardo.html

The key to the app’s convenience is also its downside: A person who is a friend of yours on Facebook can add you to a GroupMe chat without your consent.

Last November, news of the “Mud Men” chat spread like wildfire.

Students started noticing the racist chat on the morning of Nov. 11 when freshmen who were targeted posted screenshots of the threats on Twitter, Facebook and Snapchat, forcing students inside the Penn bubble — and plenty outside of it — to pay attention. Black organizations sent a barrage of emails and texts to their constituencies about the situation and began to plan for an emergency town hall. By the afternoon, the news had been picked up by national civil rights activists, including Shaun King and DeRay Mckesson. The news was trending on Twitter for hours before the school issued an official response.

There was a palpable uncertainty in the air that day. Was the chat to be taken as a serious threat to the well-being of Penn’s black freshmen and in turn, Penn’s black community? Or was it a joke that got too serious to take back? The motive is still unclear, but the incident certainly made students fearful.

The university was clear in its condemnation of hate and hate speech on Penn’s campus, but the official response came after news had spread to local law enforcement and the media, and after students of color had already met to debrief and discuss the situation.

That problem is not exclusive to the University of Pennsylvania: Many schools are unable to keep up with how quickly the world moves in this digital era.

Don’t get me wrong: Some of the key supporters of black student groups were faculty members who were instrumental in making sure that everyone felt safe and supported and that proper resources were being applied to figuring out who was responsible for the chat’s existence. I just wish that the university had taken steps publicly to support its black students much sooner than it did.

Maybe it sounds unreasonable to expect a college administration to keep up with the speed of internet discourse. But when several campus groups organized walkouts, demonstrations, rallies and marches to signal solidarity with black students, it took the Penn administration several days to publicly join and support the actions.

Black and brown students need more than official statements of concern to feel safe and welcome in college. The GroupMe incident provides a pretty good example of how amorphous online threats can still be powerfully targeted at us in terrifyingly specific ways.

The racist chat appeared to have been created in Oklahoma, but for the creator to have known so many members of the black freshman class, he or she would have to have been at Penn. So black students immediately assumed it was coming from somewhere on campus. There were multiple individuals who were taunting students on this chat, and all were anonymized by pseudonyms. So the big questions were: How many people were involved? Would they act on their covert threats? How much of the population of the school did they speak for? The chats also included a racial taunt that invoked the fraternity Sigma Alpha Epsilon, some chapters of which have been shut down at other campuses for racist behavior. (The Penn S.A.E. chapter immediately denounced the online attacks.)

Working with the F.B.I., the administration was able to identify the creator of the GroupMe chat within a few weeks — a student at the University of Oklahoma who had been accepted to Penn but chose not to attend. The student was suspended, and both the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Oklahoma issued condemnations of his actions. Ultimately, the investigation found that no Penn students were involved in the chat. But these kinds of incidents make black and brown students increasingly wary.

GroupMe is an important method of communication among hall mates, study group partners, band members, fraternity brothers and sometimes entire classes. It’s not as if we can just stop using the app to avoid racism.

An anonymous attack on GroupMe doesn’t feel that different from racist propaganda in “real life.” Just a few months ago, someone put up neo-Nazi recruitment fliers around campus. They were promptly removed, but the incident had an important thing in common with the GroupMe disaster: anonymity.

The creator of the GroupMe and the people who hung the fliers hid their names and faces, putting the students they were targeting in the precarious position of questioning who to trust.

Who is to blame for a faceless flier or for anonymous internet trolling? Either incident could be indicative of the racist opinions of one person or of many.

Victorians abound. South of Montauk Highway, the main east-west thoroughfare, grandes dames are set back on deep lots along broad, shady avenues stretching south to the bay.

“A sprinkling of homes have docks,” said Andrea Casey, a salesperson with Century 21 Bay’s Edge Realty. While most of the coastline is reserved for commercial and public use, houses along Sunset Drive and West Lane back up to canals.

At the tip of Foster Avenue, Sayville Marina Park’s three tennis courts, sandy beach and boat docks dominate the waterfront. Nearby, manicured gardens and a gazebo at Land’s End Caterers provide a picturesque bay-front setting for weddings, said Manon Compitello, an associate broker with Douglas Elliman Real Estate who lives in Sayville.

What You’ll Pay

“We get a lot of first-time home buyers who want to be in Sayville,” said Leesa Byrnes, broker-owner of Leesa Byrnes Realty. A three-bedroom, two-bath ranch in good shape on a quarter-acre lot, she said, will run between $375,000 and $400,000. Homes that need work range from the low- to mid-$300,000s, while trade-up homes with four bedrooms and two and a half baths on half-acre lots will cost about $650,000.

On Oct. 11, there were 39 houses and nine condominiums on the market. The priciest, at $1,199,000, was a restored five-bedroom 1890 Victorian with an in-ground pool on a half-acre. The least expensive, at $245,000, was a two-bedroom, one-level condo at the age-restricted Sunrise Village, a gated community built in 1987.

Good schools are a draw, Ms. Compitello said, and because Sayville is not incorporated, “you get all the benefits of a town without a village tax.”

But “one of our biggest struggles is our lack of inventory” coupled with “lots of buyers,” she added, noting that homes are selling faster and at higher prices than a year ago. The average sales price in 2017, through Oct. 11, was $453,736, a 5.8 percent increase over the average price of the same period the previous year, $428,691.

The Vibe

Locals buzz about plans for the former Island Hills Golf Club, at the hamlet’s northern edge. Developers Gregg and Mitchell D. Rechler, who bought the property last year, have been meeting with community groups, hoping to change the single-family zoning to build Greybarn, a multifamily rental community with 1,378 apartments “geared to keep millennials and downsizers close to home,” Gregg Rechler said.

Clustered in three- and four-story buildings, with rooflines and eaves resembling large Hamptons-style summer houses, the property is being designed to “benefit the people who already live in the community, as well as the residents who live in Greybarn,” Mr. Rechler said. A 22-acre “perimeter park around the property that equates to a two-mile walking and bike trail will have various pocket parks as it goes along,” he continued, including a playground, an exercise park and a dog park. Plans also call for a community farm, a pond, multiple swimming pools and a large clubhouse with a fitness center and screening rooms.

A shuttle will take residents from Greybarn to stores and restaurants downtown.

Students in kindergarten through grade five attend Cherry Avenue Elementary School, Lincoln Avenue Elementary School or Sunrise Drive Elementary School. Grades six to eight are served by Sayville Middle School. Students move up to Sayville High School for grades nine to 12.

Some Sayville properties are zoned for the Connetquot Central School District.

The Commute

Commuters to Manhattan, 56 miles west, can catch a train at the Sayville station on the Babylon branch of the Long Island Rail Road. Rush-hour rides to Penn Station take from an hour and 16 minutes to an hour and 40 minutes. Most trips to Manhattan require changing trains in Jamaica or Babylon. The monthly fare is $391.

The History

Once the South Side Railroad reached Sayville in 1868, the hamlet became a summer resort. Actors and actresses stayed in hotels and rented houses in the area. From 1909 to 1919, a seasonal trolley — initially horse-drawn, later electric — connected the railroad station with hotels along Candee Avenue, said George J. Munkenbeck, the Islip town historian.","Sayville, N.Y.: A Walkable Downtown and Victorians by the Bay",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/realestate/living-in-sayville-ny.html

“People are stuck on the fact that they don’t like sweet wines,” Mr. Johnnes said after the dinner.
For this reason, I’ve always believed that the conventional wisdom — white wine with fish and poultry, red wine with meat — is not a bad place to start.
Wine With Cheese The final fusty belief is that cheese goes best with red wine.
It seems to me that many people now understand that white wine usually is a better match.","Sweet white wines ranging from barely sweet to luscious can be glorious with food. The key is balance: The residual sugar in the wine, often caused by incomplete fermentation, must be countered by lively acidity. In successful bottles, the result is a thrilling tightrope walk as the wine treads the line between sweet and dry. These wines are indisputably sweet, but the acidity cleans away any cloying sensation, leaving a dry, refreshing feeling after swallowing.

Good examples are certain German rieslings (another myth is that all German rieslings are sweet — not remotely true!) and demi-sec Vouvrays. For a course of foie gras and guinea hen terrine, Josh MacGregor of DB Bistro Moderne picked two Mosel rieslings from the Wehlener Sonnenuhr vineyard, a 2015 Dr. Loosen spätlese and a 2007 J.J. Prüm kabinett.

This stacked the deck a bit. Traditionally, foie gras is served with unctuously sweet wines like Sauternes. Even so, many of the diners seemed unpersuaded.

“People are stuck on the fact that they don’t like sweet wines,” Mr. Johnnes said after the dinner. “I don’t understand that. We’re such a sweet culture.”

Serving Temperatures It’s sadly an article of faith that many restaurants, and homes for that matter, will serve white wines too cold and red wines too warm.

It’s easy to see where this comes from. White wines are generally served cooler than reds, and in an era of refrigerators and ice, this has come to mean ice-cold. Reds, meanwhile, are to be served at “room temperature,” a term derived at a time when many rooms had thick stone walls, and the indoor temperature may have hovered around 60 degrees.

Serving whites too cold seriously compromises good bottles, muffling nuances and complexities. Conversely, mediocre whites ought to be served ice-cold; the temperature masks any flaws.

If you are knocking back the house pinot grigio at the corner bar, make sure the bottle comes directly from the refrigerator. For a fine white, though, take it out of the fridge a good half-hour before serving, and in restaurants, do not reflexively allow the bottle to be put on ice. Take its temperature first.

Reds are a bit trickier, depending on the age and texture of the wine. Ideally, a bottle should be slightly cool to the touch. Modern room temperature can often leave a good red seeming flabby or fatiguing. A slight chill is bracing to the wine. Tannic wines served too cold can seem tough and unpleasant. If a bottle seems too warm, 15 minutes in the fridge — or, at a restaurant, 10 minutes in an ice bucket — can work wonders.

For a complicated dish of potato gnocchi with sweetbreads, chanterelles and runner beans, Joe Robitaille of Bar Boulud and Boulud Sud picked two unusual wines: a rich, textured, amber-colored 2009 from Domaine Economou in Crete, made of the obscure vilana and thrapsathiri grapes, and a pinot noir from the Jura, the 2015 Arbois Les Gaudrettes from Domaine de Saint Pierre. These were excellent examples, and each benefited greatly from the correct serving temperature.

Unconventional Food Pairings Few wine issues cause so much anxiety as putting together food and wine. For this reason, I’ve always believed that the conventional wisdom — white wine with fish and poultry, red wine with meat — is not a bad place to start.

But as people become more confident, they quickly find the exceptions. Northern Rhône syrahs are beautiful with chicken, as is pinot noir or cabernet franc with duck. Seafood is another matter, and certain meatier specimens like salmon, tuna or octopus go well with light reds like pinot noir.

For a dish of salmon with figs and fennel in a red-wine sauce, Aaron Fusco of Café Boulud picked two less-conventional reds, a 2014 cabernet sauvignon and a 2014 merlot from the Carneros region of Sonoma County, both from Inconnu Wine.

Mr. Fusco’s underlying motive may have been to demonstrate that not all California reds are big and powerful. These were both delightfully fresh, the cabernet snappy and the merlot soft. They went well with the salmon, and though I might have preferred a pinot noir, the wines made their points.

Fine Vintage Fixations I have met too many people who will buy fine wines only from vintages that critics deem great. This may be a fine strategy for investors — those who buy great wines with the intent of reselling for a profit — but for people who simply want to enjoy good wines, it is a mistake, and sometimes a costly one.

Burgundy lovers who bought the 2005s and refused the 2007s have missed out on a lot of pleasure as they have waited, and perhaps lost patience, with the ’05s. Bordeaux drinkers who favored the 2000 and 2010 vintages over the ’01s and ’11s may have had similar experiences. If you buy wines with long-term aging in mind (20 years or more), then by all means focus on the best vintages. Keep in mind that what constitutes a great vintage is often a matter of opinion.

This was borne out in a course of squab with currants. Mr. Johnnes and Raj Vaidya of Daniel picked two Côte-Rôties, a Domaine Ogier from 2010, an excellent vintage, and a Domaine Jamet from 2011, not a bad vintage though not as good as 2010.

Even accounting for the different styles of the producers, the 2011 was far more giving, offering a chorus of savory flavors, while the 2010 was tight and reticent. I’m not sure how both of these wines will fare in another decade. At this tasting, one was a wine of pleasure, the other a wine of potential.

Wine With Cheese The final fusty belief is that cheese goes best with red wine. Does anyone still follow this? It seems to me that many people now understand that white wine usually is a better match. People have become so dogmatic about this that I wrote a column a few years ago making the case that once in a while, red wine is still a good choice.

Apparently, this battle is still being fought at the Boulud restaurants. So, with two goat cheeses, one from France and one from Vermont, Ian Smedley, who had been sommelier at DBGB until it closed in August, chose a 2013 L’Etoile from Domaine de Montbourgeau in the Jura, made of chardonnay and savagnin, and an unusual sour ale, Sakura from Carton Brewing in Atlantic Highlands, N.J.

Now, I love sour ales and the combination of beer and cheese. Yet this particular ale was a little too odd for my comfort, blending sour, salty and fruity. The white, on the other hand, was beautiful with the cheeses. I’m not sure it was a revelation to the group, but if anyone needed reminding, this was a good way to do it.

What other myths could have been addressed? The issue of aging, rosés included. The effect of oak barrels on wine. Vineyard practices and soil composition. As I said, the feast could have gone on for days.

Kobe Steel added that it was examining other possible episodes of data falsification going back 10 years.
No deaths or safety incidents have been attributed to Kobe Steel.
All of Japan’s major carmakers — Honda, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Subaru, Suzuki and Toyota — are looking into their use of Kobe Steel materials.
The improperly certified metals had been shipped to about 200 companies, but Kobe Steel declined to reveal their names.","Last week, Nissan Motor said unqualified staff members had carried out inspections at its factories, prompting the carmaker to recall 1.2 million vehicles, though it was not clear if the quality of the vehicles had been affected. Mitsubishi Motors and Suzuki Motor both admitted last year that they had been exaggerating the fuel economy of their vehicles by cheating on tests.

Perhaps the biggest blow to Japan’s reputation for quality has come from Takata, the airbag maker that was at the center of the largest auto safety recall in history, involving tens of millions of vehicles. Its faulty airbags have been blamed for more than a dozen deaths. Takata declared bankruptcy in June.

Toshiaki Oguchi, director of Governance for Owners Japan, a corporate watchdog, said that Japanese companies were generally diligent about quality, but that when cheating occurred — because of competitive pressure or other factors — it could too easily go unchecked. Japanese companies, he said, tend to discourage thorough examination or criticism, either from employees or from independent outsiders.

“When something goes wrong, companies always hire a committee of outsiders to examine what happened,” Mr. Oguchi said. “But why not be proactive? Why not have people reviewing procedures all the time?”

The extent of the problems at Kobe Steel are still unfolding.

Kobe Steel said on Sunday that employees at four of its factories had altered inspection certificates on aluminum and copper products from September 2016 to August this year. The changes, it said, made it look as if the products met manufacturing specifications required by customers — including for vital qualities like tensile strength, a measure of material’s ability to withstand a load without breaking when being stretched — when they did not.

On Wednesday, the company said it was investigating possible data falsification involving another product, powdered steel, which is used mostly to make gears. The company said the powdered steel it was examining had been sold to one customer it did not name.

Kobe Steel added that it was examining other possible episodes of data falsification going back 10 years. The company did not provide significant details on the discrepancies, making it difficult to immediately determine if they posed a safety threat. No deaths or safety incidents have been attributed to Kobe Steel.

The company’s share price dropped sharply on Tuesday, the first day of trading after a holiday, and as of Wednesday morning in Tokyo had lost about one-third of its value since last week.

“The falsification problem has become an issue that could destroy international faith in Japanese manufacturing,” the Japanese financial newspaper Nikkei said in an article on Tuesday.

Even as Japan has given up its lead in technologies like televisions, cellphones and computers, it still excels in highly valued products used behind the scenes, including precision machinery, specialty chemicals, sensors and cameras.

Quality helps Japan preserve its markets overseas despite intense competition. Although China is the world’s largest steel maker, Japan still exports large amounts of iron and steel there.

One of the products at the center of the scandal, rolled aluminum, is widely used in the transportation industry because it is light. The lighter a car, train or airplane, the less fuel required to propel it.

Global manufacturers are now trying to assess their exposure, as they dig through an extensive supply chain.

A big car company like G.M. buys millions of tons of steel a year from a dozen or two dozen producers, in a variety of grades and forms. Steel can be sourced from different mills and shipped to any number of plants worldwide. G.M., for example, has 12 vehicle assembly plants and six stamping plants in the United States alone, all of which take deliveries of steel from many different producers.

All of Japan’s major carmakers — Honda, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Subaru, Suzuki and Toyota — are looking into their use of Kobe Steel materials. Toyota called the data falsification a “grave issue” and said it was looking into the problem and considering how best to respond, a statement echoed by other carmakers. Ford and General Motors are trying to determine whether they have used the company’s products.

Kawasaki Heavy Industries, which makes equipment for Shinkansen high-speed trains in Japan, said it was investigating. JR Tokai, a railway company that operates the busiest Shinkansen route in Japan, between Tokyo and Osaka, said that the data discrepancies “do not present a problem in terms of design standards,” but that it was nonetheless considering whether to replace certain train components.

Mitsubishi Heavy Industries uses aluminum from Kobe Steel in a midsize aircraft it is developing, the Mitsubishi Regional Jet, as well as aircraft components it supplies to Boeing. Mitsubishi Heavy said it was investigating. Boeing said in a statement, “Nothing in our review to date leads us to conclude that this issue presents a safety concern, and we will continue to work diligently with our suppliers to complete our investigation.”

Kobe Steel’s problem points to “a common organization issue,” said Shin Ushijima, a lawyer who serves as president of the Japan Corporate Governance Network. He drew parallels between Kobe Steel and Takata and Mitsubishi, as well as with financial-reporting improprieties at Toshiba, which admitted to overstating profit in 2015.

“Boards aren’t doing their jobs,” he said. “This isn’t an issue that can be solved by the president resigning. There needs to be wholesale change.”

He added, “The Kobe Steel case is a test of whether we’ve learned anything from Toshiba and these other issues.”

Kobe Steel said it had confirmed data falsification affecting roughly 19,300 tons of flat-rolled and extruded aluminum products, 19,400 units of aluminum casting and forgings, and 2,200 tons of copper products. The amount was about 4 percent of the company’s output of those products from September 2016 to August.

The company said that it had received no reports from customers of problems with the affected products, and that the falsification had been discovered during an internal review. The improperly certified metals had been shipped to about 200 companies, but Kobe Steel declined to reveal their names.

It said “tens” of employees and managers had been directly involved in the falsification, although no penalties against the employees were immediately announced. The company is still investigating.",Kobe Steel’s Falsified Data Is Another Blow to Japan’s Reputation,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/business/kobe-steel-japan.html

Friedman, a clinical psychologist in St. Louis. “In difficult times, when life begins to feel out of control or when faced with an emotional dilemma, working on something that has finite answers can provide a sense of security.”

Vicki Eastus, a puzzle solver in Brooklyn, put it this way: “The more hectic life is, the more calming I find filling in those little boxes.”

Search the internet for research on the impact of puzzle-solving on the brain, and you’ll find plenty of studies. But the results are mixed, and it’s not clear whether puzzle solving has any purely physiological benefits.

The psychological benefits, though, are not in question.

“When you do a puzzle, the mind becomes completely absorbed in the task at hand,” said Joanne Cohen-Katz, a psychologist in Allentown, Pa. “There is total focus on what is happening in the moment, which is the definition of mindfulness. And we know that mindfulness results in all sorts of positive changes in the brain.”

For one, solving a crossword can be a path to serenity in a world of uncertainty.

“I don’t think I have to sell you on the increased demand for this type of pastime in an increasingly worried world,” wrote Margaret Farrar, the first crossword editor of The Times, in a memo to Lester Markel, the Sunday editor, after the Pearl Harbor attack. “You can’t think of your troubles while solving a crossword.”

In recent interviews, New York Times crossword enthusiasts shared their emotional connections to the pastime and described the value they find in the exercise.

Harry Hassell, of Jackson Heights, Queens, remembered his mother working on crosswords. “Amid the chaos of the household, it allowed her a personal pleasure and a routine all her own,” he said. “It also allowed me to see her not just as a car-pooling, tennis-playing mother, but also as a clever, intelligent, word-loving woman.”

Such intergenerational connections, forged over black-and-white grids, can have long-term implications.

“I first started doing crosswords as a child while visiting my Grandma Pat,” said Neil Padrick Wilson, a claims analyst in Tacoma, Wash. “She would sit at the big dining room table, dipping toast in her coffee. I would dip toast in my hot chocolate and we would work through a puzzle together. It got me to think, it got me to learn and it got me to know her better.”

Puzzles became so important to Mr. Wilson that he began to create them, and a crossword he made recently ran in The Times.

While not all enthusiasts go on to construct puzzles, it’s not uncommon for an early habit to persist.

“Rituals are often key in bonding with others, particularly family rituals,” said Ray Bepko, a clinical psychologist in Clinton, N.Y. “Pastimes and hobbies are very much a part of this and impact our adult relationships.”

That seems to be at least one reason people continue or develop a solving habit in adulthood, Dr. Bepko said. “Accessing this deep emotional connection is a source of comfort and reassurance anytime, particularly in difficult moments.”

Of course, puzzles are games, and they’re meant to be fun — especially in the addictive “aha!” moments that many solvers describe.

Three years later, he drove that 1960 Corvette convertible to the photographer Frank Stefanko’s home in Haddonfield, N.J., for photo sessions that he hoped would produce cover art for his much anticipated follow-up album, 1978’s “Darkness on the Edge of Town.” The result was the opposite of the kind of glossy, self-celebratory portraits that had graced the album covers of freshly-minted rock stars since Elvis moved to Graceland and parked a new Cadillac out front.

The chosen cover photo — done not in a studio, but in a window alcove of Mr. Stefanko’s modest home — portrayed Mr. Springsteen as neither air-nor-hair brushed. He wore a white V-neck undershirt and looked more like one of the hard-luck road warriors that populate his songs than the rock and roll savior hailed on magazine covers.

“Frank’s photographs were stark,” Mr. Springsteen wrote in his 2016 memoir, “Born to Run,” whose cover featured a haggard portrait of the author posed with his ’Vette in Haddonfield in 1978. “[H]e managed to strip away your celebrity, your artifice, and get to the raw you. … His pictures captured the people I was writing about in my songs and showed me the part of me that was still one of them.”

Photo

The weekslong “Darkness” photo sessions were the first in 40-plus years of collaborations between Mr. Springsteen and Mr. Stefanko, who has collected his portraits and outtakes in “Bruce Springsteen, Further Up the Road,” a pricey ($380-$630) limited edition book to be published by Wall of Sound Editions in November.

Mr. Stefanko — who was introduced to Mr. Springsteen through a mutual friend, the punk poet and rocker Patti Smith — also did the cover image for the Boss’s 1980 double album, “The River,” as well as other projects over the years.

But it is the outtakes from the “Darkness” sessions, shot in and around Haddonfield when Mr. Springsteen turned 29, that strikingly capture the same kind of behind-the-rock-star persona that the now 68-year-old rocker presented in his autobiography and that he draws from in his one-man “Springsteen on Broadway” shows at the Walter Kerr Theater. In the solo show, noted the New York Times reviewer Jesse Green, he “comes off as the kind of character he often writes about: a pink-slipped worker in a shuttered factory in a dying industry.”

As Eric Meola, who shot the famous “Born to Run” album cover photo, writes in an introduction to Mr. Stefanko’s book, “In some of the outtakes from the “Darkness” sessions, Bruce simply stares at the camera with the dazed look of someone who has just shaken off blows from an unseen adversary.”

In one such black and white tramps-like-me portrait, Mr. Stefanko shot Mr. Springsteen — dressed in jeans, motorcycle boots, a checked shirt and leather jacket — as he sat on the two-step brick porch of a home not a lot different from the one where he grew up on the poorer side of Freehold, N.J. Not to mention looking like he didn’t know what — a night on the town or rock superstardom — hit him.

Other photos, including the book’s cover, find him in the same checked shirt, hulking down a grim brick alleyway and crammed into a booth with his E Street Band mates, looking like a street gang of off-duty drag racers, at Shellow’s, an ice cream shop in nearby East Camden, N.J.

Photo

Despite the downbeat mood of most of the photos, Mr. Springsteen was in good spirits throughout the Darkness sessions, Mr. Stefanko said in a 2010 interview with the music website Pitchfork. “Especially when the E Street Band was in the house,” he said. “Bruce kept everyone from getting bored by telling these wild stories. And I learned that Clarence Clemons was a great chess player. Some of the guys even set up a craps table on my dining room table between shots, just to pass the time.”

Mr. Stefanko said some of his color photos were done in an attempt to recreate the feel of “an old Kodacolor snapshot” that might have been found while rummaging “in somebody’s drawer.”

Consider this simple image (Slide 3): Mr. Springsteen sits on the bed of an otherwise nondescript motel room cradling an acoustic guitar. Mounted on the wall is an amateur but eye-catching painting of a woman in a white wedding gown with pink sash, floating like an angel in the sky.

The painting is similar to an image that hung in Mr. Springsteen’s boyhood home and that, he wrote in his autobiography, haunted him all his life. It was a photo of a girl in a white dress, his father’s sister, killed by a truck at age 5 while riding her tricycle. The death changed his family’s dynamic, causing long-lasting rifts that ultimately led him to get out while he was young — and to that motel room with the means of his escape in hand. And a reminder on the wall of a dead aunt whose “seemingly benign gaze” warned, he wrote, “‘Watch out!’”

Mr. Stefanko’s book is itself a kind of drawer full of forgotten snapshots, some offering clues to what it was that made their subject know that like his characters, he too was born to run.

The report, which is based on interviews with 120 refugees, said witnesses “indicate that in some instances burnings were clearly orchestrated and planned in advance by the military and local government authorities.”

Refugees continue to surge into Bangladesh one month after Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the de facto leader of Myanmar, said the government was prepared to welcome back those who had fled.

But refugee accounts and surveys of village destruction indicate the military and aligned vigilante groups are still trying to force the Rohingya from the country.

Human Rights Watch said Tuesday that analysis of satellite photos of 288 burned villages shows that at least 66 and possibly as many as 100 were attacked after Sept. 5, which Aung San Suu Kyi said was the end of the security clearance campaign in Rakhine state.

“We don’t believe those operations did stop,” said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch. “The narrative pushed by the military and Aung San Suu Kyi on the clearance operations is patently false.”

Refugees told U.N. refugee agency workers at the border this week that they had initially tried to stay, but fled after their villages were burned. They walked for about a week to reach the border.

About 1 million Rohingya lived in Rakhine State in western Myanmar before the latest exodus. The latest estimates of arrivals to Bangladesh means more than half have fled their homes.

The Rohingya are members of a predominantly Muslim ethnic group that have long faced discrimination and loss of basic rights in Myanmar, a majority Buddhist nation.

Rohingya who live near Sittwe, the provincial capital in central Rakhine, are largely interned in camps, with far less ability to flee. Ethnic Rakhine groups have blocked the shipment of aid to the internment camps in central Rakhine, adding to the misery there.

While those who have made it to Bangladesh are able to escape the violence of Rakhine, they face other dangers.

Pope Francis recently announced that he would dedicate his 2018 World Communications Day address to the topic of fake news, and the United States Congress is investigating how Russian agents manipulated Facebook and Twitter to spread false stories and stoke conspiracy theories to sway the 2016 presidential election.

But ahead of crucial Italian elections early next year, the country has become an especially fertile ground for digital deceit. Frustrated by economic woes, upset by a migrant crisis and fed a steady diet of partisan media, many Italians subscribe to all kinds of conspiracy theories. It is what they call dietrologia, the belief that there is also always something dietro, or behind, the surface.

The Italian passion for seeing intrigue — whether or not it exists — around every corner runs deep, said Alessandro Campi, a professor of political science at Perugia University. “All of this is part of the Italian cultural heritage,” he said.

A history of scheming Borgia cardinals, waves of foreign domination, papal crackdowns and corrupt governments had imbued Italians with an abiding distrust in authority, Mr. Campi said.

Photo

In recent years, this background has helped erode the standing of traditional political parties while being expertly exploited by political upstarts, insurgents and outsiders, none more so than the surging Five Star Movement and its founder, Beppe Grillo.

“I’d say that the Five Star Movement believes more than any other political party in conspiracy theories,” said Mr. Campi, an editor of “Conspiracies and Plots — From Machiavelli to Beppe Grillo.”

“It’s not only a tactic,” Mr. Campi said of the movement, which has succeeded in attracting votes from the left and the right with an ideologically ambiguous form of populism. “It’s their political worldview.”

Nicola Biondo, a former chief of communications for the Five Star Movement, said that for the party, spreading conspiracies was akin to a policy.

“They use the term Great Powers, never specifying who those powers are,” said Mr. Biondo, who has recently written a book, “Supernova: How Five Star Was Killed,” with another party defector. “It is a mantra.”

Ms. Boldrini, sponsor of the new student curriculum, asserts that the web cannot be forfeited to the fringes, and that the government must teach the next generation of Italian voters how to defend themselves against falsehoods and conspiracy theories designed to play on their fears.

She said she had included Google and Facebook in the project in an acknowledgment that virtual space is where many young Italians live.

Nevertheless, she expressed skepticism in particular about Facebook’s commitment to reining in fake news and hate speech, and recognized the possibility that the Italian school project provided the embattled giant with a much-needed public relations boon.

Facebook was quick to applaud the program. Laura Bononcini, chief of public policy for Facebook in Italy, Greece and Malta, said on Tuesday that “the program is part of an international effort. Education and media literacy are a crucial part of our effort to curb the spread of false news, and collaboration with schools is pivotal.”

Ms. Boldrini also noted that Facebook was contributing by promoting the initiative through targeted ads to high-school-age users, and she said she hoped that the program, which aimed to show students how their “likes” were monetized and politicized, could become a “pilot program” for Facebook throughout Europe.

But some of the Italian course load seems unrealistic. While some tips are useful, such as keeping an eye out for parody URLs, students are also called upon to reach out to experts to verify news stories, essentially asking the students to re-report articles.

The program seeks to deputize students as fake-news hunters, showing them how to create their own blogs or social accounts to expose false stories and “showing how you uncovered it.”

In Italy, that gives them a lot of ground to cover.

For months here, conspiracy theorists who reject scientific consensus have connected vaccinations to medical conditions including autism in children, often blaming pharmaceutical companies as a dark force behind the medical practice. It was an issue that struck a nerve in Italy and played right into the wheelhouse of the Five Star Movement’s distrust of expertise and authority.

In May, amid a measles outbreak, Italy strengthened its vaccination requirements for school-age children, prompting so-called No-Vax activists to protest outside the Italian Parliament for the right to choose.

The vaccination opponents were especially strong in the Five Star Movement, whose leader, Mr. Grillo, once attacked vaccines as a scam by pharmaceutical companies with the intention of “weakening children’s immune systems.”

His wildly popular blog has alleged that some vaccines “can kill,” and websites, such as La Fucina, run by another party leader, Davide Casaleggio, have published anti-vaccine reports.

(In the past, other sites associated with Mr. Casaleggio or Mr. Grillo have also carried sensational reports by Russian-backed news outlets that were deemed false and damaging to the movement’s political enemies.)

“It’s what the pharmaceutical companies do, and it’s questionable,” said Paola Barile, 65, as she stood with a Five Star Movement flag wrapped around her shoulders at a protest last week in front of Parliament. “The spell has been broken for us also on vaccines.”

At the same rally, Five Star activists screamed “shame” and railed against the political parties, right and left, for joining forces to draft a new electoral law they considered (maybe correctly this time) designed to keep the movement out of power.

But the Five Star Movement is not the only political force to have profited from fake news, and students are not the only ones who can be deceived by it.

Last weekend, Gian Marco Centinaio, a senator from the Northern League, a right-leaning party, acknowledged that he had put on Facebook a post, subsequently shared 18,000 times, of a picture of a man identified as Ms. Boldrini’s brother, and complained how the news programs “don’t cover” the man’s no-show job that paid 47,000 euros, or more than $55,000, a month. The man in the image was not her brother and none of the allegations were true.

Mr. Centinaio called the post a joke and said, “People should be less credulous.”

“As women leaders in politics, in a state that postures itself as a leader in justice and equality, you might assume our experience has been different. It has not.”

— Legislators, senior legislative aides and lobbyists, in a letter denouncing what they described as pervasive sexual misconduct by powerful men working in and with the California Legislature.

Back Story

As the U.S. national anthem played, they bowed their heads and prayed they wouldn’t be shot.

It was this week in 1968 that two African-American sprinters raised gloved fists during a medal presentation at the Summer Olympics in Mexico City, in a denunciation of racial discrimination.

The demonstration by Tommie Smith and John Carlos, who won the gold and bronze medals in the 200-meter dash, drew a quick reaction.

Under pressure from the International Olympic Committee — which wanted to avoid the politicization of the Games — the U.S. team dropped the two runners, who received death threats.

The silver medalist, Peter Norman of Australia, knew of his fellow Olympians’ plans; on the podium, all three wore badges of the Olympic Project for Human Rights, which was organized to protest racism in sports. Mr. Norman was ostracized after returning home.

In a memoir published in 2011, Mr. Carlos wrote: “If I shut my eyes, I can still feel the fire from those days. And if I open my eyes, I still see the fires all around me. I didn’t like the way the world was, and I believe that there need to be some changes about the way the world is.”

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — Today we get to watch a face-off between the good guys and the bad guys, courtesy of David J. Kahn.

Today’s Theme

The GUNFIGHT AT / THE O.K. CORRAL (28D and 62A) took place in October 1881, and was a 30-second shootout between the lawmen of Tombstone, Ariz., and a group of outlaws called the Cowboys (in those days, it was considered an insult to call a law-abiding cattleman a “cowboy”). Mr. Kahn was able to get only one law man (DOC HOLLIDAY) and one bad guy (IKE CLANTON) into his grid for space reasons.

In addition, we have four entries forming a circular “corral” of sorts (31A, 37D, 52A and 35D). All of them are synonyms for the word “O.K.,” but all are clued as something different, neatly hiding the connection to the theme in plain sight. That’s a pretty nice bonus.

Tricky Clues

1A: I had MACAU and MACAW (wrong, Deb! That’s a bird) before MACAO.

49A: Do you get tripped up by clues where the first word is actually a proper name? “Banks of Chicago” sounds as if it refers to places in Chicago where you can keep your money, but we’ve got only a five-letter slot. The constructor and editors have sneakily used the capital-letter-at-the-beginning-of-a-sentence rule against you. “Banks” refers to the baseball player ERNIE Banks.

Constructor Notes

I guess I can say with a smile that this is just an O.K. puzzle. This worked only because I was able to find 4 four-letter synonyms for O.K. that could be clued otherwise, which is why “so-so,” at first an obvious synonym, wasn’t included. I also wanted to include a gunfighter on each side. Fun fact: Kirk Douglas, who played Doc Holliday in the 1957 movie, celebrated his centennial last year.

The scrutiny also reflects public frustration with years of criminal charges leveled against the leaders of Samsung and some other big family-run companies that have led to light sentences and even to official pardons.

Lawmakers have also turned up the pressure. This week, Park Yong-jin, a member of South Korea’s governing Democratic Party and a vocal critic of the country’s corporate culture, dragged one of Lee Kun-hee’s two earlier convictions back into the limelight when he said that financial authorities had allowed Lee Jae-yong to inherit billions of dollars from his father without paying taxes.

South Korea would have reaped about $2 billion from the transaction, “if tax authorities had followed the rules and levied inheritance taxes,” Mr. Park said.

The criticism put the spotlight on one of Samsung’s most embarrassing episodes.

In 2008, prosecutors found 4.5 trillion South Korean won, or roughly $4.5 billion at the time, in assets that belonged to Lee Kun-hee but were divided up in more than 1,000 accounts under his lieutenants’ names. Prosecutors alleged that Lee Kun-hee had inherited the money from his father, Lee Byung-chul, Samsung’s founder, and that it had been structured to avoid taxes.

Lee Kun-hee was convicted in 2008, but South Korea’s president at the time, Lee Myung-bak, pardoned him the following year. It was the second time Lee Kun-hee had been given a presidential reprieve: He was also pardoned in 1997, a year after a conviction on bribery charges.

In a statement on Wednesday, Samsung said, without specifying amounts, that Mr. Lee had paid all the taxes that he promised to reimburse in 2008.

“The principle remains completely unchanged that the money will be used for a good cause,” the statement said.

Lee Kun-hee, 75, has been incapacitated since a heart attack in 2014. Many South Koreans still express admiration for the industrialist because of his transformation of Samsung from a local manufacturer of cheap goods into a global behemoth.

Samsung C&T, one of the conglomerate’s biggest units, has a portfolio including major power plants and suspension bridges, as well as the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, the world’s tallest building.

For the 2020 election, some of the party’s strongest potential presidential candidates — Senators Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand and Kamala Harris as well as Deval Patrick, the former Massachusetts governor — should not be dismissed simply because of their current or past ties to Wall Street.

If voters really hated ties to Wall Street and financial elites, Republicans would not enjoy such a commanding electoral position — or have elected a New York plutocrat president. Most voters’ major problems with President Trump stem from his performance, not from his wealth or connections to Wall Street.

A second reason Democrats should keep ties with Wall Street: Despite what the Democratic left says, America is a center-right, pro-capitalist nation. A January Gallup poll found that moderates and conservatives make up almost 70 percent of the country, while only 25 percent of voters identify as liberal. Even in May 2016, when Senator Sanders made redistribution a central part of his platform, Gallup found that only about 35 percent of Americans had a positive image of socialism, compared with 60 percent with a positive view of capitalism.

Third, it is hypocritical for Democrats to maintain ties to Silicon Valley and then turn their backs on the very people who help finance its work. The financial industry brings to market the world’s most innovate products and platforms that expand the economy and create jobs.

Fourth, demonizing Wall Street does nothing to bridge the widening gaps in our country. Wall Street has its flaws and abuses, which were addressed in part by the Dodd-Frank financial reform law. And yes, the American people are certainly hostile to and suspicious of Wall Street. But using this suspicion and hostility as the organizing principle for a major political party will consign Democrats to permanent minority status.

Here’s what the Democrats need to do instead: develop a set of pro-growth, inclusive economic policies. Democratic leaders must prioritize entrepreneurship, small-business growth and the expansion of job-training and retraining programs.

American leadership in finance will make it possible for our country to invest as much as $1 trillion in infrastructure, extend health care access to every American at an affordable rate and lift the 76 million Americans who are barely surviving financially, as reported in May 2016 by the Federal Reserve, into the middle class.

The Democrats need to partner with the financial community on these issues. Most important, the Democrats have simply had an ineffective, negative and coercive economic message. Advocacy of a $15 minimum wage and further banking regulation does not constitute a positive, proactive agenda.

The Democrats cannot be the party that supports only new, stifling regulations. Reducing regulation allows banks to employ capital and finance investment in our country’s future, making electric cars, renewable energy and internet connectivity across the globe a reality.

This was evident to Democrats in the 1990s. From 1996 to 2000, for example, Democrats led the way on two key economic legislative victories. First, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 deregulated the communications and cable industries, increased growth and enhanced market competition. Second, the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 removed regulations placed on financial institutions by bureaucrats and expanded opportunities for Wall Street to engage in mergers and acquisitions, adding wealth to the retirement accounts and other investment portfolios of millions of middle-class Americans.

If the party is going to have any chance of returning to its position of influence and appeal, Democrats need to work with Wall Street to push policies that create jobs, heal divisions and stimulate the American economy.",Why Democrats Need Wall Street,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/opinion/why-democrats-need-wall-street.html

Mr. Spencer is the president of the National Policy Institute, which describes itself as “an independent research and educational foundation,” and has produced papers on issues like racial differences in intelligence and the crime rate among Hispanic immigrants.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

He is credited with coining the term “alternative right,” or “alt-right,” almost a decade ago. He is the American editor of the website Altright.com.

The Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors hate groups, has called him “a suit-and-tie version of the white supremacists of old, a kind of professional racist in khakis,” though Mr. Spencer has denied that he is a white supremacist.

After the presidential election, he saluted an audience of more than 200 at the National Policy Institute’s annual conference in Washington with the cry “Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory!” In response, a number of his supporters gave the Nazi salute.

In May Mr. Spencer, a University of Virginia graduate, led a torch-bearing group in Charlottesville to a statue of Robert E. Lee, the confederate general, that the city wanted to remove. They chanted, “You will not replace us,” and “Blood and soil.” That dispute led to a bigger “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville in August, which erupted into street violence, leaving one woman dead when a car driven by a man associated with white supremacist groups plowed into a crowd.

Mr. Spencer appeared again in Charlottesville on Oct. 7 at a small torch-lit rally. He did not return a phone call seeking comment on his visit to the University of Florida.

Why will the college let him speak?

After the university denied Mr. Spencer’s original request, a local lawyer, Gary Edinger, threatened to sue on First Amendment grounds. Mr. Edinger, a First Amendment lawyer, said in an interview Tuesday that he had taken the case pro bono. His views do not match Mr. Spencer’s, he said, adding that he had voted for Bernie Sanders because he wanted a socialist for president.

The university responded to the lawsuit threat by saying that the ban was not supposed to be permanent, and then negotiated conditions of Mr. Spencer’s appearance with Mr. Edinger, said Janine Sikes, a spokeswoman for the university.

“Essentially the university opted to agree on a future date that gave us time to plan for safety and security, and certainly have some say in other factors leading to the event, making it during the daytime, for example,” Ms. Sikes said. Some colleges ask polarizing speakers to appear during the day to make crowd control easier.

As a public institution, the University of Florida cannot choose speakers based on their point of view, First Amendment experts say.

“The University of Florida can’t say we like country music, but we don’t like alternative music — or in this case, we like diversity, but we don’t like Richard Spencer’s message,” Clay Calvert, a journalism professor and First Amendment expert at the university, said.

The university is obligated to protect Mr. Spencer from demonstrators exercising what is called “the heckler’s veto,” Mr. Calvert said. “That’s the idea that the First Amendment does not allow an audience of hostile reaction to silence the speaker.”

The university said that security was expected to cost $500,000, far more than the $10,500 it is receiving from Mr. Spencer’s group to rent space on campus. But the university said it could not legally pass the security costs on to the National Policy Institute.

What about protests?

Far-right activists and counterprotesters have clashed in or around other campuses, including the University of California, Berkeley, Evergreen State College in Washington State and the University of Virginia. The counterprotesters have often been led by Antifa, or anti-fascists, wearing black masks and sometimes wielding pepper spray and other weapons.

The Orlando Antifa has alerted followers to Mr. Spencer’s appearance at the University of Florida. It reacted to the announcement that the National Guard was being mobilized with a tweet, “Remember the last time the national guard was invited to a university campus? #NoNazisAtUF.” The message was accompanied by the famous photo of an anguished woman kneeling over the body of a Kent State University student shot dead by the National Guard during a protest against the Vietnam War in 1970.

A group called No Nazis at UF has formed, consisting of students, community members and others, and about 90 of them marched to the administration building on Monday to protest Mr. Spencer’s appearance.

“Peaceful protests are certainly welcome,” Ms. Sikes, the university spokeswoman, said. In a provision that may be aimed at Antifa as well as Antifa’s opponents, the police are banning torches, masks and anything that can be used as a weapon at the speech.

Mr. Spencer will be appearing at the school’s Phillips Center for the Performing Arts. A security checkpoint will be set up, and 700 tickets will be handed out there on a first-come, first-serve basis, according to altright.com, raising the possibility that many of those attending will be there to heckle him.

What are other universities doing?

Mr. Spencer’s requests to speak have been rejected by Pennsylvania State University, Michigan State, Louisiana State and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Soon after the Charlottesville violence, Texas A&M canceled his planned Sept. 11 appearance there. But the University of Cincinnati last week said that it would grant Mr. Spencer a venue, with the date to be determined.

A lawsuit was filed on Mr. Spencer’s behalf against Michigan State. A similar lawsuit, against Auburn University, resulted in a federal judge’s ruling that he be allowed to speak there this past spring.

Some universities have rules requiring that speakers be invited by a student or student group. But the University of Florida has no such requirement.

Although universities are now dealing with protests and violence surrounding speakers on the right, there have been other eras when speakers on the left were the target.

There were protests against the University of Florida for allowing Abbie Hoffman, the Yippie leader and member of the Chicago Seven, to appear in 1970, Mr. Calvert said, and for letting a lieutenant of Louis Farrakhan, leader of the Nation of Islam, speak in the 1990s.

It was the governors led by Jerry Brown and others — it was the mayors who said we are not going to go back.”

Former Vice President Al Gore echoed that sentiment when he showed up in New Jersey last weekend to support Mr. Murphy.

“If you want to create the jobs of the future, if you want a governor and a first lady who really get it and who care about clean water and clean air, and cleaning up the climate and provide the jobs in the process, this is a very, very clear choice,” Mr. Gore said at the event in Ocean Township.

Mr. Murphy, a former Goldman Sachs executive and ambassador to Germany, has embraced the party’s emphasis on focusing resistance to Mr. Trump in more liberal states. With Democratic power in the states at a low ebb — there are 15 Democratic governors in the country — Mr. Murphy has promoted a vision of New Jersey as a progressive bulwark, much like other heavily Democratic states, like California and Hawaii.

The only thing standing in the way, Democrats say, has been Mr. Christie, the state’s embattled governor, whom Mr. Murphy’s campaign has targeted as frequently as Mr. Trump.

Mr. Murphy has made trying to preserve Mr. Obama’s accomplishments a centerpiece of his campaign. New Jersey, he said, would join other states in committing to the goals outlined in the Paris climate agreement and to other environmental regulations rescinded by the Trump administration, including rules on clean water.

Mr. Murphy also promised to promote enrollment in the Affordable Care Act after the Trump administration’s move to slash the program’s advertising budget, and he has pledged to defend young undocumented immigrants who might be imperiled by the president’s decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which protected young adults who were brought to the United States illegally as children from being deported.

Mr. Murphy’s Republican opponent, Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno, by contrast, has received virtually no help from national Republicans, and Mr. Trump and Mr. Christie are so unpopular in the state that their involvement in the race would more likely hurt than help. The disparity in political firepower has appeared to frustrate Ms. Guadagno, who accused Mr. Murphy on Sunday of treating the governor’s race like a campaign for president.

“He’s trying to become the leader of the Democratic Party nationwide,” Ms. Guadagno said in a speech. “He’s even further to the left than any Democrat in New Jersey.”

With his return to retail campaigning, Mr. Obama follows the path of other former presidents, who have ventured out to varying degrees on behalf of candidates after leaving office. George W. Bush, who remained a polarizing figure after he left office, pursued a low-profile role in Republican politics. But Bill Clinton was less restrained, campaigning for Mark Green in New York’s mayoral election in 2001, and going on the road for Democrats in the 2002 midterm elections.

Mr. Obama is unlikely to attack Ms. Guadagno, or to break from his practice of not feuding publicly with Mr. Trump, according to several Obama advisers.

But Mr. Obama will probably stress a list of policy priorities — all stalled or reversed in Washington — that Mr. Murphy might pursue as governor, including stricter gun control laws, more generous health care benefits and additional protections for undocumented immigrants.

In interviews this year, Mr. Obama said he was determined to help rebuild the Democratic Party outside Washington. He appeared at a fund-raiser for the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, a group led by Eric H. Holder Jr., Mr. Obama’s attorney general, that is focused on state legislative elections.

Michael Kempner, a New Jersey public relations executive and Democratic fund-raiser, said the New Jersey elections represented an opportunity for Democrats to play catch-up in the states. The party, he said, had plainly paid too little attention to state politics when Mr. Obama was in office.

“Democrats clearly had their eye off the prize,” Mr. Kempner said. “The states are where things happen, and more and more people understand that.”

Mr. Murphy’s election could make the state a model of “dark blue” policymaking, Mr. Kempner said, noting that the candidate has consistently expressed interest in “how New Jersey and the policies of the state can impact the national agenda.”

Mr. Obama will also campaign in Virginia on Thursday with Lt. Gov. Ralph S. Northam, the Democratic nominee for governor there. But New Jersey represents a distinct opportunity to press a liberal agenda. A victory for Mr. Northam would help Democrats retain a powerful governorship in a key swing state, but Republicans are likely to keep control of the Virginia Legislature, limiting the possibility of enacting an ambitious Democratic agenda.

Mr. Murphy’s potential election, however, would give Democrats full control of New Jersey, making it the seventh state where Democrats hold the governor’s office and both chambers of the legislature and can make policy without Republican input. There are 26 states where Republicans have control of the executive and legislative branches, which has allowed the party to push a sweeping agenda on the state level that has included tax cuts, restrictions on labor unions and new limits on abortion rights.

David Axelrod, Mr. Obama’s senior adviser in the White House, said he expected the former president to stress the stakes of the election to core Democratic voters and “remind them about the hazards of taking elections for granted.”

“Given his role, I would expect him to deliver positive messages about the candidates for whom he’s campaigning rather than negative ones about the opponents,” Mr. Axelrod said.

If Mr. Obama is not expected to take on his successor directly, other visitors to New Jersey have shown no such restraint.

Mr. Biden, in his campaign stop, offered red-meat lines that also were a reality check for liberals seeking to recreate an Obama-era America in blue-state havens.

Readers who are just starting to solve ask two questions when there is a rebus in a puzzle: They ask if they are supposed to be warned that a rebus exists in the puzzle (No, that’s part of the fun of solving) and they ask how in tarnation they are supposed to put more than one letter in a square if they are solving electronically. I’ll get to that in a minute, but first I’d like to show you what a rebus in a crossword looks like.

A rebus can be a letter, number or symbol that represents a word, but in many crosswords, the rebus will be a word or group of letters that need to be written inside a single square, like this puzzle by Elizabeth Long from December 1, 2011, where the word JACK was the rebus element.

The clue was “You might find one at a sawmill,” and the answer is LUMBERJACK, a 10 letter word, but the slot only has room for seven letters. How do you fill in the entire answer?

Entering a Rebus on the Web

Step 1: Select the square in which you want to enter a rebus. Click the Rebus button on the toolbar above the clue lists, or simply press Escape (Esc).

It was designated a national monument by President Woodrow Wilson in 1915, using powers granted him under the Antiquities Act of 1906.
David Nimkin, a senior regional director for the National Parks Conservation Association, said in a statement that the planned energy development “has the potential to do harm to Dinosaur National Monument.

The 330-square-mile, high-desert park is visited by about 300,000 people a year. It was designated a national monument by President Woodrow Wilson in 1915, using powers granted him under the Antiquities Act of 1906.

The new drilling leases pivot away from a policy begun during the administration of Barack Obama, in which the Park Service and the B.L.M. collaborated to avoid visual and environmental impacts from industrial development on public lands near parks. The national monument, administered by the park service, is surrounded by federal public lands administered by the B.L.M. Both agencies are within the Department of the Interior.

More gas and oil drilling is part of the Trump administration’s announced goals of what the president has referred to as “energy dominance.” The Interior Secretary, Ryan Zinke, has said that “oil and gas production on federal lands is an important source of revenue and job growth in rural America.”

In response to the concerns expressed by Mr. Herbert and others, the B.L.M. has deferred action indefinitely on about 1,600 acres near the park that had been proposed for leases, and said that it will try to mitigate impacts at the monument from drilling activity on the remaining areas near the park.

The governor’s office declared that it was satisfied by the changes.

“Thank you @BLMNational for listening to our concerns about protecting the visitor experience at @DinosaurNPS,” Mr. Herbert said on Twitter.

Others are unhappy. Critics say the shift is emblematic of changes that will affect a wide range of other parks and monuments, as well as those who visit them.

David Nimkin, a senior regional director for the National Parks Conservation Association, said in a statement that the planned energy development “has the potential to do harm to Dinosaur National Monument. We cannot keep Dinosaur the wild and wonderful place it is if we allow oil rigs on its borders.”

Some of the leases, he said, “are within the direct view of the park’s Quarry Visitor Center and the world famous Carnegie Fossil Quarry. It would also threaten the health of the Colorado River system and could further reduce air quality at Dinosaur, all while adding intensive industrial traffic to the park’s access road.”

Mike Murray, who worked as a national park administrator and ranger for 34 years, cited a range of threats to the parks and the visitor experience. In an interview, he said the decision to auction drilling rights at Dinosaur National Monument was “indefensible,” part of a new wave of “signs and signals” about the administration’s policy intentions. He is a spokesman for a group of park service retirees called the Coalition to Protect America’s National Parks.

Outdoor-related businesses near the national monument expressed a range of concerns in comment letters filed with the B.L.M. Two mountain biking trade associations said that gas and oil drilling “could also put at risk sensitive water resources and threaten other important values such as clean air, wildlife habitat, cultural resources, recreation viewsheds, and the cultural vitality of rural communities.” The National Outdoor Leadership School, which runs training programs in the area, commented that “lease and subsequent development of these parcels will have a serious impact on the river experience. Any new natural gas wells and related infrastructure on this parcel would likely be within view of the river during construction, and within earshot of the river throughout the life of the wells. Such intrusions will doubtless impinge on the river traveler’s experience and degrade the outstanding values provided by the Green River.”

Mr. Murray said the Dinosaur case is only one example of Trump administration decisions that will harm national parks and monuments. In August, the retirees’ group sponsored a letter to the administration, signed by 350 former public employees, including many park administrators. It objected to proposed oil and gas leases on federal land that it says are “adjacent or in proximity” to several other sites: Zion National Park, Capitol Reef National Park, Chaco Culture National Historical Park, Hovenweep National Monument and Fort Laramie National Historic Site.

Interior Department spokeswoman Heather Swift did not respond to several requests for comment. The Vernal, Utah, field office of the B.L.M and the agency’s Salt Lake City and Washington, D.C. offices also declined to comment.

The Dinosaur monument’s pitch-black night skies and silent soundscapes have been protected by the park service since its creation, Mr. Murray said. He said that visitors will now see “oil rigs instead of a pristine landscape.” The risk of toxic industrial spills, leaks and accidents leading to polluted air and water will have arrived along with the energy development opportunity, he added.

“We’re incredibly concerned about the direction that the White House is taking with national parks and public lands” in pursuit of energy development and other goals, Kristen Brengel, vice president of government affairs at the National Parks Conservation Association, said in an interview. “We are seeing significant rollbacks of wildlife, drilling, water and conservation policies from prior Republican and Democratic administrations. This is a sea change, and they are taking no prisoners. Even national parks aren’t sacred for this administration.”

Mr. Zinke recently completed a review requested by Mr. Trump of large national monuments created by his predecessors — Presidents Bush, Clinton and Obama.

Ophelia, downgraded from a hurricane to a post-tropical storm before it struck Ireland on Sunday, was the 10th hurricane of the 2017 Atlantic season.

It made landfall on the southwestern coast of Ireland early Monday, lashing the country with punishing rain and bringing powerful winds to all 26 of the republic’s counties. At Fastnet Rock, the country’s most southerly point, wind speeds reached 176 kilometers, or 109 miles, an hour.

Ireland has little experience dealing with such powerful storms, and the national weather service, Met Eireann, said Ophelia was the most powerful storm recorded that far east in the Atlantic. The prime minister, Leo Varadkar, told reporters on Monday that it was the fiercest storm to strike the island since Hurricane Debbie in 1961, which killed 11 people.

Ophelia left three dead in Ireland on Monday. Two motorists were killed when their cars were struck by falling trees, one in County Waterford and the other in County Louth. A third person was killed in County Tipperary when a tree fell on him as he was using a chain saw to clear debris.

Mr. Varadkar told RTE that the “full resources of the state” would be deployed in the cleanup operation, and he advised continued caution. “We have had three tragic deaths, but the most important thing is that no one else loses their life,” he told the broadcaster. “There are still dangers, even if the storm is gone.”

Insurance Ireland, an umbrella group of insurers, estimated storm damage of up to 800 million euros, or $944 million.

Schools in Ireland remained closed for a second day on Tuesday to allow the authorities to assess possible structural damage. Ophelia tore roofs off school buildings, department stores, apartment complexes and sports arenas around the country.

The storm struck Britain late Monday and early Tuesday, although it had weakened considerably by that point, officials said.

Residents in the areas most affected by the rains, like Scotland and Northern England, were warned of possible floods and were advised to remain indoors Monday night. But Tuesday morning showed the damage in Britain to be minimal compared with that in Ireland. There were no reports of deaths in Britain in connection with the storm.

Perhaps the storm’s most notable effect on Britain was that its powerful winds carried dust from Sahara sandstorms and Iberian wildfires north, turning the sky over much of the country a rusty orange.

On Tuesday, Britain’s national weather service, the Met Office, warned of wind gusts of up to 70 miles an hour on the east coast of Northern England and in Southern Scotland. The office said “a spell of very windy weather is likely” that could disrupt mass transit and lead to power failures and property damage.",Ireland Reckons With Damage From Its Deadliest Storm for Decades,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/world/europe/ireland-ophelia.html

The representatives of Fekat I met were incredibly helpful throughout my visit, particularly Eyob Teshome, a Cyr wheel expert and all-around good guy who served as an informal guide for a portion of my stay. He helped acquaint me with the neighborhood, find a local SIM card, answered questions and showed me a few different sights.

He is also, like several Ethiopians I met, incredibly proud of his country. “We are special,” he began, before correcting himself: “We believe we are special,” he said, smiling and looking downward. Mr. Teshome, a devout Christian (most Ethiopians are Christian, either Ethiopian Orthodox or Protestant), talked a bit about Ethiopia and its role in the Bible, and how many Ethiopians view the country — one of the world’s oldest Christian nations — as the promised land.

“And did you know,” asked a smiling Mr. Teshome, as we walked past street hawkers selling mangos and young men offering to clean your sneakers for a few birr, “that we have our own calendar? And that we even have our own time?” Ethiopia works on a 13-month calendar, with 12 30-day months and a 13th intercalary month (a leap month, basically) of five or six days. And instead of working on standard international time, which would put it in the same zone as Moscow, it works on a 12-hour clock determined roughly by sunrise and sunset. What we would call 7 a.m. is simply called “1 o’clock” in Ethiopian time — be careful when making appointments.

After showing me my room — modest, but comfortable, with a bunk bed and shared bathroom down the hallway – Mr. Teshome asked me if there was anything in particular I wanted to do. I said I was up for pretty much anything. “O.K.,” he said. “We’ll go to Merkato.” We hopped on the Chinese-built metro rail at Menilik II Square (right near the beautiful St. George’s Cathedral, where Haile Selassie was crowned emperor in 1930), and rode two stops west to Gojam Berenda (2 birr, less than 10 cents). We exited the station to a completely different world.

I’ve been to markets all over the world but I wasn’t prepared for this. By some accounts, Merkato is the largest open-air market in Africa: It encompasses an entire neighborhood — several square miles of barely controlled chaos. Vendors hawk nearly everything you could possibly imagine. Produce, textiles, car parts, baked goods and massive sacks of colorful incense line the dirt roads packed with honking cars and busy traders trying to avoid getting hit.

Things are roughly divided into sections: All the cookware on one street, towering stacks of colorful plastic containers on another. Against the side of a building under a plastic tarp, I saw a man welding old mechanical gears into weight lifting sets. “Watch your pockets,” Mr. Teshome warned me as we wound our way through the crush of people at the Merkato, passing rows of shoes, colorful T-shirts, bags of spices, slaughtered animals. We stopped to snack on chornake, a dense, doughnut-like fried pastry (2 birr), then each bought a mefakia (also 2 birr), a short stick of wood many Ethiopians use as a natural toothbrush. We continued wandering the market, cleaning our teeth. (Many things in the city cost just a few birr — keep some small change handy.)

Mr. Teshome warned me about pickpockets in the market, but over all, I didn’t find safety to be a problem in the city. I used common sense by limited the amount of walking I did after dark and not mindlessly gazing at my phone while strolling down the street. You may occasionally be gawked and called after — my general sense was that it came from a place of friendliness and curiosity.

But there’s also a serious hustle to many of the locals, primarily young men, who are eager to make a birr or two by cleaning your shoes, selling you knickknacks or escorting you to a destination. I’d generally advise against following strangers anywhere or accepting offers to “show you around.” Decline firmly, but not rudely.

After picking up a local SIM card (with 4G capability) from the Ethio Telecom shop near Minilik Square (bring your passport, a hundred birr or so to top up your phone, and plenty of patience — the wait can be considerable), I was beginning to feel the effect of all my recent travel. It was time for a cup of coffee — lucky for me, Addis Ababa is full of modest streetside coffee stands selling amazing java. No surprise there — coffee is believed to have originated on the Ethiopian highlands.

Photo

The best cup of my trip was at Tomoca Coffee, a small storefront on Wawel Street in the Piazza area near where I bunked at the circus (there are a few locations). The cozy, homey shop was packed, and flooded with the warm, earthy scent of ground coffee. I picked up a cup for 14 birr and a frosted doughnut for 15 birr. The doughnut was mediocre, but that was beside the point: The coffee, a dense, bittersweet shot of only three or four ounces, was some of the best I’ve had. You can buy whole bean coffee, too; I picked up a couple of 500-gram bags to bring home (138 birr).

Food and drink are practically a religion in Ethiopia, and there’s no shortage of places to get tasty, family-style meals. Expect thick stews of vegetables and meat eaten together with injera, a sour, spongy fermented bread made from teff, a native grass. At KG Corner, a neighborhood restaurant that’s been operating since 1960, I tried the fasting ferefer (the Ethiopian Orthodox Church prescribes a number of fasting days during which adherents may not eat animal products) for 43 birr and the shiro tegabino, a pea stew (also 43 birr). The ferefer was essentially a spicy vegetable stew that tasted heavily of the deep, earthy berbere spice that Ethiopia is famous for.

Other highlights of my stay included the Holy Trinity Cathedral, also known as the Haile Selassie church (the former emperor is buried on the premises with his wife). Admission to the church and small museum on the property is a relatively expensive 150 birr. For theater buffs, the Ethiopian National Theater, originally constructed during the Italian occupation, is worth visiting for a look at its massive lobby and gilded interior. I even took in a show, “Finger of God” (40 birr). While I don’t speak Amharic, I found the performance engaging.

The National Museum of Ethiopia is just a 15-minute walk from the Holy Trinity Cathedral and, for just a 10-birr admission fee, it is a must-see. The highlight, naturally, is Lucy — the Australopithecine hominid that made an enormous splash when her partial skeleton was discovered in eastern Ethiopia in 1974 by Donald Johanson and Tom Gray.

When she was discovered, the 3.2-million year old Lucy excited the anthropological world because of her well-preserved remains as well as the fact that she walked upright — shedding possible light on the “missing link” of how humans may have evolved. Seeing the bone fragments up close and in person is fascinating even for casual fans of history and paleontology. While the fossil long predates Ethiopia, of course, it serves as a reminder of how much rich history the country has — and what fascinating discoveries await the curious traveler.","Navigating Sometimes Chaotic, Always Fascinating Addis Ababa",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/travel/addis-ababa-ethiopia-budget-frugal.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss
