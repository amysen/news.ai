The roofers, who were working near Waterville High School’s football field, stood for the national anthem “even though they didn’t have to,” Michelle Lyons Cossar, the Old Town resident who snapped the photo, told Fox News on Monday.

While Cossar was standing for the anthem prior to the start of Saturday’s game, she said she heard someone in the stands point out the workers had also risen.



“When I looked over the fence, I saw them standing and respecting the flag,” she said.

That’s when she decided to take a picture.

“I just thought the world could use a little more of that right now,” she added.

Cossar’s photo has been shared nearly 600 times as of Monday afternoon.

The three men in the photo are Dwayne Harrison, Danny Thyng, and James Scruggs, according to Cossar.

Harrison, who is on the far right in the photo, told Fox News that standing for the anthem was the “right thing to do.”

“It is a respect thing for myself -- we did not do this to prove a point,” Harrison said, adding that he wasn’t aware that a picture was taken.

Thyng and Scruggs have not responded to a request for comment.

Matthew James Phelps, 28, told police he woke up on Sept. 1 to find his wife’s blood-stained body next to him.

“I think I killed my … there’s blood all over me,” Phelps said during a 911 call, “and there’s a bloody knife on the bed. I think I did it.”

The autopsy report, released Tuesday, showed Laure Hugelmaier Phelps, 29, had 44 stab wounds and cuts on her head and neck. The other stabs and cuts were found on her torso, arms and much of her body, The News & Observer reported.

Phelps was believed to have been cut and stabbed with a kitchen knife, the autopsy report said. Toxicologists did not detect any alcohol in the slain woman’s body.

Phelps, who worked at a landscaping company and studied missions and evangelism at Clear Creek Baptist Bible College in Pineville, Ky., told 911 operators he believed he might have stabbed his wife because he consumed too much cough syrup.

“I took more medicine than I should have. I took Coricidin Cough and Cold because I know it can make you feel good and sometimes I can’t sleep at night,” Phelps told a 911 operator.

“I can’t believe I did this,” Phelps was heard sobbing. ""Oh God. She didn’t deserve this. Why?""

When officers arrived to Phelps’ home in North Raleigh, they discovered his wife in a “fetal position, covered in blood on the bedroom floor,” the autopsy report said. She was rushed to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead.

In September, a grand jury discovered there was enough probable cause to decide Phelps “willfully, unlawfully and feloniously did of malice aforethought kill and murder his wife.” The couple was married for less than a year.

It was not immediately clear how much Coricidin Phelps had in his body at the time of the killing. Bayer, the company which supplies Coricidin, told People “there is no evidence to suggest the drug associated with violent behavior.”

The News and Observer reported some potential side effects of the cough medicine were hallucinations and “out of-body experiences.”

Earlier this month, police were granted a search warrant for Phelps’ home where they obtained a “white bedspread, a white sheet, a gray white comforter and several pillowcases that were all marred with an unknown red substance,” the Wake County Clerk of Courts Office, stated.

BLOODY SHEETS, BOXES OF COLD MEDICINE DISCOVERED AT HOME OF ASPIRING PREACHER WHO CLAIMS HE KILLED WIFE

Investigators also took a Coricidin Cold & Cough medicine box that was empty, four computers, receipts, a mortgage statement, a knife set, credit cards and an iPhone that reportedly belonged to the deceased wife.

Phelps, who does not have a criminal record, has been charged with first-degree murder in his wife’s death. He is being held at Wake County Jail without bail. He was slated to be arraigned on Monday.

Anthony Weiner rose to fame with an impassioned speech in Congress in 2010, only to be taken down by a scandal that involved ""sexting"" multiple women for years.

The former New York Democratic congressman was sentenced to 21 months in prison Monday on federal charges of sending sexually explicit messages to a teenage girl.

Weiner, who openly wept as the judge read the sentence, will have to surrender to a yet to be determined prison facility on Nov. 6. He will also have to register as a sex offender.

A 15-year-old girl in North Carolina told the Daily Mail last year that she and Weiner exchanged explicit messages for months. She claimed that he asked her to film herself undressing at one point.

Prior to sentencing, Weiner agreed to not appeal any sentence between 21 and 27 months in prison. He had faced up to 10 years in prison for the charge of transferring obscene material to a minor.

From his start as a politician and marrying political staffer Huma Abedin, to the first reports of his ""sexting"" scandal, here's a look at Weiner's time in the spotlight.

July 2010:

Weiner and Abedin, who met in 2001, got married in New York. Former President Bill Clinton officiated the ceremony.

That same month, Weiner, who was a Democratic representative at the time, gave a moving speech on the House floor after a bill to provide aid to 9/11 emergency responders failed. Weiner gained notoriety and soon started becoming a known name in the political world.

May 2011:

The first photo of the scandal: a picture of Weiner in his boxer brief with a bulging crotch was posted on his Twitter account with about 40,000 followers. Weiner first claimed his Twitter was hacked.

Abedin was secretly pregnant with their son at the time.

June 2011:

Weiner held a tearful news conference on June 6, fessing up to the tweet.

""To be clear, the picture was of me, and I sent it,"" Weiner said.

Weiner announced he would be taking a leave of absence from Congress on June 11. A spokeswoman said Weiner was taking the time to ""seek professional treatment to focus on becoming a better husband and healthier person.""

Five days later, he officially resigned from Congress. He held a news conference in Brooklyn, New York and apologized for his actions and the embarrassment he may have caused.

December 2011:

Abedin gives birth to their son, Jordan Zain Weiner.

May 2013:

After being out of the public eye for nearly two years, Weiner announced he was running for mayor of New York City. In the video announcement, Weiner, Abedin and their son appear to be a happy family, putting the scandal behind them.

""Look, I’ve made some big mistakes and I know I’ve let a lot of people down,"" Weiner said in the video.

""I'm running for mayor because I've been fighting for the middle class and those struggling to make it for my entire life. And I hope I get a second chance to work for you,"" he added.

""We love this city,"" Abedin said. ""And no one will work harder to make it better than Anthony.""

July 2013:

A website published screenshots of alleged conversations that contained explicit photos between Weiner and another woman.

Weiner, with Abedin by his side, held a news conference on July 23 where he admitted to the sexting. Despite the revelation, Abedin stood by her husband's side.

""What I want to say is I love him, I have forgiven him, I believe in him, and as I have said from the beginning, we are moving forward,"" Abedin said.

September 2013:

Weiner lost the mayoral primary, landing in fifth place. Bill de Blasio went on to win the Democratic nomination and the election.

May 2016:

The documentary ""Weiner"" opened in theaters. The film documents Weiner's rollercoaster career in politics and highlighted the scandal. Abedin, at the time, was one of Hillary Clinton's top campaign aides for the 2016 presidential election.

August 2016:

The New York Post published a story about more explicit texts the disgraced politician sent starting in 2015. One of the photos showed Weiner, in his boxer briefs, in bed with his toddler son by his side.

The next day, Abedin announced the couple was separating.

""After a long and painful consideration and work on my marriage, I have made the decision to separate from my husband,"" Abedin said in a statement.

September 2016:

The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the New York Police department announced they were opening an investigation into Weiner after a 15-year-old girl told the Daily Mail the former politician sent her lewd messages starting in January 2016. The exchange continued for months.

October 2016:

The FBI said it was reopening its investigation into the private email server of then Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. The FBI discovered the emails while looking into Weiner's laptop during the investigation into the sexting case.

May 2017:

Weiner appeared in federal court in Manhattan on May 19 and pleaded guilty to a charge of transmitting sexual material to a minor.

""I have a sickness, but I do not have an excuse,"" Weiner tearfully said during his apology in court.

The judge told him he would have to register as a sex offender. Weiner agreed to not appeal any sentence between 21 and 27 months in prison.

On the same day, Abedin reportedly filed for divorce, nine months after announcing their separation.

September 2017:

Weiner’s lawyers argued that he should be spared from prison in a Manhattan federal court.

His lawyers referenced letters that attest to his character, including one by Abedin.

“With Anthony, I have repeatedly found myself in circumstances I never imagined. I am devastated by Anthony’s actions, and I understand he must face their consequences,” she said.

His lawyers referenced “Anthony’s operatic self-destruction,” describing his crime as “the final act … born of deep sickness.” But they also blamed the girl who Weiner conversed with, saying that she had a goal to affect last year’s presidential election as Abedin worked for Clinton.

Weiner’s lawyers also argued that he never purposefully sought out teenagers on the internet and didn’t engage in predatory behaviors.

“He responded to the victim’s request for sexually explicit messages not because she was a teenager but in spite of it,” the lawyers said.

The couple also asked a judge for privacy in their separate divorce proceedings. While their lawyers met with state Supreme Court Justice Michael L. Katz, Weiner and Abedin chatted casually, according to the Associated Press.

October 2017:

A conservative watchdog group said the F.B.I. found about 2,800 government documents pertaining to Abedin’s work with Clinton on Weiner’s personal laptop. Those documents were reportedly sent to the computer by Abedin.

""This is a disturbing development. Our experience with Abedin’s emails suggest these Weiner laptop documents will include classified and other sensitive materials,"" said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton.

The problem was common in the NFL when I played and seems even more common today.
My fellow players, your influence really matters, so that’s why I’m asking you to stand up for the children in your lives.
We still need men and women, fathers and mothers, willing to stand together for change.","To my brothers in the National Football League:

Like you, I had the privilege of playing in the NFL. In my heyday, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, I played with greats like Phil Simms and Lawrence Taylor.

Representatives of your union met with NFL owners in New York on Tuesday to discuss players who have been taking a knee during the national anthem to protest racism in this country. I have strong feelings about that – my father, a Navy pilot, died in a plane crash before I was born. But first I want to talk about a problem that was widespread when I played and is even more common today – fatherlessness.

We don’t talk much today about how boys become men. Back in my day, only about eight percent of all children living in the U.S. went to bed without a father in their story. Today, the problem is three or four times as bad, and it’s especially pronounced in minority communities, with more than 20 million fatherless children in our country. That’s not to mention the children going to bed with a father who’s emotionally absent or worse, present and physically abusive.

Many of you can identify with the pain and loss of not having a father in your story. The problem was common in the NFL when I played and seems even more common today.

Some of you were blessed with men and coaches who stood up for you and invested in your lives while others lived with the loss of a father who stepped out, took a knee and did not take part in your story. This loss affects every part of your life.

Thankfully, another man stood up for me when my mother and I could not stand up for ourselves. He married her when I was one year old, and without him, my story would have been very different. But ultimately, it was my encounter with God the Father that brought the healing I needed to be the kind of man and father that makes a difference.

My fellow players, your influence really matters, so that’s why I’m asking you to stand up for the children in your lives. To these children, you are much more than the jersey that you wear – you are the only father figure they have ever known.

Take a stand by:

Being the kind of man that every mom and dad tells their children, “I want you to be just like him;”

Treating the women in your life with honor and respect;

Living out your public life in a way that gives hope and structure to the fatherless kids that watch you every week; and

Being a present, loving father to your kids.

Finally, let me add a personal note. As a child whose father and stepfather served in the military, I hope you will take a stand for our flag and the freedom that cost many of our fathers their lives. The issues you are fighting for are of the upmost importance. We see you and we hear you.

But no matter what you decide, I hope we can stand together as fathers; this will speak volumes to children of every color and race and encourage them to do the same.

More than 2,500 years ago, a man wrote in Lamentations 5:3, “Orphans we are, not a father in sight and our mothers are no better than widows.” In so many ways, not much has changed since then. We still need men and women, fathers and mothers, willing to stand together for change.

I’m praying for you,

One user commented: “This ad campaign is genius.","A women's suit company has launched a racy new ad campaign featuring women in sleek, tailored suits alongside men in, well, nothing.

Dutch suit label Suistudio has taken their slogan “Not Dressing Men” to a whole new level by including buff, butt-naked men in the promo shots for their latest fashion line.

The photos show women dressed in well-fitted suits and clearly in a position of power, while the naked men are featured in the background and are almost used as a type of prop.

One of the pictures shows a woman sitting on a lounge, dressed in a beige suit, while she rests her feet on the naked man stretched out beneath her.

Another features a woman in a sleek black suit, lounging on a couch with her hand on a man’s bare butt.

The photos are all set in what looks like a luxury high-rise apartment, with the woman always front and center and the man in the background or half out of the frame with his face concealed.

The studio is using the campaign as a statement to highlight the sexist way women are commonly portrayed in advertisements, particularly when selling products aimed at men.

Vice president of Suistudio USA Kristina Barricelli said the pictures bring focus to the normalized way women are often sexualized and used as objects in advertisements — the men aren’t portrayed in any way that women haven’t been before.

“There is nothing wrong with sex, the naked human body, and the inclusion of that in a campaign. Sex is a big part of fashion,” she told online newsite Upworthy.

“The problem is that in recent history, we haven’t seen a naked man objectified in the background. How strange! Why not?”

The ad campaign has gained a lot of attention online and there has been backlash from people calling the ad out for objectification, claiming it is a step backwards in the fight for gender equality.

“I’m sure if the roles were reversed and this was published there would be a backlash from females saying that they are being [sexualized], objectified, abused and so on. But somehow it is OK to do the same things to males. Hypocrites,” one Instagram user commented.

“Sexism is sexism, no matter if a woman dominates a man or vice versa.”

“And revenge is not a way to overcome injustice,” another user said.

While some are calling out the ad for being sexist, others are saying it is empowering and praising the company for shedding light on gender inequality.

One user commented: “This ad campaign is genius. How many times have we seen a woman’s legs only or her bottom as a prop in men’s ad campaigns? All is fair in love and fashion.”

“Excellent cultural commentary! Love the irony,” another said.

Police believe Prince is ""associated"" with the business, but were not sure of his employment status. The owner of Advanced Granite Solutions, a home improvement company, told the Associated Press in a brief phone interview Prince has been an employee for four months, and was a machine operator.

Barak Caba was shaken and would not provide additional details, according to the AP.

Prince may be driving a 2008 Black GMC Acadia SUV with a Delaware Registration of PC064273, according to Maryland State Police, who warned ""use extreme caution if you see him.""

The FBI is assisting local authorities to find Prince. Investigators are currently treating the shooting as a case of workplace violence and don't see ties to terrorism, Dave Fitz, a spokesman for the Baltimore FBI field office, told the AP.

Two victims from the shooting were taken to Shock Trauma hospital in Baltimore and are listed in critical condition, the facility said on Twitter.

A poor pup needed emergency surgery after the dog started eating mouthfuls of gravel.

Bella, a one-year-old French bulldog, was rushed to the vets after she was unable to eat, constantly being sick and ""very lethargic.""

Owner Victoria, 37, was baffled by Bella's sickness, but an X-ray revealed she had ingested a large collection of stones.

""I took Bella for a check-up because she wasn’t herself at all,"" Victoria, whose last name was not given, said. ""She started snapping at us and couldn’t keep anything down.""

""I wondered if she’d eaten something odd or had worms but then the vets said they could feel a mass in her stomach and I just broke down,"" she said.

Luckily, vets at the PDSA centre in Croydon, south London, managed to save the poor dog's life with laxatives and fluids to flush her system.

""Bella’s condition was very worrying, she was very lethargic and was suffering from diarrhoea and vomiting,"" Laura Heaps, PDSA vet, said. ""We examined her and could feel something in her stomach and to be sure what it was, we X-rayed her.""

""When we saw the images on the screen we couldn’t believe our eyes,"" Heaps said. ""You could clearly see the gravel in her stomach and colon. Luckily because the stones were so small and unlikely to cause a fatal blockage we were able to avoid surgery.""

The laxatives and fluids worked on Bella, and she was able to return home the next day.

Victoria said she is now keeping a closer eye on the ""inquisitive"" dog.

""Bella was out of sorts for a couple of days but she was soon was back to her normal self,"" she said. ""I can’t thank PDSA enough for the fantastic treatment she received. I’m keeping a close eye on her now to make sure it doesn’t happen again.""

Jeffrey Michels, 64, was arrested Thursday on charges of desertion after he failed to report for duty at North Dakota’s Minot Air Force Base on July 6, 1977, WFTV reported.

Michels, originally from East Liverpool, Ohio, was found living a double life in Sanford, Fla. — under the name “Jeffrey Lantz,” according to a police report.

The man reportedly used the fake name to obtain a business license in Florida in 1998. Online records show the name Jeffrey Lantz had a certified general contractor license for construction business Atlantic Development Corporation.

A photo of Michels was posted on July 9 to the Facebook group “Veteran Doe” — a website dedicated to bringing “attention to the many missing veteran/active duty cases and unidentified person cases where there is a possible military connection.” The post was deleted after Michels was discovered.

It’s unclear if the Air Force opened an investigation into Michels' disappearance due to the Facebook post.

One user commented: “This ad campaign is genius.","A women's suit company has launched a racy new ad campaign featuring women in sleek, tailored suits alongside men in, well, nothing.

Dutch suit label Suistudio has taken their slogan “Not Dressing Men” to a whole new level by including buff, butt-naked men in the promo shots for their latest fashion line.

The photos show women dressed in well-fitted suits and clearly in a position of power, while the naked men are featured in the background and are almost used as a type of prop.

One of the pictures shows a woman sitting on a lounge, dressed in a beige suit, while she rests her feet on the naked man stretched out beneath her.

Another features a woman in a sleek black suit, lounging on a couch with her hand on a man’s bare butt.

The photos are all set in what looks like a luxury high-rise apartment, with the woman always front and center and the man in the background or half out of the frame with his face concealed.

The studio is using the campaign as a statement to highlight the sexist way women are commonly portrayed in advertisements, particularly when selling products aimed at men.

Vice president of Suistudio USA Kristina Barricelli said the pictures bring focus to the normalized way women are often sexualized and used as objects in advertisements — the men aren’t portrayed in any way that women haven’t been before.

“There is nothing wrong with sex, the naked human body, and the inclusion of that in a campaign. Sex is a big part of fashion,” she told online newsite Upworthy.

“The problem is that in recent history, we haven’t seen a naked man objectified in the background. How strange! Why not?”

The ad campaign has gained a lot of attention online and there has been backlash from people calling the ad out for objectification, claiming it is a step backwards in the fight for gender equality.

“I’m sure if the roles were reversed and this was published there would be a backlash from females saying that they are being [sexualized], objectified, abused and so on. But somehow it is OK to do the same things to males. Hypocrites,” one Instagram user commented.

“Sexism is sexism, no matter if a woman dominates a man or vice versa.”

“And revenge is not a way to overcome injustice,” another user said.

While some are calling out the ad for being sexist, others are saying it is empowering and praising the company for shedding light on gender inequality.

One user commented: “This ad campaign is genius. How many times have we seen a woman’s legs only or her bottom as a prop in men’s ad campaigns? All is fair in love and fashion.”

“Excellent cultural commentary! Love the irony,” another said.

The acronym used to make fun of anti-development attitudes used to be NIMBY -- Not In My Back Yard.","Did you happen to catch CNN's latest smear?

Anderson Cooper's show recently featured a ""two-part exclusive"" that claims Donald Trump's EPA director had conspired with the CEO of a mining company to ""withdraw environmental restrictions"" so the company could dig ""the largest open pit mine in the world in an extremely sensitive watershed in wild Alaska.""

The report was enough to horrify any caring person. CNN showed beautiful pictures of colorful salmon swimming in Bristol Bay, and the reporter intoned dramatically, ""EPA staffers were shocked to receive this email obtained exclusively by CNN which says 'we have been directed by the administrator to withdraw restrictions' ... (P)rotection of that pristine area was being removed.""

No! A ""pristine"" area and gorgeous salmon were about to be obliterated by a mine!

I would have believed it, except I happened to report on that mine a couple years ago.

The acronym used to make fun of anti-development attitudes used to be NIMBY -- Not In My Back Yard. Now it's BANANA: Build Absolutely Nothing Anywhere Near Anybody.

I knew that the real scandal was not EPA director Scott Pruitt's decision to ""withdraw the restrictions,"" it was what President Obama's EPA did to the company's mining proposal in the first place.

Zealots at the EPA had conspired with rich environmental activists to kill the mine before its environmental impact statement could even be submitted. This was unprecedented.

The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform later concluded: ""EPA employees had inappropriate contact with outside groups and failed to conduct an impartial, fact-based review.""

Now, appropriately, Pruitt undid that censorship of science.

But CNN, implying devious secrecy said, ""according to multiple sources, he made that decision without a briefing from any of EPA's scientists.""

Shocking!

But Pruitt didn't require opinions from scientists. He didn't approve the mine. He didn't make a science decision. He simply followed the law and allowed a company to submit a proposal.

Also, despite CNN's repeated depictions of salmon on Bristol Bay, it turns out that the proposed mine would not even be on the Bay. It would not even be 10 miles away, or 20 miles away, or even 50 miles. The proposed mine would be about 100 miles away.

Did CNN mention that? No. Never. We asked CNN why. And why not point out that the mining company is just being allowed to start the EPA's long and arduous environmental review? They didn't get back to us.

Of course, explaining that wouldn't fit CNN's theme: Evil Trump appointee ravages environment.

Their reporter did at least speak with the mine's CEO, Tom Collier, who tried to explain.

""It's not a science -- it's a process decision.""

But the reporter, Drew Griffin, wouldn't budge. He called Collier ""a guy who wants to mine gold in an area that many scientists believe will destroy one of the most pristine sockeye salmon sporting grounds in the whole world.""

By the way, Collier isn't an evil Republican-businessman-nature-destroyer. He's a Democrat who once ran environment policy for President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore. CNN never mentioned that either.

Instead the reporter implied evil collusion: ""This looks like the head of a gold mine went to a new administrator and got him to reverse what an entire department had worked on for years.""

Here at least the report was accurate. Obama's environmental department did try to kill that mine for years. They colluded with groups like the Natural Resources Defense Council, one of America's wealthiest environment groups.

The NRDC is mostly made up of anti-progress lawyers who want no mines built anywhere. Don't believe me? I asked NRDC spokesman Bob Deans:

STOSSEL: There are some mines where NRDC says, great, go ahead?

DEANS: It's not up to us.

STOSSEL: Are there any?

DEANS: It's not up to us to green light mines...

STOSSEL: Are there any you don't complain about?

DEANS: Yeah, sure.

So I asked him for some names. He and the NRDC still haven't provided any.

If these zealots and their sycophants in the media get their way, America will become a place with no mining, no pipelines, no oil drilling, no new ... anything.

Since Trump signed an executive order in January establishing a ban on travel of people from Muslim-majority nations, it has been a point of contention and challenged in court. Here’s a look at the ban’s journey through the legal system.

Oct. 17 – Federal judge temporarily blocks travel ban

U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson granted a request from Hawaii to temporarily block the latest version of Trump's travel ban, which was supposed to take effect at midnight ET on Oct. 18.

Hawaii has argued that the revised ban – which includes citizens from Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria and Yemen, and some Venezuelan government officials and their families – is a continuation of Trump's ""promise to exclude Muslims from the United States.""

""Today’s dangerously flawed district court order undercuts the President’s efforts to keep the American people safe and enforce minimum security standards for entry into the United States,"" the White House said in a statement. ""The Department of Justice will vigorously defend the President’s lawful action.""

Oct. 10 – Supreme Court dismisses one case

The Supreme Court didn’t take action on a case that originated in Hawaii pertaining to Trump’s travel ban and a ban on refugees. That ban does not expire until Oct. 24.

However, it did dismiss another case that originated in Maryland. That case involved a ban that has since expired and been replaced with a new one by the administration.

The court’s moves largely suggest that it will step away from the controversial ban for now.

Oct. 5 – Justice Department asks Supreme Court to drop travel ban case

The Department of Justice asked the nation’s highest court to dismiss the case challenging the administration’s travel ban. The administration argued the case should be dismissed because it was regarding a previous travel ban that is now moot.

Sept. 24 – Trump signs new travel ban

As Trump’s original ban was set to expire, the president unveiled new restrictions on travel to the U.S. from certain countries’ citizens.

The revised ban included citizens from Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria and Yemen. It also included some government officials from Venezuela. The ban is set to go into effect on Oct. 18.

Sept. 12 – Supreme Court lifts restrictions

The Supreme Court blocked a lower court’s decision that would have allowed refugees to enter the country under certain conditions, blocking a ruling that said a resettlement agency counts as a “bona fide relationship.”

Sept. 7 – Appeals court limits travel ban

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld a lower court ruling that would allow for more refugees to enter the country despite the ban. The federal court ruled that refugees working with a resettlement agency would be considered to have established an approved “bona fide relationship” with a contact in the U.S.

WHO DOES TRUMP’S TRAVEL BAN BLOCK FROM ENTERING THE US?

It also expanded the scope of a “bona fide relationship” to include other family members, such as grandparents and other relatives.

July 19 – Supreme Court allows for strict enforcement of refugee ban

The Supreme Court, temporarily, allowed for the administration’s travel ban to keep a strict enforcement on its ban of refugees. It did, however, leave in place the court order that made it easier for travelers from the six Muslim-majority countries to enter the U.S. and allowed a previous expansion of “bona fide relationships” to stay.

July 13 – Federal judge expands scope of travel ban

U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson, in Hawaii, ruled that a “bona fide relationship” certain travelers need before entering the U.S. could be expanded to include grandparents and other relatives.

The Justice Department filed an emergency request with the Supreme Court for clarification.

June 29 – Travel ban goes into effect

After the Supreme Court’s ruling, the Trump administration issued guidance on who would be allowed into the country and who would be barred. The travel ban went into effect at 8 p.m. ET.

June 26 – Supreme Court allows for travel ban to continue

The Supreme Court announced it would allow Trump to forge ahead with a limited version of his travel ban. Trump hailed the decision as a “victory for national security.”

HAWAII GETS CHANCE TO MAKE CASE FOR FIGHTING 3RD TRAVEL BAN

The court said it would hear arguments in October, but until then, the ban on travelers from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen could be enforced if the visitors lacked a “credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.”

May 25 – Travel ban blocked by federal court

The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in Virginia blocked the travel ban from being implemented. It had begun to hear the case earlier in May.

“We remain unconvinced [the ban] has more to do with national security than it does with effectuating the President’s promised Muslim ban,"" the court said at the time.

March 30 – Trump administration appeals ruling

The Department of Justice filed an appeal with the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to challenge the ruling against the travel ban.

March 29 – Federal judge continues to block travel ban

U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson granted a request to continue to halt the travel ban.

March 16 – Another federal judge temporarily blocks the order

Sitting in Maryland, U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang temporarily halted the executive order. The injunction was not as comprehensive as the one issued earlier in Hawaii, but it did contend that the ban was discriminatory toward Muslims.

MEGA-COMPANIES DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM CHARITIES FOUND DONATING TO ANTI-TRUMP GROUP

The order did not change the previous injunction in Hawaii, but rather just reinforced it.

March 15 – Federal judge blocks travel ban

U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson prevented the travel ban from being implemented just before it was set to take effect. Watson granted the state of Hawaii’s request for a temporary restraining order.

Trump called the decision an “unprecedented judicial overreach.”

March 8 – Hawaii sues to block the travel ban

The state of Hawaii sued in an attempt to halt the Trump administration’s travel ban from going into effect. Lawyers said the “new executive order is resulting in the establishment of religion in the State of Hawaii contrary to its state Constitution.”

Lawyers also argued that the ban would damage Hawaii’s “economy, educational institutions and tourism industry; and it is subjecting a portion of the state’s citizens to second-class treatment and discrimination, while denying all Hawaii residents the benefits of an inclusive and pluralistic society.”

March 6 – Trump unveils new travel ban

Trump signed a new executive order which barred travel from six predominantly Muslim countries for 90 days – removing Iraq from the new ban.

The new order also exempted permanent residents and current visa holders from the travel ban. Syrian refugees were still included in the new order but only for 120 instead of indefinitely.

Feb. 15 – Trump’s travel ban gets a defender

Texas Attorney Ken Paxton split with other states and defended the travel ban as he filed documents with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit asking to reconsider a decision blocking the ban.

Paxton argued that the order is a legal exercise of presidential authority.

Feb. 13 – Federal judge grants injunction against ban

A federal judge in Virginia granted an injunction to prevent the administration from implementing the ban.

U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema said the ban was unconstitutional as it had a religious bias.

Feb. 9 – Travel ban is again blocked

The travel ban’s suspension was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in a unanimous decision.

MUSLIM ADVOCATES, LEGAL ORG FILES SUITS OVER TRAVEL BAN

Those judges were Michelle Friedland, appointed by former President Barack Obama; Richard Clifton, appointed by former President George W. Bush; and William Canby, appointed by former President Jimmy Carter.

The court began to hear arguments from the Justice Department and lawyers from the states of Washington and Maryland – in opposition to the ban – on Feb. 7.

Feb. 6 – Justice Department asks federal court to intervene

The Justice Department filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit asking it to intervene and reverse a previous judge’s decision to halt the travel ban.

Sixteen attorneys general filed an amicus brief in support of the lawsuit against the travel ban. Those included: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington, D.C.

Feb. 3 – Judge declines to extend injunction against travel ban

U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton did not extend a temporary injunction against the administration’s travel ban.

But U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle did issue a temporary block of the ban on the same day.

“The state has met its burden in demonstrating immediate and irreparable injury,” Robart said as he ruled in favor of lawyers from the states of Washington and Minnesota.

Feb. 1 – Administration tweaks travel ban

The Trump administration tweaked its travel ban to exempt legal permanent residents of the U.S.

AFGHAN GIRLS ROBOTICS TEAM ARRIVES IN US JUST IN TIME

“They no longer need a waiver because if they are a legal permanent resident, they won’t need it anymore,” then-White House press secretary Sean Spicer said of green card holders.

Jan. 30 – Senate Republicans save travel ban from Democrats

Senate Republicans squashed an effort by Democrats to overturn the executive order. When Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. sought a vote on legislation to reverse the ban, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., objected.

Trump also fired acting Attorney Gen. Sally Yates on this day when she refused to defend the travel ban.

Jan. 29 – Temporary stay issued on travel ban

A Boston federal court temporarily put Trump’s travel ban on hold for one week.

The ruling stipulated that previously approved refugees, valid visa holders and lawful permanent residents or travelers from the seven countries included in Trump’s order could not be detained or removed from the U.S. because of the executive order.

Jan. 28 – Federal judge issues emergency injunction against ban

A federal judge in New York issued an emergency order blocking, in part, the executive order. U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly’s ruling temporarily barred the U.S. from deporting people who arrived with a valid visa or who had already completed a refugee application.

As dozens of people were detained after their planes landed in the U.S., massive protests erupted at airports nationwide.

Jan. 27 – Trump signs executive order barring travel from seven Muslim-majority nations

Trump signed an executive order which immediately barred entry into the U.S. for the citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.

The order, dubbed “Protection the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States,” also halted the U.S. refugee program for 120 days, but indefinitely barred all Syrian refugees from entering the country.

“There were some inappropriate examples used in those presentations – asking students to identify certain things about themselves that is protected by law,” the superintendent admitted.

He sent a letter to parents detailing his concerns about what happened at the high school.

“I would not expect an exercise in which individual students are asked to reveal their sexual orientation and gender identity to be part of the English curriculum,” he wrote. “In this case, there was no parent notification that topics relating to sexuality would be discussed outside the approved health curriculum, which was not acceptable.”

Parents want to know why the Moab Pride group was allowed inside the high school and why teachers did not intervene when the group began to solicit personal information from the children.

“I really don’t have an explanation,” the superintendent said. “It caught the school off guard.”

One parent, who asked not to be identified, told me students were divided up by religion, sexual preference and political views.

“Their intention was to plant seeds in the high school. They were trying to indoctrinate the kids. When you have people saying ‘I’m a queer and it’s okay. I’m a lesbian and it’s okay’ – I mean – that’s indoctrination,” the parent told me.

As for the workshop where kids were forced to engage in identity mapping?

“I don’t know what that means,” the superintendent said.

Regardless, the school district said the presenters will not be invited back to the school.

“Every child that walks into that school has to feel safe no matter what their religious views are or their sexual preference,” a parent said. “Instead of it being anti-bullying, the workshops directly pointed them out.”

The folks in Grand County, Utah just learned a very important lesson about the sex and gender revolutionaries. They preach tolerance and acceptance, but the revolutionaries don’t practice what they preach.

The anti-bullying campaign, which the burger chain describes as “eye-opening” in a press release, “brings the issue even closer to home with an experience that took place in a Burger King restaurant.”

The campaign, known as “Bullying Junior,” begins with some upsetting personal shares from students, each of whom relays a time they were bullied. After every high schooler tells his or her story to the camera, an unsettling statistic flashes across the screen: “30 percent of student worldwide are bullied each year.”

BURGER KING OFFERS FREE WHOPPERS TO PEOPLE JUST FIRED FROM THEIR JOBS

Following the kids' earnest confessions, the ad cuts to the inside of Burger King where an experiment of sorts is taking place: A bunch of bullies (who are paid actors) are bullying a high-school junior (also an actor) inside the Burger King. First they tease and push him, then they pour a drink on his food.

The bullied teen begs for them to stop while most of the customers in the store (not actors) can be seen ignoring what’s happening to the boy.

Then, the ad cuts to the inside of the Burger King's kitchen, where a staffer (also an actor) is seen ""bullying"" a Whopper Jr. by punching and smashing it. This burger, and several just like it, are then served to unsuspecting Burger King customers.

Once the customers receive their food, the video reports that “95 percent of the real-life customers reported the bullied Whopper Jr."" to the staff. However, that statistic is jarringly juxtaposed with the next on-screen message, which states that just “12 percent"" of the customers stood up to the bullies on behalf of the young actor who was being mistreated.

The ""shocking and not so shocking” outcome is that people are more interested in the meal — the one they paid for, and expected not to be trashed — than they were in the high schooler who was being bullied right in front of them, the press release says.

Jackson Vincent snapped these astounding photographs of the huge roo tensing its rippling muscles in Boodjidup Creek in Margaret River, Western Australia.

The 27-year-old couldn’t believe his eyes when he clocked the mammoth two meter mammal standing in the water – and feared it could be preparing to attack beloved pet dog Dharma.

Jackson, from Freemantle, Perth, had been visiting his grandmother in Margaret River and saw the gargantuan animal on her property at about 11.30am.

He said: “I have been going to that creek since I was a little boy and there have always been kangaroos on the property.

“I was walking my dog and we saw this huge roo standing in the water. I have never seen a kangaroo standing in the water like that, we could just see his head at first.

“As I ran around him to take a picture he came closer and that was when I realised he was coming right at me and he was really big – one of the biggest I have ever seen.

“I am pretty confident around animals but the moment when he started to come out of the water my heart definitely jumped and I decided to take a few steps back.

“He looked to be at least two meters tall or taller and must have weighed at least 100 [kilograms].

“He had a really big body and was taller than me. There are a lot of roos at my grandma’s place but I have never seen one that muscular before – he was a big macho male.

“I decided to get Dharma out of there as we thought the kangaroo was going to lure her into the water to drown her.”

Jackson’s Facebook post with his images of the kangaroo’s muscular physique instantly went viral, racking up thousands of likes and shares.

Online commenters were quick to point out the animal’s impressive bodybuilder-like muscular shoulders, biceps and chest and threatening posture.

After dropping Kelpie Dharma back at his grandmother’s house Jackson returned to the creek to see the kangaroo was still there.

Jackson added: “His claws were really big – they were as long as my hand. That for me was even scarier than his muscles, they looked nasty.

“I have never seen a kangaroo be so defensive – it definitely looked like he was puffing his chest muscles up.

“I definitely wouldn’t like to take him on in a boxing match.”

She was put to the test on that ill-fated day when the bandmates played some music, expecting Manson to come up with lyrics.

“I feel it’s really important because you’re only as interesting as how authentic you are as an artist,” she said.
I don’t care about being sexually objectified or being famous for my looks or lack of looks.","When Shirley Manson was asked to audition for a rock band named Garbage back in 1994, the fiery haired singer, who left behind her native Scotland for Madison, Wisconsin, was certain she flunked her tryout big-time.

“It was embarrassing,” the 51-year-old front woman told Fox News. “It’s a miracle they ever called me back… I’ve been in a band for a decade... On paper, any normal person would assume that I had a lot of experience. And I did have a lot of experience in terms of live performance. But in terms of working in a studio? I had no experience at all.”

Manson, who initially told Butch Vig, Steve Marker and Duke Erikson she was a songwriting pro, actually had zero experience. She was put to the test on that ill-fated day when the bandmates played some music, expecting Manson to come up with lyrics. She was stunned.

“I’ve never done it before,” recalled Manson. “I was practically mute. I was so petrified. I didn’t believe in myself… So of course, nothing came out!”

However, the musical connection and friendship Manson developed with the group helped her secure a second chance. She managed to join Garbage, which became one of the best-selling bands in the ‘90s, earning double platinum in the U.K., U.S. and Australia. Their six studio albums have collectively sold over 15 million copies worldwide.

Garbage chronicled their musical journey in a new coffee table autobiography, “This Is the Noise That Keeps Me Awake.”

That awkward encounter wouldn’t be the last incident Manson managed to fumble through over the years. When Garbage was nominated for Album of the Year at the 1999 Grammy Awards, Manson decided to wear a dress featuring the artwork for their sophomore release, “Version 2.0.” However, she didn’t realize the album’s cover art didn’t completely cover up her body.

“I absolutely had no idea it was completely see-through,” she insisted. “I was sitting in a dark hotel room and then I was outside in bright sunshine… but at least my body looks good! I’m grateful my [breasts] were young and perky, so it doesn’t look bad, but I literally had no idea.

""It was only when I was going through photographs when I stumbled on one from the Grammys and went ‘Holy s--t, that’s completely see through!’ Nobody, absolutely nobody, up until like this past month, has ever mentioned it to me. So it came as a sort of a surprise.”

As for the fate of that infamous ensemble?

“I probably dumped it in a garbage bin knowing me,” said Manson. “I dumped everything in a garbage bin.”

Another shock Manson experienced was when Garbage decided to take a break at the end of 2005. The plan was initially for a year, but the hiatus lasted for five.

“It was something that came at a bit of a surprise to all of us, but I think we’re all grateful that we took that time to just refuel and find a different way of looking at things,” explained Manson. “When you’re in a successful band, you get locked in a bit of a bubble for a while and your growth — your emotional growth and your intellectual growth — gets stunted.

""But when you’re released to the wild, so to speak, you can adventure again, be curious again, be around other people and get challenged and raise questions as a human being… I’m grateful we took that break, although it was painful at the time. We all missed each other and we all missed being creative.”

As for going on another break? Manson joked “I think we have that conversation every night,” while also lighting up at the memory of the group reuniting in 2012 for the album “Not Your Kind of People.”

“It felt like no time had passed,” she said. “We just locked back into our relationship as it had been without some of the gripes and some of the… little resentments that we all have been harboring a few years. That all went out the window and the dynamic in the band has been good ever since. It was a legal separation and it worked for us. It was good.”

While Garbage continues to tour across the country, there’s one thing fans won’t be shocked to see: Manson happily embracing getting older in front of cameras and audiences.

“I feel it’s really important because you’re only as interesting as how authentic you are as an artist,” she said. “I had this realization when I hit 40. I was looking at all of these artists and thinking, ‘Why aren’t there any women talking about the experience of being an elder, being unashamed of their experience and their past… I really couldn’t find as many female artists who were willing to investigate that side of being human… I just wanted to have the courage to go there.”

Manson admitted it’s not easy being a female artist scrutinized over her looks before their talent, but she has zero interest in looking like any other pop star. Her goal, as it’s always been, is to make good music.

“… I understood that I could try and be a sad, sort of fake version of myself, thus keeping myself inside a cage, or I can break out from the cage and start to form a future for myself and build my own career based on being an authentic musician,” said Manson. “And that’s what really what I was interested in.

""I really don’t care about being a famous person. I don’t care about being sexually objectified or being famous for my looks or lack of looks. I just want to write something that somebody right between the eyes or into their heart. And if I can do that then I’ve done my job. That’s what I’m here to do.”","Shirley Manson recalls disastrous Garbage audition, infamous see-through dress",http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/18/shirley-manson-recalls-disastrous-garbage-audition-infamous-see-through-dress.html

Following the spate of violent protests in Charlottesville, Va., and Berkley, lawmakers in Los Angeles are contemplating imposing new restrictions on what people can carry at public demonstrations and meetings in the city.

In addition to tiki torches – which were used in Charlottesville – pepper spray, gas masks and shields, city lawmakers seek to prohibit water cannons, Tasers, bricks, hammers, cans of spray paint and drones. Glass and plastic bottles filled with liquids that are alcoholic or not consumable would also be banned.

The city council said it was trying to be proactive to prevent violent incidents, the Los Angeles Times reported.

Councilman Mitch Englander, who is a reserve police officer, said the city’s attorneys are drafting the new law and would work closely with the police department to finalize the list of banned items.

“We don’t have to go far to look at what’s happened,” he said during a committee meeting last week. “We’re looking at best practices.”

Los Angeles currently prohibits protesters from carrying wooden planks more than 2 inches wide and a quarter-inch thick.

Critics of the proposed law challenged the legal basis for prohibiting items at protests that otherwise are lawful to possess on the street.

“If it is lawful to have that in your possession while you’re standing on the sidewalk, then what is the difference?” Carol Sobel, a civil rights attorney who has repeatedly sued the city, said.

Peter Bibring, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, raised concerns about banning drones that are often used to document turnout.

“If the city is going to pass a blanket rule that says you can’t use drones over city streets, that’s one thing,” Bibring said. “But to target protests, in particular, raises First Amendment concerns.”

The city restricts the possession of some kinds of weapons, including knives and arrows in public, as well as prohibits people from carrying glass bottles onto public property where permitted community events are being held, with exceptions for medicine, baby formula, food preparation and beverages sold on site.","Los Angeles seeks to ban tiki torches, pepper spray, shields at protests",http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/18/los-angeles-seeks-to-ban-tiki-torches-pepper-spray-shields-at-protests.html

Bob Menendez, D-N.J., who faces more than a dozen charges of fraud and bribery. And despite the defense’s objections, a federal judge Monday refused to throw out the case.

Menendez is accused of accepting donations, trips and gifts in exchange from an eye-doctor friend in exchange for pressuring government officials to act in ways that would be beneficial to his friend’s business interests.

Menendez has maintained his innocence, and U.S. District Judge William Walls had to decide if he would dismiss it, using a 2016 Supreme Court ruling which outlined a stricter definition of what an “official act” is. The defense argued that the allegations against Menendez do not meet that narrower definition.

Walls said Monday that the case would continue – seen as a huge win for prosecutors. The defense will not start its case.

It’s the first time in nine years that a sitting U.S. senator is facing a federal bribery charge.

What is Menendez accused of?

Menendez, 63, accepted a plethora of campaign donations, gifts and vacations from Salomon Melgen, a Florida ophthalmologist.

In return, Menendez used his position to lobby on behalf of Melgen’s business interests, according to prosecutors.

Melgen allegedly directed more than $750,000 in campaign contributions to entities that supported Menendez, according to the indictment, which prosecutors said were inducements to get Menendez to use his influence on Melgen's behalf. Prosecutors have also accused Menendez of trying to hide the gifts.

Melgen also paid for Menendez and his girlfriend to stay for three nights at a Parisian hotel where rooms typically cost about $1,500 per night and allowed the senator the use of his private jet, according to prosecutors.

NBC NEWS CALLS MENENDEZ A REPUBLICAN IN CORRUPTION CASE REPORT

Federal prosecutors said that Menendez “sold his office for a lifestyle that he couldn’t afford.”

The indictment also alleged that Menendez pressured State Department officials to give visas to three young women described as Melgen's girlfriends.

What is the senator’s defense?

Both Menendez and Melgen have pleaded not guilty – and Menendez has vehemently denied the accusations against him.

Throughout the trial thus far, defense attorneys have sought to prove that Menendez and Melgen have been friends since before the former became a senator, and the trips were nothing more than friends traveling together.

At times emotional, Menendez has maintained his innocence throughout the trial.

What has happened in the trial so far?

Defense attorney Raymond Brown got into a spat with U.S. District Court Judge William H. Walls at the start of the trial. Brown accused Walls of being “extremely prejudicial to the defense.”

MENENDEZ CASE MAY IMPACT VOTES

Walls had denied Menendez’s request that the trial be recessed during critical Senate votes, stating that his job should not be treated differently from that of a construction worker or cab driver.

The trial has also focused on a meeting former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D, set up with Menendez and former Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to discuss a nearly $9 million Medicaid billing dispute.

Sebelius testified in court this week that the incident was the first time in her role in government that she was asked by a senator to take a meeting with another senator. She said that Meglen wasn’t specifically mentioned in the meeting but that she assumed his case was the topic.

Prosecutors didn’t call Reid to testify before it rested its case on Oct. 11.

Walls declined to throw the case out despite the defense’s objections that the accusations against Menendez didn’t fit the narrow definition of bribery that was a result of a 2016 Supreme Court decision.

In recent months, the McDonnell ruling led judges to throw out bribery convictions of at least three other former public officials, including a Pennsylvania congressman.

Is there anything else to know about Salomon Melgen?

Melgen, 63, was convicted of 67 counts of health care fraud in April in what the Palm Beach Post called one of the biggest Medicare fraud cases in the U.S.

During that case, prosecutors argued that Melgen, who was born in the Dominican Republic, robbed Medicare of as much as $105 million, according to the newspaper. His sentencing has been delayed until after this trial.

Aside from Menendez, Melgen has given significant amounts of money to a variety of Democratic lawmakers, according to public records.

What happens if Menendez is convicted?

If Menendez is convicted and goes to prison, Gov. Chris Christie, R-N.J., would pick a replacement.

That prospect is troublesome for Democrats who fear that Christie would pick a Republican to fill the Senate seat – giving the GOP an additional edge for legislative fights.

Vice President Mike Pence said this week that it would be ""altogether inappropriate and wrong"" for a convicted felon to remain in the Senate. However, he said it would be a decision left up to the Senate if Menendez didn't resign.

""It's all in the pan-bang,"" baker-blogger Sarah Kieffer says of her unusual chocolate chip cookies. The Minnesota baker's not-so-secret recipe had already been circulating on Instagram when the New York Times tested it out, and after the Times covered it, it went viral.

Kieffer detailed her technique after food writer Julia Moskin became intrigued by the attention the funny-looking cookies — ""as wide as a salad plate and flat as a flounder"" — were getting online.

She assumed the ""mutant"" cookies copied by food blogs were a ""cry for help,"" and she sought out the creator. Kieffer didn't hold back, revealing how she makes the unusual ringed edges by opening the oven after the cookies have slightly risen and giving the baking sheet a good slam on the rack or on the top of the oven.

She repeats the whack a few times more during the baking process, sending ripples fanning out from the center. The result is a distinct soft-crunchy texture that Moskin proclaims to be ""a leap forward in cookie technology.""

Kieffer says she has no idea what inspired her to try the pan-bang.

""I can't imagine a better chocolate chip cookie,"" says Kieffer, whose cookie glamour shots have scored more than 2,000 likes. ""I still can't believe it,"" Kieffer tells the Star Tribune.

""It's so exciting.""

Kieffer has other tips: she uses chopped chocolate rather than chips, and she chills her dough balls. Briefly freezing the dough helps it keep its shape, and it keeps ""the centers gooey, and the edges crispy,"" she says.

But Kieffer knows her time in the cookie limelight is limited. ""You never know what someone else will think of,"" she tells the Times. Get the recipe here.

For years, scientists have wondered if there might be a larger, planet-sized body lurking in or around the thick layer of debris called the Kuiper Belt, and now NASA is saying the evidence is hard to ignore.

The would-be planet, which would likely be a frigid place thanks to its position on the very outer edge of the system, hasn’t been directly spotted, but measurements of other known objects in the Kuiper Belt heavily suggest something is there. The only thing left to do is actually spot it, or verify that it doesn’t actually exist at all.

“There are now five different lines of observational evidence pointing to the existence of Planet Nine,” Konstantin Batygin, a Caltech planetary astrophysicist, explains. “If you were to remove this explanation and imagine Planet Nine does not exist, then you generate more problems than you solve. All of a sudden, you have five different puzzles, and you must come up with five different theories to explain them.”

Simply put, the observations that have already been made all point to the existence of a planet that we don’t yet know about. The mythical Planet Nine is pulling on other objects in the Kuiper Belt, and causing them to behave in ways that match with the theory that an unknown planet is doing the pulling.

Now, scientists are doing their best to actually spot the planet, but it won’t be easy. Tucked away on the edge of our Solar System, it won’t exactly be the brightest object in the sky, and the only hope of capturing a glimpse of it will be to find its faint glow.

But what is so exciting about the discovery, and who was buried within the chariot?

A team of archaeologists led by Veselin Ignatov, of the Istoricheski muzej Nova Zagora, a museum in Bulgaria, discovered the 2,000-year-old wooden chariot in 2008. It was covered in bronze and would have been decorated with scenes from Thracian mythology that are now difficult to see. Its exact age is uncertain and may be closer to 1,800 years old.

In 2009, Ignatov and his team also found a brick tomb, containing the remains of a man dressed in what appears to be armor, near the chariot. The man was buried with several items, including gold coins, gold rings and a silver cup showing a depiction of the Greek god Eros (the Roman equivalent was Cupid). He would have been a nobleman or possibly even a ruler who lived in ancient Thrace, in what is now Bulgaria. [In Photos: Early Bronze Age Chariot Burial]

Chariot burials like this are commonly found in Bulgaria. The practice of noblemen being buried near chariots seems to have started in Bulgaria about 2,500 years ago, Ignatov wrote in a paper published in 2007 in the journal Archaeologia Bulgarica. He noted that the practice was especially popular during the time of the Roman Empire, which lasted from roughly 2,100 to 1,500 years ago.

Though the people of some other regions of the Roman Empire also sometimes buried their noblemen near chariots, this practice was ""by far most popular and long-standing in Thrace,"" Ignatov wrote in the journal article. ""In all cases, the chariots represent prestige, power and authority,"" Ignatov wrote, noting that the chariots were probably intended to be used by the deceased in the afterlife.

At the time of the burial, the horses that pulled the chariot likely would have been killed. Animal offerings such as pigs, dogs, sheep and deer would have been made to the gods, along with libations (such as wine), Ignatov wrote. Sometimes, the chariots themselves were dismantled or smashed apart before being buried, Ignatov wrote.

Because chariot burials are common in Bulgaria, and sometimes have rich burial goods, looters try to find them and sell the artifacts on the black market, Ignatov noted. This means that archaeologists in Bulgaria are often racing to discover and excavate chariot burials before looters find and pillage them.

Since the archaeologists excavated this chariot burial before looters got to it, the artifacts can be displayed publicly in a museum, and pictures showing the chariot burial are being shared publicly on Reddit and other forms of social media.

NFL owners and executives met with members of the NFL Players Association for their annual fall meeting, where the topic of the players protesting during “The Star Spangled Banner” was expected to come up. But a rule change over the matter never did, according to reporters in the room.

JACKSONVILLE JAGUARS APOLOGIZE TO MILITARY FOR KNEELING IN LONDON

The current NFL guidelines on the matter say the league believes the players should stand during the anthem with their hands over their hearts.

NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said the meeting was ""very productive and very important"" during a news conference Tuesday night and described the players as ""men of great character"" who felt strongly about the issues.

""They have a very deep understanding and tremendous knowledge of the issues that are going on in all of our communities,"" Goodell said. ""And their commitment to addressing these issues is really admirable and something that I think our owners looked at as saying, 'We want to help support you. Those are issues that affect us. They're our issues also. We'd like to do it together.'""

The issue of the protesting during the anthem originated last season when then-San Francisco 49er's Quarterback Colin Kaepernick first sat, then knelt during the national anthem, protesting police brutality against minorities.

A lawyer for Kaepernick, who is currently not signed with a team and recently filed a grievance against the league alleging owners colluded against him, said Monday that the former player was not invited to the NFL meeting despite players wanting him there. But the lawyer said Kaepernick ""is open to future participation on these important discussions.""

Players at the meeting, which focused on identifying the issues and figuring out how to better use the NFL's platform for good, said they had “good dialogue” with the owners and were happy with the results.

Malcolm Jenkins of the Philadelphia Eagles said the meeting went “really well” and the players were able to speak to the owners about issues of injustice and how the league can start to create change.

“As players we’ll continue to do the work in our communities. We feel that’s the most American thing to do is to use your platform and influence,” Jenkins told reporters. “And with the stage that we have as NFL players and as the league in general we feel a real responsibility to our country, to our communities. So we’re working through ways to really have long lasting, real change.”

He also said that change doesn’t happen quickly, or over the course of a two-hour meeting, but that the players and the league have “mutual interests” and they plan to continue talking about the issues their communities are facing.

“The issues that we’re fighting against … they’ve been here longer than us and we don’t expect them to change overnight but we’ll continue to work in collaboration and have conversations to see if we can make some change,” he said.

While the possibility of a new rule wasn’t discussed, Jenkins said they did talk about the state of the league, the anthem protests and how to “amplify players’ voices” on the issues.

But as far as future protests go, Jenkins said it’ll be up to each individual player to decide if they’ll take a knee during the national anthem.

Following the meeting, the NFL and NFLPA released a joint statement, highlighting their goals to ""utilize our platform to promote equality and effectuate positive change."" They also said that ""everyone who is part of our NFL community has a tremendous respect for our country, our flag, our anthem and our military.""","NFL, players leave door open on kneeling during national anthem",https://www.foxnews.com/sports/2017/10/17/nfl-players-leave-door-open-on-kneeling-during-national-anthem.html

The now 21-year-old Maroney, who won a gold medal in the team event and a silver in vault at the 2012 Summer Olympic Games in London, detailed on Twitter the alleged assault by Larry Nassar, who's currently in prison on child porn charges and is accused of sexually abusing other gymnasts.

Maroney, at the start of the note attached to her tweet, appeared to reference the mushrooming scandal involving Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein as the reason she came forward, with Maroney noting sexual misconduct “is not just happening in Hollywood.""

“I was molested by Dr. Larry Nassar, the team doctor for the US for the U.S. Women’s National Gymnastics Team, and Olympic Team,"" Maroney wrote. ""Dr. Nassar told me that I was receiving ‘medically necessary treatment that he had been performing on patients for over 30 years.’ It started when I was 13 years old, at one of my first National Team training camps, in Texas, and it didn’t end until I left the sport.”

In Feb. 2016, Maroney announced her retirement from the sport due to health issues following the Olympics.

LARRY NASSAR, FORMER USA GYMNASTICS DOCTOR, PLEADS GUILTY TO CHILD PORNOGRAPHY CHARGES

Maroney detailed one alleged instance, when she was 15 years old and traveling to Tokyo with Nassar and her team. She said she was given a sleeping pill by the doctor and woke up “alone with him in his hotel room getting a ‘treatment.’”

“I thought I was going to die that night,” Maroney said.

In July, Nassar, 53, pleaded guilty in Michigan to child pornography charges. Nassar, who was also a sports medicine specialist at Michigan State, is awaiting trial on charges in three separate cases alleging he sexually molested a total of nine girls, including eight who were gymnasts seeking treatment for injuries.

Nassar has since had his medical license revoked and was being sued by more than 100 women or girls who have made similar charges against him.

Nassar’s career collapsed last summer after the Indianapolis Star reported USA Gymnastics mishandled complaints about sexual misconduct involving the doctor and coaches. A number of women and younger girls came forward with allegations following the expose.

Following the allegations against Nassar, USA Gymnastics ordered a review last fall. The review found USA Gymnastics needed a “complete cultural change” to better protect athletes from sexual abuse.

It was not confirmed by the court if Maroney was one of the victims named in the federal lawsuit against Nassar, FOX17 reported.

USA GYMNASTICS NEEDS ‘CULTURE CHANGE’ TO STOP ABUSE, REVIEW FINDS

Maroney concluded her essay by writing something needed to be done to end sexual misconduct.

“Is it possible to put an end to this type of abuse? Is it possible for survivors to speak out, without putting careers, and dreams in jeopardy? I hope so,” she wrote. “Our silence has given the wrong people power for too long, and it’s time to take our power back. And remember, it’s never too late to speak up.""

Maroney’s revelation comes in the wake of a number of A-list actresses speaking out about the sexual misconduct they experienced in their careers following the fall of Weinstein. The movie mogul was accused of sexually harassing and assaulting women for decades following exposes by The New York Times and The New Yorker Magazine.

Migrating pelicans can once again stop by for a mouthful of fish in Israel.

The Agriculture Ministry says Wednesday it will keep funding a pet project to feed thousands of Great White Pelicans who fly annually over the country. The idea is to centralize their feeding ground at a central Israeli reservoir so the birds do not harm the livelihood of farmers by poaching fish from nearby breeding grounds.

The ministry had previously said it was going to stop the project, claiming it was not responsible for feeding migrating animals passing through from Europe to Africa. But under pressure from farmers and environmentalists, it reconsidered.

Scott Rosenberg took to social media to share a long account of what he remembers about working with Weinstein during the “glory days” of Miramax in the mid-‘90s.

“…I was there. And let me tell you one thing. Let’s be perfectly clear about one thing: Everybody-f--king-knew,” Rosenberg wrote.

The screenwriter, famous for his work on films like “Beautiful Girls,” said people in the industry heard about Weinstein’s behavior for years.

“Not that he was raping,” Rosenberg wrote. “No, that we never heard. But we were aware of a certain pattern of overly-aggressive behavior that was rather dreadful.”

Rosenberg charged that everyone from “big producers” and “big directors” to “rival studio chiefs” and actors, actresses and politicians knew about Weinstein’s alleged mistreatment of women.

He added, “I saw you. All of you. God help me, I was there with you.”

Rosenberg stated he is disgusted by the “the current flood of sanctimonious denial and condemnation” of Weinstein’s alleged actions because he believes many in the industry were aware of the mogul’s rumored behavior.

“…Maybe we didn’t know the degree. The magnitude of the awfulness. Not the rapes… But we knew something. We knew something was bubbling under. Something odious. Something rotten,” he wrote.

Rosenberg recalled the epic vacations he would take with Weinstein and the parties he attended ahead of big industry events like the Oscars and the Cannes Film Festival.

The “Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead” writer revealed that Weinstein recently reached out to him “to talk about the bygone days.”

Rosenberg recalled, “There was a wistfulness to him that I had never heard before. A melancholy. It most assuredly had a walking-to-the-gallows feel. When we hung up I wondered: ‘what was that all about?’ In a few short weeks I would know.”

He added that he is “eternally sorry” to anyone who may have suffered because of his silence.

“With all these victims speaking up… To tell their tales. Shouldn’t those who witnessed it from the sidelines do the same?”

For the leftist #Resist movement to be fully realized, freedom and liberty will have to go.
The #Resist movement is the antithesis of “resistance.” They aren’t the resistance, the rebellion or even anti-establishment.","Since President Trump’s election the progressives in the USA have decided that they are “the Resistance.” Everywhere we look on social media we see the #Resist banner. From the virtue-signaling Hollywood celebrity to every leftist, tenured university professor, they have proudly declared themselves members of “the Resistance” club. But what exactly is this resistance? What does it stand for?

These latte revolutionaries believe they are still fighting the 1960’s “revolution” for freedom and liberty, but over the last fifty years leftist/cultural Marxist groupthink has taken over and infiltrated literally every aspect of society. That revolution was, in many ways, already won years ago and yet, they continue to fight on because for the left it won’t be enough until every single one of us thinks exactly like them.

The reality is that the #Resist movement is not the counter culture that they think they are. They actually represent the status quo, and are supporters of the Establishment itself. They are happy to wrap themselves in the conceit that they are like some kind of Second World War resistance movement fighting evil fascists. The very word resistance implies an embattled underground group resisting an occupying, ruthless enemy.

But how can they be the underground when, in reality, they control so many levers of power in our society? Today’s #Resist movement must be the first resistance in history that actually runs most of the nation and makes up most of the political and cultural Establishment.

The #Resist movement is the antithesis of “resistance.” More fitting titles for the movement should be #conform, #surrender and #comply, don’t you think?

So, let’s look at this Establishment that makes up the “Resistance” and see how very powerful and organized they are.

First and foremost are academia and the education industry. These are the Indoctrinators: from nursery school teachers, to tenured university professors and most of the administrators. They see their jobs more as social justice activism rather than teaching. This is a “resistance” that has nearly all of academia on their side. These are the most dangerous, for they are shaping the minds of our children and our future generations.

Then, there are The Enforcers: such as all the progressive social media giants like Facebook, You Tube and Twitter who push a leftist agenda and try to stifle conservative ideas and speech.

Add to that the high tech conglomerates such as Apple, Google, and Microsoft, the left-leaning CEOs of many huge multinational corporations, billionaires like George Soros, Ted Turner and Richard Branson, and the thousands of NGO’s - all of whom spend millions promoting progressive causes.

Next is the propaganda wing of the “Resistance,” which just happens to be around 90 percent of the media entertainment complex, including most news channels, most newspapers, late night comedians, news anchors, ESPN and other sporting franchises and, of course, nearly all of Hollywood and most of its pundits, hangers-on and celebrities.

And last but not least, one of the wealthiest, most powerful political parties in the whole Western world: the Democratic Party and all their minions in the American civil service and the Deep State.

Does that sound like a struggling, oppressed and poorly financed resistance? Or, does it sound more like a vast, controlling, obscenely wealthy progressive network that uses every tactic at its disposal to oppose a democratic election result - from indoctrination and propaganda to the suppression of free speech and the violence practiced by Antifa, aka the well funded and armed wing of the “Resistance.”

Bizarrely then the #Resist movement are the very thing they say they are fighting against. They say they are fighting “fascism” but then they use fascistic methods to bully, demonize and silence all who disagree with them. From Hillary calling Trump voters “deplorables” to the nearly militarized thugs of Antifa calling anyone with a conservative or libertarian viewpoint “Nazis,” their aim is to dehumanize their opposition. This is hardly what a real resistance to so-called fascism would be doing.

Of course many of those who unthinkingly use the #Resist banner or wear pussy hats on marches or swoon to the rantings of Madonna are tragically ignorant of what they are actually supporting.

They honestly believe they are pro-Freedom but, in fact, they are supporting those politicians and Establishment figures who are behind The Deep State: the powerful, and utterly corrupted part of our government that see themselves as rulers and elites, and not as representatives of the people. The shadowy figures behind the #Resist movement are for globalism and big government.

A globalist government does not value borders, or countries, or value any sense of national sovereignty. This is why they are pro open borders. Why have laws for citizens when non-citizens can now vote in this new global egalitarianism? Why be a part of government in one country when ruling the world is a much more attractive prospect?

But why is globalism and global egalitarianism important to the left and the Resistance? On one #Resist site they quote the U.S. Constitution:

“All men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.”

They interpret this “equality” as pure egalitarianism. It’s a grossly incorrect interpretation, but it suits their goals. The Constitution accepts that everyone is born equal but it’s up to the individual whether they better themselves or not. Egalitarianism means equality of outcome and cannot freely exist without being forced on us through government mandates. And true egalitarianism also has to be global: One people, one government, no borders, no “inequality.”

For progressives this sounds great - it’s the path to the utopian future they so desire (with John Lennon’s “Imagine” piped through loud speakers ad nauseum). However, BIG government is required in order to enforce this global egalitarianism. Pure Socialism, Communism and/or Fascism will soon follow.

Military dictatorships tend to also be part of that package. How will a dictatorship come into play? Disarm the citizens and abolish the second amendment. Make sure only the elites, the government, the police, and the military are armed. This is one of their main goals: make sure the people are helpless to fight against a tyrannical, military dictatorship.

For the leftist #Resist movement to be fully realized, freedom and liberty will have to go. It sounds insane, but to those who believe in leftist groupthink, egalitarianism is more important and noble than liberty.

Thankfully, the USA from its inception has a Democratic Republic with three separate branches of government: Legislative, Executive and Judicial, of which our president is merely part of the Executive Branch.

This has not changed. The president does not have ultimate authoritarian power. There is no military dictatorship in force and he has not taken away the Second Amendment (although the Deep State is attempting to.)

President Trump has been trying to make sure that U.S. citizens are safer so they may live lives of liberty and continue their pursuit of happiness. He has been trying to lessen government involvement in people’s lives – again, for the sake of liberty – and not increase government, which becomes oppressive.

He is in support of freedom and liberty and the U.S. Constitution as it was intended – unlike the #Resist movement who want to grow government, have more regulation, more mandates – so as to force citizens to comply.

The #Resist movement is the antithesis of “resistance.” They aren’t the resistance, the rebellion or even anti-establishment. They are anti-freedom, pro-establishment and part of The Enforcers, right along with The Deep State. More fitting titles for the movement should be #conform, #surrender and #comply, don’t you think?

I hope the American people can see the #Resist movement for what it actually is and treat its agenda with the derision it deserves, so we can survive this threat to the freedom and liberty of our USA.",‘Eyes Wide Shut’ actress and Hollywood conservative: Why the #Resist movement has it completely wrong,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/18/eyes-wide-shut-actress-and-hollywood-conservative-why-resist-movement-has-it-completely-wrong.html

“I believe that Fusion GPS’s business is to do basically whatever the paymasters tell them to do,” Alek Boyd, the Venezuelan journalist, told Fox News in his first American TV interview. “They are particularly good at spreading misinformation, disinformation and smears.”

Boyd says he was targeted after his 2012 reporting on Derwick Associates, a power company with close ties to the Venezuelan government. The company allegedly skimmed nearly a billion dollars from rigged contracts with the late Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez.

“It is my understanding that [Fusion GPS] were hired basically to smear Derwick opponents and to dispel any possible doubts that regular media may have had at the time,” he said.

British police records show Boyd reported a break-in, with two laptops stolen from his London apartment in November 2014. Asked by Fox News what was on the computers, Boyd said, “A lot of information and a lot of evidence about corruption and scandals in Venezuela that I’ve been compiling throughout the years.”

After the break-in, Boyd said his sources were attacked. “People that were believed to be collaborating and sending me information from Venezuela were assaulted in Venezuela by the intelligence police of Mr. Chavez,” he said.

Asked if Fusion GPS was tasked with coming after him, Boyd said, “I believe that they were involved in the defamation campaign — smearing campaign — shortly after my apartment was broken into.”

Boyd says he was labeled a pedophile, drug addict and thief on the web. “They published this information through a number of social media and websites anonymously. They created fake Twitter accounts with my name, impersonating myself. ... They started publishing photos of me walking around London with my daughters. They produced a huge amount of information — fake information — about me, accusing me from being a pedophile to being an extortionist to a drug trafficker to a car thief.”

Boyd says he believes three suspects, seen in security camera video released by British police, left pictures of his children inside his coat pocket as a warning. “The message, I believe at the time — we know where you are and we know where your children are, so take that as a threatening message.”

And there was more.

“After about a week,” Boyd explained, “two sets of envelopes were sent to me from Tbilisi, Georgia, containing the same exact same pictures — printout of pictures — that were left in my jacket, but this time the printouts had handwritten messages saying, ‘You touch the wrong girl you pedophile, you think we can’t touch yours?’”

Fusion GPS is led by Glenn Simpson and Peter Fritsch, who left the Wall Street Journal about a decade ago. Boyd provided Fox News with a travel document that Boyd said indicates Fritsch traveled to Venezuela, as part of what he described as an effort to shut down any investigative reporting into Derwick's actions. Asked if Fusion GPS plays on its credentials as former journalists, Boyd said yes.

FUSION BOSS REFUSED TO ANSWER BASIC QUESTIONS ON ANTI-TRUMP DOSSIER, SOURCE SAYS

“I believe that they are basically cashing in on the years of experience they have accumulated collectively in different newspapers, in different media around the world,” he said.

Boyd’s allegations mirror sworn congressional testimony from Bill Browder, an American businessman who told senators this summer that Fusion GPS used smear tactics to discredit him and his late attorney Sergei Magnitsky who, he says, was tortured and murdered eight years ago in a Russian jail. The so-called Magnitsky Act issued tough economic sanctions against Russia which are still in place today.

In the Magnitsky case, Browder filed a complaint with the Justice Department in July 2016 because he says Fusion worked on behalf of a foreign government and its interests. The Justice Department would not comment on the complaint status.

In a congressional declaration, human rights activist Thor Halvorssen also said Fusion GPS had “smear experts” and used “scorched earth methods.”

To date, Simpson has refused to reveal his sources and who paid for the Trump dossier, with Fusion attorney Joshua Levy threatening in an Oct. 16 letter that Simpson and others will take the Fifth if they are required to appear before the House Intelligence Committee.

Defending the company’s work on the Trump dossier, Levy wrote: “Of acute importance, these subpoenas, if indeed directed to our clients, violate the First Amendment rights of our clients and their clients, and would chill any American running for office — regardless of party affiliation, political viewpoint or candidate preference — from conducting confidential opposition research in an election. No individual should be expected to respond to such an abuse of power.”

Boyd was dismissive of Fusion’s First Amendment arguments. “I do not believe that certain privileges that apply to journalists and lawyers should apply to Mr. Simpson because he is neither — he’s a spin doctor.”

Simpson once railed against the kinds of aggressive opposition research tactics that are allegedly the lifeblood of his current company.

Ironically, in a 1996 book that Simpson co-authored with Larry Sabato entitled, “Dirty Little Secrets: The Persistence of Corruption in American Politics,” the authors wrote, “At its worst, opposition research can be a gateway to acts that are not just offensive but duplicitous and sometimes illegal.”

Levy did not respond to multiple requests for comment from Fox News over a two-day period about its work in Venezuela and Boyd’s allegations.

The Metropolitan Police in London confirmed an investigation into Boyd’s apartment break-in, but the case was closed when the leads went cold.

After Fox News emailed Alejandro Betancourt, CEO at Derwick Associates of Venezuela, Florida-based attorney Joseph DeMaria responded but did not address Fox News’ questions about the company’s relationship with Fusion GPS and the Boyd allegations:

“I have represented Derwick and Messrs. Betancourt and Trebbau for the past five years in Florida litigation. Mr. Halvorssen filed a defamation and tortious interference lawsuit against Derwick and Messrs. Trebbau and Betancourt, which I defended successfully. The case was dismissed by the trial court and just last week, the Florida Court of Appeal affirmed the dismissal. Thus, after defeating Mr. Halvorssen’s claims, you can understand why Derwick and its principals have no desire to have any further involvement with Mr. Halvorssen. They did their speaking against Mr. Halvorssen in Court and have no further comment to make regarding Mr. Halvorssen or his allegations.”

Snuggling in bed under a layer of cozy covers makes for a deliciously warm feeling, especially in the face of unrelenting winter chill. If you’re in the market for a new blanket or quilt, be sure to read this guide for advice on how to choose the best bedding for your needs.

Blankets

Shopping for a blanket can feel fairly straightforward. And maybe it is. But with a little information, you’ll be more likely to bring home a product that you’ll cherish and love using.

Start with size. Typically, you’re looking for a blanket that will cover the top and sides of the mattress with a few extra inches to tuck securely underneath. Be sure to measure your mattress before you shop.

Compare fabrics. You can choose from a wide range of materials, and narrowing them down should depend on your preferences. You may suffer from allergies or prefer a smoother texture over a fuzzier one, for example.

○ Blankets made of wool are warm and provide excellent insulation on cold winter nights. Being a natural fiber, wool is breathable. Another useful quality is its ability to wick sweat and moisture away from the body, promoting a dry and warm experience. Woolen blankets are naturally fire-resistant, which makes them relatively safe to use around heat sources.

○ Usually composed of a polyester blend, synthetic fleece blankets are popular because they feel plush, velvety soft and warm. They also can wick moisture from your body, keeping you warm, dry and snug through a cold night. Synthetic fleece blankets are lighter than their woolen counterparts. It pays to ask for ones that don’t pill (produce tiny balls of fibers from abrasion). On the downside, synthetic fleece can conduct static electricity and can attract hair and dust.

○ Ideal for warm weather, a 100 percent cotton blanket is also great during spring and autumn or with air conditioning in the room. Since cotton is a natural fiber, it’s breathable. It’s also hypoallergenic and soft, making it a smart choice for babies, allergy sufferers or those with sensitive skin. When buying a cotton blanket, consider yarn size, fiber quality, thread count and construction. Typically, a good cotton blanket will have a higher thread count.

○ Blankets made of acrylic are a great alternative to their woolen or cashmere counterparts since they’re light, hypoallergenic and warm. What’s more, they are machine-washable and retain their colors.

Do a quality check. “You can really feel a good-quality textile in your hands,” says Kate Pascoe Squires, director of Australian textile company Kate & Kate. “If it feels beautiful, it usually will be. If it’s flimsy, thin or shiny, you know it’s not going to last. Be prepared for balling and pills after the first wash. Good-quality natural fibers will wash beautifully and offer you a gorgeous product for years to come.”

Compare prices. You can pick up a twin blanket for under $20, but it won’t last very long, Pascoe Squires says. “You can also purchase stunning midrange blankets that are great quality but won’t break the bank. In terms of price, you should look at between [$60 and $120] for these items. Then there are super-premium blankets, which can run up to thousands of dollars. The price reflects the beautiful materials used to knit these items, usually stunning wools, creating real heirloom pieces.”

Electric Blankets

If you’d rather invest in an electric blanket, here’s what you need to know:

○ Electric blankets use an integrated heating device to spread warmth through your bed.

○ Electric blankets for children are normally available and labeled as waterproof electric blankets.

○ Thanks to the overheat protection feature, your blanket should sense any abnormal temperature changes and switch off if it gets too hot. However, you should never leave your blanket on all night.

○ Fitted blankets remain flat and taut through the night and feel the same as the mattress underneath it. Unfitted blankets won’t fit around the corners or provide the same level of comfort as fitted ones.

○ Before making a purchase, lie on the blanket to feel its thickness, and check that the wiring is undamaged.

○ Some blankets are available with dual controls, so each partner can control the temperature on one side of the bed.

○ If your blanket has removable controls, you can safely wash it as well.

○ If your feet feel cold easily, look for a blanket with warm foot zones, which focus more heat at the bottom of the blanket.

Quilts



Quilts offer luxurious comfort and add visual warmth to your bedroom. A quilt usually consists of three layers: a fabric backing, a layer of soft batting and a fabric top. Quilting is essentially the art of stitching or tying these layers together, often in sync with the pattern of the top.

Consider the user and the climate. Typically, adults prefer heavier quilts, whereas children are comfortable with lightweight ones. When you’re buying a quilt for your child, remember that you’ll be dealing with spills and other messes.

It pays to factor in climate. Are you looking for a quilt for very cold nights or just cool weather? Do you need something that is season-specific or something that works for all kinds of weather?

Know the types of filling. Quilts filled with natural materials such as cotton, wool, feathers and down are more breathable, softer, lighter and more comfortable. They also will last longer than synthetic or microfiber fillings. Cotton makes an excellent choice for lightweight quilts.

Although down and feather fillings provide the most warmth, they are more expensive and may not be ideal for those with allergies. In these instances, options like microfiber work well since they imitate the look and feel of down without attracting dust. Cotton and wool are naturally hypoallergenic options.

RELATED: Duvet vs. Coverlet - What’s the Difference?

If you’re tired of alternating between a lightweight quilt for summer and a heavier one for winter, consider an all-season quilt.

Care for your quilt. Air your quilt every couple of weeks to keep it in great shape and enhance its longevity. Certain quilts, such as down, are best dry-cleaned, while some can be machine-washed as well. A duvet cover can protect your quilt and add to your room’s decor. Remember to read the manufacturer’s care guide that comes with your purchase.",How to choose the best bedding for cold winter nights,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/13/how-to-choose-best-bedding-for-cold-winter-nights.html

7:55 a.m.

A sixth firefighter has sustained minor injuries battling a blaze in California's Santa Cruz mountains south of the wildfires that have been burning for more than a week in wine country.

California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection spokeswoman Angela Bernheisel said Wednesday the firefighter is being treated for second-degree burns to his hands.

Crews have been fighting the wildfire, which sparked Monday night, sending smoke into the coastal beach town of Santa Cruz.

The wildfire has grown from 125 to 270 acres and four structures have been destroyed. About 150 homes are threatened and residents have been evacuated.

The rough mountain landscape has proved a challenge and contributed to firefighter injuries.

A firefighter fell down a steep ravine and fractured his wrist while three others slipped but were otherwise unharmed. An inmate firefighter was treated for smoke inhalation.

The death toll from Northern California's destructive wildfires is at 42 after Sonoma County found the remains of another person.

Misti Harris, a spokeswoman for Sonoma County, says the department is working on identifying the person. Sonoma County now has 23 dead.

About 60 people remain unaccounted for in Sonoma and Napa counties as of Tuesday. Authorities say they are conducting targeted searches for victims and the work is slow-going.

The wind-whipped fires that started Oct. 8 swept through parts of seven counties, becoming the deadliest and most destructive series of blazes in California history.

6:30 a.m.

Authorities say fire crews made overnight progress battling blazes in Northern California's wine country, helped by moderate weather and lack of wind.

Daniel Berlant, spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, says crews did controlled burns to wipe out fuel needed by wildfires to spread.

Tens of thousands of evacuees are returning to their homes, although more than 30,000 were evacuated as of Tuesday morning. That number is down considerably from Saturday when an estimated 100,000 people had been forced out of their homes.

The wind-whipped fires that started Oct. 8 swept through parts of seven counties, becoming the deadliest and most destructive series of blazes in California history. At least 41 people were killed and 6,000 homes destroyed.

3:00 a.m.

The many thousands who lost their houses, condos and apartments in wildfires burning in Northern California will have to find a new place to live in one of the toughest housing markets in the nation.

California also has a statewide housing shortage that the governor and legislature have been trying to address. That shortage got even greater with the 6,000 homes and businesses lost in the fires.

Federal emergency administrator Brock Long said Tuesday that the blazes are ""a tremendous event for an urban area to have to handle,"" and recovery will be difficult.

The acronym used to make fun of anti-development attitudes used to be NIMBY -- Not In My Back Yard.","Did you happen to catch CNN's latest smear?

Anderson Cooper's show recently featured a ""two-part exclusive"" that claims Donald Trump's EPA director had conspired with the CEO of a mining company to ""withdraw environmental restrictions"" so the company could dig ""the largest open pit mine in the world in an extremely sensitive watershed in wild Alaska.""

The report was enough to horrify any caring person. CNN showed beautiful pictures of colorful salmon swimming in Bristol Bay, and the reporter intoned dramatically, ""EPA staffers were shocked to receive this email obtained exclusively by CNN which says 'we have been directed by the administrator to withdraw restrictions' ... (P)rotection of that pristine area was being removed.""

No! A ""pristine"" area and gorgeous salmon were about to be obliterated by a mine!

I would have believed it, except I happened to report on that mine a couple years ago.

The acronym used to make fun of anti-development attitudes used to be NIMBY -- Not In My Back Yard. Now it's BANANA: Build Absolutely Nothing Anywhere Near Anybody.

I knew that the real scandal was not EPA director Scott Pruitt's decision to ""withdraw the restrictions,"" it was what President Obama's EPA did to the company's mining proposal in the first place.

Zealots at the EPA had conspired with rich environmental activists to kill the mine before its environmental impact statement could even be submitted. This was unprecedented.

The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform later concluded: ""EPA employees had inappropriate contact with outside groups and failed to conduct an impartial, fact-based review.""

Now, appropriately, Pruitt undid that censorship of science.

But CNN, implying devious secrecy said, ""according to multiple sources, he made that decision without a briefing from any of EPA's scientists.""

Shocking!

But Pruitt didn't require opinions from scientists. He didn't approve the mine. He didn't make a science decision. He simply followed the law and allowed a company to submit a proposal.

Also, despite CNN's repeated depictions of salmon on Bristol Bay, it turns out that the proposed mine would not even be on the Bay. It would not even be 10 miles away, or 20 miles away, or even 50 miles. The proposed mine would be about 100 miles away.

Did CNN mention that? No. Never. We asked CNN why. And why not point out that the mining company is just being allowed to start the EPA's long and arduous environmental review? They didn't get back to us.

Of course, explaining that wouldn't fit CNN's theme: Evil Trump appointee ravages environment.

Their reporter did at least speak with the mine's CEO, Tom Collier, who tried to explain.

""It's not a science -- it's a process decision.""

But the reporter, Drew Griffin, wouldn't budge. He called Collier ""a guy who wants to mine gold in an area that many scientists believe will destroy one of the most pristine sockeye salmon sporting grounds in the whole world.""

By the way, Collier isn't an evil Republican-businessman-nature-destroyer. He's a Democrat who once ran environment policy for President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore. CNN never mentioned that either.

Instead the reporter implied evil collusion: ""This looks like the head of a gold mine went to a new administrator and got him to reverse what an entire department had worked on for years.""

Here at least the report was accurate. Obama's environmental department did try to kill that mine for years. They colluded with groups like the Natural Resources Defense Council, one of America's wealthiest environment groups.

The NRDC is mostly made up of anti-progress lawyers who want no mines built anywhere. Don't believe me? I asked NRDC spokesman Bob Deans:

STOSSEL: There are some mines where NRDC says, great, go ahead?

DEANS: It's not up to us.

STOSSEL: Are there any?

DEANS: It's not up to us to green light mines...

STOSSEL: Are there any you don't complain about?

DEANS: Yeah, sure.

So I asked him for some names. He and the NRDC still haven't provided any.

If these zealots and their sycophants in the media get their way, America will become a place with no mining, no pipelines, no oil drilling, no new ... anything.

Feminists didn’t go on TV to say that Trump was part of a wider culture that abuses women in this way.

Saying “not all men” is not only accurate but also a good way to keep the focus on the men who do hurt women.","In the wake of the avalanche of information about Harvey Weinstein, and other perverted predators in Hollywood, the reaction from some quarters has been angry resignation that well, all powerful men behave this way. Not the rape part necessarily, and sure, not every man defiles nearby plants as Weinstein is accused of doing, but certainly all men are capable of sexual harassment and the ones with any power are likely to act on it. In short, as people in the Twitterverse routinely put it, “men are trash.”

The phrase “not all men” has become an Internet meme that feminists use to mock men who defend themselves against these kinds of mass accusations. Plainly, “not all men” are rapists or sexual harassers or predators like Weinstein--but when men try to say so they get shut down with an “oh yeah, not all men” eyeroll.

After Weinstein, though, the line the left is pushing is “yes, all men.” Shaun Lau, host of the “No, Totally!” podcast tweeted that and added “To masculine domination, non-consensuality is a feature, not a bug. Power requires neither permission nor forgiveness.” Writer Paraic O'Donnell tweeted “Yes, all men. In some degree, in some capacity, at some remove. Yes. Now, shut the f*** up, and try to make the world just, safe and kind.”

These are both men who believe that “all” men behave this way, presumably including themselves.

Here’s an easy way to tell that this “yes, all men” is deflection: When the Donald Trump “Access Hollywood” tape was released last year, few argued that “all men” do this. Feminists didn’t go on TV to say that Trump was part of a wider culture that abuses women in this way.

What’s strange about this reaction is that there is plenty of specific blame to go around. From Weinstein himself, to his board, to actors like Ben Affleck who allegedly knew it was happening but took no action. But why then extend this blame by saying this is something that all men, or even just all powerful men, do?

For instance, USA Today ran a column headlined “Changing a culture of sexual violence starts with men,” while Variety magazine went with “Men must step up to change the Hollywood culture that enabled Harvey Weinstein.” But if all men behave like this, why would any step up to make the needed changes? “You’re a potential rapist, prove us wrong” seems like a strange tack for women to take if they’re looking for men to be their allies.

Then there’s the viral video of actress Emma Thompson, talking about the Weinstein case. She shrugs that the news didn’t surprise her at all, that what happened is “endemic to the system” and that it’s actually a “crisis in masculinity.” The Guardian also ran a column on how “the fall of Harvey Weinstein should be a moment to challenge extreme masculinity.” This eagerness to spread blame beyond the perpetrator, to all men, to all of society, lets these awful men off the hook. It’s not them, it’s the culture of “extreme masculinity!”

That’s the real problem with casting this wide net to include all men in this atrocious behavior. It ends up giving a pass to the predators. After all, the first excuse Weinstein trotted out when the story broke was “I came of age in the ‘60’-s and ‘70’-s, when all the rules about behavior and workplaces were different. He was trying to plead that it’s bigger than him, almost not really his fault. But why would women, or their alleged allies, parrot that line?

Here’s an easy way to tell that this “yes, all men” is deflection: When the Donald Trump “Access Hollywood” tape was released last year, few argued that “all men” do this. Feminists didn’t go on TV to say that Trump was part of a wider culture that abuses women in this way. No, they accurately said that this behavior is not something all men do. Trump called it “locker room talk” – as if all men talk like that-- but plenty of men and women were quick to correct him that there was nothing normal about his words.

We can’t hold all men accountable for something that only some men do. Even the pressure to speak up when they see harassment shouldn’t be just on them. This cone of silence extends beyond men. Jane Fonda, for one, admitted that she had known about Weinstein, but never said anything. Fonda, co-founder of the “the Women's Media Center” said she feels ashamed that she didn’t say anything. She should. And so should every man and woman whose silence enabled him.

Over the weekend the heart-breaking trending topic #metoo showed just how many women have been sexually harassed and assaulted. The seriousness of this problem is exactly why we shouldn’t blanket accuse all men. Saying “not all men” is not only accurate but also a good way to keep the focus on the men who do hurt women. Maligning half the population as exploiters of women mixes in the bad guys with the good ones--and it’s the Weinsteins of the world who benefit.","No, 'not all men' are like Harvey Weinstein – but apparently the left wants you to think so",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/17/no-not-all-men-are-like-harvey-weinstein-but-apparently-left-wants-to-think-so.html

Alana Chasky, 35, who worked at the private Riverdale Country Day School in Palm Bay, was charged with lewd and lascivious battery and distributing obscene material to a minor.

""She was a student's aide and she met this particular victim on the bus,"" Palm Bay Police Lt. Mike Bandis told FOX35 Orlando. ""She rode the bus back and forth...and that's where they met.""

Detectives began investigating Chasky last month after the male student’s mother found sexual text messages and images on his cellphone sent back and forth with the teacher, police said. The boy’s mother, however, said she suspected an inappropriate relationship as early as May.

The victim’s mother said her son was spending time with Chasky outside of school since February because Chasky was supposed to be helping him with his behavior problems.

But in May, the boy's mother said she told Chasky to stay away from her son because she thought the relationship was inappropriate. Despite this warning, Chasky continued to pick up the boy and drop him off, police said.

At some point, the relationship between Chasky and the teenager turned sexual, officials said.

The teenager violated a home detention order in place by walking in front of Chasky’s residence in July, authorities said, and, at the time, he told police he had exposed himself to Chasky and the two had cuddled.

Chasky denied being involved with the boy and there was not enough evidence to corroborate a relationship, police said. Chasky was again warned to cease contact with the boy.

Last month, the teenager was arrested in connection with a burglary at Chasky’s home. It was during the ensuing investigation the boy’s mother showed police the text messages.

The boy eventually admitted to police that he and Chasky began a relationship in February and has sex multiple times at her Palm Bay home, authorities said. The teen said the relationship ended at the beginning of September.

Chasky resigned from her position as a teacher in June, Riverdale Country School CEO Michele Maust told News 6.

""We are cooperating with the authorities in their investigation of this alleged event and will continue to do so until its completion,” Maust said. “She voluntarily resigned during the summer. Riverdale Country School remains committed to its mission of meeting the individual educational, therapeutic and behavioral needs of the children and adolescents it serves.”

What Tyerell Przybycien is charged with doing instead: helping her set up and carry out her suicide, the Daily Herald reports. On Tuesday, a 4th District Court judge ruled there was ""reasonable belief"" that enough evidence exists to send the Spanish Fork man to trial for Jchandra's death, charging him with first-degree murder and failure to report a dead body, both felonies.

If convicted, he could face 15 years to life in prison. In court documents cited in the Washington Post, prosecutors say when Jchandra told Przybycien of her plans, the 18-year-old texted another friend to ask what he should do, and the friend told him he should persuade her otherwise.

Przybycien, however, reportedly had the reverse reaction. ""It be awesome,"" he texted back, noting he wanted to help her carry out her plan. ""Like getting away with murder."" Those records also detail Przybycien's alleged role, including mapping out Jchandra's suicide, picking her up from work May 5, and buying rope and compressed air.

He's then accused of taking Jchandra to the Maple Lake Campground in Payson, setting up a noose for her, and filming her as she inhaled the compressed air, passed out, and fell off a wooden pedestal, hanging herself in the process.

The Salt Lake Tribune has reported he also provided running commentary through the video found on her cellphone, including noting at one point: ""That's when the brain stops getting oxygen."" Przybycien's lawyer argues his client didn't actually carry out the actions that killed her, but Judge James Brady says Przybycien's help was a ""substantial factor"" in her death.

Przybycien's arraignment is set for Oct. 24. (Radio host Delilah revealed the contents of her son's ""goodbye note."")

Erin McInrue Savage, a curler with the San Francisco Bay Area Curling Club, said she was trying to board her American Airline flight at Phoenix’s Sky Harbor International Airport, but couldn’t because of her curling materials.

McInrue Savage said she went to check her equipment bag for the standard excess sports equipment bag fee of $25 when the agent stopped her.

“[The agent] said curling isn’t a sport,” McInrue Savage, 34, said Saturday the Washington Post reported, a day after documenting her exchange in a Facebook post that went viral. “I told her it’s in the Olympics.”

'SEVERE TURBULENCE' ON AMERICAN AIRLINES FLIGHT LEAVES 10 INJURED

“[The agent] said it wasn’t an ‘elite’ sport like golf,” McInrue Savage said before unpacking her bag to show the clerk how the curling broom worked.

The airline agent allegedly tried to force McInrue Savage to pay an oversize sports equipment fee of $150. McInrue Savage, who traveled to Arizona from Oakland, CA, on a different airline, said she has paid the $25 fee for her bag in the past – as have her curling teammates. But the agent told McInrue Savage that her bag exceeded the standard sports equipment luggage size of 62 inches long.

Though curling brooms themselves are only around 48 inches long, McInrue Savage was carrying some other equipment which pushed the bag out.

During the eight-minute exchange with the agent, McInrue Savage says she removed the longer equipment and was able to get her bag under the 62 inches by duct taping the ends of her sports bag, but still had to convince the agent, who eventually relented to the $25 sports baggage fee.

According to McInrue Savage, the agent told her at the end of their interaction, “I hope you never fly American Airlines again.”

American airlines is strongly denying the details McInrue Savage recounts in her viral Facebook post – which was taken down for violating Facebook’s anti-bullying policy because it identified the agent’s name badge.

“We all agree that curling is a sport, and our colleague in Phoenix never stated that curling was ‘not a sport,’ ” American Airlines spokesman Ross Feinstein said in a statement on Tuesday, Washington Post reported. “Our colleague is a former gymnast and coach, and has great respect for all athletes.”

“Based on the information provided in the Facebook post by the passenger, and the statement from our team member: we applied the correct policy regarding sports items,” Feinstein continued. “The passenger presented herself with a bag that was over the standard bag size of 62 linear inches but containing sports equipment, her curling broom. Our agent explained to the passenger the policy on oversize bags and that she would be willing to assist the passenger by applying the sports equipment rate of $150 vs. the normal oversize charge of $200.”

American said that the agent actually “worked directly with Ms. McInrue Savage at the ticket counter to rearrange the items in the bag, in order to shorten the bag.”

Feinstein said the agent also denies telling McInsue Savage never to fly American again.

McInrue Savage has since stuck to her story, claiming that her Facebook message, which has been reposted with the name badge blurred out, is how the experience happened.

“Maybe [the American Airlines agent] was just having a bad day,” she said. “I understand [customer service] can be frustrating, but this didn’t feel like any sort of way you want to be treated.”

The anti-bullying campaign, which the burger chain describes as “eye-opening” in a press release, “brings the issue even closer to home with an experience that took place in a Burger King restaurant.”

The campaign, known as “Bullying Junior,” begins with some upsetting personal shares from students, each of whom relays a time they were bullied. After every high schooler tells his or her story to the camera, an unsettling statistic flashes across the screen: “30 percent of student worldwide are bullied each year.”

BURGER KING OFFERS FREE WHOPPERS TO PEOPLE JUST FIRED FROM THEIR JOBS

Following the kids' earnest confessions, the ad cuts to the inside of Burger King where an experiment of sorts is taking place: A bunch of bullies (who are paid actors) are bullying a high-school junior (also an actor) inside the Burger King. First they tease and push him, then they pour a drink on his food.

The bullied teen begs for them to stop while most of the customers in the store (not actors) can be seen ignoring what’s happening to the boy.

Then, the ad cuts to the inside of the Burger King's kitchen, where a staffer (also an actor) is seen ""bullying"" a Whopper Jr. by punching and smashing it. This burger, and several just like it, are then served to unsuspecting Burger King customers.

Once the customers receive their food, the video reports that “95 percent of the real-life customers reported the bullied Whopper Jr."" to the staff. However, that statistic is jarringly juxtaposed with the next on-screen message, which states that just “12 percent"" of the customers stood up to the bullies on behalf of the young actor who was being mistreated.

The ""shocking and not so shocking” outcome is that people are more interested in the meal — the one they paid for, and expected not to be trashed — than they were in the high schooler who was being bullied right in front of them, the press release says.

“We know that bullying takes on many forms, physical, verbal, relational and online. But the first step to putting an end to bullying is to take a stand against it,” said CEO and Founder of NO BULLY®, Nicholas Carlisle. “Our partnership with the BURGER KING® brand is an example of how brands can bring positive awareness to important issues. You have to start somewhere and they chose to start within.”

Burger King has also tackled the issue of bullying in the past, albeit from the other side.

Back in 2015, the chain ran a campaign in France encouraging customers to ""make fun of people who don't have a Burger King close to home."" Called ""Whopper Provocation,"" the campaign asked patrons to submit photos of themselves enjoying Burger King, which would be used in advertising materials in cities where there is no Burger King.

The 2015 ad also concluded with a voiceover asking, ""It's always fun to make fun of others, right?""",Burger King goes after bullying in strange new ad,https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/2017/10/18/burger-king-goes-after-bullying-in-strange-new-ad.html

The Turnpike Commission will use roadside sensors and other technology to produce traffic and weather alerts that could serve self-driving vehicles, the Plain Dealer reported . For now, the data about factors such as foggy conditions and snowplow angles could serve newer vehicles equipped to receive digital short-range radio signals and display the results for drivers.

The commission approved a $1.46 million contract with Logicalis for Cisco Systems equipment and software. Under the program, $65,000 from the contract will be set aside for the subcontractor GoldTech of Ohio.

The turnpike project is a part of the new DriveOhio initiative. The campaign calls for the state Department of Transportation and the state Department of Public Safety to promote vehicle communication technology. DriveOhio is also expected to attract tech industry leaders for experiments.

""The Ohio Turnpike is embracing its role on the forefront of transportation technology,"" Ohio Turnpike Executive Director Randy Cole said. ""We expect immediate safety and efficiency benefits,"" Cole added.

Crews are currently working on related tech work along the Turnpike. Fiber optic cables that are already in place will be linked to sensors.

The kitchen has more places for cooties than anywhere else in your home – even more than your bathroom, on average. We are going to look at those spots where bacteria love to hide and give you some tips and tools to keep them clean and sanitary.

1. Sinks. You might be surprised to learn that there are more germs in your kitchen sink than are in your toilet. From raw meat juices, dirty dishes and leftover food particles, the kitchen sink is a hotbed for bacteria. Therefore, any day that you use your sink for preparing food or soaking dishes, pots and pans, it should be washed down with hot soapy water and a sponge.

2. Sponges. Speaking of sponges, there have been many discussions online about the germs found in sponges and what will work to clean them. Recently, The New York Times ran an article that quoted a study from Germany claiming that cleaning a sponge only makes the bacteria on them worse. But after further research, the author wrote another article that said cleaning your sponge is still important to do. So the debate seems to remain up in the air.

However, if you still want to clean your sponge, you can either put it in the microwave on high for a minute or try a new tool called a SpongeBath that uses citric acid to keep the sponge clean and disinfected.

3. Hand towels. Hand towels are magnets for nasty germs. More often than not, we mindlessly wipe our hands on our towels, without thinking what we’re leaving behind. Raw meat juices, raw eggs from batter or even rotting food can often be found on a kitchen towel.

The trick is to change them at least once a week — more often if the towels get a lot of use — and wash dirty ones in hot water. You can also add a teaspoon of bleach to the wash to kill bacteria.

4. Knobs and handles. Every kitchen has more than a few door knobs and handles. Between everyday germs that are on your hands and the food germs you find in the kitchen, those cabinet knobs and handles can be full of bacteria.

You can use a simple solution of distilled white vinegar and some rubbing alcohol in a spray bottle and wipe with a microfiber cloth. The vinegar alone kills 98% of the bacteria, and the alcohol should kill the rest.

5. Salt and pepper shakers. Bet you never thought of your salt or pepper shakers as a place where germs are being transferred, but when was the last time you wiped them down with something other than a wet cloth (if that). These items are being handled by everyone in your family, and therefore germs are being spread to everyone.

6. Refrigerator handles. The handles of your refrigerator are touched countless times a day. Add in the fact that you are opening the fridge with hands that are preparing a meal and you can imagine all the germs and bacteria that are on those handles.

Get into the habit of wiping them down daily if possible. Use the same white vinegar and rubbing alcohol solution previously mentioned.

7. Cutting boards. Wooden cutting boards have proved to be full of more bacteria than a toilet seat. If used for cutting raw meat, they can also contain salmonella, which can lead to cross contamination.

To clean a cutting board, submerge it in hot soapy water after each use. You can also disinfect it with a mix of distilled white vinegar, lemon juice and salt. Consider plastic cutting boards that can go in the dishwasher.

8. Remote controls. TV remotes in any room of the house are apt to hold a variety of germs. But the remote in the kitchen is the worst of all. Food bacteria from meal prepping might be all over it.

Consider keeping the remote inside a ziplock bag and operating it through the bag. That way the germs are on the bag and not in all the cracks and crevices of the remote. Change the bag often.",8 overlooked germy places in your kitchen to clean now,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/04/8-overlooked-germy-places-in-your-kitchen-to-clean-now.html

The detailed images show the doomed liner leaving Southampton Harbor in the U.K. on April 10, 1912 with tugs and other vessels clearly in view. The photos, which measure 4 inches x 5 inches, are both captioned by hand.

“These photographs represent previously unknown and unique images of Titanic as she left Southampton,” Henry Aldridge & Son auctioneer Andrew Aldridge told Fox News, via email. “They are close and clear enough to count the portholes and to see the shadow cast by the stern in the water.”

DID THIS ICEBERG SINK THE TITANIC?

Titanic hit an iceberg at 11:40 p.m. ship's time on April 14, 1912 and sank just over two hours later with the loss of more than 1,500 lives.

Aldridge explained that the photos were sent from Southampton to Francis Le Boulanger, a wealthy ship owner, ship broker and coal exporter, who lived in South Wales. “It is quite possible he may have been involved in the provision of coal to the ship,” Aldridge said. “Since the recipient of the photos was important in the ship industry, the photos may have been taken by one of his associates.”

The lot also includes the original mailing envelope postmarked from Southampton on April 26 1912, personal papers of the Le Boulanger family, as well as a photo of Mr Le Boulanger. Another photo shows Le Boulanger’s wife in a group of three well-dressed women.

An extremely rare sea-stained letter recovered from the body of a Titanic victim will also be auctioned by Henry Aldridge & Son on Saturday. The letter was written on embossed Titanic stationery by First Class passenger Alexander Oskar Holverson to his mother on April 13, 1912.

TRAGIC TITANIC LETTER SURFACES: VICTIM’S SEA-STAINED NOTE UP FOR AUCTION

Holverson was among the victims of the disaster. The letter, which he clearly planned to mail on the Titanic’s arrival in New York, was apparently found in a pocket book when Holverson’s body was recovered from the Atlantic. It was eventually returned to his family with his other effects.

The lot has a pre-sale estimate of $79,031 to $105,375.

A number of artifacts from the doomed ship were auctioned in the U.K. last year, with the sextant used by the captain of rescue ship Carpathia selling for just under $97,000. Three photos and a handwritten note detailing the grisly discovery of Titanic’s last lifeboat were sold for $6,800.

In San Francisco, an average one-bedroom apartment rents for more than $3,000 a month and the median home price is about $1.5 million. The climbing cost of living has reached the greater San Francisco Bay Area, which includes parts of the fire areas.

The fires that swept through parts of seven counties were the deadliest and most destructive series of blazes in in California history. At least 42 people were killed and 6,000 homes destroyed.

Crews made excellent progress Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, setting off controlled burns to deprive wildfires of added fuel, said Daniel Berlant, spokesman for California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, also known as Cal Fire. He said cooler weather and the lack of wind helped.

""We're hoping that Mother Nature will continue to cooperate with us,"" he said. ""Increased moisture in the air and potential rainfall, all of those are welcome signs.""

Also on Wednesday, Sonoma County increased its death count from 22 to 23 when officials reported they had found another body in Santa Rosa. Officials released no details.

Keeping positive is hard when facing the reality of starting from scratch, said John De Groot, whose home in Santa Rosa burned down along with a lifetime of memories.

""We've worked our whole lives,"" De Groot said. ""We've had this house for 23 years. So there are a lot of memories there. Grandkids have been there. They love it. And it's not there. So now what?""

California, which was grappling with a housing shortage before the wildfires broke out, is faced with a massive logistical issue with entire neighborhoods destroyed and so many seeking to rebuild.

""This is a tremendous event for an urban area,"" Brock Long, an administrator with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said Tuesday. ""We've got a lot of thinking to do about how you mitigate this from happening in communities down the road and becoming more resilient.""

An estimated 100,000 people were evacuated at the height of the fires, and about 34,000 remain under evacuation. Many have yet to find out if their homes are still standing.

""The good thing is we have each other,"" said Ramona Lancu, whose family home in Larkfield was destroyed. ""We were able to escape. Now we just start a new life. It's hard.""

Lancu was among tens of thousands who have drifted home to find their lives and their communities dramatically altered.

At a Red Cross shelter in Petaluma, 69-year-old Sue Wortman recalled the words that raced through her mind when she fled the flames near her home in Sonoma.

""We're all going up in smoke,"" she thought at the time. Since then, she's been walking around in a daze.

Firefighters gained more control Tuesday of the massive wine country wildfires, even as other blazes erupted in mountains near Los Angeles and Santa Cruz.

Meanwhile, officials and trauma experts worried about the emotional toll taken by the grueling week of blazes.

Wortman has been living in her RV outside the Petaluma shelter, while hundreds of other evacuees sought refuge in tents and trailers and on cots inside the fairground facility. She has sought comfort among friends and with her dogs but knows that feeling won't last.

""I think it's really going to hit when we go home and see the destruction,"" she said.

Highlighting the concerns of mental health professionals, the California Psychological Association has emailed an urgent request calling for volunteers to help wildfire evacuees cope with the trauma they have faced and its aftermath.

""There is tremendous acute and long term impact and we are needed right now to help,"" Dr. Chip Shreiber, the association's disaster resource coordinator, said in the email sent Monday to a distribution list of 13,000 licensed psychologists across California. ""Please get the word out.""

It's common for survivors to feel a range of emotions — sadness, anger, irritability — and to suffer flashbacks or nightmares while having trouble sleeping, especially in a shelter surrounded by strangers.

Evacuees were advised to pace their exposure to news and media, which provide information that can reduce anxiety but also become overwhelming.

“I love the Star-Spangled Banner so much because I love America,” Suraci said.","It was just another college football game on Saturday in Hartford, Connecticut, until just before kickoff, an announcement came over the loud speakers that there would be no playing of the national anthem.

Everyone was on the field, the coin toss had just happened, and players had their helmets off, standing at attention, ready for the anthem to be played, Coach Jeff Devanney told Fox News.

But after a few moments of silence, it was announced the PA system failed – and there would be no playing of the Anthem.

Trinity senior fullback Ethan Suraci told Fox News the silence “felt like forever, honestly. You could hear the crowd and the opposing team” expressing disappointment over the announcement.

Suraci said he immediately started belting out the words to what he calls “America’s song,” which also happens to be his favorite song, and it seemed everyone joined in.

""There were almost three different waves of the Star-Spangled Banner going,” Coach Devanney said. Trinity’s team, Hamilton’s team, and the crowd each had started singing “almost like an echo,” but he added, “It all seemed to end on the same note.”

“That was awesome!” said sportscaster Jake Donnelly, who captured the video and posted it on YouTube. “Not many tenors on either end of the field here this afternoon, but a bunch of players that absolutely love America and love the National Anthem. That was one of the coolest things I have ever seen,” Donnelly added.

“It was a fantastic display of unity and patriotism and gave everyone in the crowd, the teams, and hopefully those who watch the video; chills of hope for a better United States of America and happiness to see us as a society beginning to heal - despite the polarization we see among the citizens and our politicians,” Suraci said.

The incident came a day before Vice President Mike Pence’s decision to leave Sunday’s NFL game between the Indianapolis Colts and the San Francisco 49ers, when several 49er players kneeled during the Anthem.

Coach Devanney said he discussed the NFL protests with his team, calling it a “complicated issue.”

President Trump tweeted Wednesday it’s “about time” NFL’s Goodell called on players to stand for the national anthem.

The senior political science major, who identifies as a Republican and voted for Trump, agrees.

“I am in total agreement with one's constitutional right to protest. However, these players are protesting in an incorrect forum,” he said. “Why insult an entire country and all those who fell for her?”

The 5-foot-10-inch, 225-pound fullback always stands and proudly holds his hand over his heart, just as he did on Saturday.

No one really knows who first started singing the anthem in at the Jessee/Miller Field, but Coach Devanney told Fox News, “I wouldn’t be shocked if Ethan was the first one, given his love of the song.”

In fact, Suraci listens to the “Star-Spangled Banner” as sung by Celine Dion every day after he’s done with school.

“I love the Star-Spangled Banner so much because I love America,” Suraci said. “It’s as simple as that.”","College football players, fans sing 'Star-Spangled Banner' after PA system fails",https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/11/college-football-players-fans-sing-star-spangled-banner-after-pa-system-fails.html

Once seated, Tyler H. ordered fried chicken and waffles that he said tasted “suspiciously like Popeyes.”

“I kindly asked our waiter how they cooked their fried chicken. After checking he admitted that they do in fact use Popeyes,” Tyler H. continued in his review. “The manager compensated us for the entire meal.”

Sweet Dixie Kitchen owner Kim Sanchez saw the Yelp review and responded, boldly defending the origins of her chicken.

“We PROUDLY SERVE Popeyes' spicy tenders — the best fried chicken anywhere and from New Orleans — which are delivered twice a day. We also in case you need to know buy our gumbo from a friend who sells it at a local farmers market,” Sanchez said in her response.

“We promote usually small batch local producers in our menu. The exception is Popeyes – we can’t fry at this location – and it the fried chicken I love so much and I ate a ton of it in the ATL. So I serve it,” she continued.

Sanchez’s Yelp response also added that they “don’t mill our own flour” or “grow our own veggies.”

In an interview with Fox News, Sanchez said that she started using Popeyes two months ago for two new dishes – fried chicken and waffles and their fried chicken sandwich.

“I tried Costco chicken, I tried Restaurant Depot chicken, and then I went to dinner at Popeyes and knew this was the chicken we had to use for the store. It’s the best chicken,” she says.

Sanchez claims that she has always been upfront with the use of the chicken chain’s spicy fried chicken strips.

“We wrote it on our board in the restaurant, ‘Imported from Louisiana this week, thank you Popeyes.’ It wasn’t a secret. We use the chicken as an ingredient in a menu item we made, we don’t use their sauces or anything else.”

But other customers that learned about the questionable chicken sourcing have felt duped and took to Yelp to vent their frustrations.

“Serving another restaurant's food and charging a premium!?” Yelp user Jeremy O. asked.

“I just can't wit them. I want to see the contract between this restaurant & Popeyes to know what percentage of $$ Popeyes is getting from this restaurant to be so proudly serving their chicken,” another user, Agnes J. said.

However, despite the complaints rolling in, Sanchez has doubled down on her decision to outsource the restaurant’s fried chicken in a long rant on Facebook detailing where the brunch outpost gets its ingredients.

The restaurant is open about making “roughly 95 percent” of the food they sell in house, like the seasoned potato salad and eggy quiche — the caveat being that the quiche, where they “crack each egg and measure spices and cream,” is then poured into a “pie crust that was made elsewhere.”

“I would be glad to put Popeyes on my menu. I walk in through the front door carrying the bag of chicken. The customers know where it’s from. Popeyes knows.”

“Here’s why Obama stays quiet as Trump attacks his legacy” is the headline on a CNN story that ran over the weekend. The author of the article, Byron Wolf, explains why the former President has generally refrained from commenting on the political news of the day. But another report out of Washington raises new questions about why Mr. Obama has remained silent on one issue in particular.

“With each passing day, President Donald Trump unravels another piece of Barack Obama’s legacy,” writes Mr. Wolf. “And yet Obama watches from the sidelines, mostly silent, as Trump punches holes in the dry wall of his freshly finished legacy.”

Presidents traditionally try to avoid criticizing their successors. Mr. Obama suggested before leaving office that he would only comment publicly when “core values may be at stake.” Since leaving the White House he has occasionally addressed issues of federal policy including immigration, health care and climate change. But Mr. Obama has had little or nothing to say about the issue that has so fascinated many of his fellow Democrats: the claim that Donald Trump somehow colluded with the Russians to rig the 2016 election.

This column noted in April that Mr. Obama’s decision not to address the issue in his post-presidency was fairly strong circumstantial evidence that, having had unparalleled access to the relevant intelligence, he didn’t think there was anything to it. After all, if our former commander-in-chief believed that a foreign government had essentially staged a silent coup in the United States, how could this not rise to the level of a threat to core values?

A report today in The Hill suggests that Mr. Obama may not simply have concluded that there was nothing to the allegations against the Trump campaign. He may have also decided that a close inspection of U.S.-Russian relations would not be kind to the Obama Administration--and especially to its State Department during the early years of his presidency.",When Obama Speaks: There's One Topic That Never Seems to Come Up ...,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/10/18/when-obama-speaks-theres-one-topic-never-seems-come

And he can finish it too, but he needs a little help to get this movement – the one he created back in 2016 when he sat out the national anthem in protest of police brutality – over the goal line.

He should meet with President Trump.

In return for his seemingly blatant disregard for the United States and the national anthem, (un)lucky #7 Kaepernick claims to have been blacklisted from the NFL. In truth, it’s hard for me to see why any team would want to get within 100 yards of him and exacerbate the already-terrible PR that’s hit the NFL in the last 24 months.

I know there are many challenging, heartfelt and legitimate issues facing our country today. These issues need to be discussed, debated and solved. Often times, protesting is the only way to bring them to the surface, and for that, I am thankful.

But I'm also thankful that we live in a country that affords us the absolute freedom to peacefully protest any of these issues - even the most difficult and seemingly divisive ones. And our national anthem is our means to celebrate this – a time to stand together, shoulder to shoulder with hands on our hearts, honoring the flag of a country that more than 1.1 million American soldiers have sacrificed their lives for in order to secure, protect and defend that very freedom that we enjoy every day.

Despite our drastic differences, we’re all on the same team. We’re all in this together. And the teams that can’t navigate their differences, those are the ones that have losing seasons year after year. But the great teams? The championship teams? They figure it out. They. Always. Figure. It. Out.

That is why I will never advocate for a protest during the national anthem. Simply put, it's country before self – even when the country isn't exactly where it should be. Our charge as Americans is to get there together and we should start by respecting and honoring the one thing that allows us to go on that journey.

That said, choosing to ignore a message simply because you don’t like the messenger or agree with his style of delivery is to choose to remain ignorant on an issue. So while I deplore the method in which Colin Kaepernick chooses to protest, I want (and need) to understand his position and opinions.

I’ve spent my entire adult life talking about how athletes - and the skills athletes possess - represent the greatest of what’s possible with the human potential - in both life and business. Athletes are incredibly hard working, dedicated, disciplined and have the desire to be a champion in everything they do. These qualities are certainly essential to a successful life and, in business, there are no better skills required when wanting to hire the best talent available.

Athletes also know the value of their teammates - that no goal can be achieved without leaning on each other. I’ve been in hundreds of locker rooms and board rooms, and I can tell you that not one of them had a room full of people that agreed on everything. I’ve witnessed more than a few verbal (and physical) battles over the years on both sides. They were brutal! But we all had one thing in common – the insatiable desire to be the best team imaginable.

This is why sports brings us together like nothing else and why athletes have the unique ability to bring people together from all walks of life. We aspire to be like them – to better our best, to improve ourselves daily and to chase perfection.

And this is analogous to our country, its citizens and our anthem. Coming together for a common purpose, despite our differences.

Which is why a meeting between two such incredibly polarizing adults – one an out-of-work NFL quarterback in the driving seat of a nationwide protest, the other the 45th president of the United States – could be such an incredible opportunity to help unify the country.

President Trump and Colin Kaepernick need to do one thing: sit down and talk.

They need to show the other side the respect it deserves and hear it out. They need to listen to each other fervently, not as a means to form a response but to intimately understand.

Because you see, despite our drastic differences, we’re all on the same team. We’re all in this together. And the teams that can’t navigate their differences, those are the ones that have losing seasons year after year. But the great teams? The championship teams? They figure it out. They. Always. Figure. It. Out.

Harvard Law student Briana Williams, 24, tells the New York Daily News she’s still furious about being booted from an American Airlines flight on Aug. 21, after she had requested her daughter’s stroller back during a delay. And, like Mallory, Williams says it was her pilot who ultimately made the call.

According to Williams, she and her 4-month old daughter were flying to New York City on Flight 1678 out of Atlanta, but due to weather, the aircraft returned to the gate and passengers were told to deplane. On the way out, however, Williams says she asked the staff if they would retrieve a stroller she checked at the gate, but they denied her request. But Williams wasn’t about to take no for an answer.

WOMEN'S MARCH CO-FOUNDER ACCUSES AA PILOT OF 'WHITE MALE AGGRESSION'

“I told a crew member that I was not going to be leaving the aircraft without my stroller,” Williams said.

At that point, Williams says her pilot became involved. “He was very disgruntled and angry,” she told the Daily News.

The pilot eventually called police to escort Williams from the plane, and she spent the rest of the night at the airport with her 4-month-old. Her fellow passengers were allowed to board a later flight, but American booked Williams on a different flight leaving in the morning.

Now, Williams says she’s considering a lawsuit against the carrier, alleging that the “unregulated discretion” of American Airlines pilots is leading to a “discriminatory policy.”

“The pilot put me in a potentially dangerous situation with law enforcement as a young, black woman, saying that I was a ‘threat,’” Williams told the Daily News, ""This type of rhetoric paralyzes the African-American community, and I want to ensure that policies are put in place that regulate the pilot’s discretionary abilities.”

Williams also added that she’s only now coming forward with this story after reading about Tamika Mallory’s incident aboard an American Airlines flight on Sunday.

AMERICAN AIRLINES AGENT SAYS CURLING 'ISN'T A SPORT,' PASSENGER CLAIMS

American, meanwhile, does not deny they booked Williams on a separate flight, but would not elaborate, merely saying it was in “the best interest of everyone involved.” They did, however, offer compensation in the form of 25,000 AAdvantage miles, which Williams says she declined.

“American spoke directly with Ms. Williams, and as a gesture of goodwill, provided her 25,000 AAdvantage® miles, which can be redeemed for a future roundtrip flight on American Airlines,” the airline confirmed in a statement to Fox News.

“American does not tolerate discrimination of any kind,” the airline’s statement continued. “From the team members we hire to the customers we serve, inclusion and diversity is a way of life at American. Every day, our team members work to make American a place where people of all generations, races, ethnicities, genders, sexual orientations, religious affiliations and backgrounds feel welcome and valued.

“All of our team members — which includes our gate agents, pilots and flight attendants – are proud to serve customers of all backgrounds and we are committed to providing a positive, safe travel experience for everyone who flies with us.”

It’s at its best in a center lane, where it holds itself dead center, even through wide radius curves. If they're too tight for the speed the vehicle is traveling at, ProPilot Assist will alert the driver to take back full control.

More impressive than its lane-keeping ability is the adaptive cruise control component of the system. This isn’t a new concept, but many cars so equipped apply the brakes abruptly when the car they’re following slows down or one pulls into their lane, often jarring passengers. ProPilot Assist has the same smooth touch as a very alert driver, and works in stop-and-go traffic, as long as the vehicle doesn’t stay stationary for very long.

Overall, ProPilot Assist is a step behind similar systems that Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, Cadillac and Volvo currently offer, but is far ahead of anything available from Nissan's peers in the mainstream automotive segment. Nissan has sketched out a roadmap toward a fully autonomous car by 2022, however, so the abilities of its technology should increase quickly and dramatically in the coming years.

Pricing for the ProPilot assist feature has not been announced, but the 2018 Rogue starts at $25,665 and it goes on sale Oct. 24th.",Nissan ProPilot Assist semi-autonomous driving system to launch in 2018 Rogue,https://www.foxnews.com/auto/2017/10/18/nissan-propilot-assist-semi-autonomous-driving-system-to-launch-in-2018-rogue.html

He also pointedly criticized China, which he accused of challenging international norms needed for global stability.

Tillerson was speaking on relations between the world's two largest democracies ahead of his first trip to South Asia as secretary of state.

He said the world needed the U.S. and India to have a strong partnership. He said the two nations share goals of security, free navigation, free trade and fighting terrorism in the Indo-Pacific, and serve as ""the eastern and western beacons"" for an international rules-based order which is increasingly under strain.

Both India and China had benefited from that order, but Tillerson said India had done so while respecting rules and norms, while China had ""at times"" undermined them. To make his point, he alluded to China's island building and expansive territorial claims in seas where Beijing has long-running disputes with Southeast Asian neighbors.

""China's provocative actions in the South China Sea directly challenge the international law and norms that the United States and India both stand for,"" Tillerson said in an address at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.

He added that the U.S. seeks constructive relations with China but ""won't shrink"" from the challenges it poses when it ""subverts the sovereignty of neighboring countries, and disadvantages the U.S. and our friends.""

U.S.-India relations have generally prospered in the past decade, in part because of their shared concerns about the rise of China. While President Donald Trump has looked to deepen cooperation with China on addressing the nuclear threat from North Korea, he's also sought a closer relationship with India, which shares U.S. worries on Islamic extremism.

""In this period of uncertainty and angst, India needs a reliable partner on the world stage. I want to make clear: with our shared values and vision for global stability, peace and prosperity, the United States is that partner,"" Tillerson said.

Tillerson said the U.S. wants to help improve India's military capabilities, and also improve security cooperation among the region's major democracies, which included Japan and Australia.

Tillerson said the U.S. and India were leading regional efforts on counterterrorism. He called for India's archrival Pakistan ""to take decisive action against terrorist groups based within their own borders that threaten its own people and the broader region.""","Tillerson seeks stronger ties with India, chides China",http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/18/tillerson-seeks-stronger-ties-with-india-chides-china.html

According to the penitentiary's website, reports of the prison being haunted began in the 1940s, when inmates — and officers — reported a slew of odd encounters. Several paranormal teams have come to investigate the spot, which has been featured on TV shows including ""Ghost Hunters"" and ""World's Scariest Places.""

The Queen Mary – Long Beach, Calif.

A post shared by Beth Crowley (@bethinsalem) on Oct 9, 2017 at 6:38am PDT

Construction of the Queen Mary began in 1930, with the Cunard Line project setting off from Southampton, England, for its maiden voyage in 1936. The ship later served in World War II before resuming passenger service across the Atlantic, but has remained docked in Long Beach, Calif., since 1967. Over the years, the Queen Mary has transported many distinguished passengers, including Bob Hope, Clark Gable, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, Winston Churchill, and — if popular rumors are to be believed — a few ghosts, as well. Today, guests can sign up for “Haunted Encounters” tours by day to explore the ship, hear haunted stories, and maybe even see one of the ghosts said to still remain, such as a sailor who died in the ship's engine room or a ""lady in white."" And when the sun goes down, a “Paranormal Investigations” tour with paranormal investigator and ParaXplorer Project founder Matthew Schulz tries to ""connect with spirits who may still call the ship home."" Finally, the Queen Mary also offers a “Paranormal Ship Walk,” where you can ""judge for yourself whether or not the ship really is haunted.""

Built in 1872, this hotel has welcomed famous guests including Wyatt Earp, Jesse James, Buffalo Bill Cody, Clay Allison, Black Jack Ketchum, Billy the Kid and Thomas James Wright. The spirits of some are said to still haunt the hotel, especially T.J. Wright in room 18, which remains intact and is not available to book. Guests are otherwise free to explore the paranormal in other rooms, no Ouija board required. A former guest who stayed in room 17 also attested to the hotel’s haunted happenings during a recent getaway: “We left that hotel feeling that definitely and for the first time in our fairly long lives we had been 'haunted.'”

Crescent Hotel – Eureka Springs, Ark.

A post shared by Southern Dreadology (@southern_dreadology) on Oct 8, 2017 at 6:15pm PDT

This hotel has a unique history, opening in 1886 as a hotel geared towards the carriage set. From 1908 to 1934, the location operated as the Crescent College & Conservatory for Young Women to help compensate for the hotel’s offseason, and then, in 1937, Norman Glenwood Baker — a charlatan masquereding as a doctor — purchased the property and opened it as Baker’s Cancer Curing Hospital. Baker was sent to jail and the location underwent renovations in 1946 to become a hotel once again, but the spirits that are said to haunt the property decided to stay. Ghost tours are now a popular attraction and ghosts are rumored to include ""Michael,"" ""Theodora,"" ""The Nurse,"" “The Ghost on the Morgue,” ""The Girl in the Mist,” and a lady in Victorian lingerie in room 3500. One account on the hotel's website describes hearing unexplained breathing and feeling “as if someone took both their hands and slowly expanded their [fingertips] widely on the back of my head.”

Foley House Inn – Savannah, Georgia

A post shared by Mandy. (@cvnicalskin) on Jul 12, 2017 at 10:06am PDT

Savannah, Ga. has been called one of “America’s most haunted cities,” and this bed and breakfast is a prime example of why. The inn was built in 1896 by the widow of a wealthy Irish immigrant Honoria Foley, on land where a home was once destroyed by the Great Savannah Fire of 1889. But during a 1987 renovation, skeletal remains were discovered behind a wall — and although the remains were never identified, the Foley House claims that they could have been the bones of a wealthy boarder who was possibly killed for his money. There are several other accounts of what happened, some of which say the man was trying to court Mrs. Foley, or that he was trying to kill her. Either way, the staff has heard stories of strange noises, rushes of air, or a man in a top hat walking through the garden at night. If you'd rather see for yourself, consider a visit via their “Haunted Savannah Package”.

Waverly Hills Sanatorium – Louisville, Kentucky

ready for tonight A post shared by ⚓️Abbey Hodapp⚓️ (@ihodapp) on Aug 20, 2017 at 5:29pm PDT

The property opened in 1883 as a one-room school house, known as the Waverley School. The Board of Tuberculosis Hospital later purchased the land and opened the Waverly Hills Sanatorium on July 26, 1910. Though it was only built to comfortably hold 40-50 patients, tuberculosis became an epidemic and the clinic ended up housing more than 140 people at one time, necessitating additions. Given the nature of the disease, the hospital was secluded and a self-contained community, even with its own zip code, post office, water treatment facility, and the community grew its own fruits and vegetables and raised meat for slaughter. So once employees and patients came to the hospital, they pretty much became permanent residents. The property later served as a tuburculosis hospital and then a geriatric facility before it was closed by the state 1981. But for those more interested in its peculiar past, the property offers paranormal tours, historical tours, investigations, and a haunted house, just to name a few attractions.

Day 6 of 31. One of the creepiest places I’ve ever step foot in The Ohio State Reformatory. Commonly known as the prison used in the Shawshank Redemption. A truly beautiful piece of history and a real life haunt as compared to my man made ones featured so far. A post shared by Caleb Kendrick (@jckendy) on Oct 6, 2017 at 8:22am PDT

According to its website, Blood Prison is the ""world-renowned"" for being paranormally active — oh, and it's also called ""Blood Prison,"" so there's that, too. The cornerstone for the prison that would become the Ohio State Reformatory was laid on November 4, 1886, but it was previously the site of a Civil War camp in 1861. In the years since, shadowy figures, footsteps and strange physical sensations have been reported. Some even say they've been jabbed by an invisible nightstick. Today, the Mansfield property offers activities including tours, but those looking for a good scare around Halloween should attempt the “Escape from Blood Prison” attraction. You can even purchase a “Touch pass” for a full immersion experience that allows the actors to, well, touch you. Fun fact: the spot is also frequently used in film and television shoots, and Sylvester Stallone even paid a visit recently to shoot an ""Escape Plane"" sequel.",10 of America's eeriest haunted attractions,https://www.foxnews.com/travel/2017/10/18/10-americas-eeriest-haunted-attractions.html

As the weather turns cooler, you might be looking for ways to keep outdoor living part of your routine. These 10 ideas can help make the most of enjoying the fresh air on your porch and patio or in your yard this season, whether you’re bookmarking dates for fall outings or looking for ways to keep your garden inviting.

1. Host a backyard party. Invite guests to bundle up and come outside to enjoy the crisp air for all or part of the evening. Make an outdoor lounge spot feel cozy with extra throw blankets and pillows brought out from inside the house. Light candles for an inviting glow or move chairs around an outdoor fire pit to take advantage of the warmth.

2. Move a porch swing outside. Admire the changing leaves from a front-row seat by hanging a porch swing in the garden. Look for a large lateral branch from a mature tree or — even easier — hang from a backyard shade pergola, if you have one. Finishing touches like pumpkin-colored pillows and pots of mums on either side make the swinging lounge even more festive.

3. Pick for a good cause. This year, why not trade a visit to a U-pick farm for a harvesting day out that will leave both you and the greater community a little richer in fall produce? Nonprofit organizations like San Francisco Bay Area-based Village Harvest host weekly picking trips to local backyards and small orchards where volunteers harvest the excess produce for community members in need.

You can also expect to take home fruit that’s not fit for donation (but may be perfect for pie) like those that are extra ripe, fragile or slightly damaged. You can join a trip or list your backyard if you have a couple of fruit trees with more ripe fruit than you can handle.

This time of year, expect to harvest apples, pears, persimmons and pomegranates, among others.

4. Find a sun trap. Gardens this time of year can feel damp and chilly but often have areas that catch the sun’s rays. Seek out these warm places or follow your cat or dog in the afternoon — they always seem to find them — as spots to linger and appreciate the last of the season’s warmth.

5. Embrace indoors-outdoors. Moving outdoor furniture under an overhang can be a great way to extend your ability to enjoy a meal or relax outside in a transitional season. If fall in your region means rain, the covered roof can make the difference of eating outside or indoors.

6. Invest in landscape heaters. Adding heat can make a big difference if you’d like to linger outside in cool weather. Installing small wall-mounted or ceiling-mounted outdoor heaters may be easier than you think. The units run from $120 to $200 in big-box stores and can be plugged in to regular home electricity systems. Most wall- or ceiling-mounted models cast about a nine-foot-square “heat blanket” — one heater would be enough for a cafe set, while two can heat an outdoor dining table.

7. Get cozy with sheepskins. Instantly make cold outdoor furniture feel more inviting by covering the seats or seat backs with a cozy material. Sheepskins (faux and real) provide warmth and a cushy padding, while throw blankets can double as wraps later in the evening.

8. Pick out a portable fire pit. It’s no surprise that adding a fire pit can really make your patio functional in the cooler months, providing warmth, light and a great excuse to go outside — s’mores! While large-scale fire pits and outdoor fireplaces can be pricey investments, smaller, portable gas-burning models come at a more wallet-friendly price. Plus, being portable, they can easily be moved from one area of the garden to another or brought in the garage for the winter.

9. Brighten up your porch. Hanging a few strings of lights can be all it takes to transform a shadowy porch into an alluring spot. Set the lights on your front porch on a timer so they turn on when you’re coming home in the evening, making for a bright and welcoming entry.

Wilson stood by her account Wednesday on Twitter. And on CNN, Wilson said she and other Johnson family members heard what Trump said because the call was put on a speakerphone.

""I have proof, too,"" she countered.

A top White House adviser separately told Local 10 News that the president's conversations ""with the families of American heroes who have made the ultimate sacrifice are private.""

Trump had called Johnson’s widow to offer condolences. Myeshia Johnson, who is expecting her and her deceased husband’s third baby in January, also has a 2-year-old son and 6-year-old daughter.

Sgt. Johnson died during a Green Berets mission in Niger. Islamic militants ambushed the soldiers Oct. 4 with machine guns and grenades.

Trump was initially criticized for lack of focus on the deadly attack, although the Department of Defense reportedly launched an investigation into the ambush, the New York Daily News reported.

The three other slain service members were: Staff Sgt. Bryan C. Black, 35, of Puyallup, Wash.; Staff Sgt. Jeremiah W. Johnson, 39, of Springboro, Ohio; and Staff Sgt. Dustin M. Wright, 29, of Lyons, Ga.

TheWrap.com reported the 44-year-old’s comment came after “The Late Late Show” host James Corden joked about film producer Harvey Weinstein at Friday night’s amfAR gala in Los Angeles.

Weinstein has been accused of raping, assaulting and harassing women during his decades-long career.

“Right here in L.A., it’s so beautiful Harvey Weinstein has already asked tonight up to his hotel to give him a massage,” the 39-year-old quipped, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

Later he said, “It has been weird this week watching Harvey Weinstein in hot water. Ask any of the women who watched him take a bath, it’s weird watching Harvey Weinstein in hot water.”

McGowan, who has come forward to also accuse Weinstein of rape, voiced her disgust with what she heard.

“THIS IS RICH FAMOUS HOLLYWOOD WHITE MALE PRIVILEGE IN ACTION,” McGowan wrote at the time. “REPLACE THE WORD ‘WOMEN’ w/the ‘N’ word. How does it feel?”

The tweet quickly received backlash and The Root’s Clarkisha Kent published a two-part post, titled “On Rose McGowan and the Continued Failure of White Feminism.” Kent pointed out McGowan’s comment ignores the experiences and struggles faced by women of color.

“For black women, silence is often equitable to death,” she wrote. “We go through enough silencing, suppression and harassment over our voices day in and day out… So who exactly thought it was wise to tell us that we should totally volunteer to give up our voices for the day? Hmm?”

Jaguars President Mark Lamping sent a letter to the director of military affairs and veterans in Jacksonville saying the team was ”remiss in not fully comprehending the effect of the national anthem demonstration on foreign soil has had on the men and women who have or continue to serve our country.”

The letter was forwarded to Jacksonville Mayor Lenny Curry on Monday and available via his public email.

Most of the Jaguars, including owner Shad Khan, locked arms during the anthem on Sept. 24. About a dozen players took a knee during the playing of ”The Star-Spangled Banner” at Wembley Stadium.

Similar demonstrations happened across the NFL as players, coaches and executives responded to President Donald Trump’s suggestion that teams should punish players making any sort of statements of protests during the national anthem.

The Jaguars demonstrated in unity as a team and then stood for ”God Save The Queen.”

”This was an oversight and certainly not intended to send a message that would disparage you, our flag or our nation,” Lamping wrote to Bill Spann, director of Jacksonville’s military affairs and veterans department.

NFL owners are meeting this week in New York, where the national anthem will be a key topic of discussion.

Lamping’s letter was dated Oct. 6, and it is unclear why it was forwarded to the mayor Monday. Lamping wrote it on behalf of Khan and Tom Coughlin, the team’s executive vice president of football operations.

”The notion never entered the minds of our players or anyone affiliated with the Jacksonville Jaguars, but today we can understand how the events in London on September 24 could have been viewed or misinterpreted,” Lamping wrote. ”We owe you an apology and hope you will accept it.”

Some fans in Jacksonville, a city that hosts a major Navy base and tends to lean Republican, expressed anger on social media sites and vowed never to attend another Jaguars game. Others praised Khan for siding with his players.

The day after the game in London, Curry called it stupid not to stand for the anthem even though such acts are protected by the U.S. Constitution.

”I stand and cover my heart for the pledge and the anthem,” Curry said in a statement. ”I think it’s stupid to do otherwise. The U.S. Constitution protects the right for a lot of people to do a lot of stupid things. I am a Constitutional Conservative, so I respect the wisdom of our Founders.”

The Jaguars announced they distributed 56,232 tickets for their home game against the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday, a 27-17 loss that was the franchise’s ninth in its last 10 games at EverBank Field. It was the team’s fewest number of tickets distributed for a Jaguars home game since 2009.

Officials insisted the decrease had more to do with the team’s losing ways in recent years – the Jaguars have won 20 of 86 games since 2011 – than the anthem demonstration.",Jacksonville Jaguars apologize to military for kneeling in London,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/2017/10/17/jacksonville-jaguars-apologize-to-military-for-kneeling-in-london.html

“Parents need to chill out a little bit.”This article originally appeared on the New York Post.","The scariest thing this Halloween for New York moms isn’t zombies or ghouls — it’s politically incorrect costumes.

An article on raceconscious.org by Sachi Feris has been making the rounds on mommy Facebook groups. Feris writes that her 5-year-old daughter declared she wanted to be Polynesian Disney character Moana, which she worried would be “cultural appropriation.”

Her daughter’s other choice: Scandinavian Queen Elsa from the Disney movie “Frozen.”

“I had some reservations regarding both costume choices … about cultural appropriation and the power/privilege carried by Whiteness, and about Whiteness and standards of beauty,” she wrote.

Feris went on to describe a series of conversations with her daughter, particularly focusing on the ethics of dressing as Moana, who as a teen sets out on a treacherous sea journey to save her family’s island from famine and destruction — and succeeds.

In the end, Feris’s daughter decided to dress as Elsa — though Feris was concerned it might teach her short-haired brunette daughter that one must be white, blue-eyed and have long flaxen hair to be a “beautiful” princess.

But she nixed the Moana costume for Mickey Mouse, because, as Ferris wrote, “we don’t have to worry about making fun of anyone or dressing up as a culture different from our own because Mickey Mouse is a pretend mouse!

“One thing is for sure, our discussions around appropriate and inappropriate Halloween costumes will continue,” concluded Feris.

Her blog was almost universally praised by commenters. Yvette Brown, wrote: “I admire your perseverance in interacting with your daughter. … You also have given her essential values along with guidelines so she has the opportunity to grow, be creative, learn and find her way in the world.”

But another commenter named Amanda expressed reservations. “This feels murky,” she wrote. “I recognize the need to be sensitive, I’m just wondering how you parse the nuances for a child.”

Meanwhile, a New York mom of one daughter told The Post: “I think it’s silly to take children’s Halloween costumes so seriously. They’re kids, can’t they just be kids and not involved with the whole political correctness thing?

""My libido’s vanished""

A post shared by Nikki Harvey (@nikki_harvey_fitness) on Sep 11, 2017 at 10:46am PDT

Nikki Harvey worries that her “zero sex drive” will push away her 26-year-old partner Jordan Burgess, a personal trainer.

Nikki, from Wolverhampton, a city 125 miles north-west of London, was an overweight smoker who did not exercise but has transformed her body in three years. She says:

“In the autumn of 2014, I was a size 16, drinking, smoking, living off junk food and generally pretty miserable.”

“One night I met Jordan and we quickly became an item.”

“He’s a rugby player and he caught me crying to myself in my bedroom when I couldn’t fit into my size 14 clothes.”

“He told me anyone can turn their life around and inspired me to get healthy and take up fitness and bodybuilding.”

“I signed up for a 14-week intensive program, pushing me harder than I ever dreamed possible. I loved every second.”

“Every gram of excess weight was stripped from my body – better than any faddy diet.”

“I now train every morning at 5:30 a.m. for two hours, then do an hour’s cardio every evening.”

“It really impacts on my relationship. I haven’t been on a date night with Jordan since January and my libido has vanished.”

“Right now I have zero sex drive so Jordan and I haven’t made love for two months. Jordan hates it but he knows it’s not because I don’t fancy him. I love my training so much that two months ago I quit my job to do it full time.”

“In April I came second in the UK Bodybuilding and Fitness Federation National Finals and qualified for three inter-national champion-ships.”

“My libido might be gone but I look better and am now so much healthier.”

“I just hope that Jordan will stick by me without sex.”

""I don’t need a relationship""

Fitness addict Gabriella Prior, 22, from Bournemouth, a city 100 miles south-west of London, would rather be in good shape than have a sex life. Gabriella has not had sex for more than 18 months. She says:

“At the start of 2016, I did almost no exercise. I went out drinking, enjoyed lazy weekends, had boyfriends and a healthy sex life. I wasn’t depressed but I felt like I didn’t have any hobbies.”

“One morning, on a whim, I decided to join the nearby House of Pain boxing gym. I was nervous but when I left I was so full of energy I couldn’t wait to do it again.”

“Exercising is now like a drug to me. Within weeks I was training twice a day for two hours each session, five or six days a week. I still do that now.”

“It’s 100 percent effort training with weights, sparring and cardio. Boxing isn’t a sport you do by halves. I can hardly tie my shoe laces after I have finished a session, let alone think about sex. I used to have boyfriends but they ran their course.”

“Now I don’t have time to meet men. I have realised I don’t need a relationship or sex to be happy. I value independence and fitness more than I thought possible. My sex life now is a dim and distant memory.”

“I hope that if I ever want to, I can reduce the intensity of my training and then get my libido back. But I’m not bothered now.”

“I’ve had a couple of short-lived relation-ships since I started training but quickly I’ve been dumped because they thought I was boring, as I did not want to have sex all the time.”

“I have been crowned Miss Fitness Inspiration UK, which means more to me than any amount of sex.”

Excess space is a luxury that most of us do not enjoy while our kids are living at home. But many of my clients find that once their grown children have moved out of the house and established their own households, they suddenly have extra unused spaces. At some point, those childhood bedrooms get cleaned out and stand waiting for a fresh coat of paint and a new purpose.

If you’re lucky enough to have extra square footage in your nest, here are eight ideas for turning that space into something fit for your current lifestyle.

1. A walk-in closet and dressing room. I love the idea of transforming an extra bedroom into a beautiful walk-in closet and dressing room. Several of my clients have done this, gaining both functionality and luxury. One client was even able to connect her new dressing room to her master bath — a nice perk if your floor plan allows. Many companies specialize in custom cabinetry and closets and can help you add this extra bit of comfort to your home.

2. A home office. Some people telecommute, others finish work projects or emails after hours at home, while still others simply enjoy having a dedicated home office for paying bills and taking care of other personal business. An extra bedroom is a perfect option for a home office because the door can be closed for solitude and focus or to hide clutter. You might line closets in the room with custom shelving and cabinets. Or, if this level of construction is not in your budget, you might purchase some beautiful storage solutions at furniture stores that can help you create a good-looking and organized home office.

3. A guest bedroom. Perhaps your adult children live out of town and stay for several nights when they visit. Or maybe other friends or family members often bunk in your home. A dedicated guest room might be just what you need. To make this a relatively inexpensive project, you might repurpose some furniture from a child’s former bedroom. A fresh coat of paint, new bedding, and updated accessories may be all you need to complete its new look.

4. A craft room. If you are someone who enjoys scrapbooking, jewelry making, sewing or similar hobbies, a dedicated craft room may be exactly what you crave. Frequently, craft projects span days or even weeks, and putting supplies away in the middle of a project can be cumbersome. Even if your funds do not allow for built-ins, a large table and wall shelving can work wonders for storing and organizing craft materials.

5. A reading nook. Maybe you have been longing for a quiet, comfortable place to relax with a good book — a small spare bedroom easily could be outfitted for this purpose. You may be able to relocate a comfortable chair from elsewhere in your home. Add a good reading lamp and a small book shelf and, if you want to go further, paint the walls a new color and add accessories, artwork and throw pillows. A cozy blanket in a bright color is another inexpensive way to add style to your reading spot.

6. An exercise gym. Outfit a small extra bedroom with exercise equipment and a wall-mounted television. Watching your favorite show while working out can make the time much more pleasant — I’m speaking from experience here. Also, large wall mirrors not only make a small bedroom appear larger but can help you ensure correct form and prevent injuries.

7. A yoga or pilates studio. With an available bedroom, a quiet dedicated space for yoga or pilates may be an attainable luxury. If your space and budget allow, enhancing a new studio by adding sliding doors out to a private garden is a wonderful way to create a special place with plenty of light and fresh air. A bubbling fountain augments the mood. Painting the walls a cool, calming color such as blue or gray can also boost the tranquility.

8. A multifunctional space. If you have only one spare bedroom but a variety of needs, a Murphy bed or wall bed may be the solution for you. Multiple companies specialize in beds that fold effortlessly into an attractive wall cabinet when not needed. That way, you can use your spare room as a home office, craft space or exercise studio without a bed taking up floor space — at least not until just before your visiting children arrive.",How to make use and better your life with a spare bedroom,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/09/28/how-to-make-use-and-better-your-life-with-spare-bedroom.html

Following the spate of violent protests in Charlottesville, Va., and Berkley, lawmakers in Los Angeles are contemplating imposing new restrictions on what people can carry at public demonstrations and meetings in the city.

In addition to tiki torches – which were used in Charlottesville – pepper spray, gas masks and shields, city lawmakers seek to prohibit water cannons, Tasers, bricks, hammers, cans of spray paint and drones. Glass and plastic bottles filled with liquids that are alcoholic or not consumable would also be banned.

The city council said it was trying to be proactive to prevent violent incidents, the Los Angeles Times reported.

Councilman Mitch Englander, who is a reserve police officer, said the city’s attorneys are drafting the new law and would work closely with the police department to finalize the list of banned items.

“We don’t have to go far to look at what’s happened,” he said during a committee meeting last week. “We’re looking at best practices.”

Los Angeles currently prohibits protesters from carrying wooden planks more than 2 inches wide and a quarter-inch thick.

Critics of the proposed law challenged the legal basis for prohibiting items at protests that otherwise are lawful to possess on the street.

“If it is lawful to have that in your possession while you’re standing on the sidewalk, then what is the difference?” Carol Sobel, a civil rights attorney who has repeatedly sued the city, said.

Peter Bibring, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, raised concerns about banning drones that are often used to document turnout.

“If the city is going to pass a blanket rule that says you can’t use drones over city streets, that’s one thing,” Bibring said. “But to target protests, in particular, raises First Amendment concerns.”

The city restricts the possession of some kinds of weapons, including knives and arrows in public, as well as prohibits people from carrying glass bottles onto public property where permitted community events are being held, with exceptions for medicine, baby formula, food preparation and beverages sold on site.","Los Angeles seeks to ban tiki torches, pepper spray, shields at protests",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/18/los-angeles-seeks-to-ban-tiki-torches-pepper-spray-shields-at-protests.html

A poor pup needed emergency surgery after the dog started eating mouthfuls of gravel.

Bella, a one-year-old French bulldog, was rushed to the vets after she was unable to eat, constantly being sick and ""very lethargic.""

Owner Victoria, 37, was baffled by Bella's sickness, but an X-ray revealed she had ingested a large collection of stones.

""I took Bella for a check-up because she wasn’t herself at all,"" Victoria, whose last name was not given, said. ""She started snapping at us and couldn’t keep anything down.""

""I wondered if she’d eaten something odd or had worms but then the vets said they could feel a mass in her stomach and I just broke down,"" she said.

BOY GIVEN 5 PERCENT CHANCE OF SURVIVAL MARKS FIRST BIRTHDAY

Luckily, vets at the PDSA centre in Croydon, south London, managed to save the poor dog's life with laxatives and fluids to flush her system.

""Bella’s condition was very worrying, she was very lethargic and was suffering from diarrhoea and vomiting,"" Laura Heaps, PDSA vet, said. ""We examined her and could feel something in her stomach and to be sure what it was, we X-rayed her.""

""When we saw the images on the screen we couldn’t believe our eyes,"" Heaps said. ""You could clearly see the gravel in her stomach and colon. Luckily because the stones were so small and unlikely to cause a fatal blockage we were able to avoid surgery.""

The laxatives and fluids worked on Bella, and she was able to return home the next day.

Victoria said she is now keeping a closer eye on the ""inquisitive"" dog.

""Bella was out of sorts for a couple of days but she was soon was back to her normal self,"" she said. ""I can’t thank PDSA enough for the fantastic treatment she received. I’m keeping a close eye on her now to make sure it doesn’t happen again.""

""She’s quite an inquisitive dog and is into everything so I’ve cleared the garden to try and ensure there are no gravel stones she can get her little paws on,"" Victoria said.",Puppy nearly dies after eating gravel,http://www.foxnews.com/health/2017/10/18/puppy-nearly-dies-after-eating-gravel.html

Three songs into his show in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the singer launched into a five-minute speech that honored the 58 killed and nearly 500 hurt in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. But Aldean took a defiant tone in telling concertgoers to resist living in fear, and he called for more of the national unity he's seen since the attack.

""These people are going to continue to try to hold us down,"" Aldean said. ""To those people that keep trying to do that, I say (expletive) you, we don't really care.""

Fans agreed. They pumped their fists and held up American flags as Aldean continued.

""I want to play the show for you guys that the people in Las Vegas came to see and didn't get a chance to,"" he said.

Friends Audra Miller, Lee Holstein and Amanda Zmak were some of those fans. They were in the audience when the shooting happened and ran for cover like thousands of others.

They traveled from Dallas for the Tulsa show and wore T-shirts they decorated themselves that said ""Vegas Strong,"" a popular meme since the attack.

Miller, 34, said Aldean made them proud and viewed the evening as a triumph.

""It was therapeutic and kind of like a cleansing all at the same time,"" she said. ""We just wanted to represent family, friends, love and hope.""

Aldean gave fans the show they wanted. The Georgia native is one of country music's biggest stars, touring in support of his album ""They Don't Know,"" which debuted atop the Billboard 200 in 2016. Much of his catalog includes Southern rock, pop and hip-hop influences, a mix of hard-charging party anthems and ballads with lyrics about farm work, drinking and small-town life.

He blasted through hits including ""Big Green Tractor,"" ''Fly Over States"" and ""She's Country,"" and popped open a can of beer onstage after the encore.

Aldean canceled shows in California last week to mourn those killed Oct. 1 at the outdoor Route 91 festival. He resumed his tour in an arena where concertgoers walked through metal detectors, and police presence was visible.

The singer visited shooting victims still in a Las Vegas hospital Sunday. The day before, Aldean performed Tom Petty's ""I Won't Back Down"" on ""Saturday Night Live"" in tribute to the victims and the late rock superstar.

Petty died the day after the shooting in Los Angeles after suffering cardiac arrest.

The first sight of a daffodil, whether in your garden or in a store, is proof that spring is here. Even better, they’re practically foolproof to grow. They’re perennial bulbs, coming back year after year. They’re cold hardy and don’t need summer water to thrive. They’re also not a target for deer or gophers. If you want to enjoy these bulbs come spring, though, fall is the time to plant.

Caution: Keep daffodil bulbs away from pets, as they are toxic.

Botanical name: Narcissus spp.

Common names: Daffodil, jonquil, narcissus

Origin: Native to Europe and North Africa

Bloom season: Late winter and spring; rebloom every year

Where they grow: Hardy to minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 40 degrees Celsius (USDA zones 3 to 9)

Light requirements: Full sun

Water requirements: Regular water when growing and blooming

Benefits and tolerances: Easy to grow; tolerate most soils and prefer dry conditions in summer; deer, rabbits, gophers, squirrels and chipmunks all avoid them.

When to plant: Begin planting bulbs when the soil begins to cool, approximately two to four weeks before you expect the ground to freeze in colder climates. That might be as early as September in the coldest climates but is more likely October in most locations.

If you live in a warm-winter climate where freezes are late or unlikely, buy the bulbs early when you have the best selection; then store them in a cool, dry spot out of sunlight until your soil temperature has reached about 60 degrees Fahrenheit, or 15.6 degrees Celsius, usually around mid-November.

Daffodil basics. Daffodil lovers and experts categorize the Narcissus genus into 13 divisions. If that is overwhelming, take the easier approach and use familiar common names. Daffodil is used for those with larger blooms, while narcissus refers to those with smaller flowers, which usually bloom early. The paperwhite narcissus, a favorite for forcing, falls into this latter category. Jonquil denotes the N. jonquilla species and its hybrids.

Choosing bulbs. Look for bulbs that feel firm and heavy and don’t show any signs of injury. Store in a cool, dry, airy spot out of direct sunlight before planting.

You might also find other daffodil species and hybrids. ‘Tête-à-Tête’ and fragrant ‘Tiny Bubbles’ are only about 6 inches tall and work well in rock gardens.

If your local selection is limited or you want something unusual, order bulbs online. They will be shipped to you when it’s the right time to plant in your climate zone. Some good sources for bulbs include Brent and Becky’s Bulbs, John Scheepers and White Flower Farm.

Where to plant. Choose a spot in full sun, although in the hottest climates they will prefer partial shade once they finish blooming. Daffodils will tolerate most soils as long as they drain well, though they prefer acidic to neutral soil. Amend your soil before planting if it doesn’t drain well.

How to use it. Plant en masse or set them among other plants in a garden bed or border. Daffodils also are good choices for containers.

Daffodils can be used to create a woodland or meadow effect. Simply toss a handful of bulbs into a prepared planting area in order to create a more naturalistic design. Adjust the bulbs as needed so the center and one end of the bed are more densely planted, giving the effect that the bulbs have gradually spread from a single spot.

Daffodils are popular cut flowers as well. They’re fine when used alone in an arrangement, but they emit a fluid that will cause other flowers to wilt. If you’re using them in a mixed arrangement, soak them overnight in a separate vase or container before adding them in with the other flowers.

How to plant. Set bulbs, pointed ends up, into the soil two to three times as deep as they are tall, between 3 and 5 inches deep for smaller bulbs and up to 6 inches deep for larger ones. Be sure there will be at least 3 inches of soil over the bulbs in colder climates. Space smaller bulbs about three times their width when planting and larger ones at least 6 to 8 inches apart. If you want, you can add a small amount of bulb fertilizer around the bulbs at this time. Cover with soil, and water thoroughly.

Growing notes. Daffodils are easy to care for once they’re in the ground. Provide additional water in fall if it is dry and through the winter in drought-prone areas. Provide regular water if Mother Nature doesn’t while they are growing and when they’re in bloom. Keep watering until the leaves start to turn yellow; then stop.

Daffodils don’t need summer water. If they get much rain, be sure the soil drains well to prevent bulb rot and other problems.

You don’t need to fertilize bulbs. If you do want to give the blooms some extra help, top-dress the area around the bulbs with a 5-10-10 granular fertilizer when the leaves begin to emerge.

Deadhead the blooms once they’ve faded if you want, but keep the leaves in place. Remove the leaves once they’re completely yellow, lightly work the soil around the plants and then add mulch. You can also add a small amount of 5-10-10 fertilizer around the bulbs at this time if flower production is fading.

Divide only when flower production begins to falter. The best time to do this is right before the foliage completely yellows. Simply dig up the clumps and divide into smaller sections. Replant immediately, or store them in paper bags or ventilated sacks (nylons work well) in a cool, dry, airy spot out of the sun.

Pests are rare, but the narcissus bulb fly can be a problem. Don’t plant any bulbs that are soft or damaged, and cultivate and mulch after foliage dies down to prevent them from finding their way to the bulbs.

Container culture. Daffodils are standouts in containers. You can plant a single daffodil in a 1-gallon container, three to four in a 2-gallon container or masses of them in larger containers. Add potting soil to your container so the bulbs will sit at the same depth as they would in the garden. Rather than spacing them out, crowd the bulbs together to get a massed effect when they’re in bloom. Water thoroughly, and provide water throughout the fall and winter and into the growing season if you don’t get regular rain or snow cover.

In warmer-winter climates, keep the container outdoors and provide additional water if you don’t have enough rainfall. In cold-winter climates where containers are vulnerable, bring into a greenhouse or unheated garage or shed. Water regularly if they won’t receive regular moisture. Bring the containers to the foreground of your garden when they’re in bloom. (You can even sink them into the ground.)

For larger bulbs, one season in a container is all you can expect. Smaller ones, however, can last several years. If you want to keep them going, move containers to an out-of-the-way, sunny spot after the blooms fade. Once the leaves are yellowed, cut them off and add a 5-10-10 fertilizer around the bulbs. Cover with mulch. Begin watering again in fall as needed.",Your planting guide for beautiful yellow daffodils,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/04/your-planting-guide-for-beautiful-yellow-daffodils.html

The deal in question, which was previously reported, involved the 2010 approval of a partial sale of Canadian mining company Uranium One to Russia’s Rosatom nuclear company.
“Notably, in the same month as the Clinton speech, Uranium One and Rosatom notified CFIUS of the Russian government’s intent to acquire twenty percent of the United States’ uranium assets.
The next month, in July 2010, Renaissance Bank reportedly assigned Uranium One a ‘buy’ rating, a move that would principally benefit its Russian investors,” Grassley wrote.
But Grassley wants to know whether the committee that approved the transaction was aware of the ongoing criminal probe at the time.","A top Senate Republican is probing potential “conflicts of interest” for Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration regarding the 2010 approval of a controversial uranium deal with a Russian company, amid new details about donations from “interested parties” and an FBI corruption probe involving employees of the same Russian firm.

“This committee has an obligation to get to the bottom of this issue,” Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said Wednesday, at the start of a hearing with Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

The Hill reported a day earlier that the FBI had evidence as early as 2009 that Russian operatives used bribes, kickbacks and other dirty tactics to expand Moscow’s atomic energy footprint in the U.S. -- but the Obama administration approved the uranium deal benefiting Moscow anyway.

Grassley on Wednesday released a series of letters he fired off last week to 10 federal agencies, addressing those issues in detail and raising the question of whether the committee that approved the transaction was aware of the FBI probe. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) included then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

REPORT: RUSSIANS USED BRIBES, SOUGHT TO PAD CLINTON CHARITY AMID OBAMA-ERA PUSH TO EXPAND US NUCLEAR FOOTPRINT

Asked about the concerns at Wednesday’s hearing, Sessions told Grassley the Justice Department will take “appropriate” actions.

“I hear your concerns and they will be reviewed,” Sessions said, without responding directly to a question from Grassley on whether the Justice Department has also probed whether the Russians ""compromised"" the Obama administration to ""smooth the way"" for the deal.

“It wouldn’t be appropriate for me to comment on any ongoing investigation,” Sessions said.

The deal in question, which was previously reported, involved the 2010 approval of a partial sale of Canadian mining company Uranium One to Russia’s Rosatom nuclear company. The U.S. was involved because the sale gave the Russians control of part of the uranium supply in the U.S.

Grassley wrote in his letters that he’s not “convinced” by previous “assurances” that there were no unresolved national security concerns. Grassley, in his hearing remarks and letters, raised two key issues.

It had been previously reported that figures tied to the transaction gave donations to Bill Clinton and his family foundation, but Grassley wrote that he has learned additional details about a $500,000 fee the former president got from a Russian investment bank for a June 2010 speech. He wrote that the bank’s senior officers include former Russian intelligence personnel, and sources had described the company as an “extension” of the Russian government.

“Notably, in the same month as the Clinton speech, Uranium One and Rosatom notified CFIUS of the Russian government’s intent to acquire twenty percent of the United States’ uranium assets. The next month, in July 2010, Renaissance Bank reportedly assigned Uranium One a ‘buy’ rating, a move that would principally benefit its Russian investors,” Grassley wrote. “The donations raise concerns about potential conflicts of interest for Secretary Clinton and the Obama administration.”

Further, Grassley raised concerns about the FBI probe into “corruption and extortion” involving employees of a Rosatom subsidiary dating back to 2009 – before the 2010 approval.

As noted in The Hill, the feds did eventually go after Vadim Mikerin, a Russian nuclear industry official, in connection with the investigation. He was later sentenced, in 2015, to 48 months in prison in connection with money laundering allegations.

But Grassley wants to know whether the committee that approved the transaction was aware of the ongoing criminal probe at the time.

“The fact that Rosatom subsidiaries in the United States were under criminal investigation as a result of a U.S. intelligence operation apparently around the time CFIUS approved the Uranium One/Rosatom transaction raises questions about whether that information factored into CFIUS’ decision to approve the transaction,” Grassley wrote.

He said given that the deal resulted in a “Russian government takeover” of a chunk of U.S. uranium mining capacity, “very serious questions remain about the basis for the finding that this transaction did not threaten to impair U.S. national security.”

When details of the Uranium One deal first emerged in 2015, Clinton’s campaign downplayed the allegations.

""No one has produced a shred of evidence that Hillary Clinton ever took action as Secretary of State in order to support the interests of donors to the Clinton Foundation,"" a spokesman said at the time. ""To suggest the State Department, under then-Secretary Clinton, exerted undue influence in the U.S. government's review of the sale of Uranium One is utterly baseless.”

The bill requires pet stores to obtain the animals from “a public animal control agency or shelter, society for the prevention of cruelty to animals shelter, humane society shelter, or rescue group … that is in a cooperative agreement with at least one private or public shelter.”

The bill's passage makes California the first state to ban the sale of animals from so-called puppy mills or mass breeding facilities, according to the Associated Press.

Below are some some other things California has banned or might soon.

Plastic bags

California became the first state in the U.S. to ban single-use plastic bags in 2015, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune. Businesses that continue to offer the bags have to charge customers a fee.

Travel

California blocked state-funded travel to multiple states in June that had what the state attorney general considered anti-LGBT policies. Those states were: Alabama, Kentucky, South Dakota and Texas.

Non-essential state-funded travel was already banned from Kansas, Mississippi, North Carolina and Tennessee.

Certain pets

California bars the possession of certain “restricted animals” without a specific permit, including hamsters, ferrets and gerbils.

Hedgehogs, certain parakeets and piranhas are also banned from being kept as pets.

Cars with internal combustion engines

Cars with internal combustion engines could soon be banned in California.

Mary Nichols, the California Air Resources Board chair, told Bloomberg that Gov. Jerry Brown is interested in a potential ban. However, she said banning cars with internal combustion engines wouldn’t happen in the next 10 years.

Foie gras

California’s foie gras ban was reinstated in September by a federal appeals court. It found that a state law preventing sales of the food product made by force-feeding ducks and geese was not preempted by federal authority to regulate poultry products.

The ban was signed into law in 2004 after proponents said the process of fattening the birds’ livers was cruel and inhumane. The law took effect in 2012, but was blocked by a court in 2015, delighting chefs who wanted to serve it.

The decision won’t immediately go into effect.

Attendees of the show were blasting the venue on Facebook and Twitter Friday morning, posting videos of Brooks playing with a significant echo that frustrated fans. Some fans who were sitting close to the stage reportedly left early.

“We sprung a couple hundred bucks to see Garth Brooks at the heavily advertised, much anticipated, and [first ever], concert at this stadium,” a fan wrote in a 1-star review on Mercedes-Benz Stadium’s Facebook page. “We sat in section 125, and we could not hear one word that Garth or Trisha [Yearwood] said or sang.

The show was being filmed and recorded for a future Brooks live album release.

The Latest on Kenya's new presidential election (all times local):

4:40 p.m.

The head of Kenya's election commission says that despite ""full technical preparedness"" for this month's fresh presidential vote, it is ""difficult to guarantee free, fair and credible elections.""

Wafula Chebukati spoke to reporters hours after a top Kenyan electoral official, Roselyn Akombe, resigned and said the vote just eight days away ""cannot meet the basic expectations of a credible election.""

Kenya's Supreme Court last month nullified the August election in which President Uhuru Kenyatta was declared the winner, citing irregularities. It ordered a new election, which will be Oct. 26.

Opposition leader Raila Odinga, whose legal challenge of vote-rigging led to the ruling, last week withdrew from the new election because electoral reforms had not been made.

___

6:50 a.m.

A Kenyan electoral commissioner has announced her resignation and says the presidential vote just eight days away cannot credibly proceed as planned.

Roselyne Akombe spoke Wednesday from New York but it was not clear if she had fled there.

She says the electoral commissioners need to be brave and speak up because the new presidential elections scheduled on Oct. 26 cannot meet the basic expectations of credibility.

She said electoral staffers are getting last-minute instructions on changes in technology and electronic transmission of results.

Kenya's Supreme Court nullified President Uhuru Kenyatta's August re-election citing illegalities and irregularities.

Opposition leader Raila Odinga had petitioned the court to overturn the result, claiming hackers infiltrated the commission servers and altered the results in favor of Kenyatta.",The Latest: Kenya vote chief: Credible election 'difficult',https://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/10/18/latest-kenya-vote-chief-credible-election-difficult.html

“I go with [President] Trump on this one,” Hanson told Fox News on Tuesday. “If you want to protest, that’s not the place to do it.”

He added: “A lot of people died over our flag. We’re able to voice our opinion because of it. If you’re going to show respect for anything, do it for the national anthem.”

Hanson has a track record of designing and digging massive messages – many political – using his old Massey tractor on his 850-acre farm.

And Hanson doesn’t use GPS or any technology for the work, which he says “works out pretty good in a harvested bean field.”

Then he flies his two-seater plane, and if his design passes the test, he snaps a pic with a Cannon camera and posts it on Facebook. He said he's only been unsuccessful twice.

Hanson told Fox News he got his “We Stand for the National Anthem” message right on the second try. During the first attempt, he was interrupted by a passerby with only two letters to go. He soon relocated to another section of the field.

Hanson said he initially wanted to add an addendum -- “We kneel at the cross” -- but the plan was foiled by the first frost of the season.

Hanson said, weather permitting, he plans to add that phrase soon.

Hanson and his wife, Darlene, are Lutherans and attend church regularly. He also describes himself as a Republican and Trump supporter, and he had the chance to get a picture of the president when Trump came to North Dakota for a tax reform speech in September.

“I was 20 feet away from him,” Hanson said. “It was a good meeting and the president stayed on script.”

Hanson said he believes Trump is trying to do well, but faces a “continuous battle” in Washington, D.C. And Hanson said he's doing all he can to send his support from his Edgeley farm.

Some of his previous messages include “Drain the Swamp,” “Blue Lives Matter,” “Feel the Bern,” “GOP, get your act together,” and “Vote Trump.”

He said his Prince symbol, plowed after the singer passed away, was one of his most popular for fans all over the world, but he caught a lot of flak for his “Never Hillary” message.

“We’ll dispatch our drones to pick up the order from our partners’ loading sites and then transport and deliver the goods to testers at their residences,” Burgess said.

Burgess said the tests are being conducted in the community because residents often drive an average of 40 minutes round-trip to the grocery stores, restaurants or coffee shops. Drones can also help deliver medical and food supplies to these rural communities when there are floods, or where fires have cut off transportation.

The tests will help Project Wing to determine what are the best areas and options to drop the items safety to residents.

“We want to learn how much notice to give them for a drone’s arrival so that they can cook, pack, and load it in one well-timed workflow,” Burgess said.

Timothy Sprenger, 31, was arrested Sept. 22 after a detective with the Paulding County Sheriff’s Office in Georgia met with someone in June “who presented what appeared to be a diary created by suspect Timothy Sprenger,” MDJ Online reported.

The diary had been ripped up and taped back together, according to the report. It allegedly contained a number of sexual encounters Sprenger had with children, ranging from 6 months to 2 years old.

“After further examination of the document, it appeared that these incidents occurred several years ago in North Dakota,” Sgt. Ashley Henson told the news outlet.

All five of the victims are believed to have been employees of Advance Granite Solutions, according to Gahler.

Police believe Prince is ""associated"" with the business, but were not sure of his employment status. The owner of Advanced Granite Solutions, a home improvement company, told the Associated Press in a brief phone interview Prince has been an employee for four months, and was a machine operator.

Barak Caba was shaken and would not provide additional details, according to the AP.

Daniel Rushing, 64, sued the city of Orlando after he was arrested in December 2015 on drug charges. Law enforcement had spotted four small flakes of glaze on his floorboard and thought they were pieces of crystal methamphetamine.

Rushing told the officers they were likely bits of the Krispy Kreme doughnut he’d eaten earlier, but he was arrested for possession of methamphetamine after two roadside drug tests tested positive for an illegal substance.

""I couldn’t believe it,” Rushing told the Orlando Sentinel. “I’ve never even smoked a cigarette before, let alone meth.”

Weeks later, a state crime lab cleared Rushing of the drug allegations and charges against him were dropped.

Rushing, a retiree from the Orlando Parks Departments, received a check for $37,500 last week and told the Sentinel he’s pleased with the outcome of his case.

Cpl. Shelby Riggs-Hopkins wrote in a Dec. 11 arrest report that she noticed flakes on Rushing’s floorboard. The police department at the time said the arrest was lawful and didn’t explain why the glaze tested positive for amphetamine in both field tests.

Riggs-Hopkins was given a written reprimand for making an improper arrest, and the Orlando Police Department ended up training more than 730 officers on how to properly use field-test kits.

Now, if you’re like me, you probably have always assumed that boys would tend to join the Boy Scouts and girls would tend to gravitate to the Girl Scouts.
And trust me, they don’t feel triggered by the idea that they can’t join the Girl Scouts.
Are there a significant number of girls who feel outraged over not being part of the Boy Scouts?
Apparently the leadership of the Girl Scouts isn’t inclined to think that there’s a growing demand by girls to be Boy Scouts.","Sitting at my usual corner table in the back of Buzzy’s 8-Ball Tavern and Pool Room, It occurred to me on Thursday night that there are any number of serious issues and current crisis that we could talk about for this week’s dispatch from the front lines.

But setting all those issues aside, let me tell you something that may have escaped your attention while you’ve been busy digging a backyard bomb shelter or getting up to speed on which starlets haven’t been groped by Weinstein. Apparently, and I did not see this coming, the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) leadership has decided to open the Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts to, wait for it… girls.

Now, if you’re like me, you probably have always assumed that boys would tend to join the Boy Scouts and girls would tend to gravitate to the Girl Scouts. Boys whittled wood into sharp, pointy things and set fire to stuff, while girls generated an incredible amount of revenue selling delicious cookies. I’m particularly fond of Samoas.

My oldest boy Scooter is in the Cub Scouts, and I can vouch for the fact that he and his Den cohorts love to whittle. They can take a 400 pound oak log and turn it into a sharp, pointy twig in less time than it takes to whistle the theme to ""The Andy Griffith Show."" To be honest, they’re a pack of smelly, loud boys with a remarkable ability to recite the entire Scout oath while actually burping. I can see why girls would be clamoring to join.

In reality, most are not. And the Girl Scouts of America, which after taking into account global cookie sales, I believe is the country’s 7th largest corporation, have criticized what they see as a blatant effort to increase membership dues by the BSA. Membership numbers are down in general for youth groups across America so this may be less about gender and more about dough. Which reminds me, I also like the Thin Mints.

Back in August of this year, the president of the Girl Scouts sent a letter to the BSA president stating “…I formally request that your organization stay focused on serving the 90 per cent of American boys not currently participating in Boy Scouts… and not consider expanding to recruit girls.” That, my friends, is how you win a merit badge for subtle insult.

At this point, It would be fairly easy to morph this into a high brow column about gender fluidity and the need to be considerate over what pronouns someone uses when referring to their particular identification. Or perhaps turn to the subject of gender equality and how girls and boys are really no different and so no association or organization should exclude one or the other.

But I’m a guy, raising a houseful of little guys, and so my thinking isn’t particularly complicated. I’m guessing the BSA’s decision is partly driven by a need for additional revenue, as suggested by the Girl Scouts leadership, and likely in part out of concern that they might be sued by some overly sensitive soul who wants to prove a point that most folks really don’t care about.

I admit to being a bit old fashioned. Believing that there’s a place for a Boy Scouts organization and a Girl Scouts organization that focus on their respective genders doesn’t make me a misogynist or a sexist or anything else ending in “ist” or even an “ism.” I happen to believe that there’s value and benefit in girls having their own space and boys having their own space on occasion…as long as they offer equal space and opportunity.

I know that Scooter and his pals at their current stage of life would prefer to keep the “no girls allowed” sign on their clubhouse door. And trust me, they don’t feel triggered by the idea that they can’t join the Girl Scouts. Give them a couple years and they’ll see things differently…they may even realize girls don’t find it attractive when you make farting noises. Although to be fair, I didn’t have that epiphany until my mid 20s.

Are there a significant number of girls who feel outraged over not being part of the Boy Scouts? I would have done that research but it seems like a lot of work and I’ve been busy whittling.

Apparently the leadership of the Girl Scouts isn’t inclined to think that there’s a growing demand by girls to be Boy Scouts. For their part, the BSA leadership claims the change was designed to provide more options for parents. According to BSA’s Chief Scout Executive, “We believe it is critical to evolve how our programs meet the needs of families interested in positive and lifelong experiences for their children.”

So there you have it. Sally can now be a Cub Scout. And soon, Sally can join the Boy Scouts and eventually earn the coveted Eagle Scout award. I haven’t raised this development with Scooter yet. He may or may not care, it’s hard to tell what a 10-year-old boy’s response will be. But I’ll bet you a box of cookies there’ll be a fart noise involved.",There’s a place for Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts.

A study from analysts at KeyBanc Capital Markets says Apple's iPhone 7 models are actually outselling the iPhone 8. In a note to investors KeyBanc's John Vinh said that ""a meaningful portion of customers are buying iPhone 7 in lieu of the iPhone 8."" He attributed the buying decisions to the iPhone 8's ""lack of significant enhancements.""

However, Apple's iPhone 8 might also see its sales stymied by its iPhone X, a smartphone that will be launching next month and has prompted some customers to hold off on buying a new iPhone until it's available, the analyst said.

Apple announced the iPhone 8 and iPhone X at a press event last month. While the company did its best to pitch the iPhone 8 as a desirable option, featuring an enhanced glass design, superfast A11 Bionic processor, and new wireless charging, customers seem to be more interested in the iPhone X. Apple's iPhone X offers a boatload of enhancements, including an all-new design, the first OLED display from Apple, and a new facial-scanning feature called Face ID.

Historically, iPhones have sold out rather quickly when offered for pre-order. Last month when the iPhone 8 was offered, however, many units were still available. There were also units readily available on its launch day. It was the first time Apple hasn't been hit with widespread sellouts of new handsets.

But perhaps it's not all Apple's fault. Vinh, whose comments were earlier reported on by Reuters, said that carriers have also been less willing to offer promotions on the iPhone 8 than they were on the iPhone 7. Customer concerns, coupled with pricing considerations, might be pushing people to the iPhone 7, which is still a fine option in today's market, and it's more affordable.

It was part of James Nifong's study on whether American alligators on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts eat sharks, and the answer might surprise you: yes.

The small variety, that is, but a press release calls it the ""first scientific documentation of a widespread interaction between the two predators."" In fact, the Kansas State University researcher tells National Geographic that when he first broached with alligator experts the question of whether alligators eat sharks, some of them thought he was kidding.

Nifong wasn't, and he found that in addition to the expected prey—crustaceans, fish, and wading birds, per his study in Southeastern Naturalist—he documented alligators eating a lemon shark, a nurse shark, and a bonnethead shark, along with an Atlantic stingray.

This though they're freshwater creatures; Nifong explains it's not uncommon for sharks to enter freshwater, where ""opportunistic alligators"" then pounce. GPS trackers also found the gators wade into estuaries where the two types of water mix, and where shark nurseries can be found.

But it may be a two-way street. Says Nifong, it's ""really about size dynamic. If a small shark swims by an alligator and the alligator feels like it can take the shark down, it will, but we also reviewed some old stories about larger sharks eating smaller alligators."" (An alligator was involved in this strange animal skirmish.)

The system uses a camera and radar to allow a vehicle to steer itself in the middle of a lane on the highway, while maintaining a safe distance from the vehicle in front of it. Nissan expects around 30 percent of Rogues sold next year to be equipped with the feature.

Unlike some competing systems, ProPilot Assist isn’t meant for anything resembling hands-off driving. It’s only there to make your life easier and safer, especially if you’re flaking out, hence the “Assist” part of the name. If it senses you’ve let go of the wheel, alarms will start going off within about 10 seconds with increasing urgency until you grab it again. If not, the system will slowly shut itself down and bring the vehicle to a stop in the lane it is currently driving in with the hazard lights on.

I recently had the opportunity to take a prototype Rogue fitted with ProPilot Assist on a short drive in New York City. It quickly locks onto lane markers and engages, but needs two well-defined lines to work. Faded paint will cause it to deactivate, as will the veering lines at exit ramps. It’s at its best in a center lane, where it holds itself dead center, even through wide radius curves. If they're too tight for the speed the vehicle is traveling at, ProPilot Assist will alert the driver to take back full control.

More impressive than its lane-keeping ability is the adaptive cruise control component of the system. This isn’t a new concept, but many cars so equipped apply the brakes abruptly when the car they’re following slows down or one pulls into their lane, often jarring passengers. ProPilot Assist has the same smooth touch as a very alert driver, and works in stop-and-go traffic, as long as the vehicle doesn’t stay stationary for very long.

Overall, ProPilot Assist is a step behind similar systems that Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, Cadillac and Volvo currently offer, but is far ahead of anything available from Nissan's peers in the mainstream automotive segment. Nissan has sketched out a roadmap toward a fully autonomous car by 2022, however, so the abilities of its technology should increase quickly and dramatically in the coming years.

But when Weinstein heard about the lyrics to the song, and his first name was included, one source said, “Harvey went bananas and insisted Del Rey change the lyrics, which she did, removing Harvey’s name, so the line now goes, “Ah he’s in the sky with diamonds and he’s making me crazy.”

Weinstein later got Del Rey to do a song for his 2014 movie “Big Eyes.”

In a column titled “All The Other Harvey Weinsteins” published in The New Yorker, Ringwald revealed the sexual harassments and assault she endured in Hollywood was “enough to feel a sickening shock of recognition.”

“When I was 13, a 50-year-old crew member told me that he would teach me to dance, and then proceeded to push against me with an erection. When I was 14, a married film director stuck his tongue in my mouth on set,” the actress recalled.

She added, “At a time when I was trying to figure out what it meant to become a sexually viable young woman, at every turn some older guy tried to help speed up the process.”

Ringwald said the harassment continued into her 20s, when she was forced to put a dog collar on during an audition. She noted it was the closest she’s come to having an “out-of-body experience” and cried in the parking lot. Ringwald credited her “protective parents” for keeping her grounded despite the horrific experiences during the early years of her career. Shortly after the “dog collar” audition, Ringwald moved to Paris.

But even abroad, she couldn’t escape the harassment. In an article with Movieline, Jeffrey Katzenberg, is quoted saying: “I wouldn’t know [Molly Ringwald] if she sat on my face.”

Katzenberg told The Hollywood Reporter in a statement on Tuesday that he was “deeply, deeply sorry” and the quote is “horrifying, mortifying and embarrassing” to him.

The “Breakfast Club” actress said Weinstein never sexually abused her, as others have claimed, but she thought he was “volatile” during their encounter when she was 20 years old.

“When we began filming, in France, I was warned about the producer [Weinstein], but I had never heard of him and had no reason to fear him,” Ringwald wrote. “The feeling on the set was that he and his brother Bob were becoming powerful and were difficult to work with, and that it was inadvisable to cross them.”

""Stories like these have never been taken seriously."" - Molly Ringwald in The New Yorker

Ringwald said she, Weinstein, and her British coworkers went to dinner where the movie mogul made a crude joke.

“There was a tense, awkward moment when Harvey became testy toward our British co-workers and accused them of thinking of us Americans as just the ‘little guys in the colonies,’” Ringwald recalled.

“It was sort of meant as a joke, I suppose, but it made everyone cringe, and all I could think was that the guy was volatile,” she said, adding that she now feels “lucky” to not have been harassed or assaulted by Weinstein.

Ringwald also described working with Weinstein on a film he eventually renamed “Strike it Rich” that “tanked” in theaters. She ended up suing the producer for failing to pay her the percentage she earned in the film.

The actress added she never told her stories of dealing with harassment in the entertainment industry because they “have never been taken seriously.""

“I never talked about these things publicly because, as a woman, it has always felt like I may as well have been talking about the weather,” she said.

According to his Facebook page, Gonzalez is a talk show host and an investigator at Paranormal Central, in addition to being a technician at AT&T. He also founded the Sanger Paranormal Society.

Gonzalez said that the sighting is not that uncommon, with three additional Bigfoot sightings in the past five years, all located in East Fresno County.

“I would have never guessed in a million years that you would have told me there were Bigfoot on Shields or Ashlan Avenue. Right? So, I want to know what’s going on. Is this for real?” Gonzalez added.

Parents told the Todd Starnes Show that one of the workshop leaders announced to the children, “I’m queer and I’m Trump’s worst enemy.”

An untold number of students were directed by workshop leaders to separate themselves intro groups based on their sexual identity and their religious preference.

Parents told the Todd Starnes Show they are livid over the September event.

“I’m sending my daughter to school to get an education, not to learn about the LGBTQ community,” one parent said.

Superintendent J.T. Stroder told the Todd Starnes Show the presentations were made to the entire student body during English class by poets connected to Moab Pride, a local LGBT organization.

“There were some inappropriate examples used in those presentations – asking students to identify certain things about themselves that is protected by law,” the superintendent admitted.

He sent a letter to parents detailing his concerns about what happened at the high school.

“I would not expect an exercise in which individual students are asked to reveal their sexual orientation and gender identity to be part of the English curriculum,” he wrote. “In this case, there was no parent notification that topics relating to sexuality would be discussed outside the approved health curriculum, which was not acceptable.”

Parents want to know why the Moab Pride group was allowed inside the high school and why teachers did not intervene when the group began to solicit personal information from the children.

“I really don’t have an explanation,” the superintendent said. “It caught the school off guard.”

One parent, who asked not to be identified, told me students were divided up by religion, sexual preference and political views.

“Their intention was to plant seeds in the high school. They were trying to indoctrinate the kids. When you have people saying ‘I’m a queer and it’s okay. I’m a lesbian and it’s okay’ – I mean – that’s indoctrination,” the parent told me.

As for the workshop where kids were forced to engage in identity mapping?

“I don’t know what that means,” the superintendent said.

Regardless, the school district said the presenters will not be invited back to the school.

“Every child that walks into that school has to feel safe no matter what their religious views are or their sexual preference,” a parent said. “Instead of it being anti-bullying, the workshops directly pointed them out.”

Pots and pans sure look gleaming and gorgeous coming out of the box, but after years of spaghetti dinners, roast chickens and holiday feasts, a well-used cookware arsenal is bound to show its age. Make your sauté pans, stockpots and skillets worthy of the hanging pot rack once again with a little elbow grease and a couple of easy-to-find, mild cleaning products (including ketchup, of all things) — and learn how keep the glow once you've got it back.

Below you'll find daily care and stain removal tips for cookware made of stainless steel, copper, enameled cast iron and more.

Good practices for all cookware. No matter the type of cookware, it is best to wash it as soon as possible after cooking (cleaning as you go is ideal), and use the least abrasive cleaning method you can. Washing by hand is always preferable, even for pots and pans that claim to be dishwasher safe. Washing by hand will prevent the scratches and discoloration that can happen in a dishwasher over time.

The tips and techniques that follow are good general guidelines, but you may also want to check the manufacturer's suggestions. If your cookware is under warranty, using the wrong cleaning product can void your agreement, so it pays to do your homework.

Stainless Steel

Everyday care: Ideally, wash your stainless steel pots and pans by hand soon after use, using regular dish soap. That said, stainless steel pans are one of the few types that can handle a trip through the dishwasher — so if you are in a rush, don't worry about tossing it in with the dishes. Regular cleaning in the dishwasher may create spots or a cloudy surface.

Stain removal: To brighten up cloudy or spotty stainless steel, rub the surface with a rag dampened with white vinegar. To treat stains on the bottom of the pan caused by high heat, sprinkle a gentle scouring powder (like Barkeeper's Friend) on a wet sponge or rag to create a paste, and rub it onto the stained area. Rinse with water.

Copper

Everyday care: Wash copper pots and pans by hand, using warm, soapy water.

Stain removal: Bring that lustrous finish back to discolored copper by covering your pan with ketchup (yes, ketchup) or lemon. Let the ketchup sit on your pan for at least 10 minutes, then rub the discoloration away with a rag or sponge. Rinse clean with warm water.

Enameled Cast Iron

Everyday care: Allow the pan to cool before washing it — a sudden temperature change may crack the enamel. Soak the pan in warm water first, then use a soft sponge and a mild dishwashing detergent to clean it. Do not use abrasive scrubbing pads, as they can damage the enamel finish.

Stain removal: Treat discoloration on the outside of the pan using a mild scouring powder, like Barkeeper's Friend. For tough stains on the inside surface, fill the pan with white vinegar and water and bring to a boil on the stovetop. Turn off the heat and let the pan soak with the vinegar solution, then wash as usual.

Hard Anodized Aluminum

Everyday care: Allow the pan to cool completely before washing it, and never place a hot pan in cold water, which can cause warping. Wash by hand, using a mild dishwashing detergent and warm water — putting your hard anodized pans in the dishwasher may void your warranty.

Stain removal: For stains on the outside only, use a paste of baking soda or a mild scouring powder, like Barkeeper's Friend. Rinse with warm water.

Nonstick

Everyday care: Use low to medium heat only — higher temperatures can permanently damage nonstick pans. Wash promptly with a soft sponge and warm, soapy water. If scratches or flakes begin to appear on the nonstick surface of your pan, recycle or toss it immediately. Otherwise those flakes will end up in your food ... not something you want to happen!

Stain removal: On the outside only, try using a paste of Barkeeper's Friend or a similar scouring powder.

Cast Iron

Initial seasoning: When you buy a new cast iron pan, wash it by hand in warm, soapy water. Dry the pan with a towel, then put it in a 300-degree oven for about five minutes to dry it completely — even a bit of remaining moisture can cause rust to form on cast iron pans. Next, using a paper towel, rub about a tablespoon of olive or vegetable oil over the surface of the pan, inside and out. Wipe away excess oil — you are aiming for a thin coat. Put the pan in a 300-degree oven for an hour, let it cool, then rub it all over with a clean rag.

Everyday care: Never use soap on your cast iron pan. Promptly after each use, wipe out the pan using a paper towel and a bit of oil. If food is stuck on, run the pan under hot water and scrub the food off with a soft brush or plastic scouring pad — remember, no soap! Soap will remove the seasoning, which is what creates that wonderful nonstick surface.

Stain removal and long-term care: For really tough, stuck-on food, boil water in your pan on the stovetop for a few minutes, then clean it as usual. Reseasoning occasionally will help maintain the finish.

Clay Pot

Everyday care: Most clay pots must be soaked in water for 15 to 30 minutes before each use. Always place your clay pot in a cold oven so the pot can come up to temperature gradually.

As reported by sources for the New York Post, the Obamas are apparently waiting for 10 Gracie Square’s housing board to approve the purchase of a unit in the building, which has been home to such famous folks as Gloria Vanderbilt, Anderson Cooper, and former first lady of China Madame Chiang Kai-shek — but it’s also got quite a tragic past, the Post reports.

SEE THE NYC TOWNHOUSE WHERE OBAMA LIVED AFTER COLLEGE

The building has been the site of two very high-profile suicides in the last 30 years, which is enough to make even a New York City real-estate agent think twice about living there.

“I don’t know of any buildings with two suicides,” said Dolly Lenz, CEO of Dolly Lenz Real Estate, in a statement to the New York Post. “It almost says that there is a cloud on the building.”

The first victim of these tragedies was Carter Cooper, the 23-year-old son of Gloria Vanderbilt and the older brother of CNN anchor Anderson Cooper. According to reports, Carter was acting strangely in the months leading up to his suicide, but had been in therapy. Then, on July 22, 1988, during a visit to his mother’s home, he abruptly ran out onto the terrace of his Vanderbilt’s two-story penthouse apartment, hopped over the ledge, and dangled there before letting himself drop from the 14th floor — all while Vanderbilt watched from feet away.

""He let go, and there was a moment when I thought I was going to jump over after him,” Vanderbilt remembered during a 2011 appearance of Anderson Cooper’s talk series.

In Vanderbilt’s 1997 book, “A Mother’s Story,” she also alleged that Carter’s suicide may have triggered by an allergy to medication.

The second, much more recent suicide at 10 Grace Square took place in April 2017, and claimed the life of author, heiress and socialite Jean Stein. Stein, whose works include “Edie: An American Girl” and “West of Eden,” had reportedly been suffering from depression, according to her daughter Katrina vanden Heuvel, and jumped from the 15th floor of the building on April 30, the New York Times reported in its obituary.

A fellow resident who witnessed the suicide has said it was a messy one, as Stein “miscalculated” the jump and landed an eighth-floor terrace. She had also severed her leg in the fall, according to reports.

10 Gracie Square, however, is also infamous for more than these two suicides: In 1982, it was also where sixth-floor resident Frances Schreuder was arrested for conspiring with her son Marco to kill Schreuder’s father, wealthy Utah businessman Franklin Bradshaw.

Schreuder had reportedly been unhappy with the amount of money Bradshaw was allotting her, and persuaded her then-17-year-old son to shoot his grandfather dead in 1978. He was eventually caught, and Schreuder was nabbed while trying to escape out the window of her 10 Gracie Square abode. She was later convicted of capital murder, and served 13 years before being released.

Hayward, who signed a four-year, $128 million free agent contract this summer, went up for an alley-oop pass midway through the first quarter and collided with LeBron James. Hayward's leg twisted underneath him as he came back to the floor. The 27-year-old collapsed under the basket and looked in horror as his left foot was pointing outward.

He put his hands to his face and dropped back to the floor as a hush fell over the charged sellout crowd inside Quicken Loans Arena, which had come to boo Kyrie Irving in his return to Cleveland after being traded to Boston this summer.

Hayward's new teammates huddled in prayer at their bench as a distressed James covered his mouth and several Cleveland players nearby looked away. Hayward had his leg placed in an air cast, and James came over and consoled him before the he was pushed from the floor on a stretcher and taken for treatment.

Cleveland's crowd gave Hayward a roaring ovation as he left.

The Celtics later confirmed that Hawyard's left ankle was broken. It's a devastating blow for the Celtics, who had overhauled their roster with the signing of Hayward and acquisition of Irving in hopes of closing the gap on the Cavs in the Eastern Conference.

Now, they will be without Hayward for an extended period as he will likely need surgery and a lengthy rehabilitation.

He continued, “Spike was the wrong boyfriend. Spike was not ready for Buffy during the run of the show. He was way below her and because the reaction was so strong … they had to do something dramatic to prove that wasn’t true.”

The move, which became one of the show’s biggest controversies, came in the sixth season of the series when Spike attempts to rape Buffy in the bathroom of her home before she fights him off.

“It was the hardest day of my professional career. It was a horrible day,” Marsters told us. “I personally don’t like to watch that stuff. I will not go to a movie if I know that’s in there. I will turn the TV off if it pops up. I will pass on auditions if thats what they want me to do, but I was contracted to do it.”

“She went to his apartment and was convinced if they made love one more time that everything would be fine,” he explained. “He had to physically push her off and that just crushed her and stuck with her all her life.”

The actor says he has no regrets about doing the scene and despite the mixed reviews, it set Spike up for his “journey toward redemption.”

Frida, the beloved Labrador rescue dog, has been dispatched to Mexico City to help search for survivors caught in the rubble, the Los Angeles Times reported.

The brave pooch is part of the Mexican Navy’s Canine Unit. Frida, 7, has been credited with finding 52 people - 12 alive – in her career. The dog has been dispatched to a few natural disasters, including the aftermath of an earthquake in Ecuador in 2016.

So far 15 dogs have been stationed to search for bodies in the capital but Frida has quite a following. The Mexican Navy tweeted a series of photos of Frida, which garnered over 8,000 likes on Twitter.

Bruce Hornsby could be heard at Key West’s Mallory Square as a “reclamation party” got underway, Thursday afternoon. The feeling was positive and the outlook was bright.

Hours later, Key West Mayor Craig Cates came in to Two Friends Patio Restaurant for dinner, as nearby Duval Street began to show signs of life.

“Key West is going to be open for business soon,” said Cates.

When asked about the higher volume of people out and about, the mayor replied, “Well, we’re taking visitors now. We haven’t advertised yet,” he said.

Cates, however, pointed out that the hardest hit parts of the Keys are still picking up the pieces from Irma’s devastation. “We understand our neighbors to the north in the Florida Keys got more damage than us,” he said.

In nearby Big Pine Key, the cleanup is still ongoing.

Among those cleaning up are 85-year-old Wes Harris and his wife. “We’ve been married 63 years,” he said.

The couple rode out the storm near their now beat-up home.

The wheelchair ramp into Harris’ home was just recently repaired by first responders, but there’s still so much more to do.

“See that rock? You see how big that rock is?” Harris said as he pointed to a large boulder in his yard. “That’s not my rock. I don’t know where the hell it came from.”

The legally blind U.S. Army veteran, who suffers from spinal stenosis, lost his orchid ranch, which he says had between 7,000 and 8,000 flowers.

Harris is so tough that the idea of getting a little emotional over the relief effort in the aftermath of the storm makes him annoyed.

“I just can’t believe how everybody has helped. It’s absolutely unbelievable,” Harris said.

Harris’ post-storm story isn’t necessarily unique. Residents told 7News about problems with their house, their boat, or in some cases, both.

Big names also came to help out the Keys, in the form of former football player Tim Tebow and U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.

“So many people are so tough, and what they’ve gone through,” said Tebow. “You know what’s even more special? So many people, who don’t know what’s even going on with their houses, but they’re still volunteering for other people that need help.”

Residents appreciated Tebow’s visit. “He’s such a huge model for me, so it’s a nice thing that he came down here to the Keys,” said one woman.

7News cameras captured Rubio posing for pictures, as food, ice and relief supplies got to those in need.

When asked what he would say to those residents who fear they may be forgotten, Rubio responded: “They won’t be forgotten by us — I don’t know if someone else will — primarily because we’ve spent a lot of time, personally, in the Keys, up and down this place. I mean my family, we’ve had so many incredible memories here. We want to see the Keys come back.”

Meanwhile, Harris indicated he will make it through that strong current called adversity, probably because of his big heart. “You’ve got to keep stroking, bud. That’s all you can do,” he said.

As the reclamation party begins in Key West, many residents feel that, because the cleanup is still underway, the party is happening too soon. however, others feel that it needs to happen to show that the Florida Keys are still alive.

Officials said tourism will return to Key West in a limited capacity on Sunday with the arrival of a cruise ship at the Margaritaville Pier. It is scheduled to arrive at noon.

“Here’s why Obama stays quiet as Trump attacks his legacy” is the headline on a CNN story that ran over the weekend. The author of the article, Byron Wolf, explains why the former President has generally refrained from commenting on the political news of the day. But another report out of Washington raises new questions about why Mr. Obama has remained silent on one issue in particular.

“With each passing day, President Donald Trump unravels another piece of Barack Obama’s legacy,” writes Mr. Wolf. “And yet Obama watches from the sidelines, mostly silent, as Trump punches holes in the dry wall of his freshly finished legacy.”

Presidents traditionally try to avoid criticizing their successors. Mr. Obama suggested before leaving office that he would only comment publicly when “core values may be at stake.” Since leaving the White House he has occasionally addressed issues of federal policy including immigration, health care and climate change. But Mr. Obama has had little or nothing to say about the issue that has so fascinated many of his fellow Democrats: the claim that Donald Trump somehow colluded with the Russians to rig the 2016 election.

This column noted in April that Mr. Obama’s decision not to address the issue in his post-presidency was fairly strong circumstantial evidence that, having had unparalleled access to the relevant intelligence, he didn’t think there was anything to it. After all, if our former commander-in-chief believed that a foreign government had essentially staged a silent coup in the United States, how could this not rise to the level of a threat to core values?

A report today in The Hill suggests that Mr. Obama may not simply have concluded that there was nothing to the allegations against the Trump campaign. He may have also decided that a close inspection of U.S.-Russian relations would not be kind to the Obama Administration--and especially to its State Department during the early years of his presidency.",When Obama Speaks: There's One Topic That Never Seems to Come Up ...,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/10/18/when-obama-speaks-theres-one-topic-never-seems-come#commenting

What Tyerell Przybycien is charged with doing instead: helping her set up and carry out her suicide, the Daily Herald reports. On Tuesday, a 4th District Court judge ruled there was ""reasonable belief"" that enough evidence exists to send the Spanish Fork man to trial for Jchandra's death, charging him with first-degree murder and failure to report a dead body, both felonies.

If convicted, he could face 15 years to life in prison. In court documents cited in the Washington Post, prosecutors say when Jchandra told Przybycien of her plans, the 18-year-old texted another friend to ask what he should do, and the friend told him he should persuade her otherwise.

Przybycien, however, reportedly had the reverse reaction. ""It be awesome,"" he texted back, noting he wanted to help her carry out her plan. ""Like getting away with murder."" Those records also detail Przybycien's alleged role, including mapping out Jchandra's suicide, picking her up from work May 5, and buying rope and compressed air.

He's then accused of taking Jchandra to the Maple Lake Campground in Payson, setting up a noose for her, and filming her as she inhaled the compressed air, passed out, and fell off a wooden pedestal, hanging herself in the process.

The Salt Lake Tribune has reported he also provided running commentary through the video found on her cellphone, including noting at one point: ""That's when the brain stops getting oxygen."" Przybycien's lawyer argues his client didn't actually carry out the actions that killed her, but Judge James Brady says Przybycien's help was a ""substantial factor"" in her death.

Przybycien's arraignment is set for Oct. 24. (Radio host Delilah revealed the contents of her son's ""goodbye note."")

So, where does the Galaxy S7 Edge out Apple's iPhone 8?
One other tidbit: Samsung's Galaxy Note 8 is actually placed below the iPhone 8 with a score of 80.","Consumer Reports has some bad news for Apple: Samsung's flagship handsets are better options. Even models that are much older.

In a new rating Consumer Reports has released, the testing organization has awarded the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ scores of 81 out of a possible 100, topping the iPhone 8's score of 80. What's worse, despite receiving the same score, Consumer Reports actually recommends the Galaxy S7, with its own score of 80, over Apple's new handsets.

Apple unveiled the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus at a press event last month. Since then, the company's smartphone has been called into question by industry pundits who wonder if it's having trouble attracting customers. In fact, one recent report says the iPhone 7 is outselling the new iPhone 8.

After its release last month, Apple's iPhone 8 units were still readily available on store shelves — a phenomenon that we hadn't seen in previous generations. That was followed by reports that the iPhone 8 wasn't selling nearly as well as Apple had planned, and bolstered by reports that customers instead were waiting on the iPhone X.

For its part, Apple hasn't commented much on the iPhone 8's success, or lack thereof, and the company typically doesn't break out sales by device type.

Consumer Reports has long been one of the most trusted services for consumers to determine which products they should buy. That the publication prefers not only Apple's biggest competitor this year, but also the smartphone Samsung launched last year, is notable.

So, where does the Galaxy S7 Edge out Apple's iPhone 8? According to Consumer Reports, the Galaxy S7's ""handset capabilities"" are slightly better than those in the iPhone 8, and it found Samsung's handset to offer better battery life and call quality.

One other tidbit: Samsung's Galaxy Note 8 is actually placed below the iPhone 8 with a score of 80. LG's G6 is the only other handset to reach a score of 80 in the Consumer Reports testing.",Old Galaxy S7 beats iPhone 8 in new report,https://www.foxnews.com/tech/2017/10/18/old-galaxy-s7-beats-iphone-8-in-new-report.html

U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John J. Sullivan, participating in the talks, said at a news conference that the U.S. continued to view diplomacy, including international pressure and sanctions, as the main means to tackle the North Korean threat.

He did, however, affirm that the Trump administration was keeping “all options on the table” as the ""regime in Pyongyang is unpredictable and non-transparent.”

""Our objective is, throughout that campaign of pressure, to bring North Korea to the negotiating table without preconditions so that we can achieve our objective of a denuclearized Korean Peninsula,"" he said.

""Diplomacy is our primary objective and primary means to addressing the threat posed by North Korea. But we need to be prepared to respond to any eventuality given the unpredictable nature of the regime in Pyongyang.”

South Korean Vice Foreign Minister Lim Sung-nam said that all three parties agreed that the situation with North Korea should be “managed stably.”

The Seoul meeting took take place following threatening comments made by North Korean Deputy U.N. Ambassador Kim In Ryong, who warned Monday that a “nuclear war may break out any moment.”

“The entire U.S. mainland is within our firing range and if the U.S. dares to invade our sacred territory even an inch it will not escape our severe punishment in any part of the globe,” the North Korean U.N. envoy’s statement said, Fox News reported.

Kim also said that “As long as one does not take part in the U.S. military actions against the DPRK (North Korea), we have no intention to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against any other country,” according to the North Korean ambassador’s prepared remarks to the U.N. committee.

Tensions between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s regime and the U.S. and its allies have escalated following numerous North Korea weapons tests and threatening public statements. The regime has continued its nuclear missile program in defiance to the U.S. and the U.N.

Of course you know October is Breast Cancer Awareness month, and women have been sharing their personal stories related to breast cancer in a number of ways for years. As a social campaign, “No Bra Day”—which may have been started as early as 2011 by a plastic surgeon in Canada—encourages women to go braless and share their photos (with the hashtag #nobraday) to support the cause of breast cancer awareness. Over 82,000 women have complied by posting pics on Twitter and Instagram:

RELATED: JESSICA SIMPSON JUST POSTED A STUNNING TOPLESS PHOTO TO CELEBRATE HER BIRTHDAY

So why are women so angry, then? Because #NoBraDay, they argue, is more about sexualizing breasts than raising cancer awareness. And if you look through the hashtag feed, it's clear that many of those 82,000 photos are more about sexy poses than breast cancer.

This year, 252,710 new cases of invasive breast cancer are expected to be diagnosed — 63,410 of which will be fatal, according to the American Cancer Society. Those frustrated with #NoBraDay are arguing that what women need is not sexy, quasi-topless photos touting #nobraday with little explanation; they need real information explaining how to perform self-exams, what unexpected symptoms to be on the lookout for, and what they should do if they find a lump in their breast.

And not for nothing, #NoBraDay plays up the myth that wearing a bra contributes to an antiquated myth that wearing bras could lead to breast cancer. A 2014 study published in the journal Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers Prevention solidly debunked that idea, finding that that bra-wearing habits, such as underwire or average hours worn, were not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women.

As great and important as it is to support breast cancer, taking your bra off doesn't do a whole lot to help the cause (although it probably will result in some creepy DMs). Instead, spread information instead of selfies. Share survivor stories. Support organizations like the National Breast Cancer Foundation and the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, which are making strides in preventative research. Schedule your own mammogram, and encourage your friends and family to do the same.

Hayward, who signed a four-year, $128 million free agent contract this summer, went up for an alley-oop pass midway through the first quarter and collided with LeBron James. Hayward's leg twisted underneath him as he came back to the floor. The 27-year-old collapsed under the basket and looked in horror as his left foot was pointing outward.

He put his hands to his face and dropped back to the floor as a hush fell over the charged sellout crowd inside Quicken Loans Arena, which had come to boo Kyrie Irving in his return to Cleveland after being traded to Boston this summer.

Hayward's new teammates huddled in prayer at their bench as a distressed James covered his mouth and several Cleveland players nearby looked away. Hayward had his leg placed in an air cast, and James came over and consoled him before the he was pushed from the floor on a stretcher and taken for treatment.

Cleveland's crowd gave Hayward a roaring ovation as he left.

The Celtics later confirmed that Hawyard's left ankle was broken. It's a devastating blow for the Celtics, who had overhauled their roster with the signing of Hayward and acquisition of Irving in hopes of closing the gap on the Cavs in the Eastern Conference.

How to create a substance-free family culture that can sustain a family business?
Make no bones about the fact that substance abuse is not what your family does.
It’s a genuine investment that will pay dividends – for your family business, yes, but more importantly, for your family’s sense of belonging.","Just last month, the Department of Health and Human Services announced its intention to dedicate an extra $144 million towards fighting the opioid crisis – a decision which, while helpful, is long overdue. Substance abuse, and opioid abuse in particular, continues to wreak havoc on this country. Ninety-one Americans die each day from opioid abuse, and drug offenders make up the large part of our nation’s incarcerated population.

It’s a health care problem, it’s a criminal justice problem – but it’s also a family problem, and it’s one that is especially challenging for families who run a family business. I’ve spent all of my life and much of my career observing and advising family businesses, and time and time again I’ve seen that substance abuse plays a large role in the sad fact that 70 percent of family-owned businesses don’t make it past one generation. The collateral damage when a family business falls apart extends to the employees, the stockholders, the lenders, the suppliers, the customers, and even the tax base and economic health of the entire community.

And, economic consequences aside, addiction has deep emotional consequences and can destroy what is an otherwise healthy family business. A longtime friend of mine recently confided in me his sorrow over his two sons, both of whom had been doing wonderfully in college – until they discovered alcohol and quickly become addicted.

My friend tried putting his sons in treatment programs, but it didn’t work. He tried tough love, but his kids wound up hating him. His business prospered, but today his children won’t speak to him. He can’t hand his business on to them, his hoped-for legacy is in tatters, and much of what gave his life meaning has vaporized. What good, he asks himself, does it do to succeed financially and fail as a family?

I was deeply saddened by my friend’s story, but even more saddened to learn that he’s not alone.

One study found that more than half of family businesses had or were struggling with an addiction issue within the family. This may sound shocking, but it stacks up with other statistics: One in ten Americans have struggled with some kind of drug abuse and one in eight with alcohol abuse. Many American families don’t know whether their life’s work will live beyond them into the next generation or whether addiction and substance abuse will have the final say.

So – what to do? How to create a substance-free family culture that can sustain a family business? How to avoid heartbreaking situations like the one my friend found himself in?

There’s no one single answer, and even among healthy families, things will look different. But I’ve generally found that among the families that last, three core values were emphasized:

Be clear. Make no bones about the fact that substance abuse is not what your family does. Parents have far more influence than they know. According to Joe Califano, former Secretary of Health Education and Welfare under President Carter and the founder of the Center on Addiction and Substance (CASA), “Parent power is the greatest weapon we have to curb substance abuse.”

He encourages parents to emphasize that substance abuse is not simply illegal but seriously dangerous, and to take the same attitude towards it that they do towards asbestos. Most parents would be in an uproar if they found out their child’s school has asbestos, but are willing to let substance abuse in school slide. And kids respond to this kind of clear condemnation: Those who know their parents would be “very upset” are more likely to abstain from drugs and alcohol than those who know their parents would only be “a little” or “not upset at all.”

Be together. Oftentimes, risky behaviors result from unloving homes. When children do not feel loved and valued by their parents, they are far more likely to look for love elsewhere – and oftentimes, that means succumbing to peer pressure to win admiration and acceptance.

Simply spending time together – without screens and without distractions – will increase family bonding and a child’s sense of worth and belonging. CASA found that teens who eat dinner with their parents fewer than three nights each week are more susceptible to smoking, drinking and drug abuse than those who eat with their parents five nights or more each week.

Be fun. Teach kids early on that you can have fun and be creative without substances. If they see you getting creative and enjoying yourself without alcohol and drugs, they’re less likely to turn to those things as a way to have fun.

Whatever you do, whether it be sports, board games, arts and crafts, or music, it’s important to intentionally set aside time to do it.

These things are important for all families that want to develop a strong family culture – but they are especially important for parents who themselves come from families that struggle with substance abuse. Creating a stable family is particularly hard when you have genetics and family patterns working against you – but not impossible.

Dr. Falk Lohoff, a scholar at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, argues that “While genetic factors can increase the risk of becoming addicted, they are not deterministic. There are also protective factors.” And one of the biggest protective factors is simple delay. CASA found that with each year of delay in substance use, the likelihood of addiction drops.

By putting the hard work in now of establishing clear values, spending quality time together and having creative, clean fun, you can create the kind of culture where your children will not only be able to perpetuate the family business, but will actually want to work for you and with you. It’s a genuine investment that will pay dividends – for your family business, yes, but more importantly, for your family’s sense of belonging. ​",Mitzi Perdue: Substance abuse is sinking America's family businesses.

President Trump has waded into a deeply complicated issue with opioid addiction, one that is continually in the headlines as new facets of the crisis surface daily.","On Monday, from the Rose Garden, President Trump announced that he is doubling down on his commitment to battle the opioid epidemic.

I was asked to travel to Trump Tower recently, as a member of the president’s Media Advisory Board, to do a piece on the mental health effects of opioids and their social and economic impact. The President posted it on his Facebook page Monday night, hours after addressing the issue in the Rose Garden.

Nationally, employers are losing an estimated $10 billion per year from absenteeism and lost productivity due to opioid abuse. Castlight Health estimates that one-third of employees taking painkillers prescribed by employer plans become addicted. These numbers are staggering, and growing.

Thirty-five thousand Americans died of opioid addiction last year, and millions are addicted today and have no idea how to get better.

The problem is prolific in hospitals across the country, and is impacting our children as well.

Drug dealers are lacing street drugs with opioids. They know that if they can get young people addicted, it will mean cash flow into their drug cartels for years to come. So they lace drugs with fentanyl, a popular synthetic-opioid cousin. Fentanyl is 30-100 times stronger than heroin (according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), and it is pouring across our borders.

Carfentanil is another one. It is 1000 times more toxic than fentanyl, and is so dangerous it is considered a weapon of mass destruction. Authorities can’t even handle it without hazmat precautions when a vehicle is suspected of having carfentanil aboard. Yet it is showing up in recreational drugs to addict our children. China refuses to stop producing it.

This addiction is terroristic in how it finds some of its victims. It preys on those who innocently go into the hospital and don't realize they will come away with an addiction that could ruin their lives.

No one is safe. Children can be addicted when a brownie is laced with the drug. Adults can be addicted when prescribed pain medicine by a doctor. The elderly are even more susceptible, as they may battle more pain and surgeries than other populations. They also tend to be more trusting of medical professionals, and less suspicious of pharmaceuticals than younger populations.

President Trump has waded into a deeply complicated issue with opioid addiction, one that is continually in the headlines as new facets of the crisis surface daily.

Tuesday morning, less than 24 hours after the Rose Garden event, the president announced that his drug czar nominee, Rep. Tom Marino, R-Penn., would be withdrawing his name from consideration following a “60 Minutes” report Sunday in which the congressman was cited as undermining legislation to bolster DEA enforcement to crack down on opioid manufacturers. Also Tuesday, Reuters reported that two Chinese men were charged with conspiring to distribute large amounts of fentanyl into the U.S.; this in addition to five Canadians and three Americans also indicted in this drug conspiracy with the Chinese importers.

Warning patients of the addictive qualities and how to wean themselves from these drugs, cracking down on the gangs bringing the substances across U.S. borders, and arresting internet distributors are all important first steps in the president’s commitment to curtail this epidemic threatening Americans of all ages.",President Trump doubles down on opioid epidemic,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/17/president-trump-doubles-down-on-opioid-epidemic.html

prev

A desperately ill woman whose brain is dropping out of her skull won't live to see Christmas this year if she doesn't raise enough money for life saving surgery.

Sarah Gearing, 40, has a condition which causes her body's connective tissues to collapse, meaning that many of her joints frequently fall apart.

This condition, called Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, means that Gearing needs $170,000 to have a unique operation which will take place in Barcelona and last for over ten hours.

""My surgeon told me that my condition is more critical than it has ever been, and that if I don't get the surgery I need by next month, I will die,"" she said. “This condition has affected every single aspect of my life, right now I wear a neck-brace all the time.""

MYSTERIOUS ILLNESS CAUSES BOY TO SLEEP FOR 11 DAYS

""When I was younger, my coordination was poor and I would bruise easily, since then things have only worsened,"" she said. ""I had pursued a further education to become a counselor but because of my health I couldn’t continue it. Right now my brain is dropping out of my skull, crushing my brain-stem and spinal cord.""

Gearing has learned that the only surgeons in the world that are able to perform this highly complex and dangerous operation are in Barcelona, Spain or in the U.S.

As a result of her condition, Gearing also suffers from her chronic pain, mental and physical levels of incapacity, and joints so loose that her ribs dislocate when she sneezes.

She has a hind-brain herniation, which means that her brain has slipped 7-mm out of place and is now preventing fluid from circulating between the brain and spine.

""The surgery I need involves a total neck fusion and procedures to put my brain back where it belongs and permanently relieve the compression on my spinal cord,"" Gearing said. ""The surgery will involve the surgeons cutting open the back of my skull and re-positioning the brain.""

""I don't understand the technical aspects of it, but it's surgery that should be done over three sessions,"" she said. ""They're doing it all at once because the surgeon doesn't think that my system can cope with being put through three separate operations.""

""I've been a full-time wheelchair user for 20 years now- my condition has drastically worsened over the last two years though- right now, I'm in bed almost all day everyday,"" she said. ""Sometimes, my skull slips away from the top of my spine and my head literally falls out of its place.""

DAD'S FATAL ASTHMA ATTACK POSSIBLY LINKED TO CALIFORNIA FIRES, GIRLFRIEND CLAIMS

Some of the common EDS symptoms that Gearing suffers are gastric and digestion problems, chronic dislocation of joints, and pains and seizures that leave her disorientated.

The money she raises will go towards the surgery itself and the aftercare that she will need, while she recovers in a specially adapted apartment with round the clock carers.

Gearing currently uses a catheter and lives with full time carer, Sue Geere, and care dog Otto, to help her with tasks like opening and closing doors, picking things up and alerting her to oncoming seizures.

She has lived in constant pain for the past 20 years but was only officially diagnosed with EDS six years ago.

Prior to this, doctors noted various different symptoms but never pinpointed that she had EDS.

""They only really suggested that it was EDS when my condition worsened a lot and more and more well-known EDS cases were popping up in the media,"" Gearing said.

Her friend, Melanie Hartshorn, 28, suffered with EDS and caught the attention of the media when she completed her degree in biology and attended her graduation ceremony while in a stretcher.

“The surgery I need involves a total neck fusion and procedures to put my brain back where it belongs and permanently relieve the compression on my spinal cord,"" Gearing said. ""The neurosurgeon said to me if I don’t have the surgery in November it’s unlikely I’ll make it to Christmas.""

""He said that this is now a matter of urgency and that, top put it bluntly, without the surgery, I don't have long left,"" she said. ""Spain and the U.S. are the only countries in the world that offer this surgery to EDS patients.”

Sarah's local community in Rochford, Essex, and church groups have raised over $72,000 for her, and she remains positive, despite having less than a month to double funds so far.

“I am overwhelmed by the support from everyone, and Rochford Council. I’m really positive about this because I think the trip to Spain two weeks ago was a sign that I’ll be all right,"" she said. ""There’s just so many things I want to do, like supporting other EDS patients. I'm not finished will life just yet.”

A crowdfunding page was set up to help Gearing reach her fundraising goal.",Woman whose brain is 'dropping' out of skull fundraising for life-saving surgery,https://www.foxnews.com/health/2017/10/18/woman-whose-brain-is-dropping-out-skull-fundraising-for-life-saving-surgery.html

Believing that truth and embracing that truth isn’t the only thing we need to do.
But it is a firm foundation on which to build a life of freedom from anxiety and the exhausting endless quest to prove our value through our performance.","I sat on a parenting panel last month with a well-known and widely respected counselor by the name of Sissy Goff, M.Ed, LPC-MHSP. She is the Director of Child & Adolescent Counseling at Daystar in Nashville and when asked about the biggest issue facing kids today, she confirmed what you’ve probably read about recently on your news feed or even your Facebook feed – the increasing anxiety epidemic in our country.

But it’s not just an epidemic among our kids. It’s an epidemic among us -- their parents.

According to the National Institute of Mental Health, anxiety is the most common mental-health disorder in the United States, affecting nearly one-third of both adolescents and adults.

In a recent article entitled “Why Are More American Teenagers Than Ever Suffering from Severe Anxiety” we glean significant insight into the anxiety epidemic:

I’ll just share just two key points from the article:

* Privileged youths are among the most emotionally distressed young people in America. These kids are incredibly anxious and perfectionistic.

* For many of these young people, the biggest single stressor is that they never get to the point where they can say, ‘I’ve done enough, and now I can stop.’ Kids have a sense that they’re not measuring up. The pressure is relentless and getting worse.

If you’re reading this article as a mom, I imagine it breaks your heart like it breaks mine (as the mother of four boys who range in age from toddler to teenager) to learn that the pressure our kids are under “is relentless and getting worse.” Of course, I think we already assumed this to be true. But knowing it to be true leaves us responsible to do something to fight against it.

We have to be willing to take an honest (maybe painfully honest) look at how we may have contributed to the anxiety our kids feel with the pressure we just might be passing down. With our unrealistic expectations and impossible standards of ourselves, and of them.

See, we parents aren’t the only ones linking accomplishment to acceptance and success to significance. Our kids are attempting to answer the question, “Is who I am enough?” by how well they perform on the field, how much they excel in school, and how many likes they get on their Instagram feed.

They are attempting to answer that question, “Is who I am enough?” by proving they can do enough and be enough. Whatever “enough” is. Because you and I both know enough is never enough when the goal is perpetual perfection.

The primary message our kids receive is that they’d better be the best at everything, and this leaves them afraid to reveal their inadequacies and insecurities—and hiding behind the best version of themselves.

In turn, parents of anxious teens feel helpless and hopeless, questioning all of the steps we are -- or aren’t -- taking. Our confidence as moms crumbles as we try to help our kids navigate the battles they have to fight and the mountains they have to climb.

We are constantly second guessing ourselves: “Have I done too much? Have I not done enough? Am I helping or am I hurting my child?”

Our anxiety escalates and overflows into our parenting and onto our kids, who then take our anxiety on top of their own.

I won’t pretend to even begin to be able to solve this for us here. I don’t have all the answers. Not even a little bit. But I do have this one nugget – which is the primary message woven into my new book, ""Mom Set Free,"" and I believe it to be true with everything in me.

A key ingredient in helping our kids overcome their anxiety is facing and working through our own anxiety.

It starts with us. It doesn’t end with us. But we are part of the solution.

We have to be willing to take an honest (maybe painfully honest) look at how we may have contributed to the anxiety our kids feel with the pressure we just might be passing down. With our unrealistic expectations and impossible standards of ourselves, and of them.

Of course, some kids are just more prone to perfection seeking than others. Such kids tend to create their own pressure, even if their parents are actively trying to relieve it. But often, we parents play a role in the pressure -- and therefore, anxiety -- our kids feel, so we have to be willing to take an honest look at how we pile our own pressure onto our kids.

And ultimately, it is our responsibility to help our kids push back the pressure they face with the truth of God’s Word. I am not at all suggesting that therapy and medication aren’t part of the solution. They often times are. But please let us not forget the alive and powerful Word of God that has the absolute power to show us where our significance comes from and ultimately set us free from proving our worth and our value in our performance.

Kids who constantly feel like they just don't measure up and who feel they have “everything” to prove need to be told – over and over again - they actually have “nothing” to prove. Because this pressure to prove our value and worth has left parents and children alike longing for what all our hearts most crave:

• to be known—truly and deeply known

• to be accepted—for who they are, not who they wish they were to be loved—with no strings attached

This isn’t sentimental fluff. This is solid truth from which freedom springs. There is absolutely no denying the inherent and deepest longing every human soul holds.

If we want to raise kids who find freedom from the pressure to get it ALL right in order to be accepted and welcomed, then we are going to need to walk in that freedom first. Or at least be willing to discover how to walk in that freedom alongside our kids.

We need to know that failing doesn’t make us failures and succeeding doesn’t make us significant. At least not in the eyes of our Creator -- the only One whose opinion of us really matters in the end.

In God’s eyes we are of great worth, not because of anything we have or haven’t done, but because of what has been done for us in the person and work of Jesus Christ.

The cross has the final word on our value. Believing that truth and embracing that truth isn’t the only thing we need to do. But it is a firm foundation on which to build a life of freedom from anxiety and the exhausting endless quest to prove our value through our performance.","America's teen anxiety epidemic is heartbreaking.

October is an exciting month for the family. Even if you or your kids aren’t into the haunted part of Halloween, you can still embrace the festivities of fall, warmth and togetherness. Encourage your kids to exercise their imagination and creativity with these Halloween-themed crafts that everyone can participate in.

1. Family Portrait Pumpkins

Skip the mess of carving pumpkins this year by investing in some good old fashioned chalk. Simply paint a circle on each pumpkin with chalkboard paint. You’ll probably have to apply at least three coats of paint. Then, draw a self-portrait using a piece of chalk. Voila!

2. Colorful Garland

Before kids jump in the pile of leaves this weekend, encourage them to collect a few especially vibrant ones. Press the leaves in a book for a couple of hours while the kids continue to play outside. Once they’ve been flattened, show your children how to clip the leaves to a string with miniature clothespins and find spots to hang them throughout the house together.

3. Harvest Vignettes

Look to nature’s bounty for easy decor ideas. Arrange apples, pears, pumpkins, squash and gourds in baskets throughout your kitchen and dining areas. Having easy access to fruits will also promote healthy eating for your family this season.

4. Candy Laboratory

First, gather vases, jars and dishes in a variety of shapes and sizes. Then fill each container with colorful treats, like candy corn, marshmallows and of course candy eyeballs. Challenge your family members to come up with a creative new name for each candy. Crows bones, zombie zingers and pumpkin teeth are excellent examples. Arrange the jars neatly on a tray or turn a bar cart into a wonderful candy buffet.

5. Candy Corn Checkerboards

A checkerboard made from a placemat can be quickly rolled up and easily tucked away. Cut a 1½-inch square from cardstock paper to make a stencil. Start at one edge of the square and paint every other square. Precise placement and straight lines aren’t necessary in this project, which makes it great for kids. Small imperfections can even give the game a rustic or quirky look. You can use candy corn or small plastic spiders as game pieces.

6. Gothic Deskscape

Fall break is the perfect time to take a break from work and transform your home office into a spooky showcase. Open a dictionary and lay a magnifying glass on the definition of “Halloween”. Stack a pile of literature to display your favorite fall titles, like The Tell-Tale Heart or Harry Potter. Swap out a desk lamp’s lightbulb for one with an orange glow or purple hue, and don’t forget an inkwell and quill pen!

7. Mantel Accessories

Fireplace mantels are the go-to spot for any holiday decor. Find wooden display letters at your local craft store to spell out “boo” or another ghastly term above the hearth. Place a mini pumpkin or two and add some candles. A stack of books and a vase of bare branches are also great ideas.

8. Stylish Spider Webs

Tulle is great for wrapping accessories, draping over doorways and even dressing up the bushes. Don’t overlook the nooks and crannies though. This fabric is even more effective in small corners of a room since that’s where spiders hang out most anyway. You might even have to dust off a few real webs before making your own.

9. Window Decals

Shadows and silhouettes can be extra spooky this time of year. Use your interior lighting and the long dark nights to your advantage by decorating windows with DIY decals. Sketch large outlines of your favorite Halloween characters on fade-resistant paper. Then cut out your witches, skeletons, bats, cats or ghosts and tape them to the inside of your home’s windows.

10. Dip-Dyed Baskets

Prepare for trick-or-treaters this year by sprucing up a traditional candy basket. Fill a plastic container (larger than your basket) with semigloss paint. Place the basket in the paint and push down until all sides are covered to your desired height. Let the basket sit overnight on an elevated rack you don’t mind getting dirty, like an old cookie sheet. Reuse this basket all year long as stylish storage!",10 DIY Halloween decorations for all ages,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/13/10-diy-halloween-decorations-for-all-ages.html

The deal in question, which was previously reported, involved the 2010 approval of a partial sale of Canadian mining company Uranium One to Russia’s Rosatom nuclear company.
“Notably, in the same month as the Clinton speech, Uranium One and Rosatom notified CFIUS of the Russian government’s intent to acquire twenty percent of the United States’ uranium assets.
The next month, in July 2010, Renaissance Bank reportedly assigned Uranium One a ‘buy’ rating, a move that would principally benefit its Russian investors,” Grassley wrote.
But Grassley wants to know whether the committee that approved the transaction was aware of the ongoing criminal probe at the time.","A top Senate Republican is probing potential “conflicts of interest” for Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration regarding the 2010 approval of a controversial uranium deal with a Russian company, amid new details about donations from “interested parties” and an FBI corruption probe involving employees of the same Russian firm.

“This committee has an obligation to get to the bottom of this issue,” Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said Wednesday, at the start of a hearing with Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

The Hill reported a day earlier that the FBI had evidence as early as 2009 that Russian operatives used bribes, kickbacks and other dirty tactics to expand Moscow’s atomic energy footprint in the U.S. -- but the Obama administration approved the uranium deal benefiting Moscow anyway.

Grassley on Wednesday released a series of letters he fired off last week to 10 federal agencies, addressing those issues in detail and raising the question of whether the committee that approved the transaction was aware of the FBI probe. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) included then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

REPORT: RUSSIANS USED BRIBES, SOUGHT TO PAD CLINTON CHARITY AMID OBAMA-ERA PUSH TO EXPAND US NUCLEAR FOOTPRINT

Asked about the concerns at Wednesday’s hearing, Sessions told Grassley the Justice Department will take “appropriate” actions.

“I hear your concerns and they will be reviewed,” Sessions said, without responding directly to a question from Grassley on whether the Justice Department has also probed whether the Russians ""compromised"" the Obama administration to ""smooth the way"" for the deal.

“It wouldn’t be appropriate for me to comment on any ongoing investigation,” Sessions said.

The deal in question, which was previously reported, involved the 2010 approval of a partial sale of Canadian mining company Uranium One to Russia’s Rosatom nuclear company. The U.S. was involved because the sale gave the Russians control of part of the uranium supply in the U.S.

Grassley wrote in his letters that he’s not “convinced” by previous “assurances” that there were no unresolved national security concerns. Grassley, in his hearing remarks and letters, raised two key issues.

It had been previously reported that figures tied to the transaction gave donations to Bill Clinton and his family foundation, but Grassley wrote that he has learned additional details about a $500,000 fee the former president got from a Russian investment bank for a June 2010 speech. He wrote that the bank’s senior officers include former Russian intelligence personnel, and sources had described the company as an “extension” of the Russian government.

“Notably, in the same month as the Clinton speech, Uranium One and Rosatom notified CFIUS of the Russian government’s intent to acquire twenty percent of the United States’ uranium assets. The next month, in July 2010, Renaissance Bank reportedly assigned Uranium One a ‘buy’ rating, a move that would principally benefit its Russian investors,” Grassley wrote. “The donations raise concerns about potential conflicts of interest for Secretary Clinton and the Obama administration.”

Further, Grassley raised concerns about the FBI probe into “corruption and extortion” involving employees of a Rosatom subsidiary dating back to 2009 – before the 2010 approval.

As noted in The Hill, the feds did eventually go after Vadim Mikerin, a Russian nuclear industry official, in connection with the investigation. He was later sentenced, in 2015, to 48 months in prison in connection with money laundering allegations.

But Grassley wants to know whether the committee that approved the transaction was aware of the ongoing criminal probe at the time.

“The fact that Rosatom subsidiaries in the United States were under criminal investigation as a result of a U.S. intelligence operation apparently around the time CFIUS approved the Uranium One/Rosatom transaction raises questions about whether that information factored into CFIUS’ decision to approve the transaction,” Grassley wrote.

He said given that the deal resulted in a “Russian government takeover” of a chunk of U.S. uranium mining capacity, “very serious questions remain about the basis for the finding that this transaction did not threaten to impair U.S. national security.”

When details of the Uranium One deal first emerged in 2015, Clinton’s campaign downplayed the allegations.

""No one has produced a shred of evidence that Hillary Clinton ever took action as Secretary of State in order to support the interests of donors to the Clinton Foundation,"" a spokesman said at the time. ""To suggest the State Department, under then-Secretary Clinton, exerted undue influence in the U.S. government's review of the sale of Uranium One is utterly baseless.”

Anthony Allen Shore, 55, will be the seventh Texas inmate to be executed this year. When he was arrested in 2003, he confessed to killing a 21-year-old woman by twisting a cord from a window blind around her neck and dumping her in the drive-thru lane of a Dairy Queen in 1991.

""He said, 'I have a tip for you. There's a serial killer on the loose.'"" - Barbara Robertson, KPRC assignment manager

Maria del Carmen Estrada's slaying went unsolved for more than a decade until a tiny particle collected from beneath her fingernail matched the DNA of Shore.

When police arrested Shore, who was on probation for his 1998 conviction for sexually assaulting two relatives, he also confessed to killing three others, including a 9-year-old girl and two teenage girls. All were Hispanic, and three had been sexually assaulted.

""There were voices in my head that I was going to have her, regardless, to possess her in some way,"" Shore, a former tow truck driver, phone company repairman and part-time musician, told detectives about Estrada. The then-21-year-old Estrada was walking to work about 6:30 a.m. on April 16, 1992, when he offered her a ride she accepted.

@LauraLynnSmiles Laurie Lee Tremblay, Maria Carmen Del Estrada, Diana Rebollar, Dana Sanchez are remembered. pic.twitter.com/hsWVFWu3u0 — LauraLynnMoserPark (@LauraLynnSmiles) January 13, 2014

It wasn't until five years after Shore's DNA went into a state database following his 1998 sexual assault conviction that the match to Estrada's murderer was made.

Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg has described Shore as a ""true serial killer"" who terrorized young Hispanic females in the Houston area for years.

Besides Estrada, Shore confessed to the slayings of Laurie Tremblay, 15, found beside a trash bin outside a Houston restaurant in 1986; Diana Rebollar, 9, abducted while walking to a neighborhood grocery store in 1994; and Dana Sanchez, 16, who disappeared in 1995 while hitchhiking to her boyfriend's home in Houston.

At the time of the Sanchez murder, Shore called Houston television station KPRC to report the location of a body.

“I pick up the phone and I say, ‘Tipline,’” former KPRC assignment manager Barbara Magana Robertson said. “He said, ‘I have a tip for you. There’s a serial killer on the loose.’”

Robertson said the nearly 40-minute call became serious when the man started giving her directions to the location of a body, including details on how it was positioned.

“He gave me clues to like four or five different murders and I had no idea. I’m thinking I’m getting one murder details and he knew I was getting several different murders,” said Robertson.

At his trial in 2004, with the confession and DNA results in evidence, a jury convicted Shore of capital murder. The next day, Shore's lawyers told jurors that, against their judgment and advice, their client wanted the death penalty. Jurors then heard four days of prosecution evidence about the three other slayings and heard from three women who testified he raped them.

The trial judge ultimately asked Shore directly if his lawyers' statements about him wanting the death penalty were accurate.

""This is very accurate,"" he replied.

In appeals, lawyers appointed for Shore argued he suffered from brain damage early in life that his trial attorneys didn't discover, and the brain injury affected his decision about wanting the death penalty. A federal appeals court earlier this year turned down his appeal and two weeks ago the U.S. Supreme Court refused to review his case.

The six-member Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles unanimously rejected a clemency petition Monday.

""I would describe Anthony's demeanor as that of any condemned man, that even though his life is severely altered by being in prison, especially on death row, he would rather have that than death,"" Knox Nunnally, one of Shore's attorneys, said.

Skin Cancer PreventionDoctors have seen a rise in melanoma in the US in the last several decades.
While older people have a much higher risk of developing melanoma, more young adults are acquiring the cancer as well.
When caught early, melanoma can be easy to treat and overcome.","Nearly everyone has some sort of spot or mole on their body. For some, a speckled face or body is just part of living in their skin, but the spots can also turn into a dangerous cancer called melanoma.

Fortunately, melanoma accounts for relatively few cases of cancer and is highly treatable when caught early. Catching it early is key, though; so you should look into any suspicious moles or spots right away.

According to the American Cancer Society, 87,000 new cases of melanoma will be diagnosed in 2017 and as many as 9,700 people will die from the cancer. Although melanoma only makes up about 1 percent of skin cancer cases, it clearly affects many lives and should be taken seriously.

What Is Melanoma?

Melanoma is a cancerous growth that occurs because of unrepaired DNA damage to skin cells. Like other cancers, these damaged cells mutate and then grow out of control.

DO YOU HAVE LIVER DAMAGE?

The damage often happens due to ultraviolet radiation from sun exposure or tanning beds. In some cases, though, a person may have an inherited trait or skin disorder that inhibits the body from repairing the damaged skin cells.

Risk factors for melanoma include excessive UV light exposure, moles (especially if there are many), family history, fair skin or a weakened immune system.

Spotting Melanoma Early

Unlike many other cancers, melanoma can often be identified first by the patient and then verified later by a medical professional. To determine whether to get expert advice, you can search for 5 common identifying factors, outlined by the National Cancer Institute as the ABC’s of melanoma.

1. Asymmetry

When judging asymmetry in a mole or spot, imagine that a line is dividing the mole down the middle. If one side of the mole does not match the shape and color of the other side, it may be cancerous. Get expert advice immediately.

2. Border

A regular freckle or mole on the skin will usually have a defined edge to it. However, melanoma often blurs or fades into the surrounding skin or has jagged edges.

3. Color

You can often identify melanoma because of its inconsistent color or shade. Again, normal spots will have a consistent color and darkness throughout.

MYSTERIOUS ILLNESS CAUSES BOY TO SLEEP FOR 11 DAYS

For example, the spot may look darker brown in the middle than on the edges. You may also notice white, red or pink spots.

4. Diameter

The diameter is the width across the entire mole or spot. Generally, melanoma gets bigger, resulting in a spot larger than the size of a pea. If you notice a mole or spot growing or spreading out on the skin, consult your doctor.

5. Evolving

Last, look for changes in the spot over the last few weeks or months. Normal moles or spots won’t change in color, size or shape.

By using these 5 easy criteria, you can judge whether a skin spot needs medical evaluation. While you likely have nothing to worry about, you should check into any suspicious areas as a precaution.

After Diagnosis

Because melanoma starts out in a localized area, it can easily be treated in its early stages. If you catch it early, you may only need surgery to remove the cancer. After the surgery, you will also need to follow up with your dermatologist on a regular basis.

PAY ATTENTION TO THESE EARLY SIGNS OF OVARIAN CANCER

On the other hand, if the cancer travels deeper within the skin, it may have already spread through the blood vessels and lymphatic system. This later stage of melanoma proves more difficult to treat. You will need to discuss treatment options such as chemotherapy with your doctor based on your specific case.

Skin Cancer Prevention

Doctors have seen a rise in melanoma in the US in the last several decades. While older people have a much higher risk of developing melanoma, more young adults are acquiring the cancer as well.

As with any cancer, the best method for fighting melanoma is prevention. Follow these steps to reduce your risk for this skin cancer:

Use sun protection.

When going outdoors, use proper protection for your skin, including hats, sunglasses, sunscreen and clothing that covers much of the body.

Avoid tanning beds and sunlamps.

These artificial sources of UV rays are just as harmful to the skin as UV light from the sun.

Check your skin.

Make it a habit to regularly inspect your skin and get familiar with your spots and moles.

Keep your immune system strong.

Avoid practices that increase your risk for immune-suppressing diseases like HIV. In addition, exercise, get proper rest and eat a well-balanced diet to help your body fend off disease.

Although you likely have a harmless mole or two in some area of your body, you should watch for signs of melanoma. When caught early, melanoma can be easy to treat and overcome. However, the absolute best method of fighting melanoma is through prevention. By maintaining a healthy lifestyle and protecting your skin from the sun, you will dramatically decrease your risk for getting this skin cancer.

A statement on the band's website said he died Tuesday night ""with his beloved children and family close by."" The statement did not give a cause of death, though he had been diagnosed earlier with brain cancer.

Since The Tragically Hip's first album in 1987, the band has provided a soundtrack for the lives of many Canadians. ""Ahead by a Century"" and ""Bobcaygeon"" are among the best known.

While Canadian musicians Drake, the Weeknd and Justin Bieber have made waves internationally, the Tragically Hip built a huge following of die-hard homegrown fans.

""There will never be another one like you, Gord, Rest in peace my friend,"" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted.

Downie was diagnosed with glioblastoma, an aggressive and incurable brain cancer, in December 2015. When the band made the news public the following May, expressions of sorrow poured in from across the country.

That same day, the band said it would mount a Canadian tour despite Downie's cancer. Tickets for the 2016 summer tour sold out almost immediately, culminating in a national broadcast of the band's final tour stop at Kingston, Ontario. Millions tuned in.

Downie later told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. that he needed six teleprompters during the concert series so he would not forget lyrics. But through it all, Downie remained the consummate showman, rocking out on stage in distinctive leather suits.

During his final show, Downie called out to Trudeau, who attended the concert, to help fix problems in Canada's aboriginal communities.

A few months after that concert, Downie released a solo album with an accompanying graphic novel and animated film inspired by the tragedy of state-funded church schools that Canadian aboriginal children were forced to attend from the 19th century until the 1970s. He said his ""Secret Path"" project was aimed at Canada's decades-long government policy of requiring aboriginal children to attend residential schools, where physical and sexual abuse was often rampant.

Born in Amherstview, Ontario, Downie said he ""always had a keen ear for music"" and while all the other kids were spending their allowance on baseball trading cards, he was buying records ""from the fathers of rock 'n' roll.""

While at university, he met Paul Langlois, Rob Baker, Gord Sinclair and Johnny Fray, and they formed The Tragically Hip, which started out as a cover band.

Their first self-titled EP was released in 1987 and their breakthrough debut full-length album, ""Up to Here,"" was released in 1989. Since then they have released 14 studio albums, two live albums, one EP and 54 singles. Nine of their albums have reached No. 1 in Canada. They have received numerous Canadian music awards, including 14 Juno awards, the equivalent of the Grammy in Canada.

The band's 2012 album, ""Now for Plan A,"" was lyrically influenced by Downie's wife and her successful battle with breast cancer.

Downie also produced three solo albums since 2001, as well as a collaboration with fellow Canadian indie darlings The Sadies.

Vanessa told Elianna to press on the bear’s paw for a special message.

The bear, with her father's voice, told Elianna: “Hey baby, daddy loves you and misses you so, so much and I can’t wait for you to be in my arms again. I love you very much.”

The little girl’s eyes went wide before squealing in delight, “Oh my God that’s daddy!”

Elianna gave her new soldier teddy bear a big hug.

The touching moment was posted on Twitter by Vanessa’s sister and immediately went viral Wednesday. As of Saturday, the video was retweeted more than 49,000 times and liked by more than 100,000 Twitter users.

“Everyone has been basically saying ‘Oh my gosh I’m crying’ (and) another girl was even like ‘I just put on my makeup and now it’s all over my face,'” Vanessa told KSAT.

“There’s also a lot of people on Twitter saying that they wish they had that from their dad or their mom and if they can hear their loved ones voice one more time, it would have made their entire world,” Vanessa said.

She said David was ordered to travel to South Carolina for basic training in August, leaving the family of three a few weeks to spend together before he left.

Vanessa said the deployment as hard on her daughter who has never been away from her father for this long.

“It really meant a lot to give that to her so she can play it every time she misses him and it helps her a lot,” she said. “It’s tough but in the end, I know it’ll be worth it.”

The 36-year-old swimmer took a knee on Sunday after he anchored Team USA’s mixed 200-meter medley relay race in Brazil.

Afterward, he tweeted: “My point is to save lives, and understand the imbalance. We all have our area. I’m a swimmer.”

Swim Swam, a swimming news organization, noted that Ervin is the son of Jack Ervin, an American black Vietnam veteran who opted to join the Marines instead going to jail after he was wrongly implicated in an act of vandalism. His mother, Sherry, is of Jewish heritage and white.

In 2000, the younger Ervin became the first black American swimmer to win Olympic swimming gold with the 50-meter freestyle in Sydney. Sixteen years later in Rio, he became the oldest swimmer in history to win an Olympic gold medal at the age of 35.

The “take a knee” movement – protesting police brutality and other issues – began when Colin Kaepernick first sat for the anthem during the NFL preseason in early August 2016. It has since grown to a sizable number of NFL and WNBA players and even spread abroad when a German professional soccer team took a knee during pregame ceremonies in solidarity on Sunday.

JACKSONVILLE JAGUARS APOLOGIZE TO MILITARY FOR KNEELING IN LONDON

It now begs the question: Will the protests to the national anthem spread to the upcoming Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea, which are set to begin in February?

The Olympic charter prohibits athletes from making political demonstrations inside venues, but it has not stopped them before.

Probably the most famous demonstration came at the 1986 Mexico City Games when U.S. track athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos raised their fists in a Black Power salute while on the medal stand. It was a silent but attention-grabbing way of protesting the discrimination and poor living condition of blacks in the U.S.

“We planted the seeds back then, and what you see today is the fruit of our labors,” Carlos told Fox News ahead of the Rio games last summer. “In entertainment, in sports, you see people demanding more access and better treatment.”

OLYMPIC LEGEND JOHN CARLOS SAYS HE PLANTED SEED FOR 'BLACK LIVES MATTER'

The fallout was swift for Smith, Carlos and Australian sprinter Peter Norman, who suggested they wear the gloves. The two Americans were immediately taken off the U.S. team, their Mexican visas were revoked and they were sent home to the U.S. Norman was reprimanded and held off future Olympic teams by the Australian committee.

The international sporting event has long been a way for individual athletes and even entire countries to make major political and social statements.

In 1960 athletes from Taiwan – protesting being asked by the International Olympic Committee to no longer march under the name “The Republic of China” at the 1960 Rome Olympics – carried a sign reading, “Under Protest,” during the opening ceremony. The then-IOC President Avery Brundage had to be talked out of banning the Taiwanese delegation from participating in the games.

In 1908, Irish athletes boycotted the London games because of Britain’s refusal to grant Irish independence.

In 1980, 62 countries led by the United States boycotted the Moscow summer Olympics after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan on Christmas 1979. President Jimmy Carter made the decision for the athletes and it would be one of the least popular decisions he ever made during his presidency.

In response, the Soviet Union and other Warsaw pact countries boycotted the 1984 summer Olympics in Los Angeles.

Last summer, at the Rio Games, the Ethiopian marathoner Feyisa Lilesa crossed his arms over his head at the finish line to protest the country's treatment of his ethnic group, the Oromo people. He has been in exile since.

It’s unclear if athletes will use the upcoming winter Olympics to make a political statement. But some are already saying they are mulling it over.

“I am an African-American woman and my family is all African American,” Kehri Jones, a U.S. Olympic bobsled hopeful told the New York Times last month. “I worry about my family and my siblings and my father going out and ending up in some of these awful situations.”

But I’m grateful for the years they gave us on ""Fixer Upper.""
There’s a real dearth of shows or, frankly, any entertainment that depicts marriage as fun.
Please be psyched, and convey that psychedness to us.”And that’s exactly what the Gaineses have done on ""Fixer Upper.""","Editor's note: The following column originally appeared on Acculturated.com.

In their years on HGTV’s show, ""Fixer Upper,"" hosts Chip and Joanna Gaines achieved far more than merely getting Americans to embrace open floor plans and shiplap; they made marriage look fun again.

The Texas couple’s decision to end the show after soon-to-be-aired Season Five ensures it won’t devolve into them simply playing certain roles, trying to recapture the magic of earlier seasons.

Along the way, thanks to the pairing of Joanna’s gift for interior design and Chip’s skilled construction craftsmanship, they made a lot of beautiful homes—showing concretely how the teamwork of marriage could create something bigger.

“This is just us recognizing that we need to catch our breath for a moment,” the Gaineses wrote on their blog. “Our plan is to take this time to shore up and strengthen the spots that are weak, rest the places that are tired and give lots of love and attention to both our family and our businesses.” In a video accompanying their blog post, Joanna spoke specifically about how quickly the couple’s four children were growing, noting that their eldest was almost a teenager and expressing how they were ready to “hunker down with our kiddos” for a time.

This is exactly what made the Gaineses so appealing. They do care about time with their family—and they’re not the kind of reality TV professionals who want to turn their family into a permanent fixture on the screen by being “on” all the time. Part of the couple’s appeal has always been their family-friendliness, their down-to-earth qualities, and the clear priority they give to living in accordance with their values.

But their decision to end the show is also appealing because the Gaineses themselves have changed: in the years since ""Fixer Upper"" began, they’ve become involved in multiple home goods lines, launched a magazine, written a book, and even opened a bakery in their hometown of Waco, Texas. While I’m happy for the Gaines’ success, the fact is they’re not the same couple facing regular problems that they were when the show launched—and frankly, yes, a reality show true to their own current reality (exploring questions like what mega chain is worth trusting for a home goods line partnership, for example) would simply not be as relatable or enjoyable to watch.

But I’m grateful for the years they gave us on ""Fixer Upper.""

There’s a real dearth of shows or, frankly, any entertainment that depicts marriage as fun. And while no doubt the Gaineses amped it up a little for the camera, the dynamics under-girding the show—the push and pull between the goofy Chip and the more serious Joanna—certainly seemed authentic, as did the joy they had in just hanging out with each other, occasionally trying to get a rise out of one another.

Along the way, thanks to the pairing of Joanna’s gift for interior design and Chip’s skilled construction craftsmanship, they made a lot of beautiful homes—showing concretely how the teamwork of marriage could create something bigger.

In her 2011 book, ""Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?"" TV writer and actress Mindy Kaling included a section, “C’mon, Married People,” in which she wrote:

""I don’t want to hear about the endless struggles to keep sex exciting, or the work it takes to plan a date night. I want to hear that you guys watch every episode of The Bachelorettetogether in secret shame, or that one got the other hooked on Breaking Bad and if either watches it without the other, they’re dead meat. I want to see you guys high-five each other like teammates on a recreational softball team you both do for fun. I’m not saying that marriage should always be easy. But we seem to get so gloomily worked up about it these days.""

Kaling, whose own show ""The Mindy Project"" unfortunately devolved into a gloomy look at the hardships of relationships these days, concluded with the following plea:

“Married people, it’s up to you. It’s entirely on your shoulders to keep this sinking institution afloat. It’s a stately old ship, and a lot of people, like me, want to get on board. Please be psyched, and convey that psychedness to us.”

And that’s exactly what the Gaineses have done on ""Fixer Upper."" In an era when marriage rates are down, people flirt with notions of open marriages and polygamy, and singles scour Tinder for one-night-stands, a show about home renovation unexpectedly became a celebration of how a husband and wife could be friends and partners, could complement each other and have a genuinely good time just hanging out with each other. In their interactions with each other and their four children, the Gaineses proved happiness isn’t impossible for an old-fashioned family in our modern era.",What Chip and Joanna Gaines teach us about marriage,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/05/what-chip-and-joanna-gaines-teach-us-about-marriage.html

The self-described “strategic intelligence” firm Fusion GPS that was behind the controversial anti-Trump dossier has a track record of intimidation and smear tactics, according to congressional testimony and the firsthand account of a London-based Venezuelan journalist who said he was labeled a “pedophile,” “extortionist” and “drug trafficker” after criticizing one of Fusion’s clients.

“I believe that Fusion GPS’s business is to do basically whatever the paymasters tell them to do,” Alek Boyd, the Venezuelan journalist, told Fox News in his first American TV interview. “They are particularly good at spreading misinformation, disinformation and smears.”

Boyd says he was targeted after his 2012 reporting on Derwick Associates, a power company with close ties to the Venezuelan government. The company allegedly skimmed nearly a billion dollars from rigged contracts with the late Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez.

“It is my understanding that [Fusion GPS] were hired basically to smear Derwick opponents and to dispel any possible doubts that regular media may have had at the time,” he said.

British police records show Boyd reported a break-in, with two laptops stolen from his London apartment in November 2014. Asked by Fox News what was on the computers, Boyd said, “A lot of information and a lot of evidence about corruption and scandals in Venezuela that I’ve been compiling throughout the years.”

After the break-in, Boyd said his sources were attacked. “People that were believed to be collaborating and sending me information from Venezuela were assaulted in Venezuela by the intelligence police of Mr. Chavez,” he said.

Asked if Fusion GPS was tasked with coming after him, Boyd said, “I believe that they were involved in the defamation campaign — smearing campaign — shortly after my apartment was broken into.”

Boyd says he was labeled a pedophile, drug addict and thief on the web. “They published this information through a number of social media and websites anonymously. They created fake Twitter accounts with my name, impersonating myself. ... They started publishing photos of me walking around London with my daughters.

Dana Perino Named As Host of New 2PM/ET Show

Sandra Smith Joins Bill Hemmer as Co-Anchor of America’s Newsroom

NEW YORK— September 26, 2017 — FOX News Channel (FNC) will unveil a new daytime lineup on Monday, October 2nd, announced Jay Wallace, President of News. Harris Faulkner will anchor her own 1PM/ET signature news hour entitled Outnumbered Overtime with Harris Faulkner and Dana Perino will host a 2PM/ET program with news and analysis on the day’s top stories, known as The Daily Briefing with Dana Perino. Additionally, Sandra Smith will permanently join Bill Hemmer in co-anchoring America’s Newsroom (9-11AM/ET).

In making the announcement, Wallace said, “Harris, Dana and Sandra are rising stars and their combined background and expertise across news, business and politics will enable us to provide a more in-depth look at the major stories breaking out of Washington, and around the country. We are living in unprecedented times and this new lineup ensures our viewers will get the best news, information and analysis on the news of the hour across the nation and around the globe.”

Faulkner and Smith will remain on Outnumbered (12-1PM/ET) alongside rotating panelists. Jon Scott will continue to helm Happening Now (11AM-12PM/ET) and Shepard Smith Reporting and Your World with Neil Cavuto will occupy the same 3PM and 4PM/ET time periods respectively, while Perino will continue as co-host of The Five.

Capitalizing on the strength of Outnumbered, Faulkner will anchor an additional hour of news with Outnumbered Overtime with Harris Faulkner (1-2 PM/ET). Each day, Faulkner will continue the conversation on the top news stories by utilizing the resources of FNC journalists in the field, plus one-on-one interviews with newsmakers and roundtable discussions with the network’s top contributors. Outnumbered Overtime originally debuted as a web show led by Faulkner following the TV version every day and her new program will seek to harness the popularity of that effort.

Faulkner added, “Three years ago, we enhanced cable news with a show that combines news and opinion, predominantly from the female point of view, and immediately, Outnumbered became the number one show in its timeslot. I am proud of the work we’re continuing to do there, and blessed to have this added opportunity to create a new program that will help inform our viewers and keep them engaged in a conversation surrounding the day’s headlines.”

Smith commented, “There’s no one better in the business than Bill Hemmer and I am honored to kick off the network’s news hours with him, informing our viewers of the biggest stories and issues driving the day.”

Following Outnumbered Overtime, Perino will host The Daily Briefing at 2PM/ET, an hour often dominated by breaking news, White House press briefings, and more from Washington and around the nation. With her understanding of what makes news, how to respond to it and her unique political expertise, Perino will break it all down with insight from key Beltway experts.

Perino remarked, “Our new show will aim to take on the major issues facing Americans and explore them from all angles. I am excited for this opportunity to draw from my political background to help our viewers get beyond the headlines and better understand what is really going on behind the scenes in Washington each day.”

That’s not to mention the children going to bed with a father who’s emotionally absent or worse, present and physically abusive.
The problem was common in the NFL when I played and seems even more common today.
My fellow players, your influence really matters, so that’s why I’m asking you to stand up for the children in your lives.
We still need men and women, fathers and mothers, willing to stand together for change.","To my brothers in the National Football League:

Like you, I had the privilege of playing in the NFL. In my heyday, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, I played with greats like Phil Simms and Lawrence Taylor.

Representatives of your union met with NFL owners in New York on Tuesday to discuss players who have been taking a knee during the national anthem to protest racism in this country. I have strong feelings about that – my father, a Navy pilot, died in a plane crash before I was born. But first I want to talk about a problem that was widespread when I played and is even more common today – fatherlessness.

We don’t talk much today about how boys become men. Back in my day, only about eight percent of all children living in the U.S. went to bed without a father in their story. Today, the problem is three or four times as bad, and it’s especially pronounced in minority communities, with more than 20 million fatherless children in our country. That’s not to mention the children going to bed with a father who’s emotionally absent or worse, present and physically abusive.

Many of you can identify with the pain and loss of not having a father in your story. The problem was common in the NFL when I played and seems even more common today.

Some of you were blessed with men and coaches who stood up for you and invested in your lives while others lived with the loss of a father who stepped out, took a knee and did not take part in your story. This loss affects every part of your life.

Thankfully, another man stood up for me when my mother and I could not stand up for ourselves. He married her when I was one year old, and without him, my story would have been very different. But ultimately, it was my encounter with God the Father that brought the healing I needed to be the kind of man and father that makes a difference.

My fellow players, your influence really matters, so that’s why I’m asking you to stand up for the children in your lives. To these children, you are much more than the jersey that you wear – you are the only father figure they have ever known.

Take a stand by:

Being the kind of man that every mom and dad tells their children, “I want you to be just like him;”

Treating the women in your life with honor and respect;

Living out your public life in a way that gives hope and structure to the fatherless kids that watch you every week; and

Being a present, loving father to your kids.

Finally, let me add a personal note. As a child whose father and stepfather served in the military, I hope you will take a stand for our flag and the freedom that cost many of our fathers their lives. The issues you are fighting for are of the upmost importance. We see you and we hear you.

But no matter what you decide, I hope we can stand together as fathers; this will speak volumes to children of every color and race and encourage them to do the same.

More than 2,500 years ago, a man wrote in Lamentations 5:3, “Orphans we are, not a father in sight and our mothers are no better than widows.” In so many ways, not much has changed since then. We still need men and women, fathers and mothers, willing to stand together for change.

I’m praying for you,

The self-described “strategic intelligence” firm Fusion GPS that was behind the controversial anti-Trump dossier has a track record of intimidation and smear tactics, according to congressional testimony and the firsthand account of a London-based Venezuelan journalist who said he was labeled a “pedophile,” “extortionist” and “drug trafficker” after criticizing one of Fusion’s clients.

“I believe that Fusion GPS’s business is to do basically whatever the paymasters tell them to do,” Alek Boyd, the Venezuelan journalist, told Fox News in his first American TV interview. “They are particularly good at spreading misinformation, disinformation and smears.”

Boyd says he was targeted after his 2012 reporting on Derwick Associates, a power company with close ties to the Venezuelan government. The company allegedly skimmed nearly a billion dollars from rigged contracts with the late Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez.

“It is my understanding that [Fusion GPS] were hired basically to smear Derwick opponents and to dispel any possible doubts that regular media may have had at the time,” he said.

British police records show Boyd reported a break-in, with two laptops stolen from his London apartment in November 2014. Asked by Fox News what was on the computers, Boyd said, “A lot of information and a lot of evidence about corruption and scandals in Venezuela that I’ve been compiling throughout the years.”

After the break-in, Boyd said his sources were attacked. “People that were believed to be collaborating and sending me information from Venezuela were assaulted in Venezuela by the intelligence police of Mr. Chavez,” he said.

Asked if Fusion GPS was tasked with coming after him, Boyd said, “I believe that they were involved in the defamation campaign — smearing campaign — shortly after my apartment was broken into.”

Boyd says he was labeled a pedophile, drug addict and thief on the web. “They published this information through a number of social media and websites anonymously. They created fake Twitter accounts with my name, impersonating myself. ... They started publishing photos of me walking around London with my daughters. They produced a huge amount of information — fake information — about me, accusing me from being a pedophile to being an extortionist to a drug trafficker to a car thief.”",Trump Dossier Firm's 'Smear' Tactics Unveiled,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/10/18/trump-dossier-firms-smear-tactics-unveiled

The suspect was not in custody and police had launched a dragnet for the shooter, identified by Harford County Sheriff Jeffrey Gahler as 37-year-old Radee Labeeb Prince.

""We have lost three lives so far this morning in Harford County,"" Gahler said at a news conference, adding it was not a random shooting but a ""targeted attack.""

The Harford County Sheriff's Office said the shooting took place at the Emmorton Business Park in Edgewood, located about 20 miles northeast of Baltimore. Shots rang out around 8:58 a.m., according to Gahler.

All five of the victims are believed to have been employees of Advance Granite Solutions, according to Gahler.

Police believe Prince is ""associated"" with the business, but were not sure of his employment status. The owner of Advanced Granite Solutions, a home improvement company, told the Associated Press in a brief phone interview Prince has been an employee for four months, and was a machine operator.

Barak Caba was shaken and would not provide additional details, according to the AP.

Prince may be driving a 2008 Black GMC Acadia SUV with a Delaware Registration of PC064273, according to Maryland State Police, who warned ""use extreme caution if you see him.""

The FBI is assisting local authorities to find Prince. Investigators are currently treating the shooting as a case of workplace violence and don't see ties to terrorism, Dave Fitz, a spokesman for the Baltimore FBI field office, told the AP.

Two victims from the shooting were taken to Shock Trauma hospital in Baltimore and are listed in critical condition, the facility said on Twitter.

Businesses in the area were on lockdown as a result of the shooting.

A business owner told FOX45 Baltimore police told them there was an active shooter, and to go back inside the building.

Steve Chetelat, who works at KC flooring near the scene of the shooting, told FOX45 he heard ""a lot of people yelling, and screaming"" in some sort of argument before police arrived at the scene. '

Some schools in the area have also been placed in modified lockdown as a result of police activity.

Special agents from Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives Baltimore Field Division are at the office park to assist local law enforcement, the agency said.

They are happy to wrap themselves in the conceit that they are like some kind of Second World War resistance movement fighting evil fascists.
The #Resist movement is the antithesis of “resistance.” More fitting titles for the movement should be #conform, #surrender and #comply, don’t you think?
For the leftist #Resist movement to be fully realized, freedom and liberty will have to go.
The #Resist movement is the antithesis of “resistance.” They aren’t the resistance, the rebellion or even anti-establishment.","Since President Trump’s election the progressives in the USA have decided that they are “the Resistance.” Everywhere we look on social media we see the #Resist banner. From the virtue-signaling Hollywood celebrity to every leftist, tenured university professor, they have proudly declared themselves members of “the Resistance” club. But what exactly is this resistance? What does it stand for?

These latte revolutionaries believe they are still fighting the 1960’s “revolution” for freedom and liberty, but over the last fifty years leftist/cultural Marxist groupthink has taken over and infiltrated literally every aspect of society. That revolution was, in many ways, already won years ago and yet, they continue to fight on because for the left it won’t be enough until every single one of us thinks exactly like them.

The reality is that the #Resist movement is not the counter culture that they think they are. They actually represent the status quo, and are supporters of the Establishment itself. They are happy to wrap themselves in the conceit that they are like some kind of Second World War resistance movement fighting evil fascists. The very word resistance implies an embattled underground group resisting an occupying, ruthless enemy.

But how can they be the underground when, in reality, they control so many levers of power in our society? Today’s #Resist movement must be the first resistance in history that actually runs most of the nation and makes up most of the political and cultural Establishment.

The #Resist movement is the antithesis of “resistance.” More fitting titles for the movement should be #conform, #surrender and #comply, don’t you think?

So, let’s look at this Establishment that makes up the “Resistance” and see how very powerful and organized they are.

First and foremost are academia and the education industry. These are the Indoctrinators: from nursery school teachers, to tenured university professors and most of the administrators. They see their jobs more as social justice activism rather than teaching. This is a “resistance” that has nearly all of academia on their side. These are the most dangerous, for they are shaping the minds of our children and our future generations.

Then, there are The Enforcers: such as all the progressive social media giants like Facebook, You Tube and Twitter who push a leftist agenda and try to stifle conservative ideas and speech.

Add to that the high tech conglomerates such as Apple, Google, and Microsoft, the left-leaning CEOs of many huge multinational corporations, billionaires like George Soros, Ted Turner and Richard Branson, and the thousands of NGO’s - all of whom spend millions promoting progressive causes.

Next is the propaganda wing of the “Resistance,” which just happens to be around 90 percent of the media entertainment complex, including most news channels, most newspapers, late night comedians, news anchors, ESPN and other sporting franchises and, of course, nearly all of Hollywood and most of its pundits, hangers-on and celebrities.

And last but not least, one of the wealthiest, most powerful political parties in the whole Western world: the Democratic Party and all their minions in the American civil service and the Deep State.

Does that sound like a struggling, oppressed and poorly financed resistance? Or, does it sound more like a vast, controlling, obscenely wealthy progressive network that uses every tactic at its disposal to oppose a democratic election result - from indoctrination and propaganda to the suppression of free speech and the violence practiced by Antifa, aka the well funded and armed wing of the “Resistance.”

Bizarrely then the #Resist movement are the very thing they say they are fighting against. They say they are fighting “fascism” but then they use fascistic methods to bully, demonize and silence all who disagree with them. From Hillary calling Trump voters “deplorables” to the nearly militarized thugs of Antifa calling anyone with a conservative or libertarian viewpoint “Nazis,” their aim is to dehumanize their opposition. This is hardly what a real resistance to so-called fascism would be doing.

Of course many of those who unthinkingly use the #Resist banner or wear pussy hats on marches or swoon to the rantings of Madonna are tragically ignorant of what they are actually supporting.

They honestly believe they are pro-Freedom but, in fact, they are supporting those politicians and Establishment figures who are behind The Deep State: the powerful, and utterly corrupted part of our government that see themselves as rulers and elites, and not as representatives of the people. The shadowy figures behind the #Resist movement are for globalism and big government.

A globalist government does not value borders, or countries, or value any sense of national sovereignty. This is why they are pro open borders. Why have laws for citizens when non-citizens can now vote in this new global egalitarianism? Why be a part of government in one country when ruling the world is a much more attractive prospect?

But why is globalism and global egalitarianism important to the left and the Resistance? On one #Resist site they quote the U.S. Constitution:

“All men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.”

They interpret this “equality” as pure egalitarianism. It’s a grossly incorrect interpretation, but it suits their goals. The Constitution accepts that everyone is born equal but it’s up to the individual whether they better themselves or not. Egalitarianism means equality of outcome and cannot freely exist without being forced on us through government mandates. And true egalitarianism also has to be global: One people, one government, no borders, no “inequality.”

For progressives this sounds great - it’s the path to the utopian future they so desire (with John Lennon’s “Imagine” piped through loud speakers ad nauseum). However, BIG government is required in order to enforce this global egalitarianism. Pure Socialism, Communism and/or Fascism will soon follow.

Military dictatorships tend to also be part of that package. How will a dictatorship come into play? Disarm the citizens and abolish the second amendment. Make sure only the elites, the government, the police, and the military are armed. This is one of their main goals: make sure the people are helpless to fight against a tyrannical, military dictatorship.

For the leftist #Resist movement to be fully realized, freedom and liberty will have to go. It sounds insane, but to those who believe in leftist groupthink, egalitarianism is more important and noble than liberty.

Thankfully, the USA from its inception has a Democratic Republic with three separate branches of government: Legislative, Executive and Judicial, of which our president is merely part of the Executive Branch.

This has not changed. The president does not have ultimate authoritarian power. There is no military dictatorship in force and he has not taken away the Second Amendment (although the Deep State is attempting to.)

President Trump has been trying to make sure that U.S. citizens are safer so they may live lives of liberty and continue their pursuit of happiness. He has been trying to lessen government involvement in people’s lives – again, for the sake of liberty – and not increase government, which becomes oppressive.

He is in support of freedom and liberty and the U.S. Constitution as it was intended – unlike the #Resist movement who want to grow government, have more regulation, more mandates – so as to force citizens to comply.

The #Resist movement is the antithesis of “resistance.” They aren’t the resistance, the rebellion or even anti-establishment. They are anti-freedom, pro-establishment and part of The Enforcers, right along with The Deep State. More fitting titles for the movement should be #conform, #surrender and #comply, don’t you think?

I hope the American people can see the #Resist movement for what it actually is and treat its agenda with the derision it deserves, so we can survive this threat to the freedom and liberty of our USA.",‘Eyes Wide Shut’ actress and Hollywood conservative: Why the #Resist movement has it completely wrong,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/18/eyes-wide-shut-actress-and-hollywood-conservative-why-resist-movement-has-it-completely-wrong.html

Kula Pelima, a native of Liberia who has lived in the U.S. for two decades, called 911 about 3:45 a.m. Monday, fearing that her visa had lapsed, Wilmington Police Chief Robert Tracy said at a news conference.

""She was concerned about her immigration status,"" Tracy said. ""She's a Liberian immigrant that came to the country in 1997, and she was worried about what could happen to her because her boyfriend ...

According to court papers obtained by FOX 29, Pelima told police she dropped the 4-month-old in the tub turned on the water and left him on his back as the tub filled early Tuesday.

Police said she then physically assaulted the 5-year old, dragged him to the bathroom and put his head under water until he stopped moving.

Tracy said the crime was shocking even to hardened officers.

There was a strong odor of gas in her apartment, but it was not clear if the gas stove had been turned on intentionally, the chief said. The building was evacuated but no one was hurt by the fumes.

Pelima’s boyfriend, the father of both boys, is a native of Nigeria. He was taken into custody by immigration authorities in Pennsylvania on Sept. 14. The couple lived together in Wilmington, and she helped care for both children, the police chief said.

Victor Epelle, 38, was in the United States legally, but he had violated the terms of his status, ICE said. It wasn’t immediately clear what he had done.

He was released from custody Monday on humanitarian grounds after being notified of the deaths of his sons.

A deputy in Palmdale, California recruited is colleagues to help stage a fake DUI traffic stop so he can propose to his girlfriend. Deputy Kevin Bowes’ fellow deputies pulled over his girlfriend and asked her to complete a DUI sobriety test. She had no idea Bowes was bent down on one knee behind her, with an engagement ring in hand.

In video shared by the Palmdale Sheriff’s Station, Bowes is seen arriving to the “scene” as his girlfriend looks up to the sky and taps her nose during one of the sobriety tests. The recruited deputy then asks her to spin around. Once she does, she finds her soon-to-be fiancé bent down on one knee.

She runs up to hug him and he can be heard saying, “Is that a yes?” and she nods in approval.

The deputy who was conducting the supposed sobriety test asked again, “That was a yes? Okay just wanted to make sure” and laughs.

The agency shared the following caption with the video:

“We don’t want to miss a person,” he said, according to KTVU.com. “If we have an area we want to bring people into, we are going to search every part of that area for a victim we don’t know about.

After years of helping patients in hospitals, Lauren realized it was having a detrimental effect on her on well-being.

She felt overworked, overstressed, overweight, fatigued and extremely unhappy, so she decided to take control of her life and get her priorities straight.

She said: ""I wanted to be a healthy, fit, strong, confident woman, actively preventing disease instead of treating everything with pills and medication.

""I wanted to change my life for the better and I wanted to help others before they lost control of their health too.""

The ultra-fit beauty never set out to become a ""fitness model.""

""I let the winter and holiday seasons get the best of me. I was unhappy with what I saw in the mirror and I felt even worse, so I decided to make a change for the better.""

She embarked on a paleo challenge, which involves eating a caveman-style diet and produced motivating results leading her to research entering competition shows.

After YouTubing to find out about the scene, she bit the bullet and signed up for her first bikini show where she placed 9th out of 30 competitors.

This spiked her interest and gave her the thirst to go for her professional card.

She hired a coach, entered more and more shows, and finally got the top spot in an amateur show, giving the opportunity to compete for money in professional body building, fitness and aesthetic shows.

She has since opened up her private Instagram account and now has over 3.6 million followers to whom she shares inspirational images of her stunning figure and workout routines, as well as the odd sexy picture of her self in tiny lingerie and bikinis.

During my years of painting people’s homes, I’ve learned that small spaces don’t have to be boring or go unnoticed. All it takes is a little paint. By adding paint in strategic places around the home, you can easily and inexpensively transform a space. Plus, there is a good chance you could accomplish at least one of these eight painting projects during the course of one weekend.

Here are eight spaces to consider painting and my tips and tricks on making even the smallest places have a big impact.

1. Entryway. When a guest arrives, their first impression is based on your home’s exterior and the front door. Realtors call this curb appeal. But the very next thing guests will notice is the area right inside your front door, so you should use it to make a statement.

If your home has a formal entry, choose a paint color that is one to two shades darker than the next room. A darker paint color in the entryway can make the space feel more inviting, like a warm hug.

If your home has an open floor plan without a defined entryway, use paint to create one. Try a bold color on the wall surrounding the front door and an adjacent wall as visual borders for the entry.

2. Hall bath. Small bathrooms might appear to be limited when it comes to design, but they can easily be transformed with a quick paint color update.

How do you pick a color for this small bathroom? Look around your home for spots of color that crop up in your art or drapes. For example, a living room that is mostly beige with blue accent pieces would coordinate well with a bathroom painted in that same shade of blue.

RELATED: What Color Works Best in a Traditional-Style Bathroom?

Dark colors also have been trending with homeowners I’ve worked with lately. To offset the dark nature of the paint, we typically recommend keeping the other design details, such as the floors and sink, light to make sure the room still feels open and bright.

Worried one color will overwhelm the small space? Consider installing a chair rail as a natural divider. Then paint the lower portion of the wall in a statement color while leaving the wall area above a neutral tone.

3. Bookshelf. Whether the bookshelves in your home are built-in or freestanding, you can easily create style with paint. Remove the shelves from the surround and paint the back wall of the case. Don’t be afraid to go bold with your paint color, because once the shelves and objects on the shelves are in place, your color choice will seem more subtle. You will get an instant pop of color without being too in-your-face.

4. Closet. This space is often overlooked when it comes to paint, but a fresh coat of paint on the walls and shelving in your closet can go a long way. With a small- or medium-sized closet, keep your paint color choice bright and light.

With a large walk-in closet, consider using a paint color that complements the attached room.

For shelving, use an oil-based paint for durability against scratches and scuffs.

5. Hallway. Hallways are typically long and narrow and, depending on the lighting, can also be dark. When choosing a paint color for the hallway, consider the paint colors in connecting rooms and then go one to two shades lighter. The colors will complement each other and coordinate the home’s overall design. Plus, a lighter shade will brighten up the passageway.

6. Accent wall. If you have a small amount of paint and want to make the biggest impact on your home’s design, then an accent wall is your best bet. Choose a wall in your living room or master bedroom that you want to highlight, such as the area behind the sofa or bed.

Once it is painted, hang coordinating artwork on the accent wall to finish the design.

7. Kitchen nooks and crannies. Typically, I find there isn’t too much paintable space in the kitchen. But when I do find it, it’s between the cabinets, appliances and backsplash.

When space is limited, I always encourage owners to go bold and use colors that offset the room’s features. For example, in a kitchen with white cabinets and natural stone countertops, pick a hunter green or dark blue. In large quantities, these dark shades might feel overwhelming, but in small quantities, they give the room a strong dimension.

8. Laundry room. You can’t avoid the task of laundry, so at least make it a room that is easy on the eyes and generates positivity. Think of a paint color you would never dream of using in the social areas of your home but would make you happy, such as a playful orange, a bold purple or a sunshine yellow. Who knows, being around your favorite color might even make the chore a little more enjoyable.",Transform a whole house by painting these 8 small spaces,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/09/22/transform-whole-house-by-painting-these-8-small-spaces.html

Cole Welker of Pevely, Mo., says he spent most of his life riding around in the 2001 Dodge Ram 2500 before his dad taught him to drive the big six-speed manual diesel. The two often took it on hunting and fishing trips until the father, Steve, tragically died of a heart attack in March at age 42.

Jesus Campos, in a pre-recorded interview set to air Wednesday afternoon, told DeGeneres he had trouble reaching the shooter’s floor to inspect a door that was left ajar on the night of the shooting, which killed 58 and injured hundreds of others who had gathered for a country music concert.

“There was a metal bracket holding the door in place,” Campos said, describing how he was blocked trying to enter the 32nd floor from a stairwell right next to Paddock’s room. “That was just out of the ordinary. It’s not normal.”

Clips from the interview were circulating on the Internet on Wednesday morning.

Campos previously skipped out moments before scheduled interviews with several TV networks last week and his highly-anticipated appearance Wednesday is still unlikely to quell rampant speculation and rumors surrounding the horrific attack. Nearly three weeks since the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, the FBI and Las Vegas Police have yet to reveal a motive for Paddock's actions and questions remain about the sequence of events -- which have become muddled after police and the owners of Mandalay Bay gave sometimes conflicting statements on a timeline of the events leading up to the shooting. Police have said they're not planning on holding any other news conferences, absent new evidence.

""I felt the burning sensation. I went to go lift my pant leg up and I saw the blood."" - Jesus Campos

Campos said he reached the floor through another stairwell and inspected the metal bracket from the other side. But before the shots started, he heard what he thought was a drilling sound near Paddock’s room and called security -- which sent maintenance worker Stephen Schuck to the floor to investigate.

As Campos walked back into the hallway from a room that leads to the stairwell, the door, which he said was heavy, made a loud noise as it closed behind him.

“I believed that’s what caught the shooter’s attention,” Campos said. “As I was walking down, I heard rapid fire. At first I took cover. I felt the burning sensation. I went to go lift my pant leg up and I saw the blood.”

Campos told Degeneres that Paddock was firing from behind the closed door of his room, but he wasn’t sure how.

Campos said a woman poked her head out of her room to see what was going on, but he told her to go back inside.

Schuck said he accessed the floor from a service elevator and didn’t notice the shooting until he got closer to Paddock’s room.

“Once I got more than halfway is when I saw Jesus, and I started to hear shooting,"" Schuck said. ""And I thought – at the time I didn’t know it was shooting – I thought it was a jackhammer and, as an engineer, I thought, 'we are not working up here late at night. We wouldn’t be doing that.'”

Schuck said Campos leaned out from his hiding spot and yelled at Schuck to take cover, which saved his life as bullets whizzed by.

He followed up: ""As it has turned out, James Comey lied and leaked and totally protected Hillary Clinton. He was the best thing that ever happened to her!""

GOWDY WANTS COMEY TO TESTIFY AGAIN

The flurry of tweets was in reference to the FBI releasing documents this week that prove Comey began drafting a statement regarding the Clinton email investigation months before he interviewed her and other key witnesses. The document release was titled “Drafts of Director Comeys July 5, 2016 Statement Regarding Email Server Investigation Part 01 of 01.”

The release bolstered critics' claims that Comey was drafting an ""exoneration statement"" well before ending the case and recommending against criminal charges.

The contents of the newly released emails, however, were largely unclear as the majority of the document was redacted. The records, that are now public, show the email titled “Midyear Exam—UNCLASSIFIED” was sent by Comey on May 2, 2016 to FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, General Counsel James Baker and James Rybicki, chief of staff and senior counselor.

Trump's Wednesday challenge to the Justice Department regarding the matter was a throwback to his summer criticism of the nation's top law enforcement official, Attorney General Jeff Sessions. While Trump had been at odds with one of his earliest supporters over the decision to recuse in the Russia probe, Trump in recent weeks has dialed down that criticism.

The existence of the Comey documents was first brought to light by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., after they reviewed transcripts with top Comey aides who alluded to the email’s existence.

The Judiciary Committee penned a letter on Aug. 30 to newly appointed FBI Director Christopher Wray noting their findings, saying that “it appears that in April or early May of 2016, Mr. Comey had already decided he would issue a statement exonerating Secretary Clinton. That was long before FBI agents finished their work.”

“The outcome of an investigation should not be prejudged while FBI agents are still hard at work trying to gather the facts,” the letter stated.

The existence of these documents raised questions over Comey’s June 2017 Senate testimony regarding his decision to go public with findings in the Clinton email investigation. Comey noted former Attorney General Loretta Lynch’s involvement in the probe, including her controversial meeting with former President Bill Clinton days before his wife was interviewed.

Google also appears to be preparing a security patch for Android devices, but it won't come out until Nov. 6 when the company releases its monthly security update.

A broad notification about the vulnerability was sent to industry vendors in late August, so major tech companies should be aware of the problem.

On Monday, Intel posted updates for the company's wireless internet adapters, which can be downloaded and installed. The chipmaker is also working with device manufacturers to roll out the patches to computers.

Others, like Ubuntu have also issued patches. Cisco and Amazon are also in the midst of preparing security fixes for their wireless products.

The vulnerability, disclosed on Monday, is particularly troublesome because it affects all modern Wi-Fi networks. It stems from the Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2) protocol, which is designed to keep the network secure. Security researchers in Belgium noticed a weakness in the protocol that can be abused to spy on the data transmitted over the Wi-Fi network.

As a result, any sensitive data like user passwords, credit card numbers, and emails could be stolen if a hacker were to exploit the vulnerability. To fix the problem, vendors across the entire industry will have to issue patches.

The good news it that the flaw only works if the attacker is within physical range of the Wi-Fi network. The researchers also found that Windows 7, Windows 10, and iOS 10.3.1 used a different wireless implementation, making the operating systems less suspectible to the vulnerability.

The flaw can also be patched in a ""backwards-compatible manner,"" according to one of the researchers, Mathy Vanhoef. That means when users patch their smartphone or PC, the device should now securely communicate over Wi-Fi, even if the internet router they're using hasn't been patched.

ZTE has optimized common apps for Extend Mode, including Google Docs, Photos, Chrome, Maps, Gmail, Facebook, Twitter, and Pandora. Apps that haven’t been optimized won't recognize the gap -- where the hinge that connects the two displays is -- in the middle. So there will be some space that’s arbitrarily broken up between the two displays for non-optimized apps.

Downie was diagnosed with glioblastoma, an aggressive and incurable brain cancer, in December 2015. When the band made the news public the following May, expressions of sorrow poured in from across the country.

That same day, the band said it would mount a Canadian tour despite Downie's cancer. Tickets for the 2016 summer tour sold out almost immediately, culminating in a national broadcast of the band's final tour stop at Kingston, Ontario. Millions tuned in.

Downie later told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. that he needed six teleprompters during the concert series so he would not forget lyrics. But through it all, Downie remained the consummate showman, rocking out on stage in distinctive leather suits.

During his final show, Downie called out to Trudeau, who attended the concert, to help fix problems in Canada's aboriginal communities.

A few months after that concert, Downie released a solo album with an accompanying graphic novel and animated film inspired by the tragedy of state-funded church schools that Canadian aboriginal children were forced to attend from the 19th century until the 1970s. He said his ""Secret Path"" project was aimed at Canada's decades-long government policy of requiring aboriginal children to attend residential schools, where physical and sexual abuse was often rampant.

Born in Amherstview, Ontario, Downie said he ""always had a keen ear for music"" and while all the other kids were spending their allowance on baseball trading cards, he was buying records ""from the fathers of rock 'n' roll.""

While at university, he met Paul Langlois, Rob Baker, Gord Sinclair and Johnny Fray, and they formed The Tragically Hip, which started out as a cover band.

Their first self-titled EP was released in 1987 and their breakthrough debut full-length album, ""Up to Here,"" was released in 1989. Since then they have released 14 studio albums, two live albums, one EP and 54 singles. Nine of their albums have reached No. 1 in Canada. They have received numerous Canadian music awards, including 14 Juno awards, the equivalent of the Grammy in Canada.

The band's 2012 album, ""Now for Plan A,"" was lyrically influenced by Downie's wife and her successful battle with breast cancer.

Downie also produced three solo albums since 2001, as well as a collaboration with fellow Canadian indie darlings The Sadies.

Downie is survived by his wife and four children.","Gord Downie, lead singer of The Tragically Hip, dead at 53",http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/18/gord-downie-lead-singer-tragically-hip-dead-at-53.html

The new images of the 105-story Ryugyong Hotel in Pyongyang depict construction trucks surrounding the pyramid-like building as well as several other buildings, the Daily Mail reported.

Tourist photos have also recently surfaced showing cranes around the hotel.

The ""Hotel of Doom,"" as it was nicknamed, has cost approximately 470 million euros ($552 million) to date but has yet to host a single guest, the Independent reported.

The 105-story skyscraper was finally unveiled this summer after being under construction for nearly 30 years, although its doors still remain closed.

The project began in 1987 under the reign of Kim Il Sung, North Korea’s founder and “eternal president.” However, the 1990s famine and an economic crash in 1992 forced the project to shut down due to a lack of funds.

In December 2016 visitors reported seeing signs of activity within the building for the first time in years when lights appeared to be on inside the hotel.

Believing that truth and embracing that truth isn’t the only thing we need to do.
But it is a firm foundation on which to build a life of freedom from anxiety and the exhausting endless quest to prove our value through our performance.","I sat on a parenting panel last month with a well-known and widely respected counselor by the name of Sissy Goff, M.Ed, LPC-MHSP. She is the Director of Child & Adolescent Counseling at Daystar in Nashville and when asked about the biggest issue facing kids today, she confirmed what you’ve probably read about recently on your news feed or even your Facebook feed – the increasing anxiety epidemic in our country.

But it’s not just an epidemic among our kids. It’s an epidemic among us -- their parents.

According to the National Institute of Mental Health, anxiety is the most common mental-health disorder in the United States, affecting nearly one-third of both adolescents and adults.

In a recent article entitled “Why Are More American Teenagers Than Ever Suffering from Severe Anxiety” we glean significant insight into the anxiety epidemic:

I’ll just share just two key points from the article:

* Privileged youths are among the most emotionally distressed young people in America. These kids are incredibly anxious and perfectionistic.

* For many of these young people, the biggest single stressor is that they never get to the point where they can say, ‘I’ve done enough, and now I can stop.’ Kids have a sense that they’re not measuring up. The pressure is relentless and getting worse.

If you’re reading this article as a mom, I imagine it breaks your heart like it breaks mine (as the mother of four boys who range in age from toddler to teenager) to learn that the pressure our kids are under “is relentless and getting worse.” Of course, I think we already assumed this to be true. But knowing it to be true leaves us responsible to do something to fight against it.

We have to be willing to take an honest (maybe painfully honest) look at how we may have contributed to the anxiety our kids feel with the pressure we just might be passing down. With our unrealistic expectations and impossible standards of ourselves, and of them.

See, we parents aren’t the only ones linking accomplishment to acceptance and success to significance. Our kids are attempting to answer the question, “Is who I am enough?” by how well they perform on the field, how much they excel in school, and how many likes they get on their Instagram feed.

They are attempting to answer that question, “Is who I am enough?” by proving they can do enough and be enough. Whatever “enough” is. Because you and I both know enough is never enough when the goal is perpetual perfection.

The primary message our kids receive is that they’d better be the best at everything, and this leaves them afraid to reveal their inadequacies and insecurities—and hiding behind the best version of themselves.

In turn, parents of anxious teens feel helpless and hopeless, questioning all of the steps we are -- or aren’t -- taking. Our confidence as moms crumbles as we try to help our kids navigate the battles they have to fight and the mountains they have to climb.

We are constantly second guessing ourselves: “Have I done too much? Have I not done enough? Am I helping or am I hurting my child?”

Our anxiety escalates and overflows into our parenting and onto our kids, who then take our anxiety on top of their own.

I won’t pretend to even begin to be able to solve this for us here. I don’t have all the answers. Not even a little bit. But I do have this one nugget – which is the primary message woven into my new book, ""Mom Set Free,"" and I believe it to be true with everything in me.

A key ingredient in helping our kids overcome their anxiety is facing and working through our own anxiety.

It starts with us. It doesn’t end with us. But we are part of the solution.

We have to be willing to take an honest (maybe painfully honest) look at how we may have contributed to the anxiety our kids feel with the pressure we just might be passing down. With our unrealistic expectations and impossible standards of ourselves, and of them.

Of course, some kids are just more prone to perfection seeking than others. Such kids tend to create their own pressure, even if their parents are actively trying to relieve it. But often, we parents play a role in the pressure -- and therefore, anxiety -- our kids feel, so we have to be willing to take an honest look at how we pile our own pressure onto our kids.

And ultimately, it is our responsibility to help our kids push back the pressure they face with the truth of God’s Word. I am not at all suggesting that therapy and medication aren’t part of the solution. They often times are. But please let us not forget the alive and powerful Word of God that has the absolute power to show us where our significance comes from and ultimately set us free from proving our worth and our value in our performance.

Kids who constantly feel like they just don't measure up and who feel they have “everything” to prove need to be told – over and over again - they actually have “nothing” to prove. Because this pressure to prove our value and worth has left parents and children alike longing for what all our hearts most crave:

• to be known—truly and deeply known

• to be accepted—for who they are, not who they wish they were to be loved—with no strings attached

This isn’t sentimental fluff. This is solid truth from which freedom springs. There is absolutely no denying the inherent and deepest longing every human soul holds.

If we want to raise kids who find freedom from the pressure to get it ALL right in order to be accepted and welcomed, then we are going to need to walk in that freedom first. Or at least be willing to discover how to walk in that freedom alongside our kids.

We need to know that failing doesn’t make us failures and succeeding doesn’t make us significant. At least not in the eyes of our Creator -- the only One whose opinion of us really matters in the end.

In God’s eyes we are of great worth, not because of anything we have or haven’t done, but because of what has been done for us in the person and work of Jesus Christ.

The cross has the final word on our value. Believing that truth and embracing that truth isn’t the only thing we need to do. But it is a firm foundation on which to build a life of freedom from anxiety and the exhausting endless quest to prove our value through our performance.","America's teen anxiety epidemic is heartbreaking.
